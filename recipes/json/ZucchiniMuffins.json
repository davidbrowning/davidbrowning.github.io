She has a really cozy Airbnb on Claytor Lake where we met when I stayed with her to look for our house in Max Meadows, VA. She always had a muffin and a boiled farm-fresh egg (she is obsessed with farmers markets in the area). Her tip is to always use less sugar than the recipe calls for, so it's up to you with this one whether it is breakfast or dessert -Sierra"}
