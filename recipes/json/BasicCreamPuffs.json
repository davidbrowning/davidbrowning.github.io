{"name":"Basic Cream Puffs","ingredients":[{"quantity":"1 c.","name":"water","type":""},{"quantity":"4 medium","name":"eggs","type":"(room temperature)"},{"quantity":"1 c.","name":"flour","type":"sifted"},{"quantity":"1/4 c.","name":"butter","type":"(1/2 stick)"},{"quantity":"1/2 tsp.","name":"salt","type":""}],"steps":["Bring water to boil with salt and butter. As soon as butter melts and full boil begins, add flour all at once. Stir rapidly. Remove from heat and continue stirring till mixture looks like corn meal mush.","Add eggs one at a time. Beat each one till it blends well.","For miniature puffs, drop by teaspoon on to greased, heavy cookie sheet about 3 inches apart. Turn oven from 425 to 400 immediately. Bake at 400 for about 15 minutes or light brown on the top. It is important that they are cooked long enough, under cooking will cause them to collapse. Remove from oven then slit the sides to allow steam to escape. I find it easier to use a sharp pair of scissors to snip with. After snipping, take out any loose batter. Fill with your favorite filling.","For dessert size puffs, drop from large spoon in desired shape. Bake at 425 for 20 min then 375 for 20 minutes. Follow same instructions as for miniature puffs after they are removed from oven.","If you aren't using Cream puffs right away, store loosely in a container or paper bag."],"timers":["","","","",""]}
