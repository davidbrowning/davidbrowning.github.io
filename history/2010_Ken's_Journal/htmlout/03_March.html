got up in time to eat breakfast with Mike’s family although David was gone just
as we got up.  We left shortly after 8AM and met Bryce and Deanna at the Lehi
freeway exit.  We traveled together, stopping at Fillmore for a break.  We
stopped and got Subway sandwiches at Cedar and then traveled on to St. George
where we stopped and visited with Aunt Joy for a couple of hours.  She told us
a lot about the Bushnell family.  We left there after 4PM and stopped at the
St. George Tabernacle and went thru a short tour there.  We came on to Mesquite,
Nevada where we checked in at the Falcon Ridge Hotel.  After getting our rooms
we went downtown and got gas in the cars.  We then tried to find a place to eat
and ended up at KF Chicken.  We then came back to the hotel and played a game
of Rummy.  Deanna won the game by quite a ways.  </span></p>

checking out we traveled to our mission assignment in Wasco California.  We
stopped a couple of times for a break and at a Sub-Way for some lunch but other
than that we came on through.  We got to the office of South Valley Farms just
after 4PM California time.  We met the Judd’s and talked to Lee Brown on the
cell phone when we first drove in.  Lee had Elder Judd take us through a short
tour of the office while we waited for him to get here.  When Bill got there he
and Elder Judd had us follow them to our home.  They also helped us unpack and
carry in our belongings to the house.  Sister Brown and Sister Judd came out to
the home.  Lee then took all of us out to dinner at the Hodel Restraint in
Bakersfield.  It was a smorgasbord dinner and we sure enjoyed a nice meal and
enjoyed the visit with them.  After returning home, with Bryce and Deanna’s
help we got some things put away before going to bed.</span></p>

wanted but it turned out a lot.  It was after 7PM when we got home.  After

got up before 5AM so I could get to work early.  However after using the
bathroom we found that the drain lines were plugged up.  I looked all over for
a plunger but finally had to give up. When I got to work I told Lee a bought
the drain problem and he called a plumber to take care of it.  I started
working with Elder Judd.  We started installing a sprinkler valves and a valve
box in one of the home in the Kimberline Road Residences.  We had to go to
Schafter to buy some parts.  When we returned Lee asked Elder Judd and I to
clean up the construction debris at a pavilion that they are installing for the
families that live there.   Lee returned and had Mae and I go with him and he
showed us around the Ranch.  He first showed and explained to us the equipments
that are used to harvest the nuts.  We found that very interesting.  He then
explained the planting procedure and care of the trees.  When we finished the
tour, I went back to work on the water valve box and Mae came home. We quite
work about 5:30PM.  Bryce and Deanna left this morning.  Mae worked around the
house getting most things put away.  After dinner I caught my journal up.  Mae
called and visited with Scott and Jeff’s families this evening.  After entering

Kimberline Road Residences.  I went right to work on the barbecue table.  Other
workers had built the base out of block but Lee wanted a thin coating of cement
trialed over it.  I have never used just cement and water to coat something but
that is what we used this time.  I finished that before I went home for
lunch.   Lee and Elder Judd were already there when I returned.  We went to the
shop and cut the material to build forms for the two table caps and then poured
them.  It was 5:30PM when we finished and quite for the day.  Mae had dinner
ready by the time I showered and cleaned up.  After dinner I set up the
projector and computer and we watched the “Eddy Duchin Story”.  That was a good
movie and story but I sure felt bad that those depicted in the story did not have
any knowledge of the purpose of life.  I don’t know how people make it through
life with some of the difficult situations they have to experience.  </span></p>

Sunday we didn’t have breakfast so we went into Wasco to Church.  We attended
choir practice.  I told them that I sang solo, so low that I can’t be heard but
they still wanted us to sing with them.  Meetings went well and it was good to
meet ward members.  The Payne’s had their baby blessed and so both of their
parents were there from out of town.  After meetings we were invited to the
Payne’s for refreshments.  It gave us a chance to meet them.  It was 4PM when
we got home. I took a nap while Mae visited with Bryce and Deanna on the
phone.  Mae also made dinner and after eating I called Mike and visited with
him about our IPod as I am unable to set the Book Marks on the Scriptures.  It
took a few minutes but I believe I can now work that portion of the program. 
It is sure a good thing I have smart children.  I called Roy to visit and we
also set next weekend up for going up there and visiting with them.  Mae then
visited with Linda for a while.  I set up a movie on the computer but it didn’t
take very long until I realized it wasn’t a very good movie and shut it off. 
We thought those movies were to be PG rated but when we read closer 2 out of
the 4 were PG but the other 2 were R.  I finished my journal entry and we went
to bed.  Of course I had to play some solitary before shutting down the
computer.</span></p>

Judd and Browning.  We asked them to meet us there to get their opinion on tile
selections.  We chose and priced ceramic tile for the barbeque base.  Elder
Judd and I then purchased some of the steel for the fire box.  This afternoon I
worked on the Shaw’s yard sprinkler control box getting power ran for it.  I
found problems in the valve box as the main line has a water leak.  We found
that a O ring had been installed wrong from the factory.  It is going to take
some doing to get it corrected.  It was 5:30PM when I quit and came home.  Mae
had dinner about ready when I got there.  After eating I installed a towel bar
and a rack on the doors of the sink cabinet.  I also tried to find out the
electrical circuit to the kitchen stove hood but didn’t find where the power

vent hood for the stove is not working and as a result when Mae uses the range
to cook the smoke alarm keeps going off.  I had some extra time before leaving
for work so thought I could quickly solve the problem.  The electric line to
the hood is dead.  I was unable to find where it was coming from because there
is no access hole to the attic.  I decided to abandon that wire and run another
wire from the electric outlet in back of the stove.  I had trouble removing the
hood from the cabinet first.  Then when I tried to run the wiring down the
inside of the wall, I found that there was blocking in the framing and I could
not get down the wall.  I gave up and went to work.  Elder Judd and I worked on
another Kimberline residential home.  The yard sprinkler valves are not working
and as we checked them out it became apparent that the old system needed to be
removed and a complete new valve box, valves and control be installed.  Most of
the day was spent there and at 3PM we helped Lee Brown move some furniture to
storage.  On the way home I went to the Nampa Auto Parts store and looked for a
tool box for the bed of my pickup.  They are pretty expensive.  Mae spent most
of this morning on the phone, getting our health insurance set up with Kaiser,
as Larry Saiz, our agent from Utah, told us that they were the best health
insurance company in California.  She also was able to cancel our contract with
Cricket Phone Company.  She did this because Cricket does not have coverage in
this part of California.  When I got home Mae was out working in the yard.  She
had spent several hours cleaning the yard and preparing the flower beds for
planting.  She also went to town shopping for ingredients for making a Lazonia
for the family dinner of a member of our Ward that passed away.  The funeral
will be on Wednesday.  We did some looking at the watering system and will need
to make some changes in it.  Mae had dinner about ready so we came in.  While
Mae finished dinner I showered and shaved.  After dinner I took a 10 minute
nap.  </span></p>

We visited with a plumbing supply co. about some of the plumbing requirements
for the houses.  When we returned we stopped at a sub-division to familiarize
ourselves with some of the California building practices.  I went to the shop

the mechanics there, installed the box on to my truck.  I visited a few minutes

and it was very nice.  The Temple is one of the small Temples but very nice. 
After we left the Temple we stopped at a Sub-Way and got a sandwich for lunch. 
After taking Mae and Linda home, Roy and I went to Costco where we bought some
potatoes, some sweet potatoes and some batteries.  Mae and I did take the time
to get into the hot tub and that really helped my back.  Phillip and Juliann
came over for dinner and then stayed and we all played games.  For dinner Roy
and Linda prepared Tri-Tip beef.  I did not recognize that cut of beef so I
asked the butcher.  He explained that it was a cut from the top of the romp
roast.  It would be close to where the filet minion steak is taken.  Any way it
was very good.  Jullie Ann and Phillip came over for dinner and played games
with us after dinner.  We played games until after 11PM which with Day Light Saving
starting tomorrow it is after mid-night.  </span></p>

arose and went to church with Roy and Linda.  It was an enjoyable and spiritual
experience.  During Sunday School a Sister that is a resent convert, questioned
Abraham’s taking his wife’s handmaiden and having children by her.  She almost
upset the lesson but the instructor handled it well and told her that he would
do more research and report back next week.  In Priesthood meeting the lesson
was on the creation and it was interesting to me that we spent a great amount
of time wondering about the Pre-existent.  The Gospel does give us a greater
insight as to where we came from and where we are going, but I feel that we
only have just a glimpse into those areas.  Roy had prepared a nice dinner and
then I got into the hot tub again.  That really relaxes my back.  We lay down
and took a nap.  When we woke we packed up left for home about 4:45PM.  We were
home by 6:15PM.  Mae watered her plants that she planted Friday and then
prepared us a light super.  Mae called some of our family while I caught my
journal up.  We got on the internet with Scott for a few minutes and were able
to get on to Google video chat for a few seconds but didn’t have time to get it
perfected on both ends tonight.  I played a game of solitary and finished this

back still is hurting me even with doing the stretch exercises.  Before leaving
for the shop Mae and I checked her plants.  Two of her pepper plants had been
eaten last night.  I was not sure what had done it.  When I was on the way to
the shop, Elder Judd called me.  He asked if I could go into Bakersfield and
pickup the plans we had sent out last week.  I stopped back by the house and
got Mae to go with me.  After checking on the plans we stopped at Lassons
Health Store and bought several items before returning home.  This afternoon I
finished building the shelf that I started last Friday.  After finishing them I
took them to the office and hung them.  I then went into Wasco to a
chiropractor and got a treatment on my back.  It seemed to relive the pain.  I
quite work for the day, to let my back heal.  When I got home Mae and I walked
up to the reservoir on the North side of the Pistachio orchard and back home. 
It is sure peaceful and beautiful around here.  I can hardly wait for the trees
to bloom and leaf.   I called Lee to let him know what I had done and asked for
tomorrows plans.  I mentioned the plants and he suggested that it was probably
slugs that had eaten the plants.  He suggested that we get some slug bait or us
a home remedy or crushed egg shells spread around the plant.  We shelled four eggs
and dried the shells and then crushed them.  We will see if that works.  Kip
Michaelis called to congratulate us on our calling.  He also said that they
were coming to California and they might be able to stop by.  After dinner this
evening Mae and I set out on the back steps and read from the “Preach My
Gospel”.  We then watched a movie before going to bed.  I have to add that I
sure have a wonderful wife and sweetheart.  She takes such good care of me.  I
sure love her.</span></p>

Judd and I figured an estimate for the roofing materials for the two houses.   Elder
Judd showed me where the houses are located as the farm has 6 different housing
locations.  We were unable to locate the hand sprayer and so had to purchase a
new one from Home depot.  I went home to eat lunch and then assembled the new
sprayer, read the instructions for the spray mixture and mixed a tank of
chemical.  I sprayed our home and then went to the Kimberlina homes and then
sprayed Lee’s home.  I quite work for the day and came home.  I got Mae and we
went into Bakersfield where I purchased some Sterling’s Shave and Lubricant. 
We then went to Wal-Mart and bought a DVD player.  We bought a few more items
and then went to Hodel’s Restraint for dinner.  After getting home we put out
slug pellets and sprayed hornets.  I set up the DVD with the TV and put in one

early so I could get to the office by 8AM.  Lee, Elder Judd and I went over the
bid cost with still a couple of bids to come in.  I worked on installing some
screens on the office windows.  The holding brackest had to be trimmed about
1/8<sup>th</sup> of an inch in order for them to hold the screens tightly.  I
took them to the shop and built a jig to hold them for cutting on the miter
saw.  I finished about 11:45AM and then went to the Sherwood farm and got a
drain snake.  I got home about 12:30PM.  Mae soon had lunch for us.  She and
Sister Judd had met with Lee at 9AM and planed for breakfast, break and lunch
for those to attend a training meeting next Friday.  This afternoon I drew the
yard plans and used the snake and cleaned out the drain line as the water is hardly
draining from the kitchen sink.  I did get a hours nap this afternoon.  Mae and
I went into Bakersfield about 5PM.  We did some shopping and went out to dinner
at Sizzler’s.  We stopped at Costco for a few items and got prices for the food
items for next Friday.  After getting home we watched the first part of “Ben
Hur”.  It was after mid-night when we went to bed.</span></p>

slept in until after 9AM and if it hadn’t been for Mae we would have stayed in
bed eve longer.  Mae made waffles for breakfast and they were very good.  I
still miss not putting yogurt on them.  We went into Shafter and bought some
more tomatoes to put in our tomato planter and some fox scent to try to stop
the critters that are eating our vegetable plants.  We have replanted several
times already and have tried different things to keep them away.  The best so
far is a screen fence but that won’t do it when the plant grows.  We washed the
car at the car wash this time and it does look better.  On the way home we went
to the cemetery and walked around for a little while, just relaxing.   I worked
on the yard today changing the hose around that water the flower area.  We also
washed part of the house to clean of the dirt.  I washed my pickup out here in
the yard.  We set out in the chairs and just enjoyed the beauties of the area
and the nice day.  We were going to Sister Hyer’s this evening with Elder and
Sister for dinner but she called and had to go into the doctors because of some
problems.  We hope she is ok.  We watched the last part of “Ben Hur” as we ate
out dinner and before we went to bed.</span></p>

nice dinner, we showed them around part of the farm.  The rest of the evening
we enjoyed visiting.  It was late when we finally got to bed even though they
want to be up early to go.  </span></p>

It was 6AM before they got away.  Mae and I then had our breakfast and I went
to the office.  I came back home and drew up the yard plans.  Mae went with me
this afternoon to Bakersfield to get some plans from Oasis Air conditioning. 
They had some questions about the engineering specifications so we left without
a bid.  We went to Winco Groceries and bought some things before returning
home.  We got some food for dinner.  I tried to enter my journal but became so
tired we just quit and went to bed.</span></p>

still out.  Elder Judd and I assembled the picnic tables for the bowery.  It
was 1:30PM when I came home for lunch.  Mae had me take a nap and then she went
with me back into Bakersfield to pickup the plans and bid from Oasis.  We
stopped at Office Supply and bought some colored pencils.  We got home about
4:30PM.  We ate some dinner and then went for a walk.  When we got back I put
on a DVD of the continued story of Ann and Green Gables.  We watched the first
half of the show and then quite for the night.  I sure enjoy being with Mae and
she is so special to be willing to be with me.</span></p>

breakfast.  She is sure special.  Lee, Elder Judd and I met for a few minutes. 
We have done about all we can do on the houses until we get the States approval
on the water.  I worked on demoralizing the old shed to the west of the house. 
I also did some work on the sprinkler system.  I took my plans to Bruce Winn
with HydroTech.  He will have a engineer figure the system and will get back to
me.  I guess I will get the yard roto-tilled tomorrow.  Mae had dinner about
ready when I returned home.  We watch the last of the “Ann of Green Gables”
while we ate.  It is really a good show.  We talked to David and to Scott this
evening.  David had called earlier thinking that they might come down this week
end but they decided that it is too far to drive for just 4 days.  We also
talked with Scott as he and Kylan had a presentation for Cub Scouts this
evening.  He had some problems with his laptop but it so happened that he had
his presentation on a thumb drive and another fellow had his laptop there so
they were able to do the presentation on the other laptop.  I filled out this
entry and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

did sleep in a little longer as I didn’t have to meet with Elder Judd and Lee
until 8:30PM.  We discussed a couple of bids and looked at the options.  We are
still held up with the State on permits.  Elder Judd and I went out to the home
at the Wasco farm and checked out a leaky bathroom faucet.  We agreed that we
need to completely replace the faucet rather than try to find parts for the
existing one.  I figured on parts that we need for the sprinkler.  Mae went
with me to Hydrotec in Delano for more parts.  We stopped at the Post Office and
mailed a phone charger to Bob and Carroll that they had left here.  We had to
stop at Home Depot and correct some charge slips and I also bought a faucet for
Elder Judd to take to the Wasco Farm.  We stopped at a Sub Way and got us a
sandwich for dinner.  This evening I filled capsules while Mae worked on the
computer.  David and Mike each called us today.  I filled out this journat
