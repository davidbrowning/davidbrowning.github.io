and we have the house about finished until the carpet and cabinets are
installed.  I had to go into Wasco for some parts so while there I went to K-Mart’s
and bought Mae a Pont seta for Christmas.  I had forgotten to take my lunch
with me this morning so Mae brought it to me.  She came while I was gone and
left just before I returned, so I sent the Pont seta to Mae by Sister Shaw. 
Mae is having a group of women to the house and Sister Shaw is one of them. 
After the women left Sister Shaw and Mae went into Bakersfield shopping.  Mae
didn’t get home until 6PM.  When I got home I made almond milk and almond
butter.  We ate dinner and then I took a shower.  We then watched a show on the
TV.  We watched another Big Valley series before going to bed.</span></p>

best last night so was a little slow getting off to work.  Mae was up and got
my breakfast and lunch ready.  She is sure special!  Today we worked on the
duplex, unit #2, by first going over the nailing of the sheetrock and either
setting the screws deeper of replacing many with nails.  This afternoon we
started taping the sheetrock.  I wish I could show Elder Shaw how to tape but I
guess I just have to be patient and let him do it the way he wants.  I got home
about 5PM.  Mae soon had dinner ready.  I then took a shower and soaked in a
hot tub for a few minutes.  This evening we watched the movie “In Harm’s Way”
with John Wayne.  It was almost 3 hours long but a good movie.  I did write a
thank you note to Brother Neiderhauser for the cabinet plans he drew for me. 
Bob called us and said that he could get me a TV for about half price.  We are
thinking about it.  Bob also told us that Jamie is getting married the 26<sup>th</sup>
of January.  That is very good news.  We are late getting to bed tonight.</span></p>

this morning but let Mae sleep later.  Mae went to school this morning to help out
there.  Elder and Sister Shaw went to Bakersfield for a Doctor appointment but
they were told that the Dr. was sick so they were rescheduled.  I started
taping.  I stopped on the way home and bought some dog food for the stray dog
that has been here for the past three days.  It looks like a female boxer and
we guess that someone has just dropped her off.  We fed her this evening
because we can’t stand to watch her just starve.  I will have to call the dog
pound tomorrow.  Mae cooked a small turkey this evening for dinner.  It was
sure good.  I helped Mae clean up and then I took a shower.  We watched another
show on DVD of “The Call of the Wild” series before going to bed.</span></p>

went back to bed and cuddled with Mae.  She soon got up because several of the
women went out to eat breakfast at Hodels.  They kidnapped Sister Birch,
leaving a baby sitter with the children, and took Sister Birch out for
breakfast.  The Birch’s will be moving to Argentina this next week, so that
Spencer can manage a farm for the Church there.  After Mae left I used the
inverter table, did my stretch exercises and went back to bed.  I didn’t wake
back up until 9:30AM.  I fed the dog and got me something to eat for
breakfast.  Mae and I worked on Christmas cards and letters.  I wrote an added
letter to President Nadado in the Philippines.  Mae gave me a haircut; we took
showers, got ready, picked up the Shaw’s and went to the company Christmas
party.  They served a nice dinner and then had some fun games.  We didn’t stay
for the gift exchange but came on home.  I filled out this entry and we went to
bed.</span></p>

cramped so I slept most of the night in the recliner.  About 3AM I went into
bed and slept ok until morning.  When we woke this morning the house was cold. 
We finally checked and found that we are out of natural gas again.  I will have
to check with Lee when we get to Church to see who we need to call.  Our dog is
still with us and she is always waiting for some food.  I have tried to call
the animal shelter but the one in Bakersfield is full and I only got a
recording with Shafter.  Nursery today was a circus with 17 children part of
the time.  It went fairly well and the Primary Presidency took 4 of the oldest
children into Primary for sharing time, so that helped some.  As normal we were
tired when it ended.  We came home and had a light lunch and then took a nap,
cuddled up with quilts over us to keep warm.  Mae slept about ½ hour and I
slept an hour.  We then went to the church house so that we could watch the
First Presidency’s Christmas message.  That was very enjoyable.  Mae had packed
a nice dinner and took it with us.  After the meeting ended we drove over to the
Kimberlina houses and used the vacant unit where we served dinner to the
Elders.  We went there because we had heat there.  We had a very enjoyable
evening with the young Elders.  Mae and I cleaned up after the elders left. 
Sister Kim Brown let us borrow a heater that we brought home and with the other
heater we got from work it gave us some heat in our house.  Lee was unable to
get anyone at the gas company to bring us out gas until tomorrow.  We will do
with the two heaters we have.  Mae did call both Jeff and Scott as we traveled
this afternoon.  It is now late so we will go to bed.</span></p>

up and the house was quite cold but the two heaters made it ok.  Mae prepared
me hot cereal in the micro-wave for breakfast.  I was late getting off to work
and then I remembered that I had forgotten to get the key to return to Sister
Shaw so I had to turn around and go back to get it.  Elder Shaw and I worked on
tapping unit 2 of the duplex.  We finished the 1<sup>st</sup> and most of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
coat of mud at 4PM so we quit and went home.  The natural gas co. delivered
propane to our house and got everything lit for Mae.  It is good to have the
house warm when I got home.  Mae had cooked turkey stew for dinner, it was
really good.  I showered and shaved after dinner and then took a short nap. 
Mae and I read two talks from the Conference Ensign and then watched “Christmas
Shoes” before going to bed.  I entered this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

got quite a bit done.  We had sidewalks poured at the housing project so it was
better that we worked other places today and it really helped Lee with the
cabinets.  Lee really has some neat cabinet equipment that he was able to buy. 
He bought it from a man that wanted to retire for $25,000 and the farm built
him a shed to put it in if he would build cabinets for the farm.  Lee plans on
using it for income when he retires.  Mae called the Shafter Dog Pound and they
came out and got the dog.  This evening we were going to watch the movie “The
High and The Mighty” but the DVD is cracked and it wouldn’t play.  That is the
second movie we have received that has been broken in less than thirty days.  I
played a game of chess with the computer and with two “undo’s” I won the game. 
We talked to Mike by phone this evening and enjoyed that.  Mae also called
Shellie and visited with her a few minutes.  It’s getting late so we had better
get to bed.</span></p>

breakfast and put my lunch together that Mae had made for me last night.  Mae
woke just as I was about to leave for work.  Elder Shaw and I put another coat
of mud on the sheetrock.  I really wish that Elder Shaw knew what he was
doing.  I am not sure just how much work it will be to correct the work he did
today.  Besides being very tired when I went home I was also upset at the
craftsmanship of Elder Shaw’s tapping.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got
home.  After eating I shaved and changed clothes.  Mae went with me Home
Teaching to Brother Manuel Macias.  We visited and invited them to the Ward
Christmas Party.  I will really be surprised if they go but we at least invited
them.  On the way home we stopped at the store and bought some distilled water
for my C-PAP.  Mae worked on Christmas treats while I played a game of Chess on
the computer.  I won the game but it was close.  I went to bed quite tired and
somewhat discouraged.  <br>

best last night and woke still very depressed and hurting in many areas.  Mae’s
comment yesterday had some affect but the thing that is upsetting is the
concerns as to how the work is progressing.  I do not want to be upset with
Elder Shaw but he and I differs in our opinions as to how things should be
done.  I also need to visit with Lee as to what he wants in craftsmanship.  I
really didn’t feel like going to work today but couldn’t feel right about
staying home.  I know that my emotional feelings are also causing some of my
physical problems.  I finally took two aspirins and left the house.  I was a
little late getting to work today.  Elder Shaw wanted to start texturing the
walls and ceiling but I suggested that we sand the tapping.  We worked on the
front room and kitchen area and then Elder Shaw moved into the bedroom.  I
started putting a third coat of mud on where we had sanded.  After Elder Shaw
sanded the bedroom he went to the west duplex and started taping there.  We
quite at 4PM and I came home.  Mae was gone Visiting Teaching when I got home
so I showered and heated me some dinner.  I then put the DVD of “Miracle on 34<sup>th</sup>
Street” on to watch.  Mae came home for a few minutes and then she went to a
progressive dinner with some of the Relief Society sisters.  After watching the
show I worked on the computer for a while and then played a chess game.  I lost
this game.  Mae got home shortly after 9PM.  She made lunches for us for
tomorrow.  We found the paper work on the pickup and I will check with Dee
tomorrow and see how we can best get the truck registered so that Scott and
Jeff can bring it down to us in January.  It is late so we had better get to
bed.</span></p>

attended the Ward Christmas party.  They served a nice dinner and had a short
program with Santa clause coming.   It was a nice evening.  We decided to watch
“Miracle on 34<sup>th</sup> Street” again as Mae didn’t get to see it last

recliner where I slept until 7 when Mae came in to check on me.  We went back
to bed and slept together until Mae got up about 9AM.  I got up shortly after
that.  We had a nice breakfast of omelets and waffles.  I called Bob to see if
he got the pickup licenced and inspected.  He had fallen to sleep and didn’t
wake up in time to get there yesterday.  I asked if he had received a package
from us and he said that it was stuck in the mail box and he needed gloves on
to get it out.  Mae worked on nursery preparations for tomorrow.  I helped her
some.  I also filled come capsules with Ambertose.  We went into Bakersfield
for some nursery items, to eat out at The Home Town restraint and to get a
couple of items from Lassen’s.   At Lassen’s they had the bread on sale for
more than ½ off.  We bought 9 loafs.  I was sure tired when we got home but it
has sure been enjoyable being with Mae today.</span></p>

Christmas performance for next Sunday.  Bishop and Sister Birch spoke in
Sacrament meeting and we enjoyed the Spirit they left with us.  In nursery we
had 16 children again and it was another wild experience.  When we got home we
got something to eat and then took a nap.  Mae slept about 40 minutes and I
slept 2 hours.  We worked for 3 ½ hours on getting nursery children pictures
printed so that Mae could make Christmas ornaments for each child to give to
their parents.  While I wrote this entry Mae read short stories from the

prefer-tape unit 3.  At 10AM we took a break.  Lee came and asked us if we
would like to see the planting of the almond trees.  It was very interesting. 
Lee also showed us an experiment that they are trying in the shaping of the
trees.  I asked Lee about the number of almond trees there are in an acre and
he told me that 105 and 128 pistachio trees.  When we returned Elder Shaw and I
continued with our work.  We completed the first coat of tape and most of the
second coat before quitting work for the day.  The Full Time Missionaries are
scheduled for transfers tomorrow.  Elder and Sister were planning on taking
them to the Mission Home in Ventura but then she asked me if we would like to
take them.  I checked with Mae and she said that she would like to.  So plans
changed and we will take them there.  When I got home I checked the car for gas
and found it low, so I took it to the service station and filled it.  After
eating dinner I took a shower.  We then watched two series of “Big Valley”.  We
then went to bed as we will have to get up at 4AM in order to pick the Elders

freeway where Elder Garff went back to Delano and Elder Nicholas went with us
to Ventura where transfers took place.  We got to Ventura at 8:30AM and Elder
Bills had a meeting at 9AM.  We visited with a Brother Moyes, from Bakersfield
that told us as story that is recorded in the book, Especialy for Mormons, of a
little girl that lived in the Mormon Settlement in Mexico in the early 1900. 
The area was experiencing a terriable drought.   brought her umbrella That gave
us time to go downtown to a McDonalds for a Egg Mcmuffin and a Wild Berry

meeting.  It was good to remember the transfer meetings in the Philippines. 
After the meeting and the transfer of luggage from Elder Nicholas’s for Elder
Manning’s (a brand new Elder) we went to a Sub Way and got something to eat. 
We stopped at a fruit stand and bought a few items and then headed home.  We
arrived at the Elder’s apartment about 3:30PM having traveled 336 miles.  Mae
and I stopped at the new orchard that they started planting yesterday and they
are almost finished with it now.  We then stopped at the plant to get gas but I
had forgotten to get the gas card.  I had also forgotten to put my wallet in my
pocket so it was a good thing that Mae had her purse.  We had Elder Bills and
Elder Manning for dinner at 5PM, although they were 20 minutes late.  Mae had a
nice dinner for them and after they left us some thoughts from the Scriptures
before leaving.  We watched the rest of the show, “The High and The Mighty”,
which we started last week and found that the DVD had a break in it.  Jay and
Ilene Payne and their children stopped by to give us a Christmas Gift from
Andrew.  It was a card that Andrew colored and a CD of the Spirit of the Season
by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra with Sissel.  It was special of
them.  After they left we watched the end of the show.  Mae fell asleep in the
recliner so I finished this entry and went to bed.   It has been a long day.</span></p>

well so I let her sleep in and I got my own breakfast.  Mae had made my lunch
last night so I just had to put it together.  Mae woke just before I left for
work.  Elder Shaw, Lee and I installed cabinets today.  We had some electrical
that we had to modify.  At noon Mae came over and ate lunch with me and I
filled her car with gas as the Farm paid for the gas to take the Missionaries
to Ventura for transfers.  Ryan Slade brought out a Christmas Present to Mae
and I from the Processing Plant.  The package contained a variety of almonds
packages.  After Mae left she went into Shafter and got a permanent from
Veronica.  She got home just before I did this afternoon.  She had dinner about
ready so we are and then I took a shower and shaved.  I helped Mae get some
pictures printed off for sending with Christmas Cards.  I started this entry
and then played the computer a game of chess.  I won the computer in the game. 
I them read an article in the Ensign given by Elder Kevin R. Duncan that gave
very good advice.  I finished up this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

in a little longer as we have an appointment to meet with Merrill Dibble at 9AM
today.   It was very foggy so Mae followed me and we didn’t drive very fast. 
We only met with Merrill for a few minutes as just after we entered his office
he got a call on the phone and a couple of men were there to meet with him.  He
did express appreciation for all we have done and he gave us a camping blanket
as a Christmas gift.  Elder Shaw and I trimmed the cabinets and then started to
hang the micro-wave oven.  Lee called me and asked if I could go out to the
Wasco farm and check the power to the house.  Most of the house is without
electricity.  As I started to leave the plant Lee drove in and asked if I could
also go to the Sherwood homes and let Artesano Granite and Tile co. into the
houses there so they could give Lee a bid on some tile work there.  I found
that three double breakers were broken so I took one of them with me.  After I
met the tile co. I went to Home Depot in Drano and bought the breakers.  I got
most of the outlets and lights working except for a ground fault circuit and I
will have to talk to Don about that circuit tomorrow.  The man from the Tile
co. gave me a Christmas sack of pistachio’s for my time.  I got home about
4:30PM and Mae had just beat me by a few minutes as she had gone to Slate’s and
helped them prepare to move on Saturday.  The Temple Apartment’s called and
told Mae that they had a cancelation for a room so we said that we would take
it.  After dinner I helped Mae with the dishes and then I took a short nap.  We
decided to watch a show on DVD and chose “Ice Castle” but with in the first few
minutes we shut it off because of the language.  We put on “We are Marshall”
and with very little bad language enjoyed the story, a true story.  We soon
went to bed as it was almost 10PM.</span></p>

work I visited with Don, the electrician, about the breakers at the Wasco farm
house.  He had his son follow me out and we found and repaired the problem I
was having with the GFI circuit.  I helped Elder Shaw for a few minutes on the
home.  At 11:30AM we went to the plant office for a dinner in appreciation to
Spencer Birch and his family.  They will be leaving this afternoon for a little
time with some of their family in Idaho and then to Argentina for a four year
assignment to manage four Church farms there.  I quit for the day and came home
with Mae.  She and Sister Shaw had been over to Sister Slade’s helping them to
pack to move.  When Mae and I got home it didn’t take us very long before we
were packed and left for Los Angeles.  It has rained all day and when we got
over the Grape Vine the rain increased and the fog also came in.  </span></p>

time to get to the Temple for the 9:30AM Temple Endowment session.  We got our
things into our car and checked out.  We drove around trying to find a parking
space closer to the Temple but finally had to walk a block in the rain.  In as
much as we missed the Endowment session we did initiatory ordinances.  We met President
Brimhall in his office and visited for a few minutes and then he invited us to
go with him to the Baptismal Fount area.  He showed us the pumping system and
then had us look through a doorway at the oxen.  They are very impressive and
massive looking when you look right straight into their face from just a few
feet away from them.  President Brimhall then took us to a Sealing room that
was President McKay’s bedroom when he would come to the L.A. Temple.  He also
explained that there was another Sealing room the same size directly above that
one that was President McKay’s office when he was there.  We then went to the
upper room in the Temple which is the Priesthood room.  It is a little larger
than a football field.  It only gets used once a year for a special devotional
meeting.  On the west end of the room is the stands for the Aaronic Priesthood
Quorums and to the east end is the stands for the Melchizedek Priesthood
Quorums.  East of the Priesthood room we entered the First Presidency and Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles room and that is the only use of this room so it is not
very often that this room gets used.  On the way back to President Brimhall’s
office I asked how the L.A. Temple compared to the S.L. Temple in size.  He
said that the L.A. Temple was the largest until the Annex was added to the S.L.
Temple.  Sister Brimhall was not there as she wasn’t feeling well.  President
Brimhall said she is just over exerting her shelf.  We were visiting with
President Brimhall for two wonderful hours, what a privilege it was for us.  After
we left the Temple we stopped at a Denny’s for dinner.  With the rain the roads
were some what slippery and foggy so we drove with caution.  We also lessoned
to the third book of the “Brothers”.  When we got to Bakersfield we stopped to
get a few items at a drug store.  While we were there Grenn Clark called.  They
got our Christmas card and haven’t received an of Mae’s e-mails except the
first one.  It was good to visit with them.  After getting home my back was
hurting quite bad so I did some stretch exercises and then lay in the Chee
machine.  I fell asleep for 15 or 20 minutes.  We watched the “White Christmas”
on DVD and really enjoyed that movie.  It was 10 PM when I finished this entry
so we went to bed.</span></p>

in order to be at the church before 8AM.  It gave us enough time to set up our
class room and get into choir practice by 8AM.  The choir put on the program
today in Sacrament meeting.  It went well.  We only had a few children in the
nursery today and it was very peaceful.  We brought a young man and a young
sister to Shafter with us.  They are both investigators and attended meetings
today.  After getting home I played the computer a game of chess and I took the
black board.  the computer won the game but it was close.  We visited with some
of our children by phone this afternoon.  Bishop Lee and Sister Kim Brown
stopped by with a gift and a short visit.  They are sure great people.  We
watched the movie “It’s a Wonderful Life” on DVD this evening.  That made us
late going to bed and then we had a warning that our Norton Anti Virus is

restored our Christmas card list from the external hard drive because we have

before noon Elder and Sister Shaw left for L.A.  They plan on staying at the

Christmas with their Son and family.  I finished the texturing in the east
duplex before quitting work this afternoon.  When I got home Mae had dinner
about ready.  The missionaries are coming for dinner.  I took a shower and
shaved and then laid on the Chee machine.  We enjoyed having Elder Bills and
Elder Manning come this evening.  After they left we started to watch a
Christmas movie but it became disgusting right at the start so we shut it off. 
The Shaw’s loaned us a Holiday Triple consisting of “The Christmas Shoes, The
Christmas Blessing and The Christmas Hope”.  We have already seen “The
Christmas Shoes” so we watch “The Christmas Blessing” and really enjoyed it. 
When I went to get up to enter my journal entry I got a cramp in my right leg
that really tightened up and had me rolling on the floor in pain.  Mae got me a
hot bath towel and that relieved the cramp enough to let me get in a hot shower

break and found that all the office and processing plant employs had today
off.  I cleaned up and took off also.  I stopped at the store and got some
groceries that Mae wanted.  It was nice to be home and relax the rest of the
day.  We made some of the cookies that Sister Shaw made but they still don’t
turn out the same as hers.  Mae tried to stay down so she will feel well for
the Holidays but staying down is hard for her.  This evening we watch the movie
“Christmas Hope” and enjoyed that as much as the other two shows.  We got on
the inter-net and ordered those three movies on-line.  Even though the DVD’s
won’t arrive until after the Holidays, they are movies that we would like to
over again.  </span></p>

flowers for her Birthday.  When we got to Penny’s Mae tried on several other
dresses and we got two of them.  We then went to Home Depot where I got the
supplies.  I hope I got everything that I had on my list because when we got to
Home Depot I couldn’t find the list.  It was 8:30PM when we got home.  It is
sure fun being with Mae.  This morning at the Chiropractor’s office, Carol
Hamilton, the chiropractor, said that they really enjoyed Mae’s delightful
personality.  She asked if she was that pleasant at home and when I said she
was, she told me to hang on to her for you don’t find one like that very
often.  I had to agree.  While at Home Depot Mae bought an artificial Christmas
tree that is already decorated.  We got home a little after 8PM and decided
that we might watch one of the JAG series from the new set of 3<sup>rd</sup>
and 4<sup>th</sup> season series.  It is now 10PM so we had better get to bed. 
After Mae went to sleep I got up and fixed the flowers for her birthday.</span></p>

until 6AM and then we went out to eat breakfast at Hodel’s.  I sure enjoy being
with Mae.  After we got back home I went to work and Mae went to the nursing
home.  When Mae finished at the nursing home she went into Bakersfield and got
her dresses that we had picked out last night.  She also talked to most of the
children who called her to wish her a Happy Birthday.  Mae went shopping at Winco
before coming home.  I got home first and took a shower and soaked in a hot
tub.  We had chicken and left over’s for dinner.  We tried to watch a DVD but
it were kind of stupid.  We did watch “Baptists at our Barbecue” and it was
also dumb.  I played a couple of games of Solitary and won them.  It is now
time to go to bed.  Good night!</span></p>

went back to bed.  I didn’t feel like getting up when the alarm went off.  Mae
pushed the getting up and for some reason it along with the dumb movie we
watched last night set me in a depressed mood that has lasted most of the day. 
I don’t understand why something like that can set the mood for a day but it
happens to me often.  I sanded the walls in the east unit, patched a hole in
the wall, installed the two window seals and made a list of materials that I
need to buy tomorrow.  Lee helped me load and bring the window seals over from
the Kimberlina homes where we have had them stored.  I left work shortly after
3:30PM so that I could be ready for dinner when Elder Bill’s and Elder Manning
came at 5PM.  Mae had a nice dinner and after the Elder’s left I helped her do
the dishes.  I filled out part of this entry and prepared to start a new year
of journals.  Mae and I read another talk from the Ensign and then tried to
find a DVD to watch.  We tried the western stories and didn’t like that so we
put on another “Big Valley” and enjoyed that.  The choice of movies that are
out now days is very pitiful and sorry.</span></p>

12:15AM and slept the rest of the night in the recliner.  Mae woke me when the
alarm went off at 5:30AM.  I debated on whether or not I should wear my thermos
or not.  I am glad that I lost that debate because it was cold all day.  Elder
and Sister Shaw got home just as I got to work.  The furnace in their trailer
quit working, so they have no heat.  I had them put the space heater in the
trailer but I am not sure that it will heat it to a comfort zone.  I worked on
the house all day.  After Elder Shaw and I tried to get the furnace to work, I
suggested that he take the thermostat with him while he went to Bakersfield for
parts.  He could stop by a RV shore and see if they could check out the
thermostat.  He did and they can’t replace it until at least next Tuesday. 
After dinner this evening, I took a shower and then we watched the movie
(Charlie) and really enjoyed it.  I filled out this entry before going to bed.</span></p>

electric throw, skirt, suits, flowers &amp; card for gifts and out for
breakfast and all the love.  You are so special and I appreciate all the things
you do for me – making the bed each morning and helping with dishes when I have
lots, taking me out to eat and showing love in so many ways.  I love the hugs,
kisses and being close to you.  You are my best friend and my sweetheart and I
want you forever.</span></p>

for the New Year Holiday so I didn’t go to work today.  We slept in getting up
about 7:30AM.  Mae has been doing some research on the T-Zone Vibration machine
and we decided to buy it.  While she was doing that and getting dressed I made
egg omelets and freezer waffles for breakfast.  After breakfast we went to
Apple Market and e0mailed the information to John Price in Gilbert Arizona.  We
then drove to the plant where we got the plumbing parts that Elder Shaw bought
yesterday.  It was interesting that he bought the model of toilet tank plug
that he bought because that is the one I told him that we didn’t want.  We did
some shopping at Lassens and Costco before we went to Lowes and exchanged the
parts.  We then stopped at Winco and bought some groceries, most of which are
for the plants monthly birthday treat.  We ate lunch while we were at
Costco’s.  After returning home I took a nap.  </span></p>
