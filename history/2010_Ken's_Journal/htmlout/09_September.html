Bakersfield to the Home Depot where we purchased over $1100 worth of materials
for the home we are working on.  It was almost noon when we got back to work. 
We quite work at 4PM.  Mae had dinner ready when I got there.  After eating and
cleaning up Mae and I went back to Bakersfield.  I returned one item and
purchased a couple of other items.  We then went to Lassens where we bought
some bread, butter and almond butter.  We made one more stop at T-Mobil to
return the charger that came with the loaner phone I used while we were waiting
for my new phone to arrive.  After getting home we watched one of the series of

and got my breakfast and lunch ready.  As I read my Scriptures this morning I
was really impressed with the great blessings that I have been given through my
life.  The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the central item of my life and I cannot
even imagine what life would be without it nor would I want it any other way. 
I wish so much that I know how to get my children to feel the same way as I
do.  Maybe someday!  I worked on the Kimberlina home changing the electrical
moving switches so that they will be in the proper place for the installing of
standard hinged doors.  While I was changing the switch location I also added a
switch so that the lights and ceiling fans each had their own switch.  Elder
Shaw spent most of the day working on the Kimberlina Shop Home.  We also took
time to attend the Plants Monthly Birthday Celebration treat.  Mae made a
special glutton free brownie for Merrill Dibble, Mae and myself.  She made 2
pans ofTexas cake with ice cream for the rest.  She also bought me a yogurt. 
This evening we watched a movie “The Band Wagon” from Netflex.  We did some
planning to have a movie night tomorrow night with the Shaw’s and the Brown’s. 
I helped Mae with the monthly report and entered this entry.  I still had to
shower and did that while Mae got my lunch ready for tomorrow.</span></p>

this morning I called Lee and told him that I was going to stop at the lumber
co. to check on the door that they are charging us for.  Lee said that he had
an invoice from them with my signature on it.  I stopped at his office and I
don’t believe the signature is mine but is almost like it.  We will think about
it to decide what to do.  Elder Shaw had some other things to take care of this
morning so I worked on the house by myself most of the day.  Elder Shaw got
over to help me for a couple of hours this afternoon.  When I got home Mae told
me of her day working as a volunteer at the Shafter Elementary school.  This
evening we had the Shaw’s and the Brown’s over for dinner and then we set the
projector up in the back yard and watched a movie.  It has really been an

until almost 8AM.  Mae prepared me a nice breakfast and then I went over to
Mike’s, at the plant, where I installed a 220v line and outlet for their
electric clothes dryer.  Everything went well until I went to cut the hole in
the washroom wall to install the outlet box.  I couldn’t get my stud finder to
read properly and when I would try to cut a hole in the wall I would hit wood. 
This was a puzzle to me until we finally realized that there had been a ½ “of
OSB sheeted the wall before the ½ “sheetrock had been added.  It took me over
three hours to do a 1 ½ hour job.  After getting home I made some almond milk
and some almond butter.  This time I ground the almonds in the hand grinder
first.  It seemed to work much better.  This evening we went out to eat at
Sizzler and sure enjoyed the evening being together.  After getting home we
really didn’t feel like going to bed but realizing that we have Church in the
morning we took showers and went to bed about 10 PM. </span></p>

well last night and didn’t get up until 7AM.  We enjoyed Sacrament meeting but the
children were really hard to handle during the nursery time.  Lee and Kim Brown
invited us to dinner after church.  Also invited to dinner were Elder and
Sister Shaw and the full time Elders.  Dinner was very good and after eating
the Elders sang a Hymn for us and had a prayer before they left for another
appointment.  The rest of us enjoyed visiting for a while.  When we got home we
called some of our children, I also called Roy and talked to him for a little
while planning for a trip to San Francisco the end of the month and the first
of October.  I caught up my journal.  We talked to Scott, Jeff and Mike.  They
are all doing well and it was good to visit with them.  We got us some fruit
and bagels for super.  We received a very nice letter from Camille Smith.  I

fond that Mae wasn’t in bed with me.  I checked the other bedroom and found her
there.  There were two notes left for me indicating that she was awake at
12:30AM and still hadn’t gone to sleep by 2:30AM.  I quietly got ready, fixed
my breakfast and put my lunch into my lunch box.  Mae had prepared my lunch
before we had gone to bed last night.  I stopped on the way to work at the
lumber company to find out about an interior door that they have sent us an
invoice.  I do not believe that we ever purchased an interior door from them. 
They were closed and I remembered that today is Labor Day and most people have
the day off.  The plant is working so Elder Shaw and I also worked.  We spent
the day at the Kimberlina Home #31341.  We got the sheetrock hung; electrical
outlets installed and started hanging doors.  It was almost 5PM when I got
home.  Mae had dinner ready so we ate and then I showered and cleaned up.  We
went over to Elder and Sister Shaw’s for Family Home Evening and had a very

Shaw worked all day on the house finishing sheetrock, cutting down the doors
and door jambs and hanging the tub – shower doors.  After I left home this
morning, Mae attended Stake Seniors Lunching, went shopping with Sister Shaw and
bought me some shoe laces for my work boots.  I got home before she did and
found that the table was set and dinner was about ready for the Elders to come
to eat.  I helped her finish up dinner as Elder Ray and Elder Day arrived. 
After eating the Elders sang a Hymn and we had prayer before they left for

all day.  I took the quilting frames over to the bowery where we set them up
for Mae and Sister Shaw.  They were supposed to have had several women come and
help quilt but it mainly ended up Sister Shaw and Mae doing most of it.  I
stopped on the way home and picked up a package at the post office.  It was my
sandals that I had left at Roy and Linda’s last week.  I am sure glad to
receive them.  Mae had a nice dinner about ready when I got home.  After dinner
we heard workers out in the yard and when I looked out the kitchen window a saw
Eric Miller and Ken Richins working on the equipment.  I walked out and visited
with them.  They are getting the new equipment ready to start the harvest of
the pistachios in the morning.  I came back and had Mae come out with me and we
saw who the equipment will work together.  This evening Mae and I watched
another serious of Big Valley.  I then helped Mae do the dinner dishes and
entered this journal entry.  I then showered and shaved before going to bed.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                This morning as I was
getting ready for work we could hear men and equipment preparing to start the
harvest of the pistachios.  It was interesting to see all the brown Ford
pickups in the equipment yard and as the new equipment left the yard for the
orchard all the pickups followed.  I would like to have gone with them.  I
really get excited at seeing the farming in this country.  The past three days
harvesting of the corn field on the N.W. corner of Lerdo and Cherry has been in
process.  Seeing the corn combine has renewed the excitement of the day I got
the new combine on the Grantsville Stake farm.  I couldn’t help thinking of
what makes the difference between a boy and a man.  The cost of his toys.  When
Elder Shaw and I started work on the Kimberlina house this morning I opened the
back door and was startled with two large dogs growling and barking at me.  At
first i thought it was the dogs to the East yard but then realized that I had
not seen these dogs.  I finally took the 16d nail gun and fired it at the
dogs.  They soon went to the far corner of the yard and shut up.  I called Lee
and he soon called me back to tell me that the dogs belonged to Stacy and
JoLynn Shaw who did live in that house.  He now works at the Chico farm and is
here to see the new pistachio harvesting equipment.  He had brought the dogs
with him and left them there for a couple of days.  Elder Shaw and i worked all
day on the house.  It seems like I am very slow at hanging the doors in the
house.  It has taken me two days to hang 8 doors and I am still not finished. 
I use to do more than twice that amount of work.  I was tired when I came
home.  After dinner I took a nap.  I then showered and we watched “Love’s
Unending Legacy” on DVD.  All though we have seen it before we still enjoy
these good shows.  I entered this journal entry and we went to bed.  Mae is so
good to me and tries to take care of my ever need.  She went Visiting Teaching
today and then when she came home she cleaned house and got dinner ready.  I am
so blessed with such a wonderful wife and sweet heart.</span></p>

school working as a volunteer most of the day.  I worked on the Kimberlina home
and Elder Shaw worked on the Kimberlina Shop home.  This afternoon Elder Shaw
also went to town to get some materials.  I went over to the plant to get gas
in my pickup about 3PM.  Mae also went to the plant to purchase some nuts for
Bryce and Irven.  We actually got to the plant at the same time.  I carried the
nuts out to the car for Mae.  She shared the last of her health candy bar with
me.  I went back to the house and put things away and locked up the house.  I
got home before 5PM.  Mae was preparing dinner.  I took a shower, shaved and
took a shower before we ate dinner.  The Shaw’s came at 6:35P and the four of
us went to the Stake Center in Bakersfield expecting to attend a “Know Your
Religion” fireside but found that it was canceled.  We went to Lassen’s and
purchased a few groceries that Mae needed.  We also bought 4 Yogurt Parfaits
and came back to our place and watched the movie “Fireproof”.  It is really a
beautiful movie and every married couple should watch it.  While I wrote this
journal entry Mae prepared lunches for the two of us.  I am going to work
tomorrow and Mae is going to a Stake relief Society activity from 9AM to 3PM

after 6AM as Mae is going to Bakersfield with Sister Shaw to a Relief society
quilting program and I am going to work on the Kimberlina home.  I worked until
3PM and came home.  Mae wasn’t home yet so I took a shower and shaved.  When
Mae got home we went into Bakersfield to the Home Town Buffet for dinner.  As
we were going to eat we drove through the orchards and saw them harvesting the
pistachios so we stopped and watched for a few minutes.  We picked up a sack
full that had fallen off the harvester.  They are good to eat raw.   When we
got home I could hear water running so investigated.  I found that a fitting
had come disconnected over at the pump area and so repaired it.  When I came in
Mae was talking to Sister Hyer so I downloaded some pictures and prepared some
nursery pictures for printing.  We couldn’t print them as we can’t find the
color print cartages.  Mae took a shower and I entered my journal entry before

waken by equipment moving out into the pistachios orchard.  I was shocked to
say the least.  Jae had said that when the pistachios harvest starts it would
go continually until it was finished.  Somehow I was naive enough that I didn’t
think that included Sunday.  I called Lee and he said that it is a perishable
crop and like a dairy or a hospital that is the way it has to be.  So far I
can’t buy that concept.  </span></p>

alarm went off and tried to let Mae sleep a little longer.  She got up shortly
after 6AM and got me breakfast and my lunch put together.  This morning Elder
Shaw and I worked on the main plant cleaning the roof drains and changing the
air conditioner filters in the AC units for the main office.  We finished just
at lunch time so set in the shade of the Shaw’s trailer.  We worked the rest of
the day on the Kimberlina shop home.  this evening Mae and I went out to eat. 
She is sure great to be with.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                Both Mae and I got up
in time so that we could both go to work at the Kimberlina shop house.  Mae,
Sister Shaw and Gloria (from the plant) cleaned and swept the house.  I
repaired some plaster area that the carpet layers broke while removing base
board. Elder Shaw put a trim around the base board to finish to the new
flooring and then he touched up the painting.  I went to Floyd’s in Shafter for
some supplies.  It was close to noon when I got back.  Mae said that she still
had a little more cleaning so I went to Sub Way and bought us a sandwich. 
After lunch Mae and Sister Shaw finished the cleaning and went home.   I worked
the rest of the day removing broken tile from the back entrance way.  It was
Spanish slate tile and was really hard to break out.  I used a coal chisel and
a single jack and it took me over four hours to get it ready for replacement. 
I had hoped to have been able to get the replacement tile laid before quitting
but that didn’t happen.  Mae became very busy when she came home, trying to get
ready for Bryce, Deanna, Irven and Sandy to come.  When I got home and cleaned
up, I helped her finish with dinner preparations.  Linda called to let us know
that Bryce, Deanna, Irven and Sandy had left there.  We figured it would be at
least 7:30 before they would get here.  We watched a “Big Valley” series and
still had a few minutes before they came.  It was almost 8PM when they arrived
but it worked out ok.  We enjoyed a very nice dinner and then visited.  We took
time to walk across the street and pick a few pistachios and show them how the
hull removes.  Bryce asked me how things were going and that lead to my
feelings of the harvesting of the pistachios on Sunday.  I maybe was out of
line to taking about this now.  Most got tired and went to bed but Sandy is
still up visiting and it is now 1130 PM.  Time to go to bed.  </span></p>

read my scriptures and said my prayers.  I called Lee at 6:30AM to get his ok
to go to Sequoia National Park.  Of course he said to have a safe and fun
time.  Mae was awake when I came back in.  We had a nice breakfast and then we
all went in our car and drove to Sequoia National Park.  It was a wonderful day
and we enjoyed the great Sequoia trees.  While we stopped to eat our lunch we
were able to see two black bears.  They got just about too close to feel
comfortable but it was exciting.  We were able to see the General Sherman tree
which is the largest tree in mass in the world and General Grant tree the
largest in diameter.   It was after 9PM when we got home.  While Mae prepared
some dinner we played a game of Knock.  After eating we played a game of
“Mormon Bridge”.  It was after mid-night that we got to bed.</span></p>

and I took Bryce’s car to town and got it fueled, washed and brake fluid added
so that it is ready for them to leave in the morning.  I then took them on a
tour of the work we are doing, the plant operation, the shaking of the almonds
and the harvesting of the pistachios.  We finished up at 6PM and then played
games and ate dinner before going to bed.  It has really been a wonderful time

Mae went to the grade school where she volunteers one day a week.  She missed
the care center this week.  Elder Shaw came to work with me but he wasn’t
feeling well so went home.  I worked in the attic until Lee came and got me
about 2PM and the two of us worked on cabinets for the house.  Lee wants me to
stay home tomorrow and not work by myself.  After getting home I fell asleep on
the bed for a few minutes.  After diner Mae and I watched a movie on DVD, “A
League of Their Own” but it was only fair.  Bob called just to talk for a few
minutes.  Bryce called to let us know that they had got home ok although it was

anywhere that we needed to do so we just relaxed.  I did make some almond
butter and almond milk.  This afternoon we went into Bakersfield and out to eat
at Sizzler’s for dinner.  We went to the Bakersfield East Stake where we met
President and Sister Brimhall.  We had almost an hour to just visit with them. 
They had to quit visiting and spend a few minutes preparing some thoughts for
their talks that they have to give this evening.  We attended the Saturday
Evening session of the Stake Conference and really enjoyed it.  President and
Sister Brimhall really gave beautiful talks and we enjoyed all of the talks. 
During Sister Brimhall’s talk she just briefly mentioned that the Browning’s
that they served with in the Philippines were here.  After the conference ended
we had three different ones come up and visit with us.  One Sister must be
related to me through the Browning line.  After a brief good bye to the
Brimhall’s we left for home.  We stopped for a couple of items at Wal Marts and
then came home.  When we were home I realized that we didn’t have our camera. 
We had taken it into the meeting with us do that we could take some pictures
with the Brimhall’s.  We must have left it on the bench when we left.  I worked
on the letter to Elder Estes until almost mid-night before we went to bed.</span></p>

woke us several times during the night.  They are harvesting the pistachios
right to the West of our house so we can feel the house shake along with the
noise.  This harvest has really kept me upset.  I just can’t feel that it is
right to harvest crops on the Sabbath Day and especially on the Church farm.  I
called President Russell of the Bakersfield East Stake and told him of our lost
camera.  He said that he would look for it and call me back.  He did call me
this evening but didn’t have good news.  He said he would continue to watch for
it and maybe someone will turn it in.  Our block meetings went well today.  During
the talk by the High Councilman, he told of the need to become Christ like.  I
particularly picked up on the need for obedience and faith.   Although we only
had 8 children in nursery today, that two hours seem like forever and we are
both completely worn out at the end.  We found out after the Block time ended
that some of the children were not there because their parents are working the
harvest and are working 12 hours a day 7 days a week.  When we came home we got
something to eat and then took a nap.  After getting up I called Jeff and was
going to play a game with him but we couldn’t get the internet to work today.  </span></p>

aware of the harvesting.  Mae got up and prepared breakfast and I left for work
before 7:30AM.  After I left for work Mae was able to get my e-mail sent to
Elder Estes.  Elder Shaw is feeling quite a bit better and was able to work
with me.  He worked on the preparation for painting and I worked on the
insulation in the attic.  This afternoon we went to Home Depot in Delano and
purchased some insulation and rented the blower.  After unloading the
insulation I boxed in the attic access to hold back the insulation when we blow
it in.  We plan to blow the insulation into the attic early tomorrow.  Mae was
still home when I got there and we had dinner together.  Mae then left to take
dinner to Valerie McDonough and then try to visit some of the Sisters on her
Visiting Teaching assignment.  I watch the movie “Hondo” before she returned. 
I then took a shower and shaved.  We had invited the Shaw’s over this evening
but they called and they are taking Elder Kay to Bakersfield in the morning so
they felt that it would be too late for them to get home tonight.  After Mae
came home Elder Kay and Elder Ray came by so Elder Kay could say good bye as he
is being transferred tomorrow.  Mae and I then watched the last show of the
first years JAG series.  The problem is that it does not conclude but continues
with the start of the second year’s series.  I finished this journal entry
before going to bed.</span></p>

of depression as I think about the harvesting of the pistachios.  Yesterday Mae
sent my e-mail to Elder Estes and then a little later she sent another e-mail
to him concerning the transportation of the Full Time Elders.  He immediately
replied to her second e-mail but has not replied to my concerns.  Elder Shaw
and Sister Shaw took the Elders this morning so I worked on preparing the doors
to be painted.  A little before 11AM Lee came over and I went with him along
with 4 other brothers and we went to the apartment that Armeta was staying in. 
She is now gone and they had to have the apartment cleaned out so that it can
be turned back over to the manager.  I don’t know if she will be returning or
not.  After getting everything out and the floors vacuumed Lee took all of us
to Champs for lunch.  I continued to work on doors for the rest of the
afternoon.  I got home just before 5PM and I beat Mae by 15 minutes.  I took a
shower and shaved.  Mae has been busy preparing dinner for the Missionaries.  They
were a little late leaving their last appointment, so didn’t get here until
almost 7:30PM.  The new Elder is Elder Bills from Provo.  After dinner Elder
Ray and Elder Bills sang a Hymn and we had prayer.  They left as they had one
more appointment this evening.  Mae and I set out side in the cool for a few

2AM and finally got up.  I am very confused about the harvesting on the
Sabbath.  I can’t talk to Lee about it.  When I talk to Elder Shaw he tells me
that I need to just let it go and that is the same thing that Mae tells me.  I
don’t know how to do that.  At this point prayer and reading the Book of Mormon
hasn’t relieved my feelings.  Elder Estes hasn’t acknowledged my e-mail to
him.  I feel very frustrated and confused as to what to do.  When I went to
work there was a almond conveyer loading trucks that blocked the roadway so I
had to detour thru the orchards to get to the Kimberlina house.  Sister Estes
called me and said that Elder Estes was out of town and would return my call in
a couple of days.  Elder Shaw and I blow 53 bags of insulation into the attic. 
We had originally purchased 38 bags but ran out so I went to the Home Depot in
Delano and bought 15 more and it took all of that.  I returned the blower to
Home Depot and purchased some more painting materials.  It was after 5:30PM
when I got home.  Mae had a very nice dinner ready and while eating we watched
the movie “Imitation of Life”.  We had seen it before but it was a long time
ago and we still enjoyed it.  I showered and shaved before entering this

house.  Elder Shaw painted door and window trim along with other areas where
brush work is needed.  I continued to mask in preparation for spraying.  At
11:30 Lee came and got elder and Sister Shaw and myself and took us to see the
pistachio harvest.  All the workers had stopped for lunch so Lee, Kim, Elder
Shaw, Sister Shaw and I went to lunch at a restaurant in Shafter.  I ordered a
salad and it came out on a large dinner platter.  It was an enjoyable time to
visit.  We then went back to the orchard and watched the harvesting.  I asked
Lee a few questions about the pistachio, such as the comparability in value and
prophet difference of pistachios and almonds.  He said they are about the same
but the pistachios take five years before you can harvest after planting
instead of three with the almonds.  Elder and Sister Shaw had not seen the
harvesting where as Mae and I have seen the harvest since the 4<sup>th</sup> of
September.  Elder Shaw and I then went back to work.   It was after 4:30PM when
we quite for the day and went home.  Mae finished up diner preparations while I
showered and cleaned up.  Mae had washed the car today and she saw that the
right rear window was down a little.  When she tried to put it up it dropped
completely down and wouldn’t close.  I will have to look at it tomorrow.  We
went to a social at the ward this evening.  I wasn’t really enthused to go but
it turned out ok.   After getting home Mae and I watched the movie “Bullet Without
a Name” with Audie Murphy staring in it.  It was after 11PM when we got to bed.</span></p>

her children came.  They were to meet some friends here as their friends wanted
to see the pistachio harvest.  After they left I went to work on the car.  I
was not able to fix the window so that it would open and close but got it
closed and locked closed.   I sure have enjoyed being home with Mae but she
will be going with Sister Shaw to the Relief Society General Conference.  I
watched “Rooster Cogburn and the Lady” and played a couple of games on the
computer while she was gone.  When she got home we entered today’s entries in
our journals before going to bed.  Mae has started to writing in her journal so
that is giving us competition for the computer but I guess we will work it
out.  I think it is neat that she is starting to make a daily entry.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I woke at 5:45AM so
let Mae sleep until the alarm went off at 6:30 AM.  We were getting ready for
meetings and since today is our Fast Sunday is today we didn’t need to prepare
breakfast.  After getting my shirt and tie on I realized that I had forgotten
to shave so had to start over.  Before leaving for church Mae asked if we could
go back to the Bakersfield East Stake building to check for our camera.  I
called one of the Ward Bishops offices in the building to see if the camera had
been turned in but no such luck.  Meetings went fairly normal.  We had as high
as 12 children in the nursery today but it went quite well.  Mae and I stopped
at Brother Manuel Macias home to visit them but no one was home.  I left a copy
of the “A Proclamation to the World&quot; in Spanish on their door with a note
to encourage them to read it.  We haven’t been able to do much for this
Brother.  We stopped at home long enough to get our GPS and then drove to the
Bakersfield East Stake Building.  There was few still there but we were able to
visit with one Bishopric but didn’t have any luck finding our camera.  </span></p>

that the equipment yard was locked up and all of the farms equipment seemed to
be there.  Lee had told me that they were about finished with the first pass
and now had to check to see if there are enough left nuts to make it worth
going back for a second pass.  It was good to see the equipment idle on the
Sabetha Day for whatever the reason.  At 6PM the crews were back and were out
in the orchards again.  I put the last CD of the “On Sacred Ground” by Truman
G. Madsen and watched that.  I fell asleep at the end of the program and Mae
let me sleep.  We visit with David’s family and Sandi by phone.  David said
that he is still having trouble with his leg.  He feels that the Doctor wrapped
his leg to tight and it shut the circulation of and damaged the nerves.  David
is afraid that he may have problems the rest of his life from it.  Sandi and
Nick are having difficulty over the pup that Nick has.  It is sure hard to know
that your children are having problems and there isn’t much you can do except
pray for them.  Mae prepared us some fruit and toast and then I added to the
monthly report.  I re-watched the last of the Truman Madsen CD that I slept
through.  It was only a few minutes of it.  That has been a very interesting
and informative series to play.  Mae worked more on the report while I got
ready for bed.  After going to bed we talked for a while about our children,
wondering what we might do to help them.  Mae said that David had told her
about a book they had read that described the possible way that with the modern
tech knowledge this nation could be destroyed.  It doesn’t sound very far off
from what I am afraid is coming.  I just wish David could realize that
scriptures has warned us of this for a long time. </span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I woke late as I had
set the clock wrong.  Mae didn’t sleep very well last night so I let her sleep
in and got myself off to work.  Mae had prepared my lunch and all I had to do
was to put it in my lunch box.  She is sure a special wife and sweetheart.  Elder
Shaw and I work all day still preparing for painting.  I stopped on the way
home and got some cool whip for tonight as we are having Family Home Evening at
our place.  I showered and shaved and by the time I finished Mae had dinner
ready.  After dinner I took a nap.  We enjoyed having the Shaw’s here this
evening.  I made this entry and then we went to bed.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I woke a little
before the alarm went off so I shut it off and set in the recliner.  Mae soon
woke and realized that I wasn’t in bed so she got up to see where I was.  By
then it was time to get up anyway.  I went to work and Mae and Sister Shaw went
to Bakersfield shopping.  While there Mae bought us a new camera.  Lee came by
this morning and gave Elder Shaw and me a hand with the masking.  I had already
got all the doors washed and ready to paint.   After lunch we started painting
inside the house and got the master bedroom, a bathroom and the laundry room
painted before we quite for the day.  Mae got home just before I did so I
helped carry things into the house.  While she was finishing up dinner I
showered and shaved.  Mike called us just to talk for a few minutes.  It was
good to talk to him.  The Elders came for dinner this evening and we always
enjoy having them.  I helped Mae do the dishes and then worked on this entry. 
We were tired but at 8:30PM we decided to watch one of the “Big Valley”
series.  I finished this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                Although I set the
alarm for 6AM, I woke at 5AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so stayed up.  Mae
soon got up and felt that she needed to get started as she is working at the
grade school today instead of Friday.  She made pancakes for breakfast and they
were very good.  I helped Mae with the dishes before I left for work.  Elder
Shaw and I finished the hand painting and then started on the spray painting. 
It wasn’t long when we realized that we didn’t have enough paint so elder Shaw
went to home depot to get another 5 gallons.  I continued to paint and was
afraid that at the rate of paint usage that we might still be short.  I called
Home Depot and talked to the Paint Department and told them that Elder Shaw was
coming for the 5 gallons of paint but to have him get 10 gallons instead.  My thoughts
were that if he brought 10 then we were safe and it we didn’t need it now we
could use it on the home and duplex.  When Elder Shaw got back we finished the
inside and then painted the doors.  We finished the doors and then had to clean
up the paint pump.  It was 4:45PM when we finished and went home, both of us
were very tired.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got home so I just washed
up the best I could.  My hands we badly covered with paint.  We put on a movie
to watch while we ate our dinner.  It was a different movie but an oldie.  I
showered and shaved and spent quite a while scrubbing my hands.  I made this
entry and we read some of the instructions on our new camera before we went to
bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I woke early and
slept in the recliner for a while.  After breakfast I worked on my financial
report and am missing one receipt.  Mae and I had an appointment to meet with
Merrill Dibble this morning at 9AM.  He visited with us for about an hour.  Mae
came back home and I went to the Kimberlina home.  Elder Shaw and I removed all
the taping and gathered up all the trash.  Elder Shaw left at noon as they are
going to San Diego for the weekend.  I emptied the trash into the dumpster
along with cleaning up some other things.  I brought all the doors in side and
stood them up to finish drying.  I didn’t want them left outside over the
weekend.  I came home a few minutes after 2PM and on the way home it rained.  This
is the first rain we have seen since the end of March.  After showering and
shaving I made some almond butter.  Mae had most things packed so we left for
Fresno before 4PM.  When we got to Fresno I installed a new toilet for Roy and
Linda.  When I started to fill the water closet we found that it was cracked. 
Roy will have to take it back for replacement.  It was after 10PM when we got
to bed.</span></p>
