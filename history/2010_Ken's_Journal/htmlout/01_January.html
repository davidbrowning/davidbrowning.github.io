<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
welcoming the New Year in we finished watching the movie.  It was 2AM before we
got to bed.  I woke about 6:30 AM, read my scriptures, shaved and showered.  My
ear is still hurting so Mae put more drops onto my ears.  I went back to sleep
for a while and then Mae woke me for breakfast.  In as much as Mae and I are
going home, our families will not be together for my birthday nor for Roy’s
birthday, so Mae and Shellie felt that Roy and I should open our Birthday Gifts
now.  It seems that somehow Roy and I both received the book “Temples of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints”, produced by Thunder Bay Press. 
It is a beautifully produced photo collections of all the Temples that have
been dedicated from the St. George Temple, dedicated April 6, 1877 to the Drape
Utah Temple, dedicated March 20, 2009.  Roy and his neighbor -------
administered to me for relief from the discomfort I am experiencing with my
ear. Roy and the boys then left for a Seymore family reunion and will be gone
until tomorrow around noon.  Mae and Shellie went for a walk and shopping.  I
took some Ibuprofen for my ear ach and took a nap.  Mae has also been getting
things packed up to go home.  Shellie and I played a board game which Shellie
won.  For dinner this evening I grilled rabbit and sweet potatoes while Shellie
and Mae prepared the rest.  After cleaning up the three of us played Rummy
Cube.  We each won a game and then we came downstairs and watched a movie. 
Even though the edit program removed language and nudity seines I still thought
it was a dumb show with pour taste.  After the movie we cleaned up and then
visited for quite a while.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
shortly after 4 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I read my scriptures and
caught my journal up, letting Mae sleep longer.  With Roy and the boys gone
Shellie could have slept in but she got up and had breakfast with us.  I got
things packed into the truck and we left about 10AM for home.  We stopped into
Phoenix to get natural gas.  I had called the natural gas company to find out
where a filling station was located.  I had tried to find out a location
through the internet, but couldn’t find anything that way.  We had to go out of
the way to find the one given to us by the CNG co.  When we got there, it is a
total different filling nozzle and would not work on my truck.  We drove on
using regular gas.  Even with that we did some chasing around just finding a
filling station.  Once we left Phoenix we drove on thru to Kanab with only two
potty stops.  After getting to Judy Giles we took her out to eat at a Chinese
restaurant and just enjoyed the dinner and visiting.  We went back to Judy’s
and watched a Jazz bale game.  That was a disappointment.  We got to bed fairly
early this evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6AM and got up.  After reading my scriptures I took my shower.  Mae was up
shortly after that.  We got ready to attend Sacrament meeting with Judy.  We
enjoyed the meting and most of the testimonies.  As in most Wards there are
children that need to be taught the purpose of Testimony.  Some of then were
very sincere and most of the Testimonies were very appropriate and inspiring. 
We drove to Panguitch where we stopped for a Sub-Way Sandwich.  Another stop in
Fillmore for CNG and then stopped in Provo to see Mike and his family for a few
minutes.  It was about 5:30PM when we got home.  I drove into the back yard and
unloaded our things.  After removing the weight from the pickup I was stuck.  I
decided to just let it wait there until tomorrow.  I will take the car to work
in the morning and get the truck out when I come home.  We talked to all our
family to let them know that we got home ok.  We set an appointment with Bishop
Smith to turn in our mission papers, on Wednesday evening.  Mae tried to get
through all the mail that had came while we were gone, but didn’t make it.  I
filled out my journal entry and I think we will try to get to bed early
tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and got up before 3AM.  I slept some in the recliner
after that.  My morning bus run went well.  I had a sub-assistant this
morning.  When I got home I took care of the chickens and rabbits.  The young
doe had eight kits and they seem to be doing well.  I put tire chains on the
pickup and drove it right out of the back yard.  I took a nap before lunch and
then took my afternoon run.  It went on except that Tyler had a bad day.  Two
teacher aids rode home with us just in case Tyler got out of hand but it went
ok.  I did appreciate the aids being with us.  This evening Mae had a nice
dinner and we relaxed for the evening and watched a DVD.  Well that was our
plans but Bob needed my help so I went upstairs and help him move a bed and
then he said that a man was bringing a new bed shortly.  We didn’t want to get
involved in a show and then get called away.  It got late and with work
tomorrow we decided against start a movie.  Bob later called and said the fellow
didn’t need my help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and spent most of the night in the recliner.  My
morning run went well.  I met with Janice in payroll for an orientation as to
the pay and bidding system that I know fall under.  That took over an hour. 
When I got home Bob and Mae were trying to repair the new chicken water tank. 
Bob and I drove to CAL Ranch and bought a new and better unit.  Mae had lunch
ready when I got back and Scott was here so I ate lunch with them.  I then set
the water tank up for the chickens before I left for my afternoon run.  That
run also went well.  I came home and Bob and I took the pickup load of Mark’s
junk to the dumps.  That gave me enough time to eat dinner with Mae before Mae and
I went to the Family History Center.  I didn’t get much accomplished this
evening as I was too tired.  We had a young couple come into the center and in
five minutes he could use the New Family Search program so good that he
latterly was running circles around me after being in this calling almost a
year.  When we got home I filled out this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My runs went
well today.  Between runs I feed the animals and thought I could relax and take
a nap.  I called the phone co. to clear up a $200.00 charge on Bob’s phone bill
that indicated it was for canceling the internet service.  Bob has never had
internet service on his phone.  When Bob and I changed our services for the
telephones, the dish TV reception and our high speed internet to Qwest, it has
been a real night-mare.  I was on the phone for 1 ½ hours and after they could
not find a reason for the charge, they said that they would give us credit for
the $200.00 on the next bill.  I did eat my lunch while I was on hold so when I
finished talking to the phone representative, I did take a nap for a few
minutes.  I had to hurry to get to the afternoon run.  This evening I checked
the animals and helped Bob for a few minutes.  Bob gave me a letter that Mark
sent to me.  It contained a check for four hundred dollars for the money that
Bob and I put out on a new motor for the rotor-tiller.  He then proceeded to
put the blame on me for him not checking the oil on the tiller before he used
it and burned up the motor.  Mae and I were also to blame for the reasons that
Bob asked him to move, and he itemized the money that we should have been
charged for his work in the garden, and the work he did to take care of Mother
and how we charged Aunt Vida for expenses while she lived here.  I really could
not believe the insinuations that Mark made about me.  Oh well, I hope things
work out for him.  Mae and I went over to meet with Bishop Smith and turned in
our papers.  Bishop went from his office to the office of President Mitchell. 
However President Mitchell wasn’t there so he talked to President Erickson. 
Bishop then came over to our house to visit with us.  They have questions as to
how to handle the money that will come from Uncle Dale’s estate.   He will
continue to check it out and we will check with Bryce and with Diane.  Mae
talked to Bryce and Deanna and they said that it did go through their ward, so
they gave us the ward clerk’s number and we tried to call him.  He was not at
home so I just left a message and ask if he would call us back.  Mae still has
lots of questions and concerns.   She had me give her a Priesthood blessing but
we were interrupted before I completed the blessing and had to cut it short.  Bishop
Smith came by to tell us that he had talked to President Erickson and they
didn’t know how to work the money at this point.  He also visited us about
Mark.  After Bishop Smith left we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Morning run
went well and after the run I attended a meeting for all Special Ed. Bus
Drivers and assistance.  It was quite informative on the subject of seizures.  I
came home but Mae had already taken care of the chickens and rabbits.  I did
get time for a short nap before lunch and then went back for the afternoon
run.  When we picked the youth up from school the teachers said that we could
be in for some problems as they had several during the day.  They sent two aids
home with us today.  Shortly after we left the school Tyler got out of his seat
harness.  It took both aids and my assistant LeAnn to get him strapped back
down.  When we got him home and both aids were trying to get him off the bus,
he jumped and hit me in the mouth with his fist and at the same time kicked
LeAnn in the stomach.  Neither of us was hurt much but just really surprised. 
After getting home I checked the rabbits, added feed to the chicken feeders and
gave them more water as Mae couldn’t open the water tank earlier when she fed
them.  Mae has been cleaning up Christmas decorations most of the day and the
house was looking very nice when I returned.  Mae and I took eggs over to Good
Earth and bought some bread and cereal.  We went to Wal-Mart’s for a few items
and then went to Chuck-A-Rama for dinner.  We stopped at Bed-Bath and Beyond to
look for a bath set.  I realized that I didn’t have my Browning Cap, so I went
back to the restraint and found it.  We were tired when we got home so I made
this entry and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The morning
run went well.  I stopped after the run to see about a bus for tomorrow’s field
trip run and Roberta said that she needed to visit with me about the run.  The
High school should have put in for an over-night run, but it got bid as two
runs.  Therefore I will drive an empty bus up and get the wrestling team at the
motel in Logan and take them to Smithfield, plus any transportation they need
up there and when they are finished return them back to Bountiful High School. 
I can take my bus so I can take it home today and leave from my house.  When I got
home Mae prepared some eggs and toast for breakfast and then I took care of the
animals.  Bob brought a phone bill down for an internet service.  I called and
could not find why as the service was no longer in use.  After I hung up things
began to come together.  Mark had put High Speed internet into his room.  He
then had it disconnected when he move and left the billing onto the house phone
service, which explains the $200.00 billing on my phone bill.  I now need to
get back to the phone co. and get this whole thing straightened out and the
billing charged to Mark.  I have also got to write Mark a letter and challenge
him as to the accusations he made to my integrity.  After I finished the
afternoon run, I filled my bus and got it ready for tomorrow.  I then went in
and visited with Sherrie about my route and put in for some route changes.  I
brought the bus home with me and left my truck at the bus compound.  I checked
the chickens and rabbits and then had dinner.  We are trying to get ready to
leave early in the morning and get to bed early tonight.  We did take Marks
check and deposit it.  While doing so I had them clear the check right then so
that I know it was a good check.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
3AM to leave with the bus at 4:45AM.  We made it to the motel in Logan by 6AM
and the wrestling team was ready to go to Sky View high school where each boy
weighed in for the tournament.  We then returned them to the motel to check out
and eat breakfast.  We had brought our own breakfast so we went out to the bus
and ate it while we were waiting for them.  We took the team back to the school
and then Mae and I went back to town as the team will be in competition until
3PM or later.  We stopped at IMF to see if they handled egg cartons but they
didn’t.  We spent a while just shopping there as it was warm.  We next went to
Kmart and parked in there lot and slept for a little while but it was cooled
and not very comfortable.  We then went to Golden Corral at their breakfast
special.  After eating we stayed and played cards at their table.  It was warm
and more comfortable and we enjoyed playing cards together.  I beat Mae at
Rummy and Mae beat me at Knock.  We went back to the school and watched some of
the tournament.  I then took a short nap and Mae read more in her book.  It was
about 5PM when we got the team back to Bountiful High and about 6:30PM by the
time we took the bus to the compound and got home.  I went out and checked the
animals while Mae got us something to eat.  We called Bishop Smith when we got
home and he asked if we would make an appointment with President Mitchell and
visit with him about the money.  We called Bishop Wheaton and made an
appointment for 10:45 AM tomorrow.  Before going to bed I asked Bob if he would
like to cook fish for breakfast.  I said he would so I took him three filet
trout and some hamburger to make gravy out of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 5AM
concerned with the mission money.  I was afraid that I couldn’t go back to
sleep so I went into the front room.  I knelt and pleaded with my Father in
Heaven for his guidance.  After I lay in the recliner and though thoughts were
continuously going through my mind, I slept until 8AM.  Bob fried the fish and
made biscuits and gravy for us for breakfast.  It was really a good breakfast. 
I fed the rabbits and chickens and then got ready for our appointment with
President Mitchell.  Mae also went with me.  We had a good visit with him and
he will check the handling of the money with Salt Lake and let us know tomorrow
as to what he finds out.  We attended meetings on the new block time change. 
After Priesthood meeting I visited with Brother Kelly Bodily about the chickens
and rabbits and told him that it is likely that Mae and I will go on another
mission.  Brother Thompson also asked me about Mark.  As he is our Home Teacher
I confided quite a bit of information as to the feelings and problems we have
experienced.  I also gave Bishop Smith the letter that Mark had sent to me.  He
later read it and then stopped at our place on his way home.  I suggested that
I totally ignore the letter and run it through the shredder and suggested that
I view it being sorry for him and the position that he has made for himself. 
Scott and his family came over at 5PM for dinner and we enjoyed the evening
with them.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
with me and got my breakfast.  My bus would not heat up this morning and yet
the temperature gage would clime almost to the top and then in a minute or two
would drop back down.  After taking the youth to the school I called and
reported the problem to the shop.  I was told to bring the bus in to the shop
so they could check it.  When I came home I took care of the animals.  I also
put my tire chains on Bob’s pickup and used it to take the Christmas
decorations out to the shed.  I got just a short nap before taking the
afternoon run.  I went back into the shop a little early to check the bus. 
They had to install a new radiator cap and fill the coolant.  When I got home
from the afternoons run I again took care of the animals and then entered some
time into the payroll and also bid on a couple of extra runs.  We then ate
dinner and after that I entered my journal.  We watched the DVD “Christmas
Shoes” that Shellie’s family gave us and it is really a good story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3AM but cuddled up with my sweetheart and sure slept good until the alarm went
off.  I let Mae sleep in.  My assistant did not show up by 7:38AM so I called
her and woke her.  The alarm hadn’t gone off.  She said she would meet ne in
route so I left.  I picked her up at the third stop but we made it being just a
few minutes late at the school.  When I got home Mae fixed a morning break
snack and then I took care of the animals.  Yesterday Bob and Carroll had
bought an electronic air filter for the furnace and the technician came and
installed it.  I took a nap before we had lunch and I took the PM route.  This
afternoons run went better.  This evening Mae and I went to the Family History
Center.  I worked on our lesson for Sunday.  When we got home I filled in this
entry while Mae made us a snack before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had
miss-set my alarm but I woke before 5:30 AM anyway.  I woke Mae by 6:30AM and
she had breakfast ready for us by the time I shaved and showered.  Mae went to
work at the Deseret Industries in 445 Wall Avenue as a volunteer for 4 hours
this morning.  My run went well and I got home in good time.  I took care of
the animals and then made a phone call to Qwest concerning the $200 charge for
the early disconnect of Mark’s internet.  I told her that I could give her
Mark’s address but she said that it has already been written off and if she
reinstalled it, the bill would again go to Bob.  Mark had put Bob’s name on the
bill when he ordered the service.  I thanked her for her understanding.  I next
called on the HP online computer service.  The technician had me turn the
computer over to his control and then I got me something to eat and took a nap. 
About an hour later the technician call me and returned control of the computer
back to me and said that all the problems should now be eliminated.  Mae got
home about 12:4PM and changed and then left to go Visiting Teaching.  My
afternoon run went well.  I thought that we might go looking for a new lap top
computer but our desk top computer would not make connection with internet
server so I had to get back on with a technician from H.P. and have them do
more work on it.  Bob and I went Home Teaching this evening.  We visited with
Brother Casey and then a long visit with Patriarch and Sister Johnston.  It was
too late to stop and see if we could visit with Sister Fallis.  It was getting
late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up and
prepared breakfast for us.  My bus runs went quite well except when we got to
Nicholas’s and went to turn around in the school faculty parking.  There were
four cars parked in my way unloading children.  Two of them were left empty and
it looked like the driver had taken the children into the school.  By the time
a couple of cars moved so I had room, other cars had come into the parking lot
behind my bus and let their children out.  The children ran through parked cars
and in front and behind my bus.  I was really nervier watching children and
cars and was very happy when I got out of the lot.  When I got back to the bus
compound I went in and talked to Rosa about the incident and what could be done
to make it safer.  We considered the situation and Rosa suggested that we try
starting the route five minutes earlier and see if that gets us out of the area
before parents start bringing their children.  When I got home I took care of
the animals, ate a snack, and wrote up a time schedule for the student pick up. 
I got a call from Elder Bretzing asking us if we could respond to a call to go
to Bakersfield California on the 1<sup>st</sup> of March.  I told him that we
could.  He said that the decision was up to the Presiding Bishopric, and that
he was just doing the leg work.  I did get a few minutes to take a short nap
before going back in for the afternoon run.  This afternoon run went well and
was quite short as we only had two students to take home.  Mae and I ate some
dinner, took a Birthday card to Bob, and then went shopping for a lap-top
computer.  We bought a Hulet Packard lap-top computer.  When we got home I
entered this journal entry and Mae filled out a survey on the purchase we made
this evening.  We were going to run through our lesson for Sunday, but ran out
of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well because I was thinking of all we need to do before we leave for
this mission call.  The frustrating thing is that we don’t know if the call
will be made yet.  It is like waiting for Christmas Day to arrive when you
can’t sleep Christmas Day.  Mae is willing but not really happy about it. 
There was a lot of fog in the area this morning but the run went quite well
anyway.  After the run, I went over to Green’s and bought some chicken feed.  I
next went to the service station and got fuel for my pickup.  While I was there
I got a car wash.  I came home and fed my animals.  I talked to Bryce about his
1996 Buick.  He will have a transmission installed in it and we will talk
price.  I just had time to eat and go for the afternoon run.  That run went
well.  Mae wasn’t home when I got home.  She stopped after leaving Georgia’s
and picked up the new computer and a second instructors book on the Family
History class that we are to teach starting Sunday.  I did get the computer to
start up and Mae found out how to shut it down.  We did get the DVD player to
work and we started to study for our lesson when <br>
Sandy called and said that the dinner was ready.  We quit and went to their
place.  They had made a bean soup and a tossed salad.  After eating the four of
us played a game of Canasta.  At first Sandy and Mae were really pulling a head
but then Irven and I had three good hands and won the game.  I filled out my
journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Neither Mae
nor I slept very well last night, thinking of the mission call, wondering where
we are to go and what do we need to get ready to go.  After breakfast I took
care of the animals.  I really hate to get rid of our chickens and rabbits but
I don’t know what else to do with them.  I went over to Irven and Sandy’s and
worked on their distiller.  Mae cleaned house.  Mae and I went to Kylan’s
basketball game so support him.  After the game we went over to Scott and
Mishelle’s where  we told them of our mission call.  Kylan and Ashley were in
tears and felt bad that we will be leaving.  Mae went up to Kylan’s room and
comforted and explained to them of our love for the Lord and so we need to
accept this call, but it would only be for 1 year.  Kylan said “But you won’t
be here for my birthday.”  Mae told him that we were having a big family
birthday party on Grandpa’s birthday, Feb. 27<sup>th</sup>, and they would get
their birthday gifts there.  She spent some time with them hugging them and
helping them.  Finally they felt some better.   Scott and Mishelle were very
supportive.  Mishelle was about in tears too because she loves us and likes to
be with us.  That sure makes us feel good that our children love us and want to
be with us.  We came home and worked on our lesson for tomorrow.  At 6PM we
went to a basket ball game that Tyler played in.  After the game we invited
David and his family to come over to our place for something to eat and some
ice cream.  David helped us with our new computer.  We told David, Shauna and
the children about our mission call.  We were a little surprised that they took
it so well.  We had also called Mike and told him of the call.  We were going
to go down and visit with Mike and Becky but they are leaving for a long week end
to Los Vegas – just the two of them.  We will go out to Tooele and visit with
Sandi and Nick on Monday.  We also will visit with Jeff and Gail tomorrow. 
After David and Shauna left I worked on our Family History lesson.  I also
tried to switch my journal from our old lap-top computer to our new lap-top.  I
have some learning to do.  It was almost mid-night when we went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6:30AM.  After reading my scriptures, having morning prayers and doing some stretch
exercises, I started playing with my new lap-top.  I was able to move my
journals over and start this new entry.  Mae got up shortly after 8AM.   Mae
prepared breakfast while I shaved.  After breakfast I fed the animals.  We then
worked on our Family History lesson and I worked on our new computer.  I tried
to set up a short cut to my journal but instead lost this year’s file.  Church
meetings started at 1PM so we were there a little early so that we could check
out the room for our Family History class.  We checked with Brother Higley
about the student lesson manuals and found that they weren’t there.  We will
have to wing it without them.  Our lesson went fairly well but we were
disappointed not to have the manuals.  Mae had put a roast on to cook while we
were at Church.  When we got home from Church we got things ready to go to
Jeff’s.  I gathered the eggs and gave water to the rabbits.  We then drove over
to Jeff and Gales, taking the roast with us.  Jeff had made a tossed salad,
vegetables and mashed potatoes.  Mae made gravy at their house.  After dinner
we told Jeff and Gale about our mission call.  We also played a couple of
games.  Jeff and I also worked on the computer for a little while getting my
journal back in the file where it belonged.  It was after 10PM when we left. 
Jeff is visible upset that we are leaving for a mission.  When we got home I
entered the rest of this entry.  It’s late so we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The phone
woke us at 6:30AM by Sandy calling as she wanted to catch me before I went on
my bus run.  She didn’t realize that I the day off because of Black Day (Martin
Luther King).  We didn’t go back to sleep so got up and started the day.  After
breakfast I fed the rabbits and chickens.  David brought Tyler, Emily and
Connor for Mae to tend as Shauna had to work and David had to fly to Phoenix on
business.  Mae and the kids tried slaying on the hill at the park but came home
when Tyler took a fall and got hurt.  Not too serious but it took the fun out
of the sledding.  They played a lot of table games.  I worked on the new
computer trying to learn how it worked.  This afternoon I went to Irven and
Sandy’s and finished the repairs on their distiller and I put a cabinet latch
on a china hutch that Dug had given them for Christmas.  Mae and I then went
out to Sandi’s.  When Nick got home we went out to eat at Applebee’s.  As I was
trying to select something from the menu the waitress had the manager come out
and he had a special meal prepared for me by the chef.  Nick paid for our meal. 
When we got back to Sandi and Nick’s we played a game of marbles before going
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did sleep
in and when we got up Sandi, Mae and I had breakfast.  Nick had already gone to
work.  Mae and I got back to our place about 10:30AM.  Mae started preparing
for lunch; I took care of the animals.  Scott and Jeff came for lunch with us. 
We sure enjoyed having then for even a few minutes.  I spent time working on
the new lap-top, getting some of the pictures transferred over so we have them
with us when and if our mission call comes through.  Mae and I took a nap this
afternoon.  Bob prepared dinner for us today.  Mae didn’t feel the best this
evening so she stayed home and I went to the Family History Center.  After
returning home I took a shower and entered two days of journal entry before
going to bed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 5AM but let Mae sleep in.  I woke her just before I left for my bus run. 
Jeff brought their children over for Mae to tend as Gale has a substitute
teaching job this morning.  My run went well and I got home about 10AM.  I took
care of the chickens and rabbits before I ate some breakfast Mae prepared for
me.  I did take a nap before my afternoon run.  The mail didn’t get here until
almost 1PM but the calls for the mission did not arrive.  The afternoon run
also went well and I was home before 4PM.  I worked on the lap-top computer
trying to get a picture down load program installed on it but it didn’t install
correctly so I will have to get some help.  After dinner this evening I did
more computer work.  Bishop Smith, Brother Higley and our Stake High Councilman
assigned to our Ward came visiting this evening.  Bishop said that they wanted
to visit us before we left so they felt they should come this evening.  We just
enjoyed their visit and appreciated Bishop Smith’s prayer before they left. 
Irven called and we visited for a few minutes about Doug and Chris.  They are
having some business problems that are affecting their friendship.  I sure hope
they can work it out.  I worked on the computer and became very frustrated.  I
had started a word document with a write up on the rabbits and chickens to put
on KSL.COM but then I couldn’t get it to save.  I am sure that it is very easy
but I nor Mae could get it to save.  I finally got upset and just closed the
computer and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:15AM and let Mae sleep until after 6AM.  Mae then got up and prepared my
breakfast.  My morning run went well and I got home before 10AM.  After feeding
the animals I went out to check the mail.  It hadn’t came but the news paper
was there so I took it to Bob and Carroll.  They had a salesman there and
wanted me to stay and see what he had.  He was selling new vinyl windows.  His
produce did look good but then I had to leave to get a short nap and eat before
my afternoon run.  This afternoon run went well and we finished early.  The bus
wash was open so I took the bus through it.  We have two possible sells for
some chickens.  We still have no idea as to where or when the mission call is
for.  This evening after dinner we relaxed and watched a show.  We watched “Top
Gun” until we got tired of the profanity, vulgarity, sex and the using of the
Lord’s name in vain.  The show was rated PG in error and should have been rated
garbage.  We did enjoy being together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Up again at
5AM and off to work with Mae’s helped with breakfast.  The morning run went
well.  After the run I went over to Irven and Sandy’s and disassembled the
drain valve to their water distiller. I then went to Durk’s and bought a
replacement for the old valve.   This valve was made of brass instead of
plastic as was the one I removed.  I came home and took care of the chickens
and rabbits.  Mae was on the phone with Qwest for almost 1 ½ hours about our
billing.  She was very upset and it really upset me.  I called Doug Durbano’s
law office and his secretary gave me a few suggestions.  At 4PM Paul Tayler
came and purchased eight hens and paid me $50.00 for them.  Mae and I then went
to Dr Toone’s in Bountiful and he gave me a treatment for my back pain.  The
adjustment took affect almost immediately and most of the pain went away.  We
met Bob and Pauline Hein at the Sizzler in Bountiful.  It was good to get
together with them and we visited for over two hours. I asked Bob if he know
anything about Larry and Tammy and explained that I had heard the possibility
that Tammy had died and Larry had taken his life.  That set the conversation
off and it was the main topic the remainder of the evening.  It was sure good
to see from them again.  On the way home it snowed heavy and made the roads
very bad from Kaysville to Clearfield.  I entered this entry and we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep the best last night and when I woke early I went back to lay down in the
recliner.  Mae got up when the alarm went off but let me sleep.  I woke and she
was getting ready to go to Kylan’s basketball game.  I told her that I was
going with her, so we ate some breakfast and went to the game.  After the game
we went to Irven’s and I repaired their distiller.  They wanted me to install an
earth quake stabilizer to their china cabinet but I will have to do some
modifications to the cabinet or find a different type of stabilizer.  We came
home and Mae went to a bridal shower for Mysha.  Gale went with Mae so Jeff and
the children stayed here.  I took them out to feed the animals and see the
bunnies.  I caught 6 hens and took them to Alan Moulhaur who paid me $20.00 for
them.  After Mae came back from the shower she went to a special county
convention to vote for a replacement for Senator Killpack who resigned after
being arrested for DUI.  Jeff, Gale and the children went home.  I set down to
watch a TV show but slept through most of it.  I did watch a show on Hallmark. 
Mae got home and watched the last part of it.  I would like to have seen the
next show but Mae told Jeff that we would go over there.  David’s family was
there so we joined then and played some games.  Before coming home I checked a
dresser drawer that was not closing all the way.  I really didn’t find the
problem but by changing it to another position it worked ok.  After entering
this journal entry we went to bed.</span></p>

until almost 8AM.  Mae had got up shortly after 7AM.  We ate some breakfast and
then took our showers.  I took care of the animals and in doing so took the
mother doe away from the kits.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner.  Bob
cooked chicken and made gravy.  We attended our meetings and then after church
we went over to Scott and Michelle’s for another dinner.  We enjoyed being with
them and Scott helped me with our laptop computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep very well so I let her sleep in a little longer but she woke before I
left for my bus route.  The route went well and we got back about 9:15AM.  I
called Mae to let her know that I was going to stop and get natural gas before
coming home.  She told me that Elder Bretzing called and said that we are being
called to serve in the farm at Bakersfield California and they want us to (and
this is what we are not sure of yet) to be there by March 1<sup>st</sup>.  Our
call will be mailed today so we should get it tomorrow.  When I got home Mae
had taken care of the animals.  My afternoon runs went well and after getting
home Bob and I went over to a window company and looked at their windows.  The
company that came the other day gave four reasons that their windows were the
best and when I checked this company’s windows they contained the same
features.  This evening we went upstairs and played Canasta with Bob and
Carroll.  Bob and I won tonight without any questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was a fairly
normal day with my runs except my assistant was off sick.  Scott and Jeff came
over for lunch.  Scott helped us with some computer questions while he was
here.  I bought a new thermostat for our fireplace and installed it.  We did
receive the official mission call today so this evening at the Family History
Center I spent my time writing an acceptance letter to the Presiding
Bishopric.  Tonight will probability be our last night at the Family History
Center as we have so much to get ready before we leave.  We are being asked to
be at the farm in Wasco California on March 1<sup>st</sup>.  It’s almost 10 PM
so we had better get to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
and fixed breakfast for me.  The run went well this morning.  I took care of
the animals when I called Elder Bretzing to see if we could check in at the
farm on the 2<sup>nd</sup> instead of the 1<sup>st</sup>.  He said it would be
no problem.  I also visited with him about some other things.  Mae had sent
President Brimhall an e-mail and let them know that we are going on another
mission.  President Brimhall asked to know Elder Bretzing’s first name.  He know
a Bretzing many years ago.  When I talked to Elder Bretzing he to remembered
Grant Brimhall.  This afternoon’s bus run went well except when I took the
Farmington exit and came to a stop at the intersection, I checked for traffic
and being clear I started through the intersection.  Jennifer called to me and
said that it was a red light.  I was too far through the intersection so went
on.  There was a highway patrolman right behind me but he just went back onto
the north bound interstate.  That was a close one.  This afternoon I worked on
the computer transferring pictures, scanned some pictures and documents to the
new laptop.  We had thought that we could go to bed early enough to watch a
show but things just took too long, we therefore took showers and went to bed. 
At 10 to 10 Bishop Smith returned a earlier call that I had made to him.  We
were sound to sleep and I was afraid that we might not go back to sleep but we
did and slept pretty well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
about the time I finished my breakfast.  My bus run went well.  I had something
to eat before taking care of the animals.  I straightened my tool trailer so it
was ready to pull out this afternoon and take to Irven’s.  Mae went to
Farmington to meet with Jackie Thompson.  The two of them spent most of the
afternoon together.  After getting home from my afternoon run I put tire chains
on the pickup and hooked onto my tool trailer.  Mae got home just as I was
doing that.  After getting the trailer out of the yard I removed the chains. 
Mae went with me to Irven and Sandy’s.  I installed earth quake straps to their
china cabinet.  We ate dinner with them and after I finished the cabinet we
played cards.  We got home about 9PM and after entering this entry we went to
bed.</span></p>

sleep very well so I was going to let her sleep in.  She woke anyway and got up
and got my breakfast.  My morning run went well and I got home before 10AM. 
When I came in the house, Mae had the bedroom door closed so I figured that she
had gone back to bed.  The phone rang and I picked it up on the first ring but
it woke Mae anyway.  It was a sales representative from Qwest asking how I
liked the services.  I took the next ½ hour letting her know how disappointed I
was in the Qwest Bundle we had purchased.  I am sure she was sorry that she had
called me by the time I finished.  I moved the trailer to the back yard.  I
wanted to put it between the rabbit pens and the boat canapé buy there wasn’t
enough room.  By the time I came in the house it was time to eat a quick bite
and go back for my afternoon run.  Mae had taken Kylan and Ashley to Dinosaur
Park for the afternoon.  I therefore stopped at the Credit Union and opened us
an account for our missionary fund.  When I got home I fed the animals and
brought in the eggs.  I filled our water bottles with distilled water and
worked on the computer, trying to transfer more files to the laptop but wasn’t
successful.  Mae stopped and bought Sub-Way sandwiches for dinner this
evening.  Scott and Mishelle brought the twins over and we tended them while
Scott and Mishelle went out for the evening.  We enjoyed the children but the
twins kept us going.  We did watch a Hall Mark show that was cute.  We watched
a DVD movie before going to bed.</span></p>

little later this morning.  I took care of the animals while Mae prepared
breakfast.  After breakfast we went over to watch Kylan play basketball.  We
made a couple of stops before going home.  I started this journal entry and
also transferred more pictures from the desk top to the lap top computer.  Time
went fast when we got home.  I did get a nap and then helped Mae vacuum the
house.  We then had to hurry and get ready to attend the Temple.  We didn’t
make the 5PM session but we had others from our Ward that was also late.  After
the session Mae and I went out to the Chuck-Wagon for dinner.  When we got home
we put a movie on and watched that.  I first started a down load of pictures,
so after the movie I stayed up and finished that down load.  It was almost 2AM
before I got to bed.</span></p>

apple sauce as Bob is having dinner at 11:30AM.  Time sure goes fast and Mae is
trying to schedule time to spend with our children before we leave.  I did get
a short nap before we went to church.  Meetings were very good.  After
Sacrament meeting I visited with Bishop Smith about the finances for our
mission.  I also visited with Sister Fallis as her home teacher.  Mae cooked a
nice dinner and Sandi and Nick came for the evening.  We played three games of
marbles after dinner and Nick and I lost all three.  After Sandi and Nick left
I took the garbage out to the curb.  I then called Elder and Sister Judd at the
South Valley Farm in Wasco, California.  We had a nice visit and found out more
as to what we are to do.  I entered my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>
