line-height:115%'>In our monthly report it asks if we have any concerns.  At
this time I have a personal concern and feel that I need to get some counsel
and advice from you, as my Director over this mission call.  I apologize that
this is my first correspondence with you since your calling to replace Elder
Britzing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:115%'>On Sunday morning, September the 12<sup>th</sup>, my wife and
I were woke up at day break with the sounds of equipment.  It took a minute for
my mind to register what was happening.  I knew that it was Sunday and suddenly
I realized that the equipment was going to the pistachio orchard to start the
harvest.  I had been told that when the pistachio harvest started it would be a
continual busyness of noises and commotion around our place.  It had not
entered my mind that it included the Sabbath.  The previous week in our Fast
and Testimony meeting I felt impressed that I should bare my testimony as to the
importance of observing the Sabbath.   All of my life I have been taught that
Sunday is the Lords day and we should not do any work on that day.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:115%'>I have tried to find out why we are harvesting on the Lords
Day and I have been given three reasons:  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>1<sup>st</sup>
- pistachios are a perishable crop.  After the fruit has been picked from the
tree it has to be processed to remove the Haul around the shell within a
relatively short period of time or the shell will be darkened which reduces its
selling value.  We have another company process the pistachios for us and they
work 24 hours a day and 7 days a week during the pistachio harvest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>2<sup>nd</sup>
- we do not have enough equipment to harvest the crop and therefore rely on
another company to help with the harvest and they work 24/7 during the
pistachio harvest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>3<sup>rd</sup>
– the longer the fruit remains on the tree after maturity the greater the
chance of damage to the fruit due to insect and disease.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:115%'> I do not want to imply that I know very much about the
raising and harvesting of pistachios and I do not know of the solutions that
have already been explored.  I realize that if the “<i>ox is in the mire we
have to pull it out”</i> but if that ox continues to get in the mire I would
either build a fence around the ox or the mire hole.  I question that after 20
+ years, if the <i>“ox in the mire”</i> is a valid excuse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:115%'>I have been told that this is not my concern and I shouldn’t
worry about it.  Would you please give me some input as to what, if anything, I
can or should do to feel peace about this matter?   We have 3,000 acres of
pistachios and about 17,000 acres of almonds.  South Valley Farms does have
their own almond processing plant and equipment to do the harvesting and I am
grateful that they do not harvest the almonds on the Sabbath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>Sincerely,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>Note:  Elder Estes
returned a call a few days later to inform me that he had taken my letter to
the presidency of Farmland Reserve and was informed that they were not aware of
scheduled work on the Sabbath.  They also assured him that if necessary they
would take the matter to the Presiding Bishopric.  I never heard another work
about the matter but the following Saturday by 6PM all equipment was in the
yard and the gates were locked and it remained that way until 6:30PM on
Sunday.  This remained the practice for the rest of the time that we served
there.</span></i></p>
