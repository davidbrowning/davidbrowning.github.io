to have stayed in bed longer but finally got up and got going.  After the
weekend with Roy and Linda we just really appreciated the love and
companionship that we have.  I wish there was something we could do to help
them.  Elder Shaw and I tapped more on the home. We quit shortly after 2PM so
that we could go to Merrill Dibbles new home and do some minor repairs for
him.   Elder and Sister Shaw was late getting to our place but we still went. 
We had to stop at Home Depot for some parts and then went to Dibbles to do the
repairs.  It was almost 7PM when we finished and left to go eat.  We went to
Sizzler’s and all of us had the salad bar.  We just had fun eating and
visiting.  It was 9:30PM when Mae and I got home.  That will put the Shaw’s
almost 10PM when they get home.  I filled out this entry and we soon went to
bed.</span></p>

get up until 6AM so we had to hurry but I got to work at eight.  We finished
the third coat and then started texturing the ceilings.  Shortly after 2PM we
got notified that the Full Time Elders needed a ride from Bakersfield to
Wasco.  I cleaned up my truck so that they would have room to ride.  Elder Ray
and his new companion Elder Isley were waiting at the Bakersfield South Stake
center when we got there.  Elder Bills new companion is Elder Garth.  Elder
Isley is a brand new missionary with this being his first assignment.  </span></p>

stressed this evening, before they came, as the Elders were late for dinner. 
It went well and Mae had a wonderful meal for them.  I helped clean up and wash
the dinner dishes.  Jeff called and visited with us for quite a while.  I sure
get homesick for the children.  I goofed (<i>again</i>) when one of the Elders
asked how Sister Browning and I met, I gave my version and that upset Mae.</span></p>

Shaw and I went to the Paramount processing plant in Lost Hills to get two
pallets of Pistachios for South Valley Farms.  We only brought Elder Shaw’s
truck as that is what I thought Lee wanted us to do.  I guess that Elder Shaw
understood that we were going with both pickups.  When we got to the Paramount
plant we had a number to call but that just went to an answering machine.  We
finally found an office and they told us to go to gate 7 and door 15.  We found
a guard gate but they couldn’t find where we should go.  He sent us looking but
that ended up a wild goose chase.  After a while we were told that we should
have gone to gate 6 and there we found door 15.  They loaded us with a fork
lift and when they put the two pallet loads on the truck I was afraid that we
should have brought both trucks.  I worried all the way back and Elder Shaw’s
driving didn’t help me any for he drove to fast and didn’t start stopping in
time.  I was glad when we got back ok.  I told Lee that I must have misunderstood
him and he asked me “Why take two trucks when one could do?”  Elder Shaw and I
spent the rest of the day texturing the ceiling and walls of the house.  We got
quite a lot done.  On the way home I stopped at the water shed at the
Kimberlina homes and got the paint we had stored there.  Also on the way home I
stopped and took pictures of the cotton harvesters picking a cotton field.  I
showered before we ate dinner.  We watched two episodes of Wanted Dead or Alive
and then a John Wayne movie.  I filled out this entry while Mae fixed my lunch
for tomorrow.  I upset Mae again this evening because I asked her if she had
decided about sending Pistachios home to the kids for Christmas.  That didn’t
go over very well.  Good night!</span></p>

difficulties reading Isaiah and with the problems I am having with Mae I was
greatly depressed today.  Elder Shaw and I loaded the excess sheetrock and took
it out to storage at the Sherwood farm.  We then went to Home Depot and got materials
for the houses.  We start texturing the house again but had to quit for the
monthly birthday party.  When we returned we finished the texturing of the
house before quitting for the day.  Mae had written me a note and left it on
the seat of my truck.  She is so good to me and I fear that I am not good
enough for her.  I stopped at Floyd’s and got a billing corrected before going
home.  Mae had dinner ready when I got there.  I was so tired that I took a nap
before taking my shower.  After showering I lay on the floor using the Chee
machine.  Mae read me some reports on foods.  We played two games of Rummy and
Mae won both of them.  I filled out this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

before I got to work and asked if I would go into Lowe’s and purchase a toilet
flush handle and install it in the women’s rest room at the office.  Elder Shaw
and I figured the material that we will need to build frames for the windows in
the house and duplex.  I came home and changed into some more suitable clothes
to go to town in.  I picked up the window materials at home depot.  I then went
to Best Buy and Wall-Mart and looked at speaker sets for our computer.  I
bought the one from Wall-Mart.  Next I went to Lowe’s and found the flush
handle Lee wanted me to buy.  I also bought a toilet seat and vanity sink
handle set for our place.  I unloaded the window material at the Kimberlina
shop and got some water for our house for our place before returning to the
plant.  I repaired the toilet for the women’s rest room and then did some more
measuring for the windows so the Monday morning Elder Shaw and I could build
the frames.  I came home and tried to hook up the speakers to the computer but
couldn’t get very much volume from then.  I hooked it to the DVD player and to
the TV and got very good sound out of it.  Mae came home from volunteering at
the grade school and setting up quilting frames at the church about the time I
was testing the speakers.  We watched the show “Hang Them High” staring Quant
Eastwood.  We had seen that show once before but didn’t remember it very well. 
It was a good movie.  We went out to eat in Shafter at the Chinese restraint. 
We should have reversed the dinner and the show and I think we would have both
slept better.</span></p>

almost 8AM but Mae had been up for some time.  Mae had breakfast ready and was
putting up her hair.  After eating Mae went to the church for a Relief Society
Super Saturday activity day.  I worked around the house getting the dishes
washed, washing and drying the linen on our bed, replacing the bathroom sink
faucet and making the bed.  I found that the toilet seat didn’t need to be
replaced but just locked into place.  Mae got home about 2:30PM from the
church.  Sherry had just called Mae to tell her that Carroll was in the
hospital.  Bruce called a short time later to tell us of Carroll.  It doesn’t
sound very good.  She had collapsed while at the chiropractors this morning and
Bob took her into the McKay hospital.  They operated on her to stop a blood clout
from reaching her heart or brain.  I called all of our children to let them
know as it sounds quite serious.  Time went fast but we got several things
taken care of.  The Shaw’s came over this evening and we played games of Mormon
bridge.  Irven called to let us know that the operation ok and Carroll was out
of immediate danger.  We watched a movie on DVD that Elder and Sister Shaw
brought.  It was a cute show about missionary experiences.  After they left
about 9PM, I corrected the clocks as tomorrow we come off day light savings
time.  It was still after 10PM when we got to bed.</span></p>

being Fast Sunday we had plenty of time to get ready for Church.  We were told
that it rain quite hard in Wasco last night, we didn’t see any evidence that it
had rained here in Shafter.  When we got to the church house we set up for our
nursery class and then went into the chapel for choir practice.  We enjoyed the
Sacrament meeting and the spirit that was there.  As we left the chapel both
Mae and I had a child holding our hand to go to the nursery class.  We love the
children but by the time the two hours are over we are beat.  We had 12
children today and they were full of it.  When we got home we lay down and took
a nap.  Anyway I did as soon after we lay down David called to see how Carroll
is doing.  Mae got up to answer the phone and she talked to David and all the
children until I woke up.  We got us some dinner and after doing up the dishes
I put on a couple of church DVD.  Between the two movies I called Bob to see
how Carroll is doing.  He had just got home from the hospital.  He said the
operation was successful and Carroll may be able to come home tomorrow.  Mae
worked on the computer and found out that the internet is not working again.  I
was afraid of that after the Technician had me restore the computer yesterday
when I was trying to get the sound to work on the computer.  After we watched
the second movie on the Prophet Joseph Smith, Mae and I lay on the couch and
rubbed each other’s feet.  I then entered my journal entry before going to bed.</span></p>

that didn’t leave me time enough to do any stretch exercises before going to
work.  I stayed at the carpentry shop and cut the parts for the window jambs
while I had Elder Shaw go for parts.  This evening after we had eaten dinner we
went to Elder and Sister Shaw’s where we watched a recording of John Bytheway give
a lecture on the “Heroes of the Book of Mormon.”  It was very enjoyable.  We
stopped at the grocery store on the way home and bought some chicken.  Mae has
spent several hours again trying to get the computer restored.  It is getting

went to the nursing home as a volunteer this morning.  After she finished with
that she and Sister Shaw went into Bakersfield shopping.  Mae returned the
sound equipment to Wal-Mart that I bought last Friday.  In as much as the sound
card is out on our computer we didn’t feel there was any need to keep the sound
equipment.  When Mae returned home she went right to work preparing dinner for
the Elders.  When I got home I showered and then helped Mae with the finishing
touches before the elders arrived.  At the dinner table we got talking with the
Elders about our trip to Jerusalem.  Before leaving, Elder Bills and Elder
Graft sang a hymn “I Stand All Amazed”.  We do enjoy having the Elders in our
home.  I helped Mae with the dishes and then lay on the Chee machine for a few
minutes.  Mae and I watched a show from the series “Big Valley”.  Mae received
a letter from her friend Carolyn Cue informing her of Gary Cue’s passing.  Mae
has known Carolyn every since they served together in the Primary Presidency in
the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup> Ward.</span></p>

window jambs and cutting the bottom casing for all the windows.  I went to the
house and Elder Shaw was spraying the primer on.  I don’t think he has ever
been shown how to spray paint.  Oh well he tries!  We ate lunch and then I took
over the spraying.  We finished up with the undercoat and cleaned up.  It was
about 2PM when we called it quits for the day.  When I got home Mae says she is
feeling some better but she has the croup and doesn’t sound better.  I worked
on the water heater and clean out some of the sediment from the tank.  I
roasted some almonds so that I can make some almond butter.  I also ground some
almonds for mile.  Mae cooked some rice and we had gravy, chicken and
vegetables for dinner.  I helped her clean up and wash the dishes.  I took a
shower and shaved.  This evening we watched the show “Tora! Tora! Tora!”,
showing the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  What a sickening feeling to realize how
many blunders were made in that historical event and to realize that we know
deal so freely with that country and they are still attacking us very slyly.  </span></p>

Mae got up just as I was finishing breakfast.  She is feeling some better. 
Elder Shaw and I painted the house and had it done by 12:45PM.  We then stopped

After dinner this evening I took a nap in the recliner.  I then showered and

well and had told David.  That is why he had called to check on her.  Mae also
called and talked to Scott and his children.  I called Bob to see how Carroll

decided that we had better stay home.  I informed the Shaw’s that we wouldn’t
go and I called the Temple housing and canceled our reservation.  I worked
until 4PM so I could finish installing one door.  I had installed all the
window jambs and seals and the one bedroom door.  The windows sure worked out
well having them prebuilt.  I had some problems installing the doors as I had
framed the door height 81 inches instead of 82 inches.  That mean I will have
to trim all the doors.  I went to build the jambs for the closet doors and
found that Pro Built had sent me exterior jamb material instead of interior
material.  I called and they were going to find out what had happened and call
me back but I didn’t get a call.  I stopped on the way home and bought Mexican
fried rice and beans for us for dinner.  While we ate dinner we watched a DVD
“Somewhere in Time”.  I then moved the TV into our bedroom and we watched the
movie “Viva Las Vegas” and that was about as good (or as bad) as any of Elvis’s
movies.</span></p>

morning and prepared breakfast of waffles and eggs about 11AM.  This afternoon
we went into the urgent care center and had Mae checked.  The Dr. said that she
did not have whooping cough but a virus that is going around.  She probably got
it from the children at school.  We went out to eat at the Home Town Restaurant. 
We came home and Mae changed and we went back to the Stake Center in
Bakersfield and attended the Saturday Evening session of our Stake Conference. 
It has been a wonderful day, being with my sweetheart and mainly relaxing.  The
evening conference was very good.  Elder Golden of the First Quorum of Seventy
is our presiding Authority over the Stake conference.  We really enjoyed his
remarks this evening.  He opened his remarks to answering questions from the
congregation.  I found his answer to a question about cola drinks very
interesting.  He said that we should use wisdom but the question is not asked
in order to receive a Temple Recommend.  After getting home I filled out this
entry and then got ready for bed.  I talked to Sandi on the phone today, she is
doing well.  She said that Chelci found out that their baby is a little girl.  </span></p>

which was great.  Elder Golden came into the chapel at 9:45AM and I believe
shook hands with almost everyone in the chapel except the choir and he waved to
them.  We were setting in the last row of the chapel so we did get to shake
hands with him.  As I did I told him that our grandson had just received his
call to South Africa.  He said to tell him he is in for a great experience.  President
and Sister Brimhall were also there this morning and they gave great talks. 
President Hawkins (the Stake President) gave the opening address and then had
he had a Spanish Sister who had just been baptized bear her testimony with
President Slaughter translate for her, then followed with a couple that had
just been sealed in the Temple tell their conversion and activation
experience.  President and Sister Brimhall spoke, followed by the Stake
Patriarch.  President Hawkins then called for another Brother to bear his
testimony and what an experience he had when he investigated and joined the
Church.  Elder Christoffel Golden Jr. spoke the remaining time and kept us
spell bound.  A few of the thoughts he taught us that I made note of, and I

continued to work on finishing’s.  The door casing that we are using is not
dittoed out in the back.  We needed a router table but do not have one.  We
made one by drilling a 1 ¼ inch hole in some sheeting and mounting Elder Shaw’s
router to it and using his guide.  It worked very well and made trimming the
doors much easier.  I have contacted Pro Built three times and have still not
got a solution to the wrong jamb material they sent me.  I believe that I will
just return the wrong material and purchase what I need elsewhere.  I was tired
when I got home.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got home.  After eating I
showered and shaved and then lay on the Chee machine.  I even got a short nap

located our Christmas card list from the back-up we have on the external hard

told her to just put some cold cereal on but she wanted me to have a better
breakfast than that.  I had Elder and Sister Shaw go looking for lighting and
other materials while I continued to install trim.  I took the doors over to
Lee’s shop and cut them off on the table saws there.  On the way home I stopped
at the post office to pick up a large letter that would not fit in our mail box
without bending it, so the mail man returned it to the office and left us a
note to pick it up.  I shaved and showered before dinner and then took a nap in

asked him if he had the key to our camper as Scott and Jeff had came over to
winterize it but couldn’t find the key.  Bob was gone to visit Carroll so he
was not home when they came over.  He will call Scott and make arrangements for
him to get the key.  I started to work on the computer when Jim Fraiser called
and I visited with him for 1 ½ hours.  I did work on the Christmas letter that
Mae had compiled, getting it to fit the back side of the picture Christmas card
Mae had made up for us.  I then worked on the printer setup for printing

appointment so didn’t get to our place until 6:50PM.  I know that I couldn’t

for our children and other gifts.  We were not able to get as many as we want
and I am not sure just why not.  Lee said that it may be because of the State
of California is putting pressure on companies.  Elder Shaw and I worked on the
house getting the trim ready for paint.  I left Elder Shaw to start painting
primer on the trim.  I went for some materials.  We quit for lunch with a
Thanksgiving dinner for all the office personal and companions including some
children.  After a very enjoyable dinner Elder Shaw and I got doors ready to
spray paint, however we didn’t have time to spray them today.  I took time to
repair a 220 amp outlet in the shop area.  Mae went to Bakersfield after the dinner
and didn’t get home until 20 minutes after I got home.  We were going to go to
the Los Angeles Temple in the morning but it looks like we will have storm and
very possible snow in the higher elevations and if that happens the Grape Vine
highway will be closed down.  Roy called and needs some help so we will go to
Fresno and give him a hand and go to the Temple there.  After dinner I helped
Mae with some blankets she is making for grandchildren and great
grandchildren.  We then watched a DVD “Love Comes Softly”.  Although we have

gave us just enough time to change and go to the Temple.  Linda was sick so she
didn’t go with us.  We sure enjoyed the Temple session today.  We saw quite a
few trees with the fall colors and that was sure nice to see.  The Almond trees
and the Pistachio trees don’t turn colors when the leaves fall off, so it was
nice to see the other trees turn colors.  I assembled a TV table for Roy and
Linda.  We had one part missing and I had to do a little creative work to get
around that one missing part.  Roy prepared lunch for us.  Linda got feeling

that it would be an easy day as several of our children we gone with family for
the Thanksgiving week, however we were shortly surprised when we had several
Spanish children come from visitors to our Ward.  We did not have any helpers
with us today.  I soon went to elder and Sister Shaw and asked for help.  They

Macias for about a half hour before going on home.  When we got home I ask Mae

well last night so I let her sleep in.  As normal she had prepared my lunch so
I just had to put it into my lunch pall.  I had cold cereal for breakfast.  Bob
called and gave me a little update on Brody.  It is a wonder that he is alive. 
I had a few minutes so I worked on Christmas cards before leaving for work.  We
continued painting on trim and sprayed doors and shelving.  I stopped on the
way home at the storage shed by the Kimberlina homes for some material and
while there I picked the last of the pomegranates and brought them home.  Mae
soon had dinner ready and after eating I got on the computer using Google Map
to find the shortest way to Shellie’s.  I then worked the rest of the evening
helping Mae with her blankets for our grandchildren’s Christmas gifts.  We got
an update on Brody from Sandy this evening.  David also called to let us know
that he has been accepted into PA schooling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I just spoke with Bruce.  This is the update he gave me
about Brody:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His condition has changed from critical to serious, which is
good.  He is in stable condition, but this morning his heart rate went up and
they haven't gotten it down as of about 4:00 our time.  From the time he was
shot he has had 16-18 pts. of blood--a complete overhaul, said Bruce.  He had 8
shots to his body, not 5 or 3, as was previously reported.  They say it is
amazing he got from being shot, to the hospital he now resides without dying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His arm was shattered; a bullet hit the kidney, spleen, and
intestine, fragments into the heart, and his leg.  They have not done anything
to repair his arm yet.  He is in a medical coma, or something like that. 
Apparently he can hear but cannot speak He will probably be hospitalized for
3-4 more weeks.  I asked Bruce if there was any word about the guy who shot
him.  He said there was none.  They continue to look for him as if he is alive
but because he is armed, they have to be careful.  Bruce wonders if he may have
killed himself and he is in the water close by, never able to locate him.  He
said this guy was on parole and broke parole, plus he was armed; and because he
didn't want to go back to prison, it makes sense that Brody suspicioned him for
some reason and the guy became scared about being caught, so he shot Brody.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I asked about writing emails to the hospital or some way to
get messages to Brody.  He said there was an email address being set up, and he
would let me know that address, and I will forward it on to all of you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are putting his name in all temples in the country and I told
him we would continually pray for him in our personal and family prayers.</p>

painted doors this morning.  We were within 15 minutes from finishing when the
spray gun plugged up and we couldn’t get it to clear.  After working on it for
some time I got another airless sprayer and finished the job.  It was after 1PM
when I was able to leave where I had planned on leaving at noon.  Mae was
completely ready including packing the car, when I got home.  I showered and
shaved and we left home at 2PM.  We drove straight through to Shellie’s with
three short stops and I made two wrong turns which cost us a little time but we
still arrived at Shellie’s at 11PM California time.</p>

woke at 8AM and went into the bathroom.  I read my scriptures and then came in
and woke Mae.  I was glad that she was able to sleep ok last night for she had
eaten quite a lot of deserts yesterday.  It was very hard to be around all the
wonderful foods and not eat most of them.  Even I ate some that I shouldn’t but
I was afraid that Mae had eaten too much.  Garrett and I visited about the
importance of the daily religious practices in order to resist the influences
of the adversary.  Shellie prepared omelets for breakfast and after eating
Steve and Chelci went over to Steve’s brothers.  I called Bob but he had gone
to the store.  Carroll came home this morning so I talked to her about her
health and I asked about Brody and his family.  She said that the Doctors
operated on his arm and cleaned out the wounds yesterday.  His fever dropped
down for the first time, after that operation.    Roy and Garrett got talking
computers and computer design and it was about like lessoning to a foreign language. 
Mae and the girls were talking girl talk so I came downstairs and worked on the
computer.  Shellie, Sandi, Mae and I played Rook, the first game Sandi took the
first three bids and won the game in those three hands.  The next game we
played for a long time and who ever took a bid lost almost ½ the bids so the
game stretched out for a long time until we really just quite.  We did get to
meet Nora, Garrett’s girl friend.  They seem to enjoy getting to know each
other.  I think everyone would be in favor of that relationship. This evening
we watched a DVD titled “Australia”.  It was very good and with Roy and
Shellie’s editing program was a very enjoyable show.  It was a long show

and I substituted fried sweet potato over the hash browns) and all the
trimmings.  We had family activity today starting with going to the park and
shooting rockets off, then we played croquet, followed by going to the Arizona
Temple grounds to see the Christmas lights, we all returned home where Sandi,
Chelci, Steve and Nathan went to bed as they will be leaving for home quite

certainly didn’t want to go that way as we would be there in the afternoon rush
hour.  We thought we found the way but then we ran into road construction and a
detour.  When I thought we were straight I went back to the GPS and it rerouted
us back to L.A. so we lost more time.  We also got gas and stopped at a grocery
store for some groceries Mae needed for Wednesday.  By the time we got back on

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke just before 6AM so I shut the alarm off so Mae could sleep a little
longer.  About 6:30 someone knocked at the door.  It was one of the farm
workers and they needed to jump the tractor and didn’t have a pickup to do
that.  When I went out to start my truck the windows were all frosted heavy so
I had to drive with my window down to see.  I got him going and came back.  Mae
had tried to get water in the sink and the water lines were frozen.  We had the
drinking water but nothing from the faucet.  After eating breakfast I worked on
the water until I finial got the water lines clear from ice and got it flowing. 
When I went to go to work my truck wouldn’t start.  It has been quite a
morning.  Elder Shaw came over and we jumped my pickup with his.  He then
followed me to the shop and I left my pickup there for them to check out the
problem.  They replaced the battery in my pickup.  Elder Shaw and I removed
masking tape and then I started installing light fixtures.  Elder Shaw worked
on the shelving for the closets.  It was after 5PM when I got home.  I put
cardboard over the pump and water lines to try to stop them from freezing
tonight.  After dinner I took a nap and then I printed the Christmas letters on
the Christmas cards Mae had printed.  I then used the computer to address the
envelopes for the cards.  It was after 10PM when we went to bed.</p>
