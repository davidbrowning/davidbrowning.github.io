went to Lee’s home in Shafter where Elder Judd and I helped Lee install
windows.  I left for home about 10:15AM so I could shower and change.  We went
over to the Wasco Ward Chapel, getting there at noon.  We help take youth to
the L.A. Temple so that they could do baptisms for the dead.  Brandon, Riley
and another girl road with us in our car.  It was good to be in the Temple and
to participate with the youth in this work.  After we finished at the Temple
Bishop Birch invited everyone to meet at a beautiful park that was quite close
to the Temple where he got Sub-Way sandwiches for everyone.  We only had the
two girls ride home with us as they both lived in Shafter.  Going to L.A. the
two girls’ slept but on the way home they never quite talking.  We were a
little concerned at some of the words that the girls used in there talking.  As
a youth if I would have used language like that I would have got my mouth
washed out with soap, but I guess that with the language our youth are bomb boarded
with at school now, these expressions are ok!  </span></p>

and started studding for my Priesthood lesson.  I realized that I had picked up
the November 2008 Ensign.  I hadn’t found that Elder Bednar’s talk was on Home
Teaching, so I found the November 2009 and again that talk wasn’t on Home
Teaching.  It was interesting but I got a lesson ready.  We got to the Chapel
in time for choir practice.   Meetings were very enjoyable and spiritual.  I
felt good with the way my lesson turned out.  Mae was asked to teach the
nursery today.  I felt like I should go in with her to help but I couldn’t
because of my lesson.  Elder and Sister Judd over heard that she had the
nursery so they went in and helped her.  It went fairly well.  When we got home
we took a nap.  We just had an easy dinner and then we made phone calls to our
family.  I visited with Rich, Lois and Elise while Mae talked to David, Sandi
and Scott.  When we called Jeff, he and I got on the phone and computer and
played a inter-net game of Hearts.  It was late when we finished talking to
everyone, so we had better head to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke with the alarm but cuddled back with Mae for a few minutes when my cell
phone rang.  It was Rosia at the Davis School Bus shop.  She wanted to let me
know that Jennifer Vedaa, my bus assistant died last night.  At this time they
do not know the cause but Ron woke during the night and found her dead on the
floor.  I am so glad that Rosia called me but feel so sad that I hadn’t written
to Jennifer.  We got to know each other quite well while we worked together. 
Jennifer felt badly that I quit and came on this mission, but she understood. 
She had asked me how pistachios grew and I told her I didn’t know but that when
I found out I would let her know.  As we have watched the pistachio trees
develop and bud I have thought about writing Jennifer and letting her.  I also
wanted to send her a pass along card, but now it is too late.  Work went well
today and we worked on the closet, I picked up the expansion joint filler and I
bought paint for the closet.  I was tired when I got home but stopped and
bought some groceries for Mae on the way home.  Mae had a nice dinner for us. 
We read more in the “Preach My Gospel” manual.  We then watched the first movie
of “The Work and The Glory” series.  We sure enjoyed it even though we have
read the books and seen the three DVD of the series.  It’s now late so we had
better go to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep very good last night so I tried to let her sleep in but she got up
about 6:30 and got my breakfast and saw me off to work.  She went to a social
held at our Stake Center in Bakersfield today.  Work went ok today with Elder
Judd and I working on the chemical closet at the processing plant.  We finished
for today about 3PM and then washed both Elder Judd and my trucks.  I came home
and took a nap before dinner.  After dinner I went over to Lee’s home and
helped install a window and also did some sheetrock tapping.  I got home about
8PM.  We called Roy and Linda about this weekend and got that planned.  Both
Mae and I have sore feet tonight so we went to bed early and rubbed each
other’s feet.  Every day we feel excited at the country, the farms and the
orchards.  The barley crop a mile from us is just beautiful and it is fun to
see it ripen.  I still get excited at farming.  Jeff called to get our address
so he could get a Mother’s day card off to Mae.  I visited for just a few
minutes with him.  Mae and I rubbed each others feet before going to sleep</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Again
as I left for work and traveled through the farm and orchard lands I feel an
unexplainable excitement.  Then when I think of my sweet wife and her love the
tears just have to flow.  When I got over to the plant Elder Judd was already
painting.  We finished up the painting and cleaned up.  We then went over to
the bowery and chopped up some fire wood.  The logs were cut from Almond trees
that have blown over.  The logs were not cut at a 90 degree angle and are not
very straight so they are very difficult to hold for cutting.  They are also a
very knotty, so they are very hard to split.  To make it worse, the splitter
that we used has a very wide splitting edge and does not cut into the log. 
When we quite for lunch elder Judd went home and I ate at the bowery.  After
eating I lay down and slept for a few minutes.  We repaired a drinking fountain
and also a sprinkler valve before quitting for today.   Mae had dinner about
ready when I got home.  We ate and then went over to Lee’s and I helped him
move a piano.  There were five other men that showed up before we got it moved
so that went pretty good.  Mae and I then went to Bakersfield where we returned
the pop that we had bought for the company party and looked for some other
pap.  We bought each of a swimming suit so we can use Roy and Linda’s hot tub
this week end.  We stopped at Home Depot but they didn’t have the things I
needed.  It was after 9PM when we got home, very tired.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were late getting up but I got to the Kimberlina bowery about 8:30PM.  I turned
the water onto the water fountain that we repaired yesterday.  I checked out
the horse shoe pits to see what needs to be done to have them ready to use.  I
think they just need some sand added to the pits.  I stopped at the office and
visited with Merrill and I will take care of getting the sand next week.  Other
than that we should be ok.  I worked on the closet upstairs putting the doors
on.  For some reason the doors are too tight.  I will wait until Monday to
figure that out.  I need some tools to install the water lines and the valves,
so I went home and ate lunch, then went to Floyd’s and got the tools that I
needed.  Before going home I went to Wasco to the K Mart store and bought the
pop for the company party.  On the way home I stopped and bought some
strawberries’ for Mae.  We left for Roy and Linda’s about 5PM.  Roy and Linda
had diner ready for us when we got there.  I was going to get in the hot tub
but it wasn’t working so that was out.  We just visited this evening before
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                On
the way to Roy and linda’s, Mae drove and I wrote a card to Ron Vedan to
express sympathy for the passing of Jennifer.  Mae felt that I should keep a
copy of what I wrote so I will add it here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Dear
Ron, I am so sorry for your loss.  It was certainly a shock to me when the bush
shop called to inform me of Jennifer’s passing.  When we left for California to
spend a year on this assignment, Jennifer asked me “How do Pistachios grow?”  I
told her I didn’t know but that I would let her know when I found out.  Every
time we walked and watched the trees developing, I thought of her.  I had taken
some progressive pictures and planned on sending her a CD with pictures and descriptions. 
Now she probably knows better than I.  I just feel badly that I didn’t contact
her to let her know that I often thought of her.  I know that she had a deep
love for Jesus Christ.  I enclosed this picture of Christ.  I am sure that if
you would call for a copy of this beautiful movie, that you and your family
would enjoy watching and receiving great comfort especially at this time.  I
wish there was more I could do.  Know that my prayers have been with you.  May
Christ’s love be with you and your family.  A friend, Ken Browning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up around 8AM.  After breakfast Roy, Linda, Mae and I left for Yosemite
National Park.  The grandeur of the trees was the first thing that excited me. 
They were mainly Lodge Pole Pine and they stood so tale.  Then as we climbed
the hills to an elevation of 5,000 feet and dropped into the Yosemite Valley
and emerged through the tunnel the beauty and excitement that I felt is
indescribably.  It was exciting to meditate about the purpose of the creation. 
I commented that “God had created this valley for the enjoyment of man.”  Linda
said that she didn’t feel that that was the only reason but I wonder if it
isn’t one of the main reasons.  We thrilled at the spectacular beauty of each
water fall and each peak that we saw.  I found great excitement at looking at
the river and streams and got excited just to think of fishing in those
waters.  When we finally stopped at the parks village to eat, we enjoyed the
squirrels and birds that were all around begging for food.  Even though people
are cautioned about feeding them they, still find enough to become very
friendly.  We enjoyed a little shopping and Mae saw a set of DVD’s about the
birth of National Parks and wanted to buy it.  When we looked at the price of
$99.90 for the set of six DVD,s I questioned if we should buy them.  I finally
said that Mae should let her conchance be her guide.  That did it and she
immediately bought the set.  Even the cashier questioned the price and so he
gave her a special bag that starting tomorrow for Mothers day they will be giving
out.  We had a lot of fun with this experience.  The day was gone so we started
home, however we still had to stop at several more places to take more
pictures.  It has been a very enjoyable day.  I am afraid that this entry
really doesn’t do this day justice for the thrill and excitement I personally
felt.  We watch the first of the DVD this evening while we ate a evening
snack.  Mae and I got in the hot tub for a few minutes and then took a shower
before going to sleep.  Although it is after mid-night I made this entry so
that I could try to get some of my excitement into it.  Mae went to sleep
shortly after mid-night, but it was almost 1AM before I finished and got to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                When
I woke this morning I lay in bed meditating as to the grandeur of the park
yesterday.  I believe that the Lord made this earth for each person and though
some have never had the opportunity to know the Gospel and gain a testimony of
the truthfulness of it the opportunity will be there sometime somewhere.  We
enjoyed the day with Roy and Linda.  We did go out for a little while about
noon but returned and watched the movie “Fly Away” that was very enjoyable. 
Mae and I then packed up and came home.  It was almost 7PM when we got home. 
After unpacking and putting things away, we watched the show “October Sky”. 
Both of these shows were taken from true stories.  It has sure been and
enjoyable weekend and so much fun being with Mae.</p>

slept in and then I prepared breakfast for Mae.  Mae got a package from Jeff
and from David that we got in the mail when we got home last night.  She
wouldn’t open them last night but saved them for today.   After breakfast we
got ready and left for Church.  There was no choir practice today because of
Mothers Day.  Meetings were very good and after Priesthood meeting Brother
Hayward visited with me about some Home Teaching assignments.  Then Brother Allred
asked me if Sister Browning and I would speak in Sacrament meeting on the 23<sup>rd</sup>
of May.  I was going to prepare dinner but I couldn’t find what to prepare. 
Mae was talking to Mike on the phone and when she got off she got dinner.  I
loaded the Adobe Photoshop on our computer for Mae and got it working for
her.   Later I did up the dishes for Mae while she worked on adjusting pictures
so that they can be sent to our children.  We watched the second movie of “The
Work and the Glory” series.  About half way through the show I put it on pause
while Mae called and talked to Jeff, Gail and Ben.  After the movie I filled
out this entry before we went to bed.  I did play a game of Spider Solitary
before shutting the computer down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night so I had her go back to sleep and I got
myself off to work.  Elder Judd and I took one of the doors off the double
doors on the closet and with Lee’s table saw trimmed 3/16<sup>th</sup> off the
door and when we put it back on the doors fit perfect.  Lee told us that we
have the permits to start building the homes.  Lee will call for the footing
contractor and get him and the plumber coordinated to start.  Tim and Travis
asked Elder Judd and I to show some men how to clean and fill the floor
expansion joints, which we did.  It is very interesting to me that we had to
show someone else how to do something that we had to figure out.  I guess that
we did it by trial and error so it saved them experimenting.  I was going to
get some sand for the horseshoe pits today but they close the yard about noon. 
I will have to get it tomorrow.  I picked up a package at the post office for
Mae, sent by Shellie for Mothers Day.  I repaired one of the sprinkler valves
that was leaking this afternoon.  I worked on some of my history this evening. 
Mae got on the inter-net and called support because of problems she was
having.  I used the new blender and made a batch of Almond Butter.  We studied
for a little while and then read our Patriarchal Blessings and then we had
finished a game of Rummy before going to bed.  I won the game tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
breakfast I went to a cement plant in Wasco where I purchased a small amount of
sand for the horse shoe pits.  I stopped at the plant and met with Lee and
Elder Judd. We discussed the plans for starting the houses.  I then took the
sand over to the bowery and filled the pits.  I came on home and got my paint
pants so that I could help Elder Judd paint their storage shed.  Lee went into
Bakersfield and while there bought a lock set for the upstairs closet.  When I
went to install it, it had the wrong length bolt for the door.  Lee had sent
Elder Judd into the locksmith to have some locks rekeyed.  He tried to catch
him but he was almost back when Lee called.  So I decided that I would have to
go in for the part that I needed.  Just as I was about to leave Elder Judd
stopped me and said that the locks were keyed wrong so I took them back in with
me and got those corrected, along with the part that I needed.  Mae had spent
most of the morning at a Rest Home in Shafter.  She enjoyed that experience and
afterwards went shopping.   I came on home and helped Mae finish getting diner
ready for the Elders to come for dinner with us.  I did have time to take a
shower and change.  We sure enjoyed having the elders.  I helped Mae with the
dishes after they left.  Mae made some signs for the ring toss she is in charge
of for the company party Saturday.  I assembled the rings.  I also put on a DVD
so that we might watch it while working on the projects.  I put on “The Love
Story” but within a few minutes we shut it off and threw it in the trash. 
There were no ratings on the packaging but when the show started it indicated
that it was rated PG.  It didn’t take long to realize that it should have been
rated R.  After throwing that one away we put on “Love’s Unending Legacy” and
it was an excellent movie and was worth watching.  It is late but we sure enjoy
being together.  Good Night!</p>

we finally received the permit to start the houses.  We had Pick N Paw excavate
for the footings and plumbing trenches plus form for the slab.  Lee and I
installed some door hardware on the new doors to the loading dock and I
installed the hardware on the closet doors upstairs.  At noon Lee, Elder Judd
and I went into Bakersfield to Champion Door and Lock for an invitational
barbecued chicken and beef dinner.  At 1:30PM we met with the architect, who
brought out the official permit and the final blue prints.  We had a few
questions to clear up with him.  It is good to finally get started on the
project that we were called here to do.  Hopefully we will be able to pour the
concrete on Monday.  I made some stakes to fence the ring toss area for this Saturday’s
activity.  After getting home Mae had me take a short nap before dinner.  I
worked on my journal and played a couple of games on the computer.  Mae called
and visited with Kathleen Clark to see how they are doing, and then she made

made hot cakes for breakfast and with fresh strawberries and mango along with
apple sauce, they were great.  I was at work at 8AM and we went over the house
plans.  After the three of us discussed the bids Elder Judd called and ordered
the trusses, doors and windows.  The plumbers were most of the day getting the
underground pipes in.  Lee went over the needed underground electrical conduits
with the electrician and then with a Spanish helper I set and secured them to
the concrete forms.  I picked up paint tools at the Sherwood farm and purchased
paint at Home Depot.  Elder Judd and I painted the room upstairs in the plant
that we had built the storage closet in.  it was 5:30PM when I left the plant
to go home.  After dinner we relaxed and watched the movie “The Other Side of
Heaven”, a true story taken from the personal records of John Groberg.  We
really enjoyed it.  Before going to bed we made some Almond milk and I entered
this journal entry.  Mae read me a letter she had written to Sandi and I felt
that it was a good letter.  I hope that it will help Sandi.</p>

I thought about my talk for the 23rd I spent extra time in prayer and
meditation.  Mae called me for breakfast before I was ready so I had to hurry. 
This morning Lee, Elder Judd and I went over the plans.  We thought that we had
the solution with the natural gas and electrical figured out but found that we
are still trying to solve that problem.  Subs are not as fare along with the
underground, footings and concrete as we had hoped.  It just takes time.  I
guess I will spray houses for bug control in the next few days while we are
waiting for the home to be ready to frame.  When I looked for the sprayer, it
is missing so I had to go to Home Depot and purchase another one.  I bought
some nuts for our use.  Lee was cute as he reminded me to be sure to give
myself plenty of time to get to the temple this evening.  We did leave for the
Temple shortly after 3PM and arrived there at 5:30PM.  We checked in at the
Temple Patrons apartments and then I took a nap.  As we came into LA the
afternoon traffic leaving the city had a five lane freeway backed up for miles
and traveling at almost a stop.  As we for closer to the Metro area the traffic
on our side continues to slow down.  It really made us appreciative of us
living out in the pistachio orchard.   We attended the Stake Temple meeting
held in the Temple Chapel.  President Hackins, the Bakersfield Stake President
spoke, giving us some very important counsel on the importance of the Temple
garment.  A counselor in the Temple Presidency also spoke to us.  We then went
through an initiatory session that I felt very inspired and enjoyed the
session.  It was almost 11PM when we got back to our room.  We were both hungry

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 5AM, for dressed and checked out and then went to a Denny’s and got
breakfast.  Traffic was fairly light at that time of the morning.  The weather
was very overcast but as we left the city we realized that it was smog that
shut out the sunlight.  We got home at 9AM.  We soon went over to the park at
the Kimberlina residence and started setting up for the company party.  I don’t
know how many there were in attendance but it looked like there was a good
turnout.  There were many activities for all to join.  We were kept quite busy
until the party was over and everything taken down.  After getting home I did
get a few minute nap and then we went with the Judd’s to the Saturday night
Stake Conference meeting.  It was very good and I set with my mouth open as to
the knowledge that the Stake Presidency had.  He spoke about your Calling and
Election Made Sure and that is above my comprehension.  We were tired when we
got home so I started this entry but couldn’t stay awake so am finishing it
today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early thinking of my talk for next week.  I am really having a hard time
with this assignment.  The subject of the talk is to be, “Be Strong and Of Good
Courage”.  I am concerned that we have many in our Ward, especially Spanish
that are new in the Church and are not fully committed.  Today we attended
Stake Conference.  To our disappointment President and Sister Brimhall were not
able to attend our conference because of other assignments.  President and
Sister Murphy came in their place so after Conference we visited with them and
asked them to take our love to President and Sister Brimhall.  The conference
talks were very enjoyable and the meeting carried a special Spirit.  After
returning home we had dinner and then took a nap.  Mae and I worked on the computer
getting our files backed up on to the external hard drive.  We feel much safer
with them being backed up off from the physical computer.  We made some calls
to our children, most of them were away.  I did get to talk to Sandi for a few
minutes.  Mae called Gary Nelson and Pat Bradfield.  I also called Bob and
Carroll and visited for a while.  He got the east side fence replaced with him
doing most of the work.  He said that Yangs came over and helped a couple of
times.  We decided to play some Rummy before going to be but then David and
Jeff each called us as when we called them they were not home so we left
messages.  We enjoy our children and we worry for them.  It’s now 10:15 PM so
we will go to bed.</p>

we had to turn on the air-conditioned but this morning we had to turn on the
heater.  We got rain storms most of the day.  I did get several of the homes
sprayed for cockroaches and put some shelf brackets on the shelves in the
closet upstairs in the processing plant.  I took time for lunch at home with
Mae.  It will still be a couple of days before the slabs will be poured and we
can start framing the houses.  I came home at 4PM so we could go out to dinner
tonight.  We got away before 5PM but Mae had several places to go shopping
first.  I thought that we were just going to stop at T-Mobile to get Mae’s
phone repaired before we went to eat.  It was almost 8PM when we got to
Sizzler’s.  We just beat three busloads of tourists that also came to
Sizzler’s, so we were glad that we weren’t any later getting there.  It was
9:30PM when we got home.  Mae put groceries away.  I filled out my journal and
we went to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep the best last night because I woke thinking of my talk for
Sunday.  I went over to the plant and had some questions to visit with Lee
about the houses.  I found out that all of the farms management is gone for a
special training seminar.  Elder Judd is also so sick today.  I went over to
the Kimberlina homes and sprayed them for cockroaches, except the one house as
no one was home and they have dogs in the back yard.  I left them a note with
instructions to call me if they want me to return when someone is there.  Mae
was gone to the nursing home when I got home, so I took a nap and then got up
and worked on my talk.  Elder Judd called and said that the inspector passed
the footing and underground so that concrete can be poured.  She did say that
there was many more tie down bolts than what is needed.  I guess that Elder
Judd also called the architect and he said that there shouldn’t be that many
tie down ether.   I have been studying the plans and do not see why there
should be so many tie down bolts for they are not called for in the plans.   Elder
Judd and I will meet at 6:30 in the morning and go over it and meet with our
concrete sub-contractor in the morning at 7AM.  Mae and I did take a short walk
this evening.  We also watched a show on DVD this evening.</p>

got up early and went into the plant.  Elder Judd and I went over the plans for
the tie-down bolts requirements.  We also checked for the underground plumbing
for the islands in the duplex.  They are ok.  When the concrete crew came we
adjusted several J-bolts and eliminated several others.  The cement had too
much water in it as to my thoughts but I hope it will be ok.  I came home and
had some more breakfast and took a nap.  I worked on my talk for Sunday.  I
adjusted some of our sprinklers to get a little better coverage.  After dinner
this evening I started this journal entry and we went to Bakersfield shopping. 
I let Mae drive as she needs to become familiar with going to Bakersfield.  I
turned the GPS on for her and everything in the GPS was gone.  We don’t know
what happened.  I am unable to get the voice back on.  We did get a new ink
cartridge for our printer.  I called Ruben Aispuro, my Home Teaching Jr.
Companion, to see if we could set an appointment but he is sick with the
stomach flu that seems to be going around.  I finished this entry and we went
to bed as I will go in early tomorrow.  Elder Judd has lumber being delivered
at 6:45 in the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was up early and over to the plant at 6:40 AM and got there just as the truck
came with our lumber packages.  When the truck was completely unloaded I
realized that there was no 2 X 4’s but everything was 2 X 6’s.  When we
questioned the driver he didn’t know.  Elder Judd called the lumber co. and
they had understood that he had changed the total wall structure to 2 X 6’s. 
They will correct the order and bring us out the 2 X 4’s.  During the mean time
we got the outside plated laid out on the single units.  David called me this
afternoon to thank Mom and I for sending him the pistachio’s.  We visited for
just a few minutes.  Elder Judd and I didn’t quite until 4:30PM.  Mae and I
visited for a while and then I took a nap before dinner.  Mae went to a
chiropractor today and she really seemed to have helped her.  She highly
recommended that she use our inversion table daily.  We went to bed early this
evening.</p>

got up and got my breakfast and lunch and I left for the job site at 6:30AM. 
Elder Judd and I  got the bottom plates laid out and drilled.  We still removed
more J-bolts.  The shear walls tie down for the 4 X 6 beams were difficult to
get laid out so that they matched the tie-down bolts and located the beam so we
can be able to connect the tie brace to the beam.  By the end of the day we had
the front wall framed.  We quite at 4:30PM and picked up tools.  I got home
about 5:10PM and had to hurry to shower and shave before Chris, Valerie and
their son Chris came for dinner.  Mae had a very nice dinner prepared.  After
eating Chris and I set and visited, while Mae and Valerie played some Rummy. 
Mae gave little Chris a couple of balloons and he sure had a good time with
them.  He was sure cute and made me a little home sick for our grandchildren.  It
was still early evening when they left so Mae and I watched a show on DVD “My
Blue Heaven”.  We really enjoyed it and soon went to bed after.</p>

slept in until almost 8AM.  We hadn’t been up very long when Elder Judd called
me with a couple of questions about the house.  As I went through the plans to
answer his questions, I realized that the concerns about the natural gas
appliances, that have never been completely resolved is causing concerns with
the location of the sheer walls.  This quite upset me.  Mae prepared waffles
for breakfast.  She then went Visiting Teaching and shopping.  While she was
gone I made Almond Butter and Almond Milk and of course a mess.  I did make a
call to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Ruben
Aispureo, my Home Teaching Jr. Companion and set up a time that I could meet
with him and maybe even try to visit some of the families.  Mae got home just
as I was starting to clean up my mess.  I caught my journal up as I hadn’t
entered yesterday because I was too tired last night.  We called Chelci and
wished her a happy birthday. After lunch I took a nap while Mae worked on the
computer. Elder and Sister Judd stopped by and introduced Armreta, an interest
from Utah State that will be here at the South Valley Farms for a while.  She
will be with us tomorrow.  She is a very pretty girl from India.  I paint the
bench that we use at the back door and then I went Home Teaching.  I met with Ruben
Aispuro and found him to be a very pleasant young man.  He is 14 years old and
lives with his Mother and 5 siblings.  We were able to visit with Manuel Macias
and his wife, also with the Father of Ryan Pentecost.  Ryan is 17 years old and
I believe the only one in his family that is a member of the Church.  He was
not home at the time we stopped.  This evening Mae and I watched the movie on
DVD “Love’s Unfolding Dream” and really enjoyed it.  I worked on my talk for a

got up early and worked longer on our talks.  Our talks went fairly well and
several complemented us on the talks.  We came home and got a little to eat and
then went back to Wasco and got Amrita to show her around the area.  Amrita is
a student from India that has been going to school at Utah State.  She is now
here on a intern ship to worked at South Valley Farms for 3 to 6 months.  We
went over to Bakersfield and saw some of the points of interest there.  We
returned home and had dinner, visited and played games.  It was after 8PM

6:30 AM and worked until after 5PM.  We did get quite a lot done and had three
walls framed and set up, with the forth wall about framed.  I was very tired
when I got home so I took a shower, ate dinner and we watched the third show in

Lee, Elder Judd, Sister Judd and I got furnishings for an apartment in
Bakersfield for Amrita.  We also did some shopping before returning home.  One
of the stops was at K-Mart where we bought a set of DVD on the JAG series. 
When we got home Mae made some beans for dinner and I cleaned up and got ready
to go Home Teaching.  I called my companion Ruben Aispuro, but he was not
home.  I guess he forgot so I ask Mae to go with me.  We had two families to
visit her in Shafter, the first we could not find the address and no one in the
neighborhood know the name.  The second family we found the home but no one was
home, so I just left a note.  We then went to the plant to get my pickup and so
Mae could see the homes we are working on.  When we got home we decided to have
some peaches, which Lee and Kim gave to us, with some of our shake over it.  It
was really good.  The show lasted almost 2 hours and we thought each show was
only 1 hour; it put us late getting to bed.  Good night.</p>

Elder Judd came out.  He worked with me a while and then went for a Dr’s
appointment.  Lee came out and we discussed a couple of items.  Later Lee and I
went over to the Kimberlina homes and I saw how Lee wanted the closet doors
hung.  Before we went home we had all the outside walls leveled and bolted
down, the interior walls laid out and half of them framed and put up.  I think
we will be ready to put on trusses Friday morning.  I was tired when I got
home.  Mae had a very nice dinner ready.  We set in the recliners and I fell
asleep for a while.  Mae woke me later and I took a hot bath and shaved.  Mae
is so good to me and does everything she can to help and care for me.  I often wonder
why I a was so blessed to have such a wonderful wife and companion.  Mae got up
at 7AM, took care of house cleaning,  joined some other sisters in the Ward and
tied a quilt, came home and planted the flowers we bought yesterday,  filled
our pills for the next week, got dinner, then while I entered this journal
entry she did the dishes and got my lunch ready for tomorrow.  Wow, how she

Lee’s help we got the sheathing all on and the walls ready for trusses.  We
quite about 4:30 PM and cleaned up.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home. 
After eating I used the inversion table, the chee machine and took a shower.  This

However she noticed that the griddle wasn’t hot.  I checked and we are out of
propane, we there for had cereal instead.  I called Lee and he said that he
would call the gas co. and have them fill the tank.  We set the trusses today. 
Lee got four or five from the office to come out and hand the trusses up to Lee
and I.  The first truss that was handed up the ones on the ground let it go
before I was able to get a hold on it.  It almost knocked me off the wall.  I
don’t think that anyone noticed that I almost fell as they were concerned about
dropping the truss.  Anyway it went well and we got all the trusses set, braces
and the facia board fastened to the truss tails.  We also got braces set so
that we can install the side facia.  It’s been a good day.  It was after 5PM
when we got home.  Cerineo mowed our lawn today and it really looks good.  At
7PM we had Elder Blunk and Elder Kay came for dinner.  Mae had it all ready. 
When Mae started doing dishes this evening she ran out of hot water.  We had to
use some matches from our 72 hour kits to light the water heater.  I also
repaired and reset some of the sprinklers on the flowers.  It’s now after

come as he had several other things to do and their oldest son, Jarred, was
sick so stayed home also.  Ian sure took a liking to me and sat by me in the porch
swing.  He was excited to tell me about his love for fishing.  I told him that
when I got home from this mission, if he and his parents came to Utah I would
take him fishing in my boat.  Joylyn and Ian went with Roy and I shopping. 
Besides some groceries we were looking for a sewing awl.  We went all over from
one store to another and until the last store, no one even know what a sewing
awl was.  Everyone went to Julianna and Phil’s home where we enjoyed a barbeque
dinner.  They have a cute home which Phil’s father owns.  We sure enjoyed the

Spanish.  The third Sister, although she is Spanish, spoke in English.  Mae’s
class went well.  After meeting the Ward had a Linger Longer with everyone
bringing pot luck.  Most of the food I could not eat because of the ingredients
that the food contained and those dishes that were ok for me to eat was gone before
I got to them.  When I got home I made me some scrambles eggs.  I ate and then

the lawn sprinkler cycle to complete.  We don’t have enough water to sprinkle
the lawn and use water for other things at the same time.  I took a shower and
