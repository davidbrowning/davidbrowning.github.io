tried to get Mae to sleep in but she couldn’t go back to sleep so got up before
I left for my bus run.  Jennifer was late getting to the compound because she
fell back to sleep after the alarm went off.  We called Chris and William, the
first two students that we pick up, and asked if they could be ready when we
got there.  Both of them were at the curb as I drove up so that helped us make
up time.  I also pushed the speed limit.  We came out ok.  Mae had me something
to eat when I got home.  I took care of the rabbits and chickens and then took
a hours nap.  This afternoon run went well.  Mae and I went to Tanner Clinic
and got a physical examination by Dr. Lee, which went well.  Mae stopped on the
way home and got some food from Little Orient in Layton.  I stopped and filled
my pickup with natural gas.  We talked to Irven and Sandy about letting them
put insurance on our pickup but I don’t think that is going to work.  I also
visited with Bryce about the car he is getting ready for us.  We will go into Ogden
on Wednesday and get it registered so it can be road tested.  I visited with
Mike about our Palm and he will show me some things that may work for us on
Google.  He will visit with us on Friday evening.</span></p>

us.  We sure enjoyed having him.  Jeff couldn’t make it because of work.  My
afternoon run also went well.  I took our tax papers over to Mr. Sorenson’s and
he said that he would have them ready tomorrow.  This evening Jeff came over
and visited for a few minutes.  I called and visited with Rich and Lois and let
them know that we were going on another mission.  We started to watch a show on

minutes nap before taking the afternoon run.  After returning home I took care
of the animals and then Mae and I went over to Mr. Sorenson’s and signed our
tax returns.  We then went to Penny’s where I bought Mae a suit and pajamas. 
We came home and got something to eat and watched the last of a show on TV.

let Mae sleep in this morning, as I kept her awake quite a bit last night.  She
got up just before I finished my breakfast.  The morning run went well although
there was heavy fog for the first half of the route.  I took the bus in for
service this morning when I got back to the compound.  I went home and got
Mae.  We then went out for breakfast with Jennifer and Ron.  Jennifer wanted to
do something for me before we left.  It was a very enjoyable morning being with
them.  When we got home I fed the animals and then took a nap.  When I went
back to the bus compound I found that my bus was not completed.  I went to
dispatch and they assigned me another bus.  I went to that bus location but no
bus was there.  I called and dispatch checked the GPS and said that the bus was
on top.  I went up top and found a big red sigh “Bus out of service” so called
and dispatch assigned me another bus.  I went there and again the bus wasn’t in
the parking spot.  I found another bus and called dispatch and said that I had
found one and would take it.  No objection.  I had to go up to the shop and
find some seat harnesses for Christopher and Nicholas.  Jennifer was waiting
for me when I finally got up to pick her up.  The teachers had the students
waiting when we finally got there.  As we let William off Jennifer indicated
she needed to find a restroom so I stopped at an Arby’s and gave her a few minutes. 
Mae wasn’t home when I got there but came shortly after.  Bob prepared
spaghetti sauce and Mae cooked some of our spaghetti for dinner.  We drove over
to Scott and Michelle’s just to visit with them.  We enjoyed being with their
family and especially playing with the twins.  They are growing so fast and
almost walking.  Of course they are into everything and when you remove that
item immediately finds something else.  Before we left Scott mentioned that
their lazy Suzan wasn’t working.  I got some tools from the truck and after a
few minutes of working with it found the problem and was able to repair it.  As
we drove over and back Mae read from the novel we are reading.  It is sure fun
just being with Mae, sure love that woman.  It’s getting late and I have one
more day to drive the school bus so we had better get to bed.</span></p>

got up and prepared breakfast of pancakes and eggs.  My morning run went well. 
Mae went into Dr. Bennett’s for a treatment.  She then picked up Georgia and
the two of them went out to Sandi’s.  Georgia had never seen Sandi’s home.
After my morning run I filled the bus with fuel.  I then stopped at Green’s
Farm and Feed and bought feed for the rabbits and chickens.  From there I went
to the Chevron station and filled my pickup with natural gas.  I came home and
fed the animals.  Cheryl came from Salt Lake to let us know that on the 26<sup>th</sup>
of February, she and Bob will be sealed in the Jordan River Temple.  She would
also like to have her daughter sealed to them.  We set a date next Friday
morning for Cheryl to come up and we would help her with the New Family Search
program to get the paper works ready for that event.  Jennifer had a Dr.
appointment and was unable to work with me this afternoon.  Dispatch was able
to get me a sub to help me. The bus run went well.  When I got home Mae still
wasn’t home.  I took care of the animals and then started getting dressed for
the wedding and reception for Marsha and John.  Mae got home and we left for
the wedding by 4:15 PM.  It was a beautiful wedding and reception.  We had a
lot of Family there and had trouble getting to visit them all.  All of our
family made it to the reception and most to the Wedding.  After Mike and Becky
and Mae and I went to Jeff and Gail’s where we played a game and visited for a
little while.  David, Taylor, Mattie and Jessie had trouble finding the right
directions to get to our place.  They made it just before we got there.  Mike
showed Mae and I some things about our computer.  I think that I became quite
confused with it all.  It was late when we finally got to bed.</span></p>

David and Taylor left for home.  The rest of us started to play rook but the
deck was worn out so Mike and I went looking for a new deck.  We went to 5
stores before we bought a deck of Rook and a deck of Canasta cards.  By the
time we got back we decided that we would just play Sneaks so that the Mattie
and Jessie could play.  We had lunch and then they left for home.  It was sure
good to be with them.  I took a short nap and then we went with the Clark’s to
Maddock’s in Brigham City.  There we met with Brother and Sister Hyer for
dinner.  It was a fun evening with the six of us.  When we returned home Mae
and I took showers and watched a show on DVD.</span></p>

slept in until after 8AM.  We did some planning on mission preparation
including some discussion as to the question “Are we wise in buying this car
from Bryce”?  I called Bryce about the 1996 Buick and he brought it up to our
place.  We took it for a test drive and then let Bryce take our car back to his
place and he left the 96 with us.   I took care of the animals and we took more
pictures of our rabbits.  I thought it would only take a few minutes to have a
picture ready for Mae to put the rabbits on KSL.Com, but an hour and ½ later I
had it ready.  By then we had to go to our meetings.  Meetings were very
spiritual and informative.  Mae bore her testimony in Relief Society.  Bishop
Smith read our mission call to the congregation at the beginning of our
Sacrament and Testimony meeting.  When time was opened for individual
testimonies I took the opportunity to express my feelings about our calling.  The
testimonies that were shared were very well given, even the three that were
given by young boys.  After getting home from the meetings, Bob invited us for
dinner.  It was very good.  I helped Mae take the monthly ward news letter
around to the homes she had been assigned to deliver to.  We drove the new
Buick and when we had completed the delivery I had Mae drive for a little
while.  The car sure does ride nice but you can feel a problem with the
transmission shifting.  I visited with Bryce about it and he is ok if we do not
want the car.  I wrote this journal entry.  Mae made us a strawberry shake and
some toast with almond butter &amp; jam.  I transferred several documents from
the desk top to the lap top.  I also played a couple of games of solitary while
waiting for files to transfer.  I called and visited with Chuck Hyer about
getting a newer car.  He said that he would do some looking for us and call us
back.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

woke early this morning and couldn’t get back to sleep.  I did dose in the
recliner a little.  After breakfast I took care of the animals and then I
called Qwest and was on the phone with them for over ½ hour.  I scheduled our
services to be removed on March 1<sup>st</sup>.  I expressed my feeling of
disappointment with their services and also told them that I would be moving to
California which is outside their services.  They did agree to wavy the early
disconnect charges because of my dissatisfaction and also moving.  Bob will
probably keep his services with them.  Mae and I drove Bryce’s Buick to
Jennie’s where we bought some remedies.  We then went to the Good Earth Health
store.  Next we took the Buick over to Dee’s and had his mechanic take a ride
in it.  He felt that if we got into it for under $1,500 we couldn’t go to
wrong.  We next went to a detailing shop in Layton and got an estimate to have
the Buick cleaned up.  We stopped at Deseret Book store in Layton where Mae
bought some books.  When we got home Bryce was there to get the car.  We are
still not sure if we should continue with the Buick but I feel like I should
wait for Chuck to get back together with us.  Bob had looked at a car at
Beutler Auto so we went over there and looked at a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria that
has 36,000 miles on it.  It really looks nice and drove quite nice but it would
cost us $55,000 plus tax and licensing.  They also had another car we looked at
for a little less.  I don’t know why but I just didn’t feel good about it.  This
evening went fast as we looked at some cars on ksl.com and I got the pictures
of our car ready for Mae to advertise on ksl.com.  I filled out this entry and
quite for today.</span></p>

at Hertz that look good that I will check out in the morning.  We watched half

woke before 4AM thinking about the cars and when I got up, Mae also woke.  We
tried to go back to sleep but finally decided that we should get up.  Mae
wanted to get some apples put up before we leave, so we worked together and got
10 quarts of apple sauce out of the apples that we had remaining from what we
got from Gale’s Mother.  We then went into Ogden and picked up some of our supplements
from Nancy.  I tried to call Charles Hyer but could not get through to him.  We
next tried to reach the Clark’s to see if they had a new phone number for the
Hyer’s but they were also not answering their phone.  We drove up to Soda
Springs in Idaho.  Just as we entered Soda Springs Kathleen called and gave us
Charles’s phone number.  Before we could call Charles he called us.  He gave me
directions to Can Do Auto sales.  We looked at the 2003 Buick and decided to
buy it.  Because of Charles Hyer we bought the car for 3,100 dollars.  We
stopped at a café that Charles also recommended.  After lunch we went upstairs
and went through a privet museum and enjoyed a few minutes there.  We came home
by way of the freeway and just west of Tremonton there was an accident. 
Several vehicles had already stopped but the police hadn’t arrived yet.  We
felt that there was too many people already there so we cautiously drove on.  The
police were there in just minutes.  The accident looked as if it was a one car
accident but looked quite serious.  As it got dark and I turned the head lights
on and we had other indications of problems show up.  It made me a little
nervous to have unexpected problems with the car.  Bob and I went Home Teaching
and did visit with all our familys.  It was about 9:30PM when we got back home. 
We were tired tonight, so soon went to bed.</span></p>

safety inspection which we need before we can get it licensed in Utah.  Dee
took it right in and called me back a little later and said that he had it all
fixed and passed.  That was great news for me.  After I had taken the car in I
fed the animals and then butchered three rabbits.  I then had Bob take me back
to get the car.  I took it to Farmington and got it registered but I didn’t
have the previous title so could not get the plates.  We will have to wait for
the title to come from Idaho.  I called Can Do Auto and asked them to get it
right out to me.  I got home just in time to change and attend the funeral
services for LaVern Larson.  The services were quite simple but very nice.  She
has fought a battle with cancer for 10 years and passed away last Sunday
morning.  Her husband, Richard will surly miss her for he has taken such good
care of her through it all.  This afternoon I cut up, bottled and pressure
cooked the three rabbits.  Mae had made Yummy Potatoes for the funeral and so
made a dish for Scott and Mishelle.  Almost all of Scott’s family is sick with
a fever and feels sick.  We watched some shows on TV while we worked here in
the kitchen.  Mae wrote Chuck and Karen a thank you card for all they have done

done today.</span></p>

and did a good job.  It was late when we got home.</span></p>

went to Kylan’s basket ball game that started at 9AM.  It was a very good game
and we enjoyed watching the two teams.  It was a close score but Kylan’s team
won and we they excited.  When we got home I took care of the animals.  At 11
AM Mae went to the Clearfield Swimming pool where she met Jeff and his family
and they went swimming.  I loaded the rabbits into carrying pens and took them
to meet Dian Taylor and her husband.  They were later than they had expected
but they took the buck, the two doe’s and the eight kits.  When we get back
they will give us a new buck and two does in exchange.  When I got back to the
swimming pool Mae and Jeff’s family were just coming out.  Mae and I went to
Cricket where we purchased a broadband internet receiver for our laptop.  We
came home and got things packed and went over to Jeff and Gail’s.  We enjoyed
the children and Jeff, Gail, Mae and I also played games until late.  We slept
at their place this evening.</span></p>

Jeff didn’t attend with us and we saw the strain that Gail had as she tried to
care for the two children without help.  Jeff did keep the baby home so that
was a help.  Mae tried to help Gail as much as she could.  The Sacrament
meeting was very enjoyable.  The High Councilman that spoke was especially
interesting as he talked about those that experienced tragic things, including
death or killing other in line of duty during war.  He then tied it into Family
History work and Temple work.  After Sacrament meeting Mae went to Jr. Sunday
School with Benji.  Gail took Rachael to her class and I attended Sunday School
class and Priesthood meeting.  When we got home we had a light lunch.  Jeff,
Benji, Mae and I went for a walk into the hollow that start behind their house
and goes down to the West for quite a ways.  There has been paved trails put
there so that it is a very nice walking trail area.  After we returned from the
hike we enjoyed a nice dinner.  This evening Mae, Gail, Jeff and I enjoyed
playing some games.  We were late getting to bed.</span></p>

had new windows installed throw out the upstairs.  I then had Bob follow me
with our new Buick and I drove the pickup to Murdock Chevrolet in Bountiful
where I had them Service the car and automatic transmission, check the tires,
repair the lining in the trunk and bought a new door lock transmitter.  When
Bob and I got home Mae and I lay down for a nap.  However the phone rang and
Mae got up to answer it.  I fell asleep so Mae didn’t come back to bed.  Bob
took both Mae and I back to Murdock’s about 4PM.  The car was finished and all
went well with the service.  The reason that the cornering lights didn’t work
is that the car didn’t come with that equipment.  Mae and I then drove to Bryce
and Deanna’s where we joined with Kim and Jeanenne, Georgia and Rick and the
six of us had dinner and then visited about memories of Mom and Dad Porter.  We
had a very enjoyable evening.  I goofed as we were all leaving.  We stayed
behind to visit with Bryce and Deanna about traveling together when we drive to
California.  Bryce and Deanna were suggesting that they travel very light so
they could take more of our luggage with them.  I didn’t handle it right and
Mae took offence to it and we drove home in silence.  It didn’t make for a good
ending but Mae and I finally talked it through.</span></p>

got up about 3:30AM and was still concerned about last night. I couldn’t go
back to sleep so went to the front room and finally slept in the recliner.  We
got up about 8:30AM and I had a 10AM appointment in Ogden.  Mae got breakfast
ready for me before I left.  I went to Praxair where I had my CPAP checked
out.  I got a new face mask and some filters for it.  When I left I drove past Dillard’s
and the thought came to me that this is where Dennis Ewing works.  Just then I
saw Dennis washing the front doors.  I stopped and visited with him for a few
minutes.  He said that he was doing fairly well but that Eleanor wasn’t doing
very well.  That is why they haven’t been able to attend any of the functions
where we have attended together as old friends.  Bob wanted me to help him with
the paper work that he needs to fill out to get the rebates for installing the
windows.  We also stopped at Universal Rental to check on the price of a car
dolly so that I could tow the Buick behind the pickup.  When we got home and I
told Mae that it would cost over $200. To rent it but that I would do that if
she couldn’t pack all she needs into the Buick.  I called Roy and asked him
about some questions on Bob and Carroll’s rebates.  We visited for a little
while.  After dinner this evening we did watch a little TV.  Mae also got on
the computer and did some research on the cost of Hotel rooms in St. George.  I
caught my journal up today and now it is time for bed.</span></p>

tried to download our checking accounts onto our laptop computer.  I doen’t
know what I did but I got things locked up on the computer.  I became quite
frustrated and finally just left it.  Bob needed help with the rebate on his
windows.  I had called Roy yesterday and then told Bob and Carroll that we
needed the information for their last year taxes.  They couldn’t find their Social
Security information so this morning Bob went into the S.S. Office in Ogden and
got copies.  I took my computers to Staples and got help from them with the
problems.  I went to Home Depot and picked up some items I needed.  When I got
home Mae was trying to help Bob with the papers he was to send to Roy and she
was getting quite upset also.  I finished getting the papers ready for him. 
This afternoon I trimmed the rose bushes down, ate lunch and then cut the tree
in the front parking down.  Bob helped me by loading the branches into the
truck.  We got the tree cut down and about half of it loaded.  We will have to
make a second trip to the dumps. Mae and I watched a show on TV while we ate
dinner.   Bishop stopped by and gave me a check to deposit into our Mission
Account.  I thought it would be for the full amount but it was for $1,200 which
is the amount for the first month.  I called Bishop Smith back and he called
Brother McPhie who had miss understood so they will give me another check.  Mae
got on the internet and made reservations for Bryce, Deanna, Mae and I to stay
in the Falcon Ridge Hotel in Mesquite, Nevada the night of March 1<sup>st</sup>. 
We couldn’t get the printer to work from the laptop again tonight.  I gave up
and wrote down the information.  I entered today’s journal.  Mae cleaned out

went down to Randy’s 60<sup>th</sup> Birthday open house.  After that we drove
up to David and Shauna’s where we stayed the night.  Shauna had a nice dinner
for us when we got there.  It was a very nice evening just relaxing and
visiting with their family.  Emily gave up her bed room for us and she and
Tyler slept in sleeping bags on the front room floor.  David expressed concerns
with his company.  His boss wants him to train the rest of the company’s reps

Tyler is one of his main players.  Tyler had a gun safety class to attend

they got there the other team was 9 to 0 on the score board.  David’s team did
quite well but could never get closer than 3 points to them and lost by that
margin.  After lunch Mae and I let David and Shauna go looking for some new
furniture while we stayed with the children.  I took a short nap but Jeff call
and woke me.  I caught up my journal this afternoon and I also called and
visited with Jackie Winterowd, my cousin.  They had just got home from a
vacation so had not seen Uncle Lee or Aunt Wilma yet.  She had talked to Tonna
and was told that both of their parents are doing quite well although they are
still in a nursing home.  Jackie gave me the phone number where I could call
Uncle Lee and Aunt Wilma, so I call them.  I visited with the two of them for a
few minutes and they seem to be doing fair for the age that they are.  We took
the children over to the church house where we played in the gym for a while. 
I played some basket ball with Tyler.  Conner brought his race car but he broke
the antenna when he got in the car.  I took a few minutes and repaired it.  Mae
played games with Conner and Emily.  When David and Shauna returned they told
us that David had just heard the news that his company had just received a huge
law suit against them.  David figures that this will have high negative effects
that may very well affect him.  Mae and I came home and soon took showers and
then watched a movie.</span></p>

be with us as much as she can before we leave.  I went to the credit union, got
gas, went to the post office, went to the auto parts and made a second stop to
the credit union to be sure that our credit cards will work when we go to

came over this evening and finished his income taxes.  They will be getting a
fair amount back this year.  This evening at 8:30PM Mae and I went to the Stake
President’s office where he set the two of us apart for our missionary calling.

tote and drive the pickup and pull the car.  When I called to rent the tote we
found out that U-Haul advised against pulling the 2003 Buick Lasabre with my
1997 Chevy3/4 ton pickup.  There for we could have no insurance on it.  I tried
several other ways and it would cost too much.  I brought the Buick down and
loaded it and we will get everything in especially with Bryce and Deanna’s
car.  Mae has been busy all day cleaning and packing.  We did lay down this
afternoon and take a nap.  I mailed a package to Shellie, bought us a Sub-Way
for dinner and bought me a couple of white shirts at Kohls.  Lanny called this
evening and I visited with him for a while.  I told him that I had visited with
Jackie and also his parents.  We visited for several minutes.  His company laid
him off a year ago because he was getting older and younger family members now
owned the company.  He said he is doing ok and hasn’t missed a day of work
since but it just makes him mad that they treated him that way after all the
years he has worked for them.  I guess we are going to ride the Trax to Salt Lake
in the morning so we had better get to bed before long.  Bishop Steadman called
just after we went to bed.  He said he was going to be in meetings in Salt Lake
all day so he would pick us up and take us and then he should be through about
the same time as us and would bring us back home.  We agreed on that plan.</span></p>

were up at 4:30AM to be ready when Bishop Steadman came.  It was nice riding
with him and we enjoyed the trip together.  We were at the designated meeting
place a little early but that was ok.  We enjoyed the seminar with Elder and
Sister Bretzing.  It was good to meet with them and get better acquainted.  Also
in the seminar were Elder and Sister Evans from Prescott Arizona. They will be
going to The United Kingdom to serve.  The first thing on the agenda was to
have our pictures taken.  I realized that I should have been in a dark suit and
I felt improperly dressed the rest of the day.  We each introduced our self. 
Kevin Pasker of Risk Management gave a presentation of farm safety.  Elder and
Sister Bretzing presented a video on Serving on a FRI Mission.   At dinner time
we were taken to the Joseph Smith Memorial building to the Garden Restaurant
for a very good dinner.  This afternoon we continued with more training and
wound up at 3:30PM.  I went to call Bishop Steadman but found that we had left

his answering service.  At 4:30PM we made contact with him and he soon came. 
During the day I felt that I should have worn a dark suit.  Because my dark
suit and to small I wore my light one.  While waiting for Bishop Steadman we
thought about going across the street to Mr. Mack’s but realized that I
wouldn’t have time for any alterations or the hemming of the pants.  When we
got home we were also concerned about the renewal of our Temple Recommends.  I
called Bishop Smith but he could not interview us this evening.  He had me call
Brother Mark McPhie his 2<sup>nd</sup> Counselor, and he said that he could
meet us at the office at 7PM.  We had time to go to Stake Executive Secretary
and get a key to the red chapel.  I talked to him about getting a member of the
Stake Presidency to sign our recommends and he said that President Mitchell
would be at our chapel so we could get him to interview us.  It all worked out
great.  When we mentioned that I needed a bark suit to Bob, he said he had
one.  Most of the suits that Bob has had doesn’t fit me but this one was just
perfect.  It looks like all our problems just worked out and we got everything
done that we needed.  We went to bed late with Mae not feeling very well.</span></p>

got up early to go to the Jordan River Temple to be with Bob and Cheryl Bottom
as they go through a session for Bob to receive his endowments.  When we woke,
I felt very rough, so I went back to sleep.  We later rode with Bob and Carroll
to the Temple and were able to attend their sealing.  This afternoon Bob and I
went over to Roy and picked up the rotor tiller that we purchased the other
day.  It looks like it will be a pretty good one.  Mae got her hair washed and
put up this afternoon and then went to Scott and Michelle’s.  She tended their
children while Scott and Michelle went out to eat.  It was 9:30PM before Mae
got home.  Bryce and Deanna came over and the two of us loaded most of our
luggage into the two cars.  Bob cooked liver and onions for he, Carroll and I
this evening.  After eating I went over to the Winegars to deposit our travel
check and looked for some canned sliced apples but they didn’t have any.  Mae
got her something to eat before we went to bed.</span></p>

fixed breakfast for us of bisques and gravy.  He also made us an apple pie,
using our sweetener, and he made gravy for our family party.  I cooked chicken
breast on the grill and put them in an electric oven.  I also finished packing
the car.  We went up to the red chapel where all our family (except Shellie’s
family and Logan) came and we had a Family birthday Party.  We did this so that
we can give all the Birthday presents now instead of mailing them.  After a
very great dinner, we opened gifts and then set up volleyball net and several
enjoyed a game.  That wound up at 5PM.  Mae and I went to the Hail Playhouse
and enjoyed Fiddler on the Roof.  It was 11:20PM before we got to Mike’s. 
Becky was still up waiting for Taylor to get home from a Stake dance.</span></p>

got up at 6:30AM and got ready for church.  Mae and I were so tired that we
only stayed for Sacrament meeting and then came home and took a nap.  When I
got up Mike and I went over to Costco and purchased some appt cards for our
IPod and a membership card for Mae and I.  Mike and I spent most of the day
putting applications into the IPod for Mae and I. </span></p>
