breakfast before I left for work.  She sure takes care of me.  Work went quite
well although different than I had planned.  Lee showed Elder Shaw and I how to
change the filters on the office, which we did.    I also gave Elder Shaw the
sprayer and introduced him to Roy who has control of the chemicals used to
spray for cockroaches.  I took Elder Shaw and Sister Shaw around to the homes
and showed them where they are.  Lee had a backhoe and operator dig the
trenches for the gas, electric, water and phone lines for the house and
duplex.  I had Hermodas work with him.  Mae made 5 cheesecakes this morning for
the birthday celebration and then Sister Shaw helped her serve it and ice cream
at 2PM for the monthly Birthdays.  I did get one meter box set this afternoon
and had Hermodas start painting the facesha on the houses.  I am having a pain
in my groan for the past few days.  Mae soon had dinner ready when I got home. 
After dinner I took a nap.  We then watched a “Big Valley” movie.  Sandi and
Shellie didn’t get here until after 8PM.  The evening quickly passed as we
visited, looked at the pictures that Sandi had on her camera but Shellie’s
camera was not compatible with our computer.  They gave me a Father’s Day gift
of a belt buckle knife.  Even best were the cards that came with the gift. 
They also gave us a special picture of the two of them in a Lake Tahoe frame. 
It was almost 11PM when we went to bed.  Good Night!</span></p>

morning and went to the West Coast.  We took the DVD of Hearst Castle with us
and watched it on the way.  We stopped at a beach and spent a few minutes there
before going on to Morro Bay where I took a nap in the car while the rest went
window shopping.  When they came back we got something to eat.  We took a boat
ride around the bay area and then went north to see the elephant seals.  It was
very windy and cold there so we didn’t stay very long.  We went up to Hearst
Castle and spent a while in the visitor’s center.  From there we went across
the road and ate our dinner at the Hearst Park.  We got home about 9:30PM.  We
started a game of Rook but finally gave it up to go to bed. Sandi and Mae went
to bed but Shellie and I stayed up visiting until 3AM.</span></p>

Mae, Shellie and I finished our game of Rook that we had started last night.  I
took the girls on a tour of the farm and showed them the houses we are
building.  Mae prepared a nice dinner and after eating we helped Sandi pack. 
Sandi left for home about 4:30PM.  We were going to go over to Lee’s and Kim’s
in Shafter at 5PM for a back yard barbeque prior to watching the Fire Works. 
We decided that we were still full from lunch so waited until 7:30PM instead. 
Shellie, Mae and I played a game of three handed Rook before we went.  The
fireworks were launched from the High School so Lee’s house as a good place to
watch them.  When we came back home we set out on the chairs on the patio and
let Jase set of a few fireworks that Mae had bought for him.  We were all tired
when we went to bed.  </span></p>

morning but we really didn’t get going until later.  We attended Church but the
attendance was off quite a bit.  We only had 6 children in nursery today and it
was much easier today.  When we got home this afternoon we all went in and took
a nap.  For dinner this evening Mae made Hawaiian Hay Stacks and it was sure
good.  Mae and Shellie did up the dishes and then we played Rook.  I popped pop
corn and Mae made smoothies.  The weather was so nice that we went for a walk. 
Jase and Shellie brought their dart guns and were running through the trees
shooting each other.  Shellie sure seems to be a good mother.  When we got back
home we held Family Home Evening.  We centered the theme on the 4<sup>th</sup>
of July.  Shellie gave us a lesson and did such a good job in explaining the
reason we celebrate the 4<sup>th</sup>.  I fear that we have great reason to be
concerned about those freedoms that so many have fought and given their life’s
for us to have the freedoms that this Nation had enjoyed for so many years but
are now being taken from us by those that have been elected to protect those
very freedoms.  Our president in my opinion is nothing short of being a trader
to our country and an evil man.    Before Shellie went to bed she wrote Garrett
a letter and sent it by E-mail.  </span></p>

we have off as the 4<sup>th</sup> was on a Sunday, so we slept in and I didn’t
have to go to work.  I still woke by 5:30AM but let Mae and Shellie sleep in. 
I woke still worrying about the closet for the washer and dryer in the duplex. 
I don’t think they are deep enough.  As I read my scriptures this morning I
still wonder where we went “so wrong” as we raised our children.  We love our
children and constantly pray for each one of them but Sandi, David and Jeff
sure have us concerned.  We played several games of Rook and Rummy today.  We
played a couple of games of Jenga with Jase.   I did take a nap for ½ hour as I
woke early this morning.  It has been fun and very enjoyable being with
Shellie.  Jase is quite creative and likes to make things.  It's after 9:30PM
so I will get to sleep.  Good night!</span></p>

sleep in.  Mae had most of my lunch put together and most of my breakfast.  I
stopped at the Kimberlina shop on the way to work and got some ice.  Don, the
electrician, was there and Lee decided that he and his men should pull the
wiring and that is fine with me.  We started hanging doors but I needed some
things from Home Depot plus the electrician needed some things so I went there
during my lunch.  I am not sure just how much I can leave to Elder Shaw.  His
work style is different than mine so it seems different.  We are ready to start
on the roof in the morning.  When we started to put the first door in the ruff
framing was 1 inch low.  I had to cut the header off an inch and that was quite
a job.  As we hung the third door we realized that the door jamb was the wrong
size.  I called the lumber company and took the door back.  We are not sure why
it is wrong but will order another one.  I came on home and took care of a few
items in the yard for Mae.  Shellie and Jase left for home by way of L.A. as
Shellie wanted to stop to buy some items for her movie room.  Mae went to
Bakersfield this morning and she was able to find her way without using the
GPS.  She is being more secure each day as she has to drive in Bakersfield.  I
love her more each day and she is so special to me.   While eating dinner this
evening we watched the third episode of Big Valley.  I entered this entry and
went to bed early so that I could get up at 3AM so we can get started with the
roof by 5AM.  </span></p>

after laying in bed worrying about the job.  I went into the job sight at 4:14
AM.  The first thing I did was to check the doors that we hung yesterday and
they are swinging the right way.  I next built a cutting board for the cutting
of shingles.  When it got light we started on the house roof and got the north
side of the house about 85% completed when it got too hot to continue.  Before
coming home I went to Home Depot and purchased a washer and dryer set for the
duplex along with some other materials.  I will be able to run the dryer vents
out the side and therefore should be able to get it into the closet.  After getting
home I called the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in regards to a letter we
received for them yesterday.  I also called Dr. Hudson’s office and had the
receptionist add to my notes that I would like to also be checked for a
possible hernia when I go in for an appointment of Friday.  With the Dr. Office
I was able to get things taken care of right away but with the power and gas
co. I have been waiting for over 40 minutes for a return call.  I started a
letter to Sandi but didn’t get it finished and will have to pray about it
before I finish it.   I took a shower and then called Mae to find out where she
was.  She was still doing shopping.  I slept for about an hour.  When I woke
Mae was home and putting things away.  She prepared some dinner and we again
watched a movie.  This evening we watched “Roman Holiday” with Gregory Peck
Audrey Hepburn and although we have seen it many times we still enjoy it very
much.  Mae is such a special person and is so good and caring to me.  Bob
called and asked about coving the flooring in the kitchen and washroom.  I told
him that he should as it will be more water resistant.  It sounds like the work
is coming together and our apartment will soon be refinished.  Bob will sure be
glad when it is done.  I have got to get up early again for work.  I hope that
I will feel ok to work as I am sure that I have a hernia.</span></p>

Hernandas and I worked on the roofing getting about ½ of the north side of the
duplex done by the time it got so hot to work on the roof.  I hung the door on
the hot water heater room on the house.  I stopped at Floyd’s on the way home
to get some materials but they didn’t have what i needed so came on home.  I
showered and then was going to take a nap but about then Per and his family
arrived.  They brought us a gift of Ghirardelli Chocolate Squares and do they
look good but I am sorry to say that I had better not eat them.  I took them
over to the plant and Travis took us on a tour of the plant.  I then showed
them some of the orchards before we came home.  Mae had a fantastic dinner
ready when we got home.  We visited for a while and then played cards for a
little while.  It was after 11PM when we went to bed.  It has really been

today because of a Dr’s appointment.  We were able to sleep in until 6:30AM and
then we got up and prepared breakfast.  I also woke up with a head cold.   After
breakfast we did up the dishes and then Mae and I had to leave so I could get
to my Dr’s appointment.  We told Per that they could use the washer and dryer
to clean some clothes and when they were ready to leave they could just lock
the door and leave.  My doctor is Dr. Hudson at the Stockdale Medical Center. 
I was quite impressed with him.  He is running some blood work for signs of
colane censer and he checked me for a hernia and I do have one.  He will send
the information to a surgeon for his recommendation.  It looks like I will have
to take it easer and will need an operation to repair the hernia.  I called Lee
to let him know the results and he was not going to let me do any more work
until I was better.  I convinced him that I could still do light work but he
warned me about lifting.  Dr. Hudson wants me to get a hernia support and said
that I should be able to get one at Wal-Mart or Walgreen’s but neither had
them.  We had to go to a medical supply store.  We ate at Denney’s for lunch
and though it was fair, it was a long time getting our order.  Sub-Way would
have been better, cheaper and quicker.  When we got home I took a nap.  Mae
prepared a nice dinner for the full time Elders and Elder and Sister Shaw.  I
had Elder Shaw give the prayer and blessing on the food.  In his prayer he
especially mentioned the Full Time Elders and the comment was made after that
all six of us are on a full time calling as missionaries.  That is a good
feeling.  The dinner was very good and we enjoyed the Elders.  They shared with
us and we enjoyed their love.  After they left Elder Shaw, Sister Shaw, Mae and
I played a game of Mormon Bridge.  It was after 10PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

At the last minute I decided to go to church with Mae but I did not go in with
the little children for concerns of my cold.  I felt guilty enjoying Sunday
school class and Priesthood meeting and participating in the discussion.  I did
stick my head in the nursery and Mae assured me that she was ok so I didn’t
stay with her.  She only had six children again this week.  We came home and
took a rest before eating dinner.  After eating and doing up the dishes we laid
down and slept for over an hour.  When we got up we did some work on the
pictures and then watched the DVD “Finding Faith in Christ”.  We enjoyed it so
much that we watched it twice.  We called Brad to wish him a Happy Birthday but
he was not there so we just left the wish on his answering recording.  We had
fruit and toast this evening.  Mae called some of the family.  I talked to Bob
about the restoration project and he is somewhat frustrated but I think it is
coming out ok.  Well I will be getting up early so I had better get to bed.  </span></p>

the washer and dryer rooms to add vents above the doorways into the hallways. 
Hermandos and I continued roofing.  Lee was trying to be sure that I did not
hurt myself so jokingly I told him he had a lot of other important duties to
worry about so I wouldn’t hold him up and that I would be ok.  We finished the
north side of the duplex roof and started on the south side of the houses roof
before it got too hot to continue working on the roofs.  There were some
questions about an inspection of the newly relocated sewer pit but before the
day was over I think that it was worked out.  The ruff-in inspection of the
house was approved with the correction of the vent problem.  The electricians
are working on the duplex and we hope they will have it ready for inspection by
tomorrow.  I was in contact with the lumber yard concerning the doors and
windows.  I will probably meet with them tomorrow.  Elder Shaw put the locks on
the house so that it can now be locked up.  Well almost as the bathroom window
is still off.  I stopped at Floyd’s in Shafter for some electrical parts but
they didn’t have what I needed so I came home, showered and changed and Mae and
I went into Home Depot in Bakersfield and got them.  We then went out to eat at
the sizzler before coming home.   When we got home we watched another JAG

at 5AM and was able to complete the shingling of the house before it got to
hot.  I was able to keep both Elder Shaw and Hermandos busy helping me.  I went
to the Home Depot in Delino for some supplies.  When I returned Elder Shaw and
I met with Lee and discussed some of the next steps to be done in the project. 
Before leaving for home I filled my truck and elder Shaw’s truck with gas.  I
was very tired when I got home so after showering Mae had me take a nap.  She
let me sleep for over an hour.  When I got up Mae had a very nice dinner
ready.  We ate as we watched another JAG series.  We are enjoying this series
and with having them on DVD we don’t have to worry about setting our schedule
in order to see them but can watch them at our convenience.  After the show I
lay on the chee machine while Mae read from the General Conference Reports in
the Ensign.  As I read from the Scriptures and especially from The Book of
Mormon and Conference talk my mind continuously wonders what I might do to get
my children to study these writings.  We have so many concerns for Sandi, David
and Jeff but recognize no changes.  Why oh why????  Well it’s about time for me
to get to sleep.  Mae got her hair done this morning.  She got it cut and was
given a permanent.  She is sure a good wife.  I am afraid that I often fall
short of being worthier of her.</span></p>

again this morning and got quite a lot done on the roof of the duplex.  When it
got hot we got off and started with other items.  Lee had Harmondos fill the
water line trench back in.  He also had his backhoe operator level out the area
that we will move the fifth wheel to in back of the units we are building.  I
lined the stucco co. up to start on Friday.  We will have to add some blocking to
the gable end eves before they can start.  I picked up some 2 X 4’s and at the
same time ordered the interior doors for both units.  I asked about the one
exterior door that we have never got correct yet.  They are sure they will be
able to deliver it on Friday.  I got a call from the surgeons’ office and set
an appointment with Dr. Moon for an evaluation tomorrow at 4:30PM.  When I left
this morning for work I noticed that the sprinklers are not adjusted correctly
so when I got home, this afternoon, I corrected some of them.  I took a nap
before dinner.  Mae had a cabbage casserole ready for dinner.  She is sure good
to me and does everything she can to make it possible for me to do this work. 
Lee got a letter from Elder and Sister Judd as well as Mae called them while I
was taking my nap.  It sounds like Tharon’s is going to be in the casts for
another four weeks.  The bones are not mending as fast as they had hoped.  This
evening we watched a Big Valley show.  I filled out this journal entry before
taking my shower and going to bed.</span></p>

at 5AM.  We did well and just about finished but it got to hot and Lee brought
a fork lift and we moved Shaw’s trailer over to the back of the houses.  We
needed an extension cord size 18 / 3 WG 25’ long so I went to Home Depot and
bought the materials to assemble the cords.  When I got back I had 18 / 3 but
did not have the ground.  I had to go back but they didn’t have what I needed
so I bought a single 18 GA. wire and assembled it.  That gave me just time to
get home and ready to go to my appointment with the Dr.  From there we went to
the Kaiser Clinic and got some lab work done.  We stopped and had dinner at
Sizzler.   We met Brother &amp; Sister Rosales and her mother there.  They were
sitting behind us.  She was the former Relief Society President and he was the
branch president in the Spanish Branch and is now the Gospel Doctrine Teacher,
and a very good one.   As we were on the way home Linda called and is just
about to our place.  We were behind them so they pulled over until we caught up
with them and then they followed us on home.  We visit for a while before going
to bed.   </span></p>

until 7AM but was still able to complete the roof before it go to hot.  The
crews from Kennion Stucco Company came and started the preparation of the homes
for the stucco.  The county inspector came to inspect the duplex.  He was quite
upset saying that we hadn’t inspected any of the work since the slab and now we
even had the roofing on.  I told him that we had called and had the inspectors
out on each phase.  We got the paper work out and none of the subsequent
inspections had been signed off on.  I told him that they had been done and
told him of the problem we had with the septic tank and pit being inspected
twice and not recorded.  I also told him that each time we have had an
inspector it was someone different.  We talked for some time and he finally accepted
and signed off on all the previous inspections and as he walked through the
duplex was very satisfied that the work was well done and met all codes or
above.  He then asked about the hand carts, that we have stored near the
project, and that gave me a chance to explain a little about the Pioneer Saints
crossing the plains to the Salt Lake Valley and that we give the youth a chance
to a mini experience as to what our ancestors went through for their Faith. 
All in all when the inspector left he was feeling much better than when he
came.  The rest of the day went well and everything is moving along.  I was
going to get away from work before 3PM but didn’t make it until after 3PM.  I
stopped at Pro-Built Lumber and although Chase had left for the day they still
gave me some scrap 4 X 4’s.  I wanted them for a Primary project Mae wants to
do this Sunday.  After getting home I took a short nap and ate dinner and then
Mae and I went into Bakersfield to get chest x-rays prior to the operation next
Friday.  When we got home we watched a movie on DVD, “Teachers Pet” with Doris
Day and Clark Gable.  We had not seen this movie before but really enjoyed it. 
Mae is sure a wonderful Wife and Sweetheart.</span></p>

in; in fact I woke for a while and then went back to bed.  Mae got up a little
later and she got up, letting me sleep even later.  I did get over to Lee’s
shop and cut 3 inch blocks out of the 4 X 4’s I got yesterday.  Mae and I
worked together gluing prints onto the blocks.  Later we watched “North to
Alaska” and another JAG series.  While we watched the shows, Mae colored the
pictures we had glued onto the blocks.  I told her that I couldn’t understand
how she could watch a show and color at the same time.  The blocks sure turned
out cute.  </span></p>

early this morning and soon had our class room organized for today.  We had
time to attend choir practice.  The choir sand in meeting today.  The program
in Sacrament meet centered on the YW camp program that the YW attended this
past week.  Nursery went well as we only had six children there again this
week.  I had my watch so I could check on the time.  I finally told Mae that
the time was sure going slow today.  She checked her watch and said that we
only had 15 minutes left.  I realized that my watch had stopped for it showed
that we still had an hour before it would be over.  What a relief it was to be
about over.  After meeting Mae went with me to visit Brother Manuel Macias.  He
was not home but his wife, Camilla was there and we visited with her.  She
reminded us that she is Catholic and wasn’t going to change.  I gave her a copy
of the CD of “Finding Faith in Christ” and told her that anyone that believed
in Christ would enjoy and appreciate it.  She took it and said that maybe she
would watch it.  We came home and took a nap.  We planned on just a short nap
but we were both very tired and slept longer.  Mae finally woke and we were
going to get up but I fell back to sleep and slept until Mae called me for
dinner.  After dinner I made prints of three of our primary children so that we
can add them to our poster.  We watched one of the “Big Valley” series.  I
called Jeff but he didn’t answer so I just left a message.  I called Sandi and
Nick.  Nick will start his new job in the morning.  I guess he will work 5 - 12
hour days.  Chelci and Steve are moving in with Sandi and Nick while they build
them a new home.  Chelci is pregnant and should have a new baby on the 23 of
February.  I hope this will be for the best.  Well it’s 9:15 PM so we had
better go to bed.</span></p>

wash the sheets and pillow cases so we had to take the bed back to pieces.  I
got to work before 8AM and Elder Shaw and I started blocking the gable eves. 
When we finished that we finished the ceiling insulation in the house.  We were
going to go to Home depot and buy the wall insulation but set down for a break
and ended us quitting for the day.  I had to shower when I got home to get the
insulation dust off of me.  I took a nap while dinner finished cooking.  We
watched two documentaries about the Sound of Music and the Von Trap Family.  We
found them very interesting and enjoyed both of them.  Mae did up the dishes. 
We have a gofer that is making quite a mess with our yard so I put out some
more bait for him.  We read an article in the Ensign and Jeff called us which

bags.  They came up with a different insulation to substitute but it was almost
3 times the price.  I told the ones at the pro-desk that I couldn’t accept
that.  They came up with another that came more in line with the budget so we
got that.  After leaving I thought that I should have bought the 13 bundles
anyway.  It was almost 6PM when I got home.  After showering and shaving, Mae had
dinner ready.  We watched “Twelve O’ clock High” staring Gregory Peck.  While
watching the show I also filled capsules.  It was after 10PM when we went to

before noon so took a shower before lunch.  Mae went with me to Bakersfield for
a pre-op physical.  We then went to Wasco and got a chiropractic treatment for
each of us.  We stopped at the grocery store for a few items before coming

at 3AM to use the bathroom.  Although I was still tired did not feel like
laying back down in bed.  I got comfortable in the recliner and fell back to
sleep for a while.  I heard Mae up at 7AM and so we cuddled up in bed for a
little while.  She felt so good in my arms.  I went back to sleep and slept
another hour or so.  When I woke Mae soon had waffles cooked for breakfast.  We
watched a couple of “Big Valley” series.  Mae called the nurse and she said “It
was ok to remove the main bandaging.”  That is all I needed to remove it.  Mae
also made some others calls, and Georgia called her and they visited for quite
a while.  They need some time together but I am concerned about the use of the
phone.   I had gotten up and was walking around the house a little and looked
out the kitchen window and saw a semi truck pull up in front with a large piece
of equipment.  As I watched, I recognized that it was one of the shock wave
machines used to shake the Pistachios from the trees.  I was very interested in
it because it looks like the same shock wave machines for the almonds except
that it has large butterfly wings that can hydraulically fold around the tree
to catch the nuts before they fall onto the ground.  We took pictures of it and
was amazed to see the operation of the trailer that carried it because the
driver stopped the unit and then started up a small gasoline engine which ran a
hydraulic pump which raised the trailer from the hitch of the tractor.  The
driver then drove the tractor forward a short distance, went back and lowered
the front of the trailer right to the ground so that he only had some small
ramps to put into place.  He then started up the shock wave and drove it off
into the yard.  Coming back to the trailer, he again used the hydraulic pump to
raise the trailer back up, backed the tractor until the trailer locked into
position.  The entire unloading of the machine took less than half an hour.   We
were very impressed with the efficiency of the equipment and the driver.  The
driver knew just what to do and he quickly did it.   I worked on a couple of
stories but I find I can’t sit at the computer very long as it hurts too much. 
This afternoon we watched a couple of series of “Big Valley.”  And after
dinner, we watched the movie “Audie Murphy”.  I had to have Mae finish up this
journal entry for me.</span></p>

trying to find a way to set at the computer, so far it has not been comfortable
to do so.  It was late when we went to bed last night.  I slept until 4AM and
then had to get up.  I tried to lie back down but was so uncomfortable that I
got back up.  I went to the recliner and was able to sleep until 7AM.  I am
continually amazed when I read from the Book of Mormon and just wish that we
had a Moroni to lead us.  Monday I received a letter requesting help to stop
legislation from being passed that will take away religious freedoms in the
work place.  This restricts any employer or employee from having so called discrimination
against homosexuals or lesbians.  This goes so far as not allowing individuals
to have a picture of one’s own family displayed at his or her work station or
computer screen.  How far will the evils take over our government before
someone can stop it?</span></p>

Mae’s help I took a shower this morning.  Yesterday, after checking with the
nurse, I removed the main bandage from my stomach and it sure helps with
comfort.  I am still very sore, swollen and black and blue through my groan
area and stomach. I can’t sit longer so will add more later.  I asked Mae if
she would go to Bakersfield and pick me up the conference DVDs and a phone for
me at T Mobile.  She was gone a couple of hours doing this, during which time I
watched a rerun of the movie, Audie Murphy.  Mae cooked us some beans, which we
had for lunch along with avocados and rice cakes.  I watched Elder Perry and
Elder Kristofferson’s talk.   Shellie called I did take a short nap this afternoon. 
We ate supper and watched another Jag series and then watched it again in order
to totally understand the story.  Mae &amp; I played a couple of card games
this evening.  We watched a Lassie show.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I
haven’t felt very comfortable today and cannot find a good position to be in. 
Mae tries to take care of me but I am afraid that I am quite a pain.  I didn’t
expect this outcome.  Mae tells me I just need to have patients.  I watched the
last of the 2<sup>nd</sup> session of Saturday afternoon’s General Conference
and really enjoyed that.  Before turning the DVD player off I found out how I
had missed the Saturday morning session.  Before evening we watched a JAG show
but did not get all the plot so we replayed it and this time understood the
full plot.  Before going to bed I challenged Mae to a game of Rummy.  Tonight I
won quite easily.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                This
morning I showered doing a full shower and it really felt good.  I read the 53<sup>rd</sup>
chapter of Alma this morning and though I love those chapters this morning I
became very depressed.  I couldn’t get the feeling of failure in raising my
family from over shadowing me.  Mae with her very special TLC helped me more
than she know.  Mae went into town before noon and while she was gone I watched
the first of Saturday morning Conference.  When Mae returned we re-watched it
as President Monsen’s and President Packered’s talks were so good.  I called
David to ask him about his leg and it looks like he may be laid up for several
weeks with the operation to repair the damages.  He strongly advised me to
follow the Doctors directions in my recovery.  I also asked David about the
Medical Will and ask if he would be the first Agent with Mae and I being 2<sup>nd</sup>
Agent and then Bishop Birch, our Bishop here in Wasco, being 3<sup>rd</sup>. 
UPS delivered our new blender to replace the first one we bought.  Using some Q
tips and rubbing alcohol I cleaned up two DVD that we had written on with red
markers.  It did wash off and we were able to watch the shows ok.  I visited
with Rich using the loaner phone to see how it worked.  When I was talking to
Elis and Rich I got an echo of my voice so I called Bob and it was clear.  This
evening I called Mike and visited with him about the wills.  We had a good
visit.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I
slept fair last night.  Mae prepared breakfast and then she had to leave at
9AM.  Mae met the Shaw’s and they went to Delano to attend the Baptismal of
Taylor Lamoreaux and Austin Birch.  They are both youth from our Ward.  I just
stayed home.  When Mae came home the Shaw’s had given her a package of roasted
almonds and loaned her some DVD’s.  I had watched the Saturday morning session
of last General Conference.  This afternoon I watched “Saints &amp; Soldiers”,
one of the DVD loaned to us.  This morning I did work a little while on the
house plans, figuring the sheetrock specifications for the two buildings.  Mae
told me that the Shaw’s worked until 7PM yesterday getting the insulation
installed.  Mae tried to call Elanor Ewing but only got the answering machine. 
Mae also spent some time working on histories of our family.  Much of her time
is also spent in caring for my every need.  She is so special to me.  We
showered and went to bed.  I don’t feel the best this evening but I am afraid
that most of my problems are feeling sorry for myself.</span></p>
