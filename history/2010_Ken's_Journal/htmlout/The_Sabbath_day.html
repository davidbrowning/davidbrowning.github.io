<p class=MsoNormal>The Sabbath day</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9/12/2010 7:39 PM</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today has been a very challenging day for
me.  I do not know if I will do anything with this paper or not but I am going
to try to write down my feelings to see if it will help me personally with my
feelings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We were woke this morning at day break with
the sounds of equipment.  It took a minute for my mind to register what was
happening.  I know that today was Sunday and suddenly I realized that the
equipment was going to the pistachio orchard to harvest.  I had been told that
when the harvest started it would be a continual busily of noises and commotion
around our place.  It had not entered my mind that it included the Sabbath. 
Last week in our Fast and Testimony meeting I felt impressed that I should bare
my testimony as to importance of observing the Sabbath.  I told of a Brother in
our Ward when I was a youth and how he had all his years work threatened to be
lost because he would not let men work on his farm on Sunday.  I remember of
his testimony on how the Lord blessed him because of his Faith.  Ever since I
can remember I have been taught the importance of observing this commandment. 
I remember listing to all the Prophets speak on this subject.  I don’t know
just when the Primary song “Saturday is a Special Day” has been an importance
song taught to the children.  I remember lessons from my youth in Sunday school
and Priesthood classes.  I remember my Priest Advisor giving us a lesson on the
need to observe the Sabbath Day.  He said that sometimes the “ox may get in the
mire” but if we had to work or do anything in which we made a profit on the
Lords day, he suggested that we owed that gain to the Lord because it was
earned on the Lords day.  The next week he said that he had to repent, he had
never been tested so quickly; as when he returned home from giving that lesson;
he had a man come to his home needing to buy an item that my adviser sold in
his profession.  He said that he did everything he could to get the man to wait
until Monday morning but to no avail.  He therefore donated his commission to
the Lord before he came to Priesthood meeting.  When I returned from the Air
Force, jobs were very hard to find.  I went up to my brothers in Idaho hoping
to work for him but his work was very slow also.  After some time I was offered
a job at a service station but was told that I would have to work Sundays.  Not
knowing what else to do I accepted the job.  On the first Sunday I felt so
guilty, that on Monday morning when I went back to work I went to the boss and
told him that I had to resign.  When I told him that I just couldn’t feel good
about working on the Sabbath, he said I told you what was expected before he
gave me the position.  I apologized, but said that I couldn’t do it.  He
thought for a minute and said that he had another employee that came to him
asking for more time so he would let him have the Sunday shift and I could work
Monday thru Friday.  When I first went to work for the Church Farm, I was told
that because of the cost of starting up the irrigation pump, also because the
wheel lines were very venerable to the wind if they were empty, that I would
have to keep the pump running 24 hours a day.  To change the irrigations was at
best a three hour job.  I also had about 100 heifer calves that I raised so had
to feed and care for every day.  The first year every Sunday I felt that the
“Ox was in the mire” and so took care of these items daily.  I always felt a
little guilty at these chores but then one Sunday a widow who lived across the
street from the farm; asked me “Why is it ok for the Church Farm to require
work and yet teach that we should observe the Sabbath?”  That really caused me
some reflection and from then on I did everything possible to prepare things so
as to minimize the work required on the Sabbath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Earlier on a Sunday morning we were woke
with sprayers spraying the orchard.  When I asked about that I was told that
because of the need to get the spraying done, they had to hire an independent
contractor to spray the orchard and he worked seven days a week or he wouldn’t accept
the job.  I think that I rationalized that South Valley Farm wasn’t doing the
work so maybe it was up to the independent contractor.  Again with the harvest
of the pistachio, independent contractors will be involved.  This time my mind
will not accept the rationalization I used before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I am sure that there are many things that I
do not understand about the pistachio operations.  This call to serve on a nut
farm has been a very educational challenge to me.  I talked to Lee and to Jay
about the problem and both explained that the pistachios are a perishable
crop.  I just can’t convince myself that there can’t be away around the
problem.  From my understanding the pistachio orchard is the original orchard
for this farm and the farm was started about 20 years ago.  It is hard for me
to feel that in 20 years we can’t solve this problem except for a lack of
Faith.  I really wonder if the presiding authorities are aware of the situation
and what is happening.</p>
