style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I got up at 4:30AM
and started the day.  It was 5:30AM when we got away to San Francisco.  I put
the GPS on but Linda didn’t trust it and was afraid that it would take us the
wrong way.  As it was the only mistake was because the GPS said that I should turn
one way and Linda told me the opposed way.  I followed Linda and the GPS was
right.  It helped us several times today.  Mae and Linda had decided the places
that we wanted to see today and we made all of them.  First we went to the
Golden Gate Bridge, next to Lombard Street to the Worlds Crookest Street and
drove down it.  We went to Pier 39 on Fisherman’s Wharf where we ate lunch. 
Mae and I then took a cruise on the bay.  As we sailed away from the pier,
there were lots of seals lying on floating docks.   We went under the Golden
Gate Bridge and around Alcatraz Prison.  There was a narrative telling all
about everything we saw and how it was in the 1800s.  It was very interesting
and great to see these sights.  From here we went to Fisherman’s Wharf and walked
around.  Linda and Mae were going to walk to Ghirardelli Square and Roy &amp; I
were going to pick them up there, but by the time we got there I realized it
was way too far for Mae &amp; Linda to walk so I called Mae and told them we
would come pick them up.   We parked the car and went inside.   Linda bought
some chocolates, she even bought a dark chocolate bar for Mae.  We then went to
where we could ride a cable car.  Roy didn’t want to ride the cable car and
said he would pick us up at the end.  We had a hard time finding a place to
park so we could find out where Roy would pick us up so we could put it in the
GPS and he could follow that to where we would be.  We had to wait 45 minutes
so Linda stood in line while Mae made arrangements with us.  By the time Mae
and I got back to Linda, she was pretty stressed as she was ready to board the
cable car.  We had been longer than she thought we would be.  We were worried
about Roy finding his way in all that traffic even with the GPS as he wasn’t
used to one.  He looked pretty worried when we walked away.  Both Mae and I
offered a silent prayer and it worked out just fine.  We had a great time on
the cable car and when we called Roy, he was able to meet us.  The last place
we wanted to go was to China Town.  It was dark by now and we were hungry so
wanted to eat there.  We parked in a parking garage and walked until we found a
Chinese restaurant.  The food was very good and so was the atmosphere.  It was
fun to see China Town at night with all the colorful lights and decorations and
shops.  San Francisco was great to see both day and night.  With the help of
our GPS, w e drove to our motel in Oakland.  It’s been a great day, but we are
all very tired.</span></p>

and I woke at 7:25AM.  This way we were able to shower and shave before Roy and
Linda got up.  We packed up and went up to the office where we checked out and
got some of their continental breakfast.  The only thing I tried was a little
orange juice as everything else contained sugar.  Mae had some left over’s from
the Chinese dinner we had last night that she heated for me.  We went up to the
Oakland Temple and enjoyed see that beautiful Temple.  We then left for Fresno,
stopping for something to eat and another pit stop for restrooms.  I missed a
turn off as we had turned the volume down on the GPS and we lessoned to an
account of “Seven Miracles That Saved America” on CD.  We didn’t get to Roy and
Linda’s until 2PM and then it took a few minutes to get the TV set so we could
receive the Conference so we missed this morning session and half of the
afternoon session.  I took a nap before the Priesthood session.   Roy and I
went to Costco and returned the water closet to the toilet they are installing in
their bathroom.  From there we went to the Stake Center where we watched the
Priesthood Session of General Conference.  When we got home we ate dinner that
Mae prepared and then I finished installing their toilet.  I got in their hot
tub for about ½ hour.  Mae was too tired to join me.  I then typed up this
entry before going to bed about 10PM.</span></p>

morning in time for breakfast and then watch the morning General Conference
Session.  After the morning session ended I took a nap.  We did some packing
and then ate dinner while we watched the afternoon Conference Session. 
Conference as normal was wonderful with great and timely advice and direction. 
After conference we finished packing and drove home.  Roy and Linda let us take
a set of DVD’s entitled “Seven Miracles That Saved America” by Chris Stewart
and Ted Stewart.  We have sure enjoyed the first 5 out of 8 chapters.  It was
5:30PM when we got home.  We unpacked and then I called Bob to see how they are
doing.  He brought Carroll home for the hospital this morning.  They took her
completely off the comedian as it was causing her to bleed internally.  I also
called Rich and Lois and they said the reception went well but the weather was too
hot.  Mae also called most of the children this evening.  I visited a little
with Jeff and Scott.  We down loaded the pictures that we took this weekend.  </span></p>

didn’t make it back this morning so I worked at the Kimberlina house by
myself.  I sometimes wonder if I am too particular about my work or not.  Today
I have been quite depressed wondering if I am doing anything that is eternally
worthwhile or not.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home so I just washed up
and showered later.  This evening we read from the Ensign and the Church News
and then we watched a Netflix movie “The Americanization of Emily” with James
Garner and Julie Andrews.  We entered our journals and went to bed.</span></p>

gone off with the alert that a child had been abducted.  Later this morning
while I was driving I had the radio on and it told of a 4 year old girl that
had been abducted in Fresno last night.  That is about all I found out.  I
didn’t sleep very well after being waked up.  I went to Home Depot for some
supplies first thing and then Elder Shaw and I worked all day on the Kimberlina
home.  I was tired when I came home this afternoon.  Mae had dinner ready so we
ate and then I showered and shaved.  Mae had gone with some sisters to a
lunching in Bakersfield today.  We watched a John Wayne movie before going to

some trim on the cabinets he had installed in the upstairs offices at the
plant.  We did that first and then went to the home and started installing
sheetrock.  Lee came and helped us.  Most of the time I measured and cut the
sheetrock while Lee and Elder Shaw screwed the sheet rock to the joists. 
Although we ran out of sheetrock screws and I had to go to The Home Depot in
Delano for more screws, then the batteries ran out of power and we can’t find
the charger nor the extra batteries and Lee purchased the wrong screw driver tips,
we still got most of the house ceiling placed.  I went home and cleaned up and
we went back to the Shaw’s for dinner and FHE.  It was a wonderful meal and
Sister Shaw gave a beautiful lesson on “Simple Faith”.  When we got home I
worked on my journal and Mae prepared my lunch for tomorrow.  I am sure tired
tonight.</span></p>

on one side of the duplex and over half of the ceiling on the other side.  It
was 5PM when I got home this evening.  Mae went to Bakersfield shopping after
she helped Sister Shaw with the monthly Birthday party.  It was almost 6PM when
she got home.  I had already showered and shaved.  She had stopped at a Sub Way

day went good at school today.  I showered and shaved before dinner.  Mae had
prepared a very nice dinner along with getting the car washed and ready for the
trip tomorrow.  She is sure a blessing to me and I don’t know what I would ever
do without her to care for me.  We put a movie on and after it was ½ over we
got discussed with it and throw it in the trash.  We then put on a Big Valley

longer.  We were up and ready to leave for Wasco at 5:35AM to get the Elders. 
I helped Mae prepare our breakfast.  After getting Elder Ray and Elder Bills
and we drove to the Los Angeles Temple getting there at 8AM.  Both Elders were
escort for Spanish Brother’s that were going through for their first time.  We
got to see President and Sister Brimhall for just a few minutes when they came
into the Temple.  We went through the Spanish speaking session and so had the
head phones.  The headphones helped but it made it harder for me to concentrate
especially with not getting very much sleep last night.  After the session we
ate at the Temple cafeteria.  It was 5:30PM when we let the elders off at their
apartment.  They are sure cute young men.  We stopped and ate at the Chinese
Restaurant in Shafter to eat and found Elder and Sister Shaw there.  They had
been to Cub Scout training all day so had stopped to eat at the same restaurant. 
We enjoyed visiting with them.  It was 7:30PM when we got home very tired.  I
entered my journal entry before we went to bed.  Mae is sure special.  Good
night!</span></p>

couldn’t go back to sleep.  Mae got up and had me try.  We finally cuddled but
I’m getting old so that only discouraged me.  Mae gave me a hair cut after
breakfast and then I took a shower.  We attended choir practice before our
block meetings.  Sacrament meeting went well, after the Sacrament Brother
Magana and Brother Allred spoke.  Brother Magana’s talk was in Spanish so I
didn’t get much out of that but I sure enjoyed Brother Allred’s talk.  After
the Temple session being in Spanish and Brother Magana’s talk in Spanish I am
beginning to get a feeling of the difficulty it is to attend meetings in
another language that the one you understand.  The nursery went fair today but
that is the longest two hours I endure.  After meetings Mae and I visited
Brother Manuel Macias.  We had a nice visit with him.  He is struggling with
his testimony of the Church.  I really feel that he was never ready for baptism
into the Church.  When we got home we had left over’s for dinner.  Mae took a
nap but I don’t do well to lay down right after eating.  I called and talked to
Bob for a few minutes.  I then washed the dinner dishes.  Mae had some items
she wanted backed-up on the computer so I spent some frustrating time trying to
get that to work.   This evening we went for a walk and went down to the walnut
trees.  We picked a few walnuts and then walked on up to the canal and back
through the pistachio orchard.  As we walked it got quite dark and we could
hear the coyotes barking at each other and that did make us a little nervous. 
After getting home we took a shower and washed Mae’s hair.</span></p>

and when I went into the bathroom there was a note telling me that Mae hadn’t
slept well so I went in and got the alarm clock and shut it off before it went
off and would have awaken Mae.  I prepared my own breakfast and then roasted
some almonds and make almond butter, almond milk and just roasted and salted
some almonds for Mae.  She is able to eat the roasted nuts better than the raw
nuts.  Mae had my lunch all made last night so I just had to put it in my lunch
case.  Shortly before I left for work Mae woke up.  I am afraid that I keep her
worried and that is one reason that she doesn’t sleep the best.  I stopped at
Pro-Lumber on the way to work and got the doors ordered for the houses.  Elder
Shaw and I worked on the Kimberlina homes still putting doors and fixtures back
together along with some paint touch up.  I stopped at Floyd’s and got some
plastic plugs and some screws for the house tomorrow.  Mae was busy getting
ready for dinner and FHE when I got home.  She had baked some cookies for
desert, ones her and I could eat as she already had some for the Shaws, as she
made a double batch last Friday and gave part of them to the Elders on
Saturday.  They were very delicious and I had a couple before dinner.  I took a
shower and then took a nap.  Mae had a nice dinner ready and had invited the
Shaw’s for dinner and FHE with us.  Dinner was wonderful and Mae had a very
good message for our FHE lesson on Faith in Jesus Christ.  After the lesson we then
played a game of “Knock”.  After the Shaw’s left I helped Mae with the dishes. 
I then entered this entry before we went to bed.  Mae is sure a special wife
and sweetheart!</span></p>

installed a safety chain on the back door.  Mike called this evening and talked
to Mae.  They are in Park city this week as it is their twentieth wedding

well last night so I let her sleep in and I got myself ready for work.  Mae had
my lunch prepared and so I just got cereal out.  Mae woke up in time to eat
with me.  Lee had Elder Shaw and I help him hang cabinets and install the
trim.  That took us until lunch time.  We then worked on the Kimberlina house
until 2PM when we went to Shafter and picked up tables and chairs at Floyd’s
for a dinner held at the bowery for all the harvest employees.  The dinner was
completely catered so with our wives help we set up the tables and chairs and
put covering on the tables that we rented.  There were between 160 to 170
people in attendance at the dinner.  After the dinner we cleaned up the area. 
It was 6PM when we got home.  Mae had been into the Doctors for tests and then
had done some shopping before she came to help us.  We were tired when we got
home so I put on one of the early John Wayne shows and watched it.  While
watching the show I made up more capsules of our vitamins and minerals.  It was
about 10PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

could go to sleep so we finally got up.  Mae prepared French toast for
breakfast.  While doing so she got her finger in the beater and it hurt but
didn’t cut her.  Time seemed to go by fast and it was soon time to go to work. 
Elder Shaw and I first returned the table and chairs to Floyd’s and then worked
on the Kimberlina home.  Lee had us go with him to look at a problem at the
Sherwood storage shed.  We made some recommendations and then came back to the
Kimberlina home.  It was 2PM before we finished and cleaned up.  We then worked
on the duplex at the plant, hanging sheetrock.  Lee told us that the new screw
guns should be here tomorrow.  He said “that it is cheaper to order complete
new screw guns with two batteries and a charger than to just order the
batteries and chargers.”  It is a crazy world that we live in.  Mae has been
Visiting Teaching most of the day today.  She attended a special R.S. Program
this evening.  She was home when I got home from work and had me something to
eat and then she left.  I watched a John Wayne show and “Big Valey” series, while
watching them I got some blocks ready for next Sunday’s nursery class on
Sunday.  </span></p>

went back to the duplex and worked on the duplex.  Just before noon Lee brought
us new screw guns so Elder Shaw went to screwing the sheetrock that I cut and
placed.  We finished the east duplex about 3PM when Lee came and he and Spencer
Birch helped us carry in enough sheetrock to do most of the other duplex and
also the house.  Lee said that there was a possibility of storm Monday and this
was we wouldn’t have to carry it in with the rain and mud.  I was sure tired
when I got home.  After eating dinner I took a nap.  We watched a movie from
Nteflex “Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kid”.  Although we have seen it before
we sure enjoyed it.</span></p>

the chapel.  On the way home we stopped and got a Sub-Way for lunch.  This
evening we attended a High Priest dinner that Lee hosted in their back yard.  We
had a good attendance and very good food.  As an activity Lee had each couple
tell how they met and decided that we wanted to get married, when we married,
how many children we had and etc.  It was a good evening and we found it very

Ibuprofen and went to sleep in the recliner.  I finally was able to get to
sleep and woke again around 5AM.  As I lay in the chair thinking about the pain
I realized that my problem came from the chicken that I ate last night.  I also
realized that it started shortly after we ate as I couldn’t think clearly and
went into a depression before we got home.   I went back to bed and when I went
back to sleep I was woke by a horrible dream.  Mae rubbed my feet and legs and
let me sleep a little along.  We attended choir practice and I quickly realized
how little I know about music.  Brother Pain asked me if I could take him to
pick up a Sister that is in a wheelchair that wants to attend church.  When we
got there she was in so much pain that she didn’t feel she could go.  The
Sacrament was being passed by the time we returned.  The Bishop had a Deacon
return to Brother Pain and I with the Sacrament so we could partake of it.  The
Primary children put on the program today and they did a super job of that. 
The nursery did not go very well today.  By the time the two hours were up we
were beat and ready to go home.  Mae heated some leftovers for lunch and after
eating we took a nap.  Mae called some of our children plus Bob and Carroll. 
Sandi returned the call as she had gone to Star Valley this weekend.  It
doesn’t look like she and Nick are getting along any better.  Jeff and his
family had gone to St. George with Gail’s Mother to visit an Uncle.  I called
Lanny Wilding and visited with him as to the health of Aunt Welma and Uncle
Lee.  They are both doing quite well for someone of their age.  Uncle Lee is
now 91 years old.  Lanny and LaRue are doing well.  It was good to visit with
them.  This evening we watched a John Wayne movie before going to bed.</span></p>

rocking it.  Lee helped us as much as he could but he is concerned with the
finishing of the harvesting.  Because of the weather conditions this year is
the latest that the harvest has ever gone since Lee has been involved with this
farm.  Lee is very concerned because they have several truck loads of almonds
still waiting to be picked up but are not dry enough.  The weather report is
predicting heavy storms and if the almonds lay in the orchard and get heavy
rain on them the chances are very great that they will spoil before they can be
processed.  I got home about 5PM very tired from the work today.  This evening
we had the full time Elders for dinner. They are two very delightful young men
and very dedicated to the work.   After they left we watched another in the Big

Mae called on the problem we are having with getting on the internet.  She took
the computer into T Mobile but they couldn’t find the problem.  She talked to
the technical support but they think we will have to contact Hulet Packard
tomorrow.  We do have a one year warranty and a three year extended warranty,

and prescribed an antibiotic in an ear drop so it shouldn’t cause me any side
affect.  He also gave me a prescription for another problem I am having.  He
visited with Mae about her bone problems.  When we came home I changed clothes
and we went to the plant.  Elder and Sister Judd were here so we got to visit
with them.  Elder and Sister Shaw went into a Doctor’s appointment this
afternoon.  Lee then asked if we would like to go out to eat with them.  Of
course we did so we all road in Eric’s car as it has six seats.  We went out to
a Mexican restraint in Shafter.  The food was ok but it was especially good to
see the Judd’s again.  They are tending their grandchildren while there sun and
his wife are in Utah with their other children.  I worked in the home on the
sheetrock nail off when the inspector came.  He apologized for being so late
getting there but explained that he had been very busy today.  He looked at the
house and said it looked good, he then asked if the duplex was ready.  I
hesitantly said yes and he went there.  I was surprised that he accepted the
house.  I didn’t follow him to the duplex but was sure that he wouldn’t accept it. 
He didn’t come back to say anything to me so I went looking for him.  When I
couldn’t find him I went to the inspection sign off sheets and they were signed
off.  I was shocked to say the least.  I would not have accepted the job if I had
been the inspector.  I called Lee and suggested that he did a personal
inspection but he seemed irritated with me suggesting that.  I guess we will
start tapping Monday morning.  I quit and came home.  Mae was sure special with
me as she know that I was upset.  I guess that I am just too particular.  Mae
had spent quite a bit of time trying to get the computer working.  We are

phone with HP technical support and after some time with them they feel like
the problem is coming from our firewall.  They had Mae call Morton and they
decided to delete the firewall and then they took over the computer and worked
for several hours on our computer from there end.  It took most of the day but
it looks like our computer is now working again.  I did several small jobs
around the house but was mostly bored.  This evening we took a walk and went
down to the field to the west of us.  It was getting dark but we could see that
they were still harvesting the black eyed beans so we walked to where we could
watch the combine and shuttle wagon.  I wished that we could have taken some

stopped for fruit and toast and then I continued.  Mae worked on crocheting on
a blanket for a granddaughter and talking to Linda on the phone.  It really
helps her to have ear pieces so she doesn’t have to hold the phone to her ear. 
We quite at 10PM and got ready for bed.  Time really goes by fast.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I woke early so
turned the alarm off and went into the front room so as not to wake Mae.  She
woke a little later and got up.  Mae cooked oat meal cereal for us and it was
really good.  She was able to find some gluten free oat meal.  Elder Shaw and I
first sheet rocked the hot water heater closet on the duplex.  Although it was
quite small it took a while to get it sheet rocked.  Lee came over and we
discussed the cabinet layout with Sister Shaw.  I think that Lee is going to
have another person build the cabinets as he will be so busy with his new
calling as Bishop.  That is just my thoughts at this point.  We then got all
the tools and supplies to start tapping the sheet rock in the home.  I think
that we will now concentrate just on the home until we get it ready for the
Shaw’s to move in.  I hope we can have them before Christmas.  As Elder Shaw
and I worked together. Because I have stills I did the ceiling and Elder Shaw
worked the walls.  We quite work about 4PM for the day.  I stopped at Floyd’s
on the way home and bought two dog collars to use on my stills as when I went
to use the stills the leg straps are missing.  Mae soon had dinner ready when I
got home.  After eating I showered and shaved and then studied the Family Home
evening lesson for tonight.  I fell asleep studding so Mae let me sleep a
little while.  It was almost 7:30PM when the Shaw’s came.  We enjoyed the
evening having FHE together.  I filled out this entry and then I got ready
while Mae made her journal entry.  We then went to bed.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                We were slower
getting up this morning and then had to put the drops in my ears.  I really
could have just gone back to bed and forgot work today.  Mae had to work at it
but she finally got me off to work.  When I got to Shafter I realized that I
had forgotten my phones, my badge and my wallet.  As I was already late I went
on to work.  Mae had her time at the nursing home and then she brought my items
and her lunch and ate lunch with me.  She is so special.  Elder Shaw and I
worked all day tapping the house.  I was almost 6 hours on the stills today and
when I quit I was tired.  We worked late, not quitting until after 4:30PM and
then had to clean up.  I also stopped at Floyd’s for some sheet rock sand
paper.  I had to hurry and shower and shave before the missionaries came for
dinner.  As always, Mae prepared a very nice dinner.  Elder Day and Elder Bills
were forty minutes late coming for dinner but Mae’s food held well so it was
nice to relax for a few minutes.  We do enjoy having the Elders for dinner. 
Tonight before leaving they sang the Hymn “My Savior’s Love” and then Elder Day
led us in prayer.  I helped Mae with the dishes and then I laid on the couch
and Mae put my ear drops in my ear.  I fell asleep there and slept for over an
hour.  Mae listened to the last of some DVD’s entitled “Seven Miracles That
Saved America”.  I made me some padding that should protect my legs while I am
wearing my stills.  The dog collars that I bought yesterday worked well but
they wore a sore on my legs.  Bob had sent us some information about the
candidates that are running for elections and the amendments to the Utah State
Constitution.  She read through much of that and we are still in the dark but
did fill out an absentee ballot to send in.  It was 10:45PM and I then had Mae
rub me with Thera-gesic pain relieving crème, before I went to sleep.  As late
as it is, I had Mae sleep in the other bedroom so that I wouldn’t wake her when
I got up.  </span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I slept fairly well
but woke at 4:45AM.  I got up and read my scriptures and did my exercises
before getting me some breakfast.  It is cold this morning and the furnace is
coming on often.  I have a little extra time so I worked on my journal for a
few minutes before going to work.  I enjoy Elder Shaw but he and I were taught
differently as to craftsmanship.  I really have to bit my tong as we work
together.   When I left the house, this morning the temperature registered 40
degrees and when I got to Shafter it was 43 degrees but back to 40 degrees at
the plant.  Mae called me just after 2PM but I didn’t get the message until
2:30PM.  Mike and Becky are driving up to Logan to give David his Mission
Call.  They will have him call us when he opens it.  I came home early and had
time to shower and then had Mae put my ear drops in.  I got a short nap before
he called at 4:50PM.  He will be going to Africa Abidjan (The Ivory Coast)
Mission, but he is excited about it and will be speaking French.  He will enter
the mission home on the 23 of February.  Mae had a nice dinner for us.  We
watched the first half of “The Cowboys” and then decided that we had better
watch the rest tomorrow evening as it is getting late.  Mae had a couple of
calls during the show and Mike called us again just to visit about David’s
call.  He has very mixed emotions from concern for his safety and the fact that
all of a sudden his little boy is changing very quickly into a man.  How fast
the time seems to go!</span></p>

have an appointment with Merrill at 9AM and I don’t want to start work and then
get cleaned up for that appointment.  Elder Shaw and I continued to tape sheet
rock.  I was tired when I got home.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got
there but we called Tyler to wish him a Happy Birthday before we ate.  I also
talked to Shauna and David for a few minutes.  David is upset that I am working
so hard at my age, I don’t know, maybe he is right.  After dinner, Mae gave me
a haircut and then I showered and shaved.  I added a story to my history and
then Mae and I watched the last half of “The Cowboy’s” before going to bed.</span></p>

school today to help.  Elder Shaw and I continued to tape sheetrock.  I decided
that we should quite early and call it a day.  Elder Shaw was happy to go along
with that.  I talked to Travis and asked him if I could get another bag of
almonds and he had a girl bring me a bag right up.  I got water and also filled
my truck with gas before coming home.  I got home shortly after Mae had gotten
home.  I made some almond milk, almond butter and ground some almonds for Mae. 
She made some almond cookies and prepared things for Roy and Linda as they are
coming to stay with us this weekend.  I took a nap and then when Mae finished with
the things she was doing, she also took a nap.  Roy and Linda came about 6PM. 
Mae soon had a nice dinner ready.  After dinner we just visited a little about
a lot, but it was fun.  It was after 11:30PM before we went to bed.</span></p>

Linda had a question for me and we ended up talking until after 1AM.  I think
she is crying for help because she doesn’t know how to handle the fact the she
has Roy 24/7 and he doesn’t know what to do with his time.  I don’t know how to
help or what the answers are.  </span></p>

went to Hodel’s for a all you can eat breakfast.  After that we went to Leson’s
and purchased mainly bread as it is on sale know for $3.90 per loaf and Monday
it will be $5.90 per loaf.  Mae bought a few other items.  We then drove up to
Lake Isabella just for the ride and to see what is was like.  We had a very
enjoyable time and ate a lunch at a park before returning.  We went to Wall-Mark
for a shirt for Roy and some Thera-Gesic for me.  Mae and Linda found a few items
they wanted.  After leaving Wall-Mark we went to McDonald’s where we bought
their fruit smoothies and then came home.  We watched the movie “While You Were
Sleeping”.  It was a cute movie but it did have some language in it.  Mae and I
then took our showers before going to bed.</span></p>

so that we were ready for church.  We had understood that we would not be
singing as the choir today but when we got there we were told differently.  As
today is the 5<sup>th</sup> Sunday there was a special adult meeting after
Sunday school ended.  The YW came in and finished the last hour of nursery so
that Mae and I could attend the meeting.  It seemed a relief to be away from
the children and to mingle with the adults for a little while.  Mae cooked a
nice dinner when we came home.  We visited with Roy and Linda this afternoon. 
I can’t really understand Roy and Linda’s situation but I am sure glad for what
Mae and I have.  They left for home shortly after 6PM.  We watched two episodes
of Big Valley this evening.  I tried to call Sandi but didn’t get them home.</span></p>
