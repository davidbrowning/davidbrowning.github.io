that I could be at the job site by 7AM.  Elder Judd and I continued with the
framing.  We quit and cleaned up by 4PM.  With Lee’s help we got the sheathing
on the north side of the roof.  That gave Elder Judd time to help his wife with
Cub Scouts.  It put me home in time for me to take a shower, take a short nap
and for Mae and I to be into Bakersfield for a dinner appointment with the Aguilar’s
  The Aguilar’s are natural born Philippines but immigrated to the United State
in 1980.  Mae met Sister Aguilar at Stake Conference and said Hello.  She
noticed Mae’s Missionary badge and asked her about it.  In their conversation
Mae told Sister Aguilar that we had served in the Philippines as missionaries.
Sister Aguilar said that she and Brother Aguilar had sold their home and had
moved into an apartment and are waiting for a mission call.  She said that they
would like to invite us to dinner so that we could become better acquainted and
we might be able to answer some questions as to what to expect when you are
called to serve a mission.  The Aguilar’s received their mission call this last
week and are called to go to the Philippines.  Sister Aguilar had prepared a
wonderful Filipino  Dinner.  We really enjoyed the evening with them.  It was
10PM when we returned home.</span></p>

let Mae sleep in.  She did get up at 6:30 and see me off.  Elder Judd and I
finished the framing of the single home.  After lunch we got the duplex laid
out.  We cleaned up and I left by 4PM.  I stopped on the way home and had my
pickup serviced.  Mae helped Sister Judd and Sister Pain clean up the house
that Darrel and Pennie moved out of.  They were all morning doing that as the
house was left quite dirty.  She then went to Bakersfield shopping.  It was
after 6PM when she got home.  We had dinner and then watched a DVD movie.  I
finished this entry and we went to bed.  </span></p>

continued to lay out the plates for the outside walls.  At noon Elder and
Sister Judd left to go to Yosemite National Park with their son and family. 
The building inspector came about noon and did the framing inspection on the
house.  It was very good and he signed of the inspection report.  I asked him a
couple of questions about the window clearance from the floor, and about the
water closet addition for the duplex.  He also saw my Missionary badge and
asked several questions about our Mission and how that worked.  We visited for
several minutes.  I worked this afternoon until Lee told me to quit and go
home.  I got home at 4:45PM.  Mae soon had diner ready.  Home Depot Delivery
brought the micro wave oven that we had purchased last week.  It will go in
Armreta’s apartment.  We watched another serious of ZAG this evening.  Scott
called and we visited for a few minutes then he tried to help Mae install the
Conference talks to the IPod, but they couldn’t get it to work.  Bob called and
the sewer line plugged up and ran over our kitchen sink.  He told me that it
had backed up some but today they found that it was a lot more than they had
originally expected.  It looks like it has done quite a bit of damage to the
carpeting and the cabinets.  Wipple Plumbing will be there tomorrow to assess
the problems.  </span></p>

before 7AM and started.  Lee soon came and worked with me most of the day. 
Bishop Spencer Birch also spent quite a while helping us frame.  There was also
several of the plant office personal that came out and gave us help lifting and
placing the walls when we got them nailed together.  There was a lunching held
for all the plant management and their families, which sister Browning and I
were also invited.  It was very nice.  Lee indicated that maybe I should call
it a short day but I wanted to get more done before quitting.  It was after 4PM
when we quite but we had the west, south and east walls framed and standing
plus the small north walls framed before we quite.  After dinner this evening
Mae and I took some pictures outside.  I then downloaded the pictures from the
camera and resized some so Mae can e-mail them to our family.  We then watched
a DVD that we purchased.  It was a cute story of a boy growing up and deciding
what he wants to do with his life.  We really enjoyed the movie.  I sure
enjoyed being home with Mae and relaxing.</span></p>

and fearing that I would wake Mae I slept a while in the recliner.  When Mae
woke we enjoyed rubbing each other’s feet for a while.  I prepared breakfast
while Mae did her hair.  After breakfast I made a batch of almond butter.  Mae
has been busy preparing for Georgia and Rick’s arrival.  I called Bob and
talked to him about the apartment and if the insurance pays what we expect it
will it will cost about $1,200 to have the drain pipe taken out and repaired
right. The carpeting, kitchen flooring, cabinet top and possibility some of if
not all of the cabinets has to be replaced.  Some of the sheetrock is being
replaced so that means some painting.  With all that work and having the drain
repaired so that we don’t have to continually watch that, it should be worth
it.  Georgia and Rick arrived here about 1:30PM.  Mae had lunch ready.  We sure
have enjoyed visiting and being with them.  We toured around the farm and
explained some about the harvesting and processing of the nuts.  We mainly set
around relaxing and visiting.  We played Knock for a while.  I was the last one
to shower and go to bed and that was mid-night.</span></p>

today is Fast Sunday.  We attended Church and enjoyed the spirit there.  In
Sunday school the room was very cold so rick and I adjusted the temperature
which Mae and Georgia said it felt much better for Relief Society.  However we
then were told that the Nursery was way to warm.  After leaving the chapel we
drove out to the homes at the Sherwood farm as Rick and Georgia know Tenney and
Jenny Lamoreaux and they wanted to meet them.  When we got home Mae had a very
nice dinner soon prepared.  We relaxed and visited.  Later we watched a
documentary on the National Parks.  We made reservations to go on a tour at the
Hearst Castle tomorrow.  It was after 10 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

eggs for breakfast.  We sure had fun being with Rick and Georgia.  We had a
tour scheduled and reserved for 1:10PM so we had time to eat lunch before being
at the ticket office.  As we entered the tour gate they took a group picture of
the four of us.  We really enjoyed the tour through the castle but it was
interesting how so much money could be spent just to satisfy one personal
gratifications.  It was about 9PM when we got home so I soon went to bed.</span></p>

rest sleep in a little longer.  Work went well and we felt good about what we
got done today.  Mae brought Rick and Georgia over to the plant and had
arranged for them to have a tour of the plant.  They did take time to see the
houses we are building. Lee with some other workers poured some cement for a
gas tank pad.  Elder Judd was also helping him and about noon Elder Judd came
to me and said that Lee had gone for a few minutes and that hee, Elder Judd,
had to go into a Dr. for some test results.  He ask if I could keep watch on
things until Lee got back.  I noticed that all the Spanish help had gone to
lunch.  I could hear the cement mixer working quite hard.  I went over and the
trailer has jumping with the turning of the concrete in the mixer.  I looked
inside the barrel and realized the concrete was getting quite hot.  I added
water to stop the cement from setting up and called Lee to see what his timing
was.  Had I not checked there could have been real problems.  I stayed with the
cement until we got it poured and some post placed.   After lunch Mae and
Georgia went shopping in Bakersfield.  They had a good time and got some good
sales.  I think the best time was for the two of them to spend some time
together.  Rick enjoyed staying home and said he got some reading done that he
wanted to do.  I came home about 4PM and Rick and I got talking.  Mae called
and I gave her the choice to go out to eat or tell me what she wanted us to
prepare for dinner.  Rick and I ended up getting dinner ready just about the
time Georgia and Mae got home.  After dimmer we watched a DVD made by Brandy to
celebrate Nolan’s tenth year from the time he was hit by lightning.  Georgia
and rick then explained an experance they had that day in connection with Nolan. 
We then played a game of Mormon Bridge in which Rick ended up winning.  It was
late when I went to bed but it has been a great day and evening.  Mae stayed up
later.</span></p>

again this morning but she woke before I left for work.  Rick and Georgia
wanted to go walking with Mae again this morning.  Mae said that it was almost
11AM before they got away.  It has sure been nice having them come and visit
us.  Work went well today and we accomplished quite a lot.  It was five PM
before I got home.  The missionaries were waiting outside when I got there. 
They had just arrived for a dinner appointment with us.  I just washed up and
Mae had a nice dinner on the table for us.  We enjoy having the missionaries
come for dinner with us. After the Elder’s left I showered and cleaned up.  I
caught up my journal.  Mae and I then watched another show in the J.A.G.

tomorrow.  Mae went Visiting Teaching, stopped and purchased some items for the
dinner today. The lunching was very good and most of it we could eat.  It was
also nice to have lunch with my sweetheart.  Elder Judd and I finished putting
on the sheathing before we quite.   It was after 5PM when I got home from
work.  Mae had me lay down and take a nap before dinner.  I was going to take
my shower after eating but the sprinklers came on and they take all the water
so I waited.  We watched a show on DVD, “Love In the Afternoon” with Gary
Cooper and Audrey Hepburn.  It was after 9PM when it finished.  I took a shower
and we went to bed.  I sure love my beautiful wife and Eternal companion.</span></p>

breakfast this morning.  I have to read the water meters for the Kimberlina
home while Lee is gone.  That job has to be done each day.  We hadn’t been to
work very long when the crane operator came to lift the trusses onto the roof
for us.  I still had to lay the walls out.  We got a few trusses set when the
plant needed the crane to move the propane tank.  That took about an hour that
we mainly had to stand around.  The company came to dig and install the septic
tank and drain hole.  The drain hole was about 8 foot in diameter and was dug
46 feet deep.  The digger was quite neat to watch.  It had a auger that would
turn down and fill up, then they would lift it up and the bottom would open and
dump the dirt in a pile to the side of the hole.  It was neat to watch.  When
the crane returned, there was just Elder Judd, one Spanish fellow and myself to
set the trusses.  We had all the trusses set by noon.  Mae came over and took
some pictures of us setting the trusses.  This afternoon we set ties and set
bracing up.  I came home and ate dinner so Mae could get the dishes done before
the Judd’s came.  We had a good time playing card games and visiting.  It was
10:30 before they went home.  We soon went to bed. </span></p>

Carpet One store and looked at their flooring for the kitchen area and
carpeting for the front room, sun room and hallways.  We did look at kitchen
cabinets at The Home depot but we are not satisfied at their cabinets in
comparison to the Field Cabinets we presently have.  We stopped for lunch at
Sizzler and then went to Lassens.  It cost us $100 for two sacks of groceries
that I could easily carry out to the car.  I took a 15 minute nap when we got
home and then we went to the park at Kimberlina for a Ward party.  We took our
own food as most of the food was not on our diet.  It was a good social with a
good attendant.  I came home and hoped to watch a movie but instead Mae and I
worked on our lesson for nursery tomorrow until 11PM.  We quite and went to

had to hurry to be at church on time.  I had to stop at the Kimberlina housing
water station and take readings before going on to the chapel.  We went right
to the nursery room and got it set up.  We went to the chapel in time to
practice the music that we will be singing today in meeting.  Sacrament meeting
was very good.  Two High Councilmen spoke and the choir sang.  We then went to
the nursery where we had 9 active boys and two girls.  It was a busy two hours
and we came home very tired.  After getting a light lunch we took a nap.  We
slept about two hours.  I called Brother Neiderhauser in Clinton and asked him
if he would go over and look at the kitchen cabinets in our apartments and get
an opinion as to what will have to be done to repair them or if they will have
to be replaced.  I talked to Bob and he now is having trouble with the water
softener.  I downloaded the pictures from the camera and worked on getting the
childrens pictures download that we took today.  I have them ready to print but
we don’t have photo paper here.  I caught up my journal and it is now after 9PM

well so I had her sleep in.  She had put my lunch and breakfast together during
the night hours in which she couldn’t sleep.  I went to work, stopping on the
way at the Kimberlina housing water pump to take the daily readings.  I then
went to the Kimberlina shop and added water to the water container in my
pickup.  I also picked up two bottles of water for our house.  We continued
working on the house and decided that we needed a different saw and while at it
a new cordless drill as the one we have has two bad batteries.  We also need
some coil nails for the sheathing, so I went to Bakersfield in search of the
items.  It was after noon when I returned only getting part of the items we
wanted.  Elder Judd and I sheathed the gable ends and cut the truss tails
even.  At 4 PM we quite work on the house and I went over to Dibble’s and
checked their clothes dryer.  It is warren out and in my opinion not worth
working on.  Elder Judd located a store Bakersfield that carries the coil nails

about ready.  I had time to shower and clean up before dinner.  After eating we
lessoned to a cassette tape entitled “The Trial” and really enjoyed it.  I
filled in this entry before going to bed.</span></p>

that I could go into Bakersfield by 6AM.  Mae was upset at me last night
because I was getting up so early.  Yesterday I spent so much time going into
Bakersfield that I didn’t want to loss that much time today.  I was able to get
the items that I needed and was back to the plant by 7:30AM.  Mae went to the
nursing home today.  She came over to the job sight and brought my lunch as I
had forgotten to get it this morning.  She stayed and ate lunch with me and
that was sure enjoyable.  Elder Judd and I quite work at 3:15 PM and cleaned
up.  We were both tired and hot.  Mae went into Bakersfield and got me another
back brace.  We got home about the same time this afternoon.  I showered and
took a nap before dinner.  I talked to Bob concerning the problems there.  I
think he is going to be able to get things taken care of.  After dinner we
watched a JAG series and went to bed.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                Work went well this
morning.  Elder Judd and I got the facia on the two gable ends and started on
the sheathing of the roof.  Sister Judd has been busy trying to get packed to
go home on Friday.  I told Elder Judd that he should quit and help his wife. 
He wouldn’t hear of it.  About 11:20 AM I heard a sheet of sheathing drop and
as I turned, I saw elder Judd’s feet going over the edge of the roof.  I ran to
the edge of the roof and Elder Judd was laying on the ground.  I asked if he
was ok to which he replied the he thought so.  I quickly got off the roof and
ran to him.  We slowly straightened him out but he said he only hurt in his
arms.  He set up and then got up.  I had him set and rest a few minutes.  He
suggested that he should go to the house.  I agreed that he should and should
rest for a while.  A few minutes later Sister Judd asked where Therin had
gone.  I realized that she had been gone when Elder Judd had gone to the
house.  I told her she should check on him because he had gotten hurt.  I went
to the house to see if he was ok.  Sister Judd had called her son who is the
CEO of the hospital and he had told them to come into the hospital to be
checked.  I took a lunch break and then continued to work by myself.  Later
Fernando came out and I asked him if any of the bosses were there.  They are
all gone either on assignments or on vacation this week.  I told him what had
happened to Elder Judd and wondered who I should tell about it.  He didn’t
know.  Fernando later came out and helped me with the sheathing.  I was very
tired when I left for home.  I called Mae and she asked if I would stop at
Apple’s market for a few items which I did.  Mae had dinner ready by the time I
washed up.  After dinner I watched a movie on DVD.  I then took a shower and
typed this entry.  Mae called Kylan and we wished him a Happy Birthday.  She
also talked to Scott for a while this evening.  </span></p>

today.  Fernando Osorio came out and helped me this morning.  We finished
putting the roof sheathing on.  He also started nailing it for me.  That was a
great help.  Mae came over and helped Elder and sister Judd finish their
packing and helped with the cleaning of the trailer.  I was asked if I could
repair a wall in the employee’s lunch area as workers are preparing to replace
the flooring throughout that area.  I had to go into Shafter and buy some
drywall mud and some tape.  When I got back Mae came out and we ate lunch
together.  I had Mae help me on the roof to chalk out nailing lines.  It was
cute the way she would move around on the roof with fear of being on the roof. 
I really did appreciate her help in chalking the lines, for it saved me a lot
of walking back and forth.  After putting the first coat of mud on the patch I
went over to Lee’s shop for some tools.  I washed my pickup as it really needed
it.  After getting home I showered and took a nap.  Mae let me sleep about ½
hour and then she woke me for dinner.  We went over to the Wasco Ward House for
a special fund raising dinner put on by the Young Women to raise funds for
Girl’s camp.  It was quite special as they prepared a special dinner for Mae
and I because of our diet.  We thought that was very special of them.  We
stopped at the grocery store for a few items and then took some throw carpets
to the Judd’s that Mae had washed for them.  We then stopped at Lee’s shop for
a router before coming on home.  I filled out this entry while Mae prepared my
lunch for tomorrow.  It’s been a busy day.</span></p>

get me off to work.  I stopped and read the water meters before going on to the
plant.  I got there just as the Judd’s were about to leave.  I did get to visit
with them for a minute.  I finished the roof sheathing and then cleaned up the
house and put the tools away.  I was concerned with the tools being left out
without anyone living there over the weekend.  I called Mae while I was on the
way home.  She asked me to stop at Apple’s market for some cookies.  It was
after 5PM when I got home.  Mae had dinner about ready but wasn’t sure when Roy
and Linda would get here.  I took a shower and a nap.  Before going to sleep
Mae rubbed my feet.  She is sure good to me.  It was about 7:15PM when Roy and
Linda got here as they had gotten lost and didn’t have our phone numbers with
them.  Linda said to Mae when she greeted them “It’s good to see a friendly
face.”  She said that Roy was so mad at her for not bringing our phone
numbers.    We enjoyed visiting while we ate and after doing the dishes we
planned  the trip for tomorrow.  Linda had been worried for some time on how we
would be able to find the places we wanted to see in Los Angeles as it is the
largest land mass city in the world.  While she was looking at the map and Mae
was looking on the internet, finally Linda said: “What do you think about going
on a tour of the city?”  We thought that was great so Mae looked up tours in
L.A. and founds L.A. Tours.  It showed all the places we wanted to see plus
many more.  Mae called and they did have a few openings and it would cost us
$60.00 for seniors.  We scheduled it.  We will have to leave by 6AM in the
morning in order to get to the tour that we have registered for.  Good night!</span></p>

Roy and Linda at 5PM.  It was a little after 8AM when we got to LA.  It took us
a little while to find the tour Co. that we made reservations with.  We asked
two police officers and both gave us wrong directions, but we found it anyway. 
We started the tour at 9:15AM and got back to the office at 3:30PM.  We were
sure glad that we had scheduled with a tour group.  It would have been a
disaster if we had tried to see the city on our own.  As it was we saw and were
told about Marina Delray Bay, Venice, beaches where we had time to walk out to
the ocean, Santa Monica, LA Oil Fields, Beverly Hills, a special place where we
got a good view of the “HOLLYWOOD” sign and many more places of interest.  We
saw many shops, homes of the “Rich and Famous”, USC campus, the financial
areas, residential areas, golf courses and many more points of interest.  We
all agreed that it was the best way to see the LA area.  We stopped for some
dinner before coming home.  It was going on 9PM when we got home so I didn’t
take time to fill out this entry but just went to bed.</span></p>

plant and showed Roy and Linda the homes we are building.  Mae prepared a very
nice dinner.  We enjoyed the rest of the day visiting and playing games with
Roy and Linda.  This time together has been good as we have cleared up some old
miss-understandings.  It was late when we went to bed.  I got a call from
Sandi, Scott and Mike wishing me a Happy Fathers day, also a call from Logan

11AM the inspector came.  He complemented me on the well built house.  There
was one problem and that was with the blocking of the trusses at the outside
walls.  California requires blocking different that Utah, Idaho and Arizona.  I
will make those adjustments but other than that he passed the house ok.  I cut
the new blocking out of any scrap 2 X 6 that was left over.  I used Lee table
saw to cut to blocking to size.  Lee got home today and we at the shop when I
came to cut the blocking.  It was good to visit with him.  When I got home Mae
had me take a shower and a nap.  We read a couple of talks from conference and
then Mae read the information that she had typed about David’s life.  She had

calling Lee to let him know I was having pickup trouble, I showered and then
took Mae and Jase with me in the car and we still went to Bakersfield.  We
stopped at WinCo for a few groceries, went to a Sub Way for dinner and then to
Home Depot for the electrical parts needed for the houses.  It was 9:30 PM when
we got home.  I carried in the groceries and then entered this entry before
going to bed.  Jase had made a very impressive car out of his Lego Creator
kit.  Mae took pictures of Jase and his car.  He seems to have a talent for
using those sets.</span></p>

came at 6:30AM as I was getting ready to take the car to work.  He found that
the battery had gone bad.  I left him the key and then I went to work.  Later
today Mae drove the truck over to me and got her car.  She was going to go visit
Tara Guyton and had just got there when I called her to let her know that Elder
ken and Sister Vivian Shaw was in Bakersfield and would soon be at the farm. 
She came on over and it wasn’t long when the Shaw’s got here.  Mae and I helped
them unpack their truck.  Mae and Sister Shaw then went shopping.  Elder Shaw
and I visited for a few minutes and then I left him to unpack and I went back
to work.  I met with the electrician for just a few minutes and will meet with
him again in the morning.  If we can get the wiring pulled we should be ready
for the next inspection and I would like to have that on Friday.  I came home
about 4:30PM so that I could have time to shower and change before we went out
to eat with Lee, Kim, Elder Ken Shaw, Sister Vivian Shaw, Mae, Jase and
myself.  Lee took us to the Red Lobster for dinner.  It was very good.  After
getting home I entered this entry and went to bed.</span></p>

shortly after 6AM.  I went over to the lumber co. and bought a half a dozen
2X4’s and some shim shingles.  I also stopped at the Magdalena shop and got
some ice for our drinking water.  Just after getting to the plant Lee came and
scheduled time to take Elder and Sister Shaw for a tour of the farm.  Elder
Shaw also said that a gas valve on their stove broke.  I went to Bakersfield
and got parts for the stove.  I also picked up two electrical panels for the
houses.  When I got back I replaced the valve on the stove but when I lit it
there was a gas leak and caused a fire in the top of the stove.  It burned a
couple more parts so I had to return to Bakersfield for more parts.  It was
noon by the time I got the stove repaired.  We started pulling electrical
wiring but I needed advice from the elastration and he was tied up with other
problems.  I asked Tim about telephone and inter-net service to the houses and
that raised all kind of issues.  We did get some things done but not what I had
hoped to do.  It was after 5PM when I got home quite tired.  Mae took the care
to Shafter and got it serviced as it was over due for a service.  Mae had
dinner about ready when I got there so I took a shower and ate.  After dinner I
take a nap and then we watched a show on DVD.  I filled in this journal entry
and soon went to bed.  </span></p>
