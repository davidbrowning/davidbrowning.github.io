morning but went back to bed not feeling very well.  Mae cuddled me up, added a
blanket and let me go back to sleep.  She came back in at 8:30 to check on me. 
I woke and she told me that my breakfast was ready for me.  She then had to
leave for church.  I got up and found that not only was my breakfast ready but
that the TV and DVD player were ready for me to turn on to the General
Priesthood session of last conference.  Also the computer was set on the stand
beside the recliner so I could easily access it.  Is there any man that has a
wife sweeter to him than I do?  How grateful I am for her.</span></p>

me a couple of minutes to get up and moving.  About that time Eleanor Ewing
called in return to Mae’s call yesterday.  We enjoyed a short visit.  It was
good to hear from long time friends and to know that they are still in fair
health.  </span></p>

meetings completely worn out.  We laid down together and took a nap.  Mae
cooked a very delicious chicken dinner.  While Mae cooked dinner and while we
ate we watched the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> CD of “On Sacred Ground”
by Truman G. Madsen.  The Shaw’s let us borrow their set of eight CD’s.  Lee
and Kim came over for a short visit and then Jay, Ilene and Andrew Payne came
over so that Andrew could give me a get well picture that he colored for me. 
Andrew is in our nursery and is a very special young man.  Of course he has
very special parents.  This evening we watched another CD loaned to us by the
Shaw’s, “For Ever Strong” and we really enjoyed that.  I also got my letter to
Ashley written today.  It was after 10PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

Granddaughter Ashley,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                Grandpa
had hoped that we might drive home to be with you on this special day in your
life.  I am sorry that my health is stopping Grandma and me from doing that. 
When we found out that I was going to have this operation and we were told that
I could not work for a couple of weeks, we thought that it might work out so
that we could come home for this special occasion but I guess Grandpa is
getting to old for my body to heal that fast.  I guess it is like waking up on
a school day being too sick to go to school but also to sick to get up and
play.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                May
I still tell you some of my feeling as to what this special day means to me? 
Of course this special day, that I am writing about, is the day you are
BAPTIZED.  Although it was over 63 years ago that I was baptized, I still
remember that day.  I am sorry to say that it was not because of my mother or
father’s testimony, teachings or encouragement that I was baptized but because
of the love of my primary teacher.  When she realized that my parent’s faith
was not strong enough to teach me the importance of baptism into the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, she continued to teach me each week in our
primary class and then, several months after my 8<sup>th</sup> birthday, she
arranged for me to have an interview with my Bishop.  She then picked me up on
the appointed day and took me to the Stake Baptismal Day which was held at our
Stake Center over 10 miles away from where I lived, in the next community. 
There is not much that I remember about that day except that I didn’t know
anyone that was there, except my primary teacher.  I do not remember the talks
or the music and I did not even know the one that baptized me.  I do remember
that after being baptized that I felt good and I also remembered that my
primary teacher loved me.  The next day was Fast Sunday and my Uncle Albert,
who was also serving in the bishopric, confirmed me a member of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  I do not remember if anyone else in my
family was in attendance at the meeting or not that day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                When
looking at how much I remembered about my baptismal day, some people may say,
“Why do we baptize a child so young?  Why not wait until they are older, maybe
16 or 18 or even 21 when they are an adult and can decide for themselves?”  Yes
we have many wonderful and faithful members of the Church that were not
baptized until they were much older.  I believe that for some reason; only
known to Our Heavenly Father, some of us were blessed with the privilege of
coming to this earth with special parents and circumstances wherein we are
blessed to have the privilege of being baptized as early in our life as 8 years
of age.  We know from our scriptures that, Our Heavenly Father has stopped
Satan from having power over the hearts of little children until 8 years of
age.  I believe that because of the Great Love Heavenly Father has for each of
his children, as soon as circumstances are right, that He wants us to have a
very special helper, a personal guide and a comforter, to be with us as we go
through the rest of our life.  Most of the time we refer to this helper as the
Holy Ghost.  Ashley, for you that time is now.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                May
I testify to you, as one of many who loves you very much, that I know the Holy
Ghost.  He has helped me make important decisions in my life.  He has given me
answers to my prayers, often instantly.  He has comforted me when I was afraid
and needed help when there was no one else that could help me.  The greatest
experience to me was when I needed help and asked to know if the Book of Mormon
was true and if Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God.  That answer came to me as I
left my bed room, after I had completed reading the Book of Mormon and earnest
prayer, as clear and certain as if someone had spoken to me in a loud voice.  I
bear testimony that I know that the Book of Mormon is true and that Joseph
Smith was called of God to restore the Church of Jesus Christ.   He remained
true to that calling and sealed his testimony by giving his life rather than to
deny his testimony.  By the Spirit of the Holy Ghost you or anyone can also
have that testimony.</span></p>

were able to sleep well last night.  Sometime during the night Mae went into
the spare bedroom to sleep.  I still woke a couple of times but I think we both
slept better.  When Mae couldn’t sleep she got up and wrote a special letter to
Ashley.  I got up before 7 but tried not to wake Mae.  I worked on the
sheetrock materials take off for the housing project and started today’s entry
to my journal before getting something to eat for breakfast.  I did some study
from the “Preach My Gospel”.  This evening at 5:30 Elder and Sister Shaw came
for dinner and after we held a Family Home Evening and enjoyed discussing the
Attributes of Christ.  It was a very enjoyable evening.  After the Shaw’s went
home Mae and I watched a series of the JAG programs before going to bed.  </span></p>

July to August.  After breakfast Mae went with other Sisters from our ward to a
Sr. dinner and program held in Bakersfield.  I stayed home and started this
journal entry and watched more of Truman Madsen.  When Mae returned I had eaten
my lunch and was ready to go to Bakersfield for my appointment with Dr. Moon. 
After the appointment we got a few items from Lasson’s. We stopped and got a
Sub-Way and then went to Home Depot.  I used the electric cart to get around. 
This evening before going to bed we watched another section of Big Valley.  </span></p>

will be baptized on Saturday, David will be operated on tomorrow, Aunt Beth is
dying, and I can’t do much work yet.  We also need to see the apartment now
that it is about repaired.  She asked how I felt and I said that I felt like
going home for a few days.  I called Lee and he agreed with me, so we packed up
(mainly Mae packed), I made some arrangements for sheetrock to be delivered and
we left for home.  We called Mike on the way and asked him where we should stay
overnight in Las Vegas and he recommended Sam’s Town or Orleans.  Sam’s Town
was only $27.00 for the two of us so we took that one.  We got checked in and
started for the elevators when the show started at Mystic Mountain.  It was a
water dance to music with moving animals on the mountain.  It was fun to watch
but I had walked long enough by the time we got to our room.  The room was very
nice, especially for that price.</span></p>

and took my computer into the bathroom where I might work on it without waking
Mae.  I worked on my personal autobiography.  We left for Mike’s shortly about
9AM after getting something to eat and stopping at Wal-Mart’s.  it took us a
few minutes to get the GPS going and determining our rout.  Then when we
thought we were going onto the main highway the exit was closed due to
construction and we had to find an alternate route.  We were sure glad for the
GPS as I completely lost coordination to directions and after several turns of
freeway we were back on route.  We stopped in St. George for a break, gas and
something to eat before going on.  Mae drove from St. George to Fillmore where
we stopped for a break.  I couldn’t resist and we got a small cup of frozen
yogurt and did we enjoy that.  I drove on to Mike and Becky’s.  Becky invited
us to stay for dinner with them, it also being Taylor Page’s 16<sup>th</sup>
Birthday.  After dinner Mike and Page had plans to go to a movie.  We soon went
on to Jeff and Gail’s.  Ben and Rachel had gone to bed but when they heard us
come in they had to get us and give us a hugs and kisses.  They were so cute
and then went right back to bed.  They are growing so fast.  It is so good to
see our family as we have missed them very much.  Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played

The apartment looks very good with the cabinets looking the worst.  They will

how people are breaking into our house and using our internet service.  I
assured her that they couldn’t use our internet service as we had totally
disconnected our services with Qwest and had disconnected any services.  She
feels that it is the neighbors to the east and that they are stealing
electricity from us.  She is sure that they are getting on the roof of the
house and into the attic along with getting access to the house through our
apartment.  We attended Sacrament meeting in the Clinton 20<sup>th</sup> Ward

morning and having breakfast we went up to David’s.  David is doing well but is
in quite a lot of pain.  It is good that he has pain med’s.  I slept some
through the day.  We also watched the movie “The Man from Snowy River”, along
with a couple that the kids watched.  David has a program with Netflex so that
they can select the movies that they want.  We really enjoyed being with
David’s family.  We stayed tonight at David’s.</span></p>

took a shower.  This afternoon we went to Scott and Michelle’s.  We spent some
time looking and checking out their camp trailer.  It is very nice and we were
quite impressed with some of the new fetchers that they have added to this
model.  David called Scott and asked if he could got to his n-laws and get I
stationary bike for him so he can get started exercising his leg.  Kylan and I
went with him and it ended up taking about two hours to do it.  It was 11PM

for biscuits and gravy.  I soldered a pipe in the cabinets downstairs just
before the cabinet tops were installed.  The installer did a excellent job with
the installation.   Bob, Carroll, Mae and I played a game of Canasta in which
Bob and I won.  Mae and I then went to a Truss Officer at America First Credit
Union and had our Truss reviewed.  It is in fair shape but needs a little
addition.  We spent 2 ½ hours with him and it was free advice.  We stopped at
the health store and the grocery store before going on to Jeff and Gail’s.  I
took the time to get this entrance added to my journal and then took a nap. 
Mae woke me for dinner and then Mae, Gail, the children and I took a walk. 
Jeff came home shortly after we got back from the walk.  After the children
were put to bed Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played a game of Harts.  It was a close
game with Jeff finally going over 50 and we quite at that point.  Mae isn’t
feeling the best today as she feels like she is coming down with a cold.</span></p>

After the swimming lesson we took the children to the park and let them play on
the slide set.  They had Mae on the slides with them until she was worn out. 
When we got back to Jeff’s and Gail was home, Mae went downstairs and took a
nap.  I filled some capsules with Phy-loe and Ambrotose.  We filled out Medical
Directives Living Wills and took them to get our signatures Notarized and then
made copies in case of a medical crisis.  I then took Mae out to eat at Golden
Corral Restaurant.  After eating a wonderful dinner we went over to Bob and
Carroll’s and watched a cute show on the Hallmark channel.  We came back to
Jeff and Gail’s, Jeff wanted to play a game before going to bed. Gail and Mae

reading my scriptures and having my morning prayers I wanted to go to the
Temple.  As Jeff didn’t go in until late I stayed to be with him.  For
breakfast we had hot cakes.  I went over to Good Earth and bought some fresh
ground almond butter.  It was really good and the price was ok but it is made
out of almond chips and not whole almonds.  Mae, Gail, Jeff and I played a game
of Settlers which Mae won beating me by one move.  This was Mae’s first time at
winning this game.  I took our truss papers back up to David’s and put them
into our safe that is there.  David is feeling some better this morning but I
didn’t go up to his room to see them because of the colds we have all had at
Jeff’s.  I am sorry to say that I didn’t make it to the Temple.  This afternoon
Mae and I watched the show “Eight Below” with Benji and Rachael.  We then had
dinner and went to the movie “Toy Story 3” with Jeff and Gail.  Gail’s mother,
sister and sister-in-law also met us there.  It was a cute show for little
children.  After the show more of Gail’s family met at a ice cream store so Mae
and I went to a store and bought some fruit and came back and ate our fruit
with them.  I had started this entry earlier and finished it before going to

It was 11:30AM when I returned home.  I finished packing up as Mae had done
most of the packing while I was at the Temple.  We played a game of Settlers
with Jeff but ran out of time so called the game and I won by 1 point.  We
stopped at Bob and Carroll’s and they had the two apple pies baked for us and
ready for us to take.  We came out to Sandi and Nick’s.  We helped them prepare
for a 50<sup>th</sup> Birthday Party for Nike.  They had quite a few guests
that came.  Mae and I especially enjoyed visiting with Gary and Sandra McClusky
and _____________________.  After the party ended and we got things gathered
up, Chelci, Steve, Nathan, Sandi, Nick, Mae and I set in the gazebo and
visited.  It has been a very enjoyable evening.  Before the party started Mae
and I started watching the show Johnny Lingo 2 but was unable to see the last
of it so after the party we watched the ending.  Sandi and Nick gave up their

didn’t want to chance it.  We stopped to get gas and changed into our Sunday
dress and went to Sacrament meeting at the Broadway Ward in Tooele.  We really
enjoyed the meeting and appreciated being able to partake of the Sacrament.  We
drove to Las Vegas where we stayed at Sam Town.  We did go down and watch the
water show and I estimated that the height of the mountain room is over 100

Dr. Moon for another check-up.  Dr. Moon said that everything was good and I
could go back to work.  I asked him about the dizziness that I am
experiencing.  He said that it is not related to the operation and that we
should look into it.  He is ordering a cat scan to be taken and told us that we
would follow up with Dr. Hudson.  We also had to go to the laboratory to get a
blood test.  After leaving the medical center we searched for a notary to get
the letter signed for Citi Bank.  We finally went to UPS where they notarized
my signature and then faxed the letter to Citi Bank.  We next went to T-Mobil
and got my new cel phone switched and returned the loaner phone.   We went to
Lassens to get some bread but also got some cold cereal as it was on sale. 
After getting home I took a short nap and then we met Lee and the Shaw’s and
Lee showed us the harvesting of the almonds.  It was very interesting.  We took
several pictures and notes of the operation.  Before returning home I washed my

Kimberlina shop home at 8AM and Elder Shaw was already working.  I am still
dizzy when I bend over or tip my head but I have been able to work all day.  We
removed the carpeting and pad from the dining room area, hall way and living
room.  The flooring is not in very good shape.  The roofers worked on the roof
most of the morning.  The plumbers removed the toilet and shower / tub in
preparation of replacing them.  We found that someone has replaced several
areas of water line mixing galvanized pipe with copper pipe making direct connections
with the two metals, which does not work.  Hector sent his crew over but when
we found this problem he came over.  I spent some time visiting with him.  He
had his men stop back this afternoon and we went over the situation.  We agreed
that the waterlines need to be completely replaced but that decision has to
come from Lee.  I called Lee and he stopped be and we again looked at the
problem.  He will call Hector and then take the problem to Merrill for his
decision.  It was almost 5PM when Elder Shaw and I finished for the day and
went home.  I was really tired when I got home.  Mae had called to see how
David was doing.  He is doing quite a bit better than the other day.  Mae told
David that I was still dizzy and that my blood pressure was low.  David said
that that could cause my problem.  He will do some more research on it and get
back to us.  This evening we called and talked to Shellie but Garrett was still
at school.  We wanted to wish him a Happy Birthday but did enjoy visiting with
Shellie.  After dinner I was just tired out so we watched a JAG show and then
called and did get to visit with Garrett.  He sure sounds good.  I wish we
could be at his Ward when he gives his report Sunday.  After thinking about my
blood pressure and dizziness situation I told Mae that if in the testing the
medical people should suggest that I have a pace maker installed, that my
decision is still the same and that is NO.  After showering and shaving I
entered today’s journal entry.  </span></p>

insect damaged.  It looks like the damage was caused by termites.  When I
talked to Lee about it he said that they had to have the home treated for
termites about a year ago and they hadn’t seen signs since.  Mae called me just
before 4PM and wanted me to stop at the plant and purchase some nuts which I
said that I would but I then got involved with ending the day and forgot to go
to the plant.  Mae has been busy all day.  She and Sister Shaw went to Bakersfield

our game of Rook and Mae won.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I woke about 1AM and
Mae was not in bed with me.  When I got up Mae was at the computer working on
the write-up of the harvest that Lee had taken us out to see.  She hadn’t been
able to sleep partly because they are spraying the Pistachios again and the
sprayers are very noisy.  I got her to come back to bed and when I again woke
at 5:15AM I shut the door so that the light would not wake Mae.  I got myself
off to work.  I went to the plant and got some tools and the compressor and
then went to the Kimberlina shop home.  Elder Shaw and I worked on the bathroom
flooring, moving the light switch to the opposite side of the door way and then
we removed the pocket door and added framing so we can install a standard door. 
At 11AM we went to the Kimberlina bowery where we started the fire in the
grill.  Sister Shaw and Sister Browning also met us there, as well as Lee and
we worked together setting up tables and putting covering on them, setting out
food and grilled hamburgers.  At noon we had 40 men that are in a management
training seminar come for lunch.  They were there for about an hour for lunch
and then continued their training program.  We were another hour cleaning up
before we got back to work.  I went over after work to help Elder Shaw get
their propane tanks refilled but a gasket was missing from the fill nozzle. 
They will have to get the tanks filled at a station in Shafter.  I came home
and showered and shaved.  Mae and I met Elder and Sister Shaw in Shafter at the
China Cuisine Restaurant where we had dinner.  It was Elder Shaw’s Birthday so
we celebrated it with them.  After eating Ken and Vivian stopped at a station
and got propane before coming to our place for desert.  We are sure enjoying
serving with them.  We were tired and ready for bed this evening.</span></p>

back to bed and cuddled with Mae.  She is sure special.  I feel better today
than I have for a long time.  Elder Shaw and I again worked on the Kimberlina
Shop home.  We still have quite a lot to do on it yet.  We quit, cleaned up and
then went to the pavilion.  Lee already had the fire going in the grill.  Mae
and Vivian soon came and we all worked together getting a dinner ready for the
management seminar.  Tonight there were several that also brought their wife’s
and children.  We were ready to serve dinner at 6:30PM.  It was after 8:30PM
when we finished cleaning up and got home.  I entered this journal entry and we
soon went to bed very tired.  Before Mae came over to help with the dinner she
had gone to the nursing home and then to the Riverside Elementary and put and
application in to help as an assistant.  She stipulated that her calling as a
missionary had to take preference.  </span></p>

realized that I should not have put any sheetrock on the tub area at the
Kimberlina Shop home.  I couldn’t go back to sleep so got up and got my own
breakfast.  Mae got up just as I was finishing my breakfast.  She made me a
lunch and I left for The Home Depot in Delano.  I decided to stop at the plant
and leave the washer and dryer set that I had in the back of my pickup there. 
I went on to the Home Depot and bought some sheetrock and underlayment and then
returned to the Kimberlina Shop home.  Elder Shaw and I worked there all day
and finished up about 5PM.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got home.  I then
showered and shaved.  We watched another JAG series.  I entered this entry and
played a game of solitary and a game of Harts before we went to bed.</span></p>

for me.  I left a little early and got to work at 7:30AM.  We got started on
the repairs.  At 8:45AM Mae came and got me and we went to the plant where we
met with Merrill Dibble in his office.  He just wanted to meet with us to see
how we are doing.  He would like to do this on a monthly schedule when he is
available.  We just visited for almost an hour.  To show his appreciation for
the work we are doing and the example we are he gave us a large bag of almonds
and a bag of pistachios.  For our help with the lunching and dinner for the
training meetings Carman had Lee give us some chocolate covered almonds, some
chocolate covered prunes and a box of See’s candy.  This evening we tried the
chocolate almonds and prunes and both were very good.  I worked until 5PM this
afternoon and came home very tired.  Today we received two special E-mails, one
from Tonie, Leah and Kenneth Garison and one from President Brimhall.  It was
so good to hear from Tonie as it has been so long since we have heard anything
from or about them.  They are in the United Kingdom.  Hopefully we can again establish
contact with them.  President Brimhall let us know that he will be in
Bakersfield on September the 18<sup>th</sup> at the Bakersfield East Stake
Center.  When I got home Mae had dinner about ready and while we ate we watched
a Netflex movie, “Mrs. Miniver” a movie of the families in England during the
war with Germany in 1939.  It was really a moving story.  I filled in this
entry and then took a shower before going to bed.  I need to just add, “That I
sure love my sweet wife!”</span></p>

took the quilting frames that Mae got from the Ward, to Lee’s shop and there
did some repairing and strengthening of them.  Elder Shaw and I worked the day
on the Kimberlina Shop home getting quite a lot accomplished.  Sister Shaw
stopped at the home and I gave her the quilting frames.  She went to our home
where she and Mae sewed a quilt.  I got home quite tired about 5:30PM.  Mae
soon had dinner ready and then we watched the show “Rio Bravo” before going to
bed.</span></p>

I gave Mae a hair cut this morning.  We took showers and I prepared breakfast
while Mae put her hair up.  It was 9:30AM before we got away to Fresno.  We
arrived at Roy and Linda’s at 11AM and hurried and changed clothes.  We
attended the Fresno Temple with Roy and Linda.  It was a very enjoyable session
and I again gained some answers to questions concerning the Temple session. 
After the Temple we went out to the Home Town Buffet for lunch.  After lunch,
we went back to Roy and Linda’s.  Roy and I got into their hot tub although the
water wasn’t really very hot today.  It was 6:45PM before we left for home.  As
we drove this morning Mae read the Church News and as we returned she read from
the book “Seven Years in Hanoi”.  That really gives you an appreciation for the
blessings that we have.  After unpacking I caught my journal up to date.  We
watched a “Big Valley” episode before going to bed at 10:30PM.</span></p>

slept in but we were up early to get to church in time.  As it was we were
there long before choir practice and had time to set the nursery room up.  Kim
and Lee Brown were the speakers for Sacrament meeting and both did very well on
the subject of Tithing.  Nursery went very well today.  We did have two Spanish
sisters help us and Elder and Sister Shaw also helped us.  Today we took the
children outside for a walk.  We have tried using the rope in the room but just
wasn’t sure just how well it would work when we took them outside.  It worked
very well.  After the block meeting was over the activity committee held a
“linger longer” which was a pot luck lunch.  It went quite well and does give
Ward members time to be together in an informal gathering.  After leaving the
Church Mae and I stopped by Manuel Macias’s to make a Home Teaching visit but
no one was home.  We came home and had some lunch and then took a nap.  We
watched a DVD on the Life of President Tomas S. Monson “On the Lord’s Errand”
that is very good.  We called Jeff and David, and visited with each for a few
minutes.  Georgia called us to let us know that Aunt Beth died yesterday.  Her
funeral will be held on Saturday.  We are sure glad that we were able to visit
with her while we were in Utah two weeks ago.  It is sure a blessing for her to
be able to go.  We received a e-mail from Leah Gerritsen.  We are sure glad
that we have been able to reestablish contact with them.</span></p>

miles on it and the Ford has 100,000 miles on it.  It really doesn’t matter to
me.  It took a little while to transfer the tools from one to the other.  This

Mae had dinner ready for me by the time I showered and shaved.  She also went
Home teaching with me to Brother Manuel Macias.  After visiting with him we

minutes.  He said that the Doctor checked Carroll and said that she does not
have Alzheimer’s but does have anxiety and he would like her to see another Doctor
but Bob doesn’t think she will.  I worked on the Kimberlina Shop home and then
went over to the Kimberlina housing where Elder Shaw and I worked all day on
demo-ing it.  At 4PM Lee wanted me to follow him to a lock smith in Bakersfield
to get a new lock put on my tool box.  After getting that repaired I stopped at
a Sub-Way and got sandwich before going to Mike’s where I checked on what we
would need to put an electrical outlet for their dryer.  It was 8PM when I got
home.  After taking a bath and shaving Mae and I split the last half of the
sub-way sandwich.  I entered this journal entry while Mae prepared my lunch for
