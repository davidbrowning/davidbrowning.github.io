<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke a little before 7am and spent some time reading and pondering the Book of
Mormon and wondering about our children.  We do not know what it will be like
to be able to be with our Father in Heaven, but I can’t help thinking of the
question that David asked Mae, “If Emily were to find a future husband and they
decided to get married in the Temple, would he and Shauna be able to be with
their daughter in the Temple?” Of course Mae told him that under the present
condition, they would not be able to attend.  David doesn’t feel that would be
fair.  I couldn’t help but think that we don’t know what it will be like to be
with our Heavenly parents, but if we are not worthy to go to the Celestial
Kingdom to be with them, we might feel about like being on the outside of the
Temple while our daughter is inside being married!  If we have that kind of
feelings about our earthly family what will it be like if we are not with our
Heavenly Parents?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Shortly
after having breakfast, Mae went shopping and I started working on our storage
carts.  I need to lower the carts 1 ¾” in order to get them to clear the
framing under the trailer house.  I tried putting a load on the cart, that I
have built, and it works quite well.  I removed the 220 V 30 AMP breaker from
the breaker panel and took it into Whitehead Electric and got a 40 AMP
breaker.  This should hold the breaker from tripping when I use the welder.  I
then went to Dan’s Hardware store on Washington and about 30<sup>th</sup> St. 
They had casters that are about 1 ¾” smaller than the ones I am now trying, but
the whole is almost ½ the weight of the larger.  The thought came to me that if
I doubled the number of casters then it would hold the weight.  I will try
that!  On the way home, I stopped and ordered the angle iron that I will need
to build two more carts.  They will have my order ready for me in the morning. 
I then stopped at Durk’s and got the pipe to build handles for my carts.  When
I got home it was time to get ready to go to Bryce and Deanna’s.  Mae had made
dinner to take to them and we will eat with them.  Deanna is still quite sick,
but it was good to be with them.  Deanna told us of an experience that she had,
prior to being treated for cancer.  She said it may have been an E.K.G. or a
M.R.I. (she had so many tests that she couldn’t remember which it was), but it
would take about 45 minutes.  She told us that when they put her into the
machine they told her that it would take some time and would she like to have
some music to comfort her while in the machine?  She said that maybe some very
soft music turned down very low.  Shortly after starting, she said that she
recognized that her Mother and Father were both there with her.  She said that neither
her nor her parents said anything but just communicated with each other through
thoughts &amp; feelings.  Deanna said that she just saw light and felt warmth
and love.  She didn’t even see the machine she was in.  She said that she
wanted to be with her parents, but she communicated to them that it was not her
time to go.  That thought just came out unexpected.  Deanna also shared with
Mae that her hospital stay was needed, but hard.  She said that after her
operation, nurses, doctors &amp; staff kept coming in and she couldn’t get any
rest.  Finally, a kind, compassionate nurse said to her “You look exhausted and
need some rest.  I can put a sign on the door that you are not to be disturbed
for two hours, would you like me to do that?”  Deanna said “Oh, yes, please do
that.”  The nurse said she wished it could be longer, but two hours would be
all she could do.  Deanna said she was so grateful and finally got some rest. 
Deanna also told Mae that the doctor told Deanna, before he left to go on
vacation to Lake Powell for a week, that she would be staying in the hospital
for 8 to 10 days, but on the third day, she heard the nurses telling each other
that she (Deanna) would be going home the next day.  She still had tubes in
her, she hadn’t had a bowel movement, and she could hardly lift her head off
the pillow.  She was shocked to hear that.  I guess the insurances don’t want
to pay to keep patients in the hospital for long, but it is too hard on the
patients to go home before their bodies are ready.  She told her kind,
compassionate nurse what the other nurses had said and that her doctor told her
that she wouldn’t be going home for 8 to 10 days, and then this nurse said “I’m
going to put that on your record and you won’t be going home tomorrow.”  Deanna
said she was so grateful.  When the doctor came to see her on the morning of
the 7<sup>th</sup> day, he asked her if she was ready to go home.  She told
him, no, that she didn’t feel like she was ready yet, but maybe tomorrow.  He
told her that was fine.  She had talked to Bryce that they didn’t have things
ready for her at home – like a chair or shower stool to sit on while she
showered and a shower head with a hose so she could sit and take a shower.  She
didn’t have a walker or anything to help her get around and they didn’t have a
recliner for her to rest on.  She was very concerned about how she would manage
at home.  Bryce went to the D.I. and found a nice shower stool and 2 nice walkers
– one for the house and one with wheels and a seat to move around with
outside.  He put in another hand rail in their shower, and bought a new shower
head with a hose.  Shauna’s father-in-law had a nice recliner that he wanted to
give to Deanna when he heard about her, so Danny, Shanna and their family moved
it in for her.  Bryce bought her a cover to put over it which heats up when you
push the remote, and Deanna said that has helped her so much.  Bryce, read up
so much about how to heal the liver and what foods to eat, etc., and has been
such a help to her.  He fixes her green smoothies each morning and although
they don’t taste that great, she drinks them as they are helping her.  Deanna
also shared with Mae that the first Sunday, she wanted to get off the Lora Tab
pain pills as they were making her head feel so awful and so she got off them
and it made her so sick.  She woke up and asked Bryce to make her some quick
Oatmeal.  She would take a bite and then walk around as she knew she couldn’t
sit as she was too sick.  She would take another bite and walk around again,
and she kept doing this.  Bryce wanted to go to Sacrament Meeting, but hated to
leave her.  She told him to go, that she would be alright.  He came home during
the intermediate song to check on her.  He picked up a program as he thought
she might want to see who the speakers were.   He put it on the table next to
where she was sitting and then went back to church.  She reached for something
on that table and the program fell on her lap.  She noticed the spiritual
thought on it which was from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland.  It said “Keep on
walking, don’t give up.  There are brighter days ahead, so just keep walking.” 
She couldn’t remember what the rest of it said, but that was what she needed to
read.  She said that hit her so forcefully and she knew it was from the Lord. 
She knew that the Lord was showing her that he was mindful of her and loves her
very much.  So, she said to herself, “I won’t give up, I will keep walking”,
and she has.  Mae and I were happy to see that she is progressing and doing as
well as she is, she is walking with a cane now, but she still has a long ways
to go and you can tell by looking at her, that she has been through a lot.  We
are grateful that she is still with us.  She told Mae that before the surgery,
she would play games with her children and grandchildren, but hadn’t felt like
it until yesterday when Wendy came to see her.  She said to Wendy, “Let’s play
a game of Skipo.”  Wendy said “Oh Mom, I have been waiting for you to tell me
that, now I know you are going to be okay.”  Chad had come with his children a
few days before and said they wanted to play games with her, but she told Chad
that she just couldn’t yet, that she didn’t feel up to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Also
while we were there, Bryce wanted to show me some welding rod that he had
bought from Irven several years ago.  He said that it might make my welding job
easier.  Bryce also took Mae and I to Grannies Fruit stand where we could buy
some tomatoes and some peaches.  We also saw some Spaghetti Squash and bought a
couple of those.  Then we stopped back at Bryce’s as he had some more tomatoes
he is growing that he wanted us to have.  That is (Bryce) for you, he would
give you the shirt of his back if you wanted it. When we got home we went down
to Pat and Dick Terkelson, as Pat is going into the hospital for a Colon test
and wanted a Priesthood Blessing before doing so.  We visited for a little
while and then Dick went into the other room and came back with a tie he had
made today.  After getting home I entered this entry into my journal before
going to bed.  Mae helped me with this entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 7am but spent some time reading the Book of Mormon.  Mae got up about
8am.  After breakfast I went down to Bowman Steel and got the material that I
ordered yesterday.  I got the first cart finished and loaded up with storage
items that will go under the house.  Jeff, Gail and the family are down for the
long week end so Jeff and Matt came over to visit for a few minutes.  Mae and
Matt played a game of Old Pig and then the four of us played Sequence.  Jeff
and Matt left shortly after lunch.  I got started again on my projects but then
Scott, Michelle, Kaden and Kaitlyn came over to bring my ladders back.  They
stayed for a while to visit.  We sure enjoy our family but I didn’t get a lot
done.  We were tired and so ate some super while we watched a couple of shows
on TV.  It is now after 9PM and we have to be over to the church house at 7am
to clean the building so we had better get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 6am so that we could be at the Church house at 7am to clean the
building.  Even though it is earlier than we like, there was still a good turn
out and we finished soon after 8am.  We came home and Mae went to the store for
some items.  I got the canning pans and bottles out from under the house.  I
also swept under the house, so that the carts will roll under the house
better.  Mae and I peeled, cored and quarter tomatoes.  Mae cooked then into
spaghetti sauce.  I cut steel, getting it ready to build two more carts.  At
4:30pm I quit and cleaned up my tools.  When I came into the house, Mae went to
Walgreens to get a prescription for Marianne.  I watched the tomatoes and kept
them stirred so they wouldn’t burn.  I also got bottles washed so that when Mae
came back we got the sauce bottled and ready for cold packing.  While they were
cooking we ate some dinner and watched a western show on TV.  We got 14 quarts
of spaghetti sauce bottled.  We figured at the price we paid for the tomatoes,
we could have bought the sauce canned, however, when you buy the canned spaghetti
sauce, it does contain sugar, which we try to stay away from.  I watched a 2<sup>nd</sup>
western show but Mae finished cleaning up the kitchen and worked on our budget. 
This life insurance that Bob gave to us is sure a blessing to us.  Mae gave me
a hair cut this evening.  I filled out this entry before we got ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke before light but was only up for a few minutes.  I then slept until 8am,
although it wasn’t really restful as I continued to think about welding my
storage carts.  Mae hadn’t slept very well last night so I let her sleep in.  I
read a couple of lessons in the Priesthood manual as I am not sure just what
lesson schedule we are in.  I wish our Priesthood group would print up a lesson
schedule.  I did listen to the Tabernacle Broadcast.  When Mae got up, I did
read the last of the lesson on Honesty, to her as she did her stretch
exercises.  I then pulled a blanket over me and took a nap.  Meetings went well,
although there wasn’t very many in attendances today.  It always amazes me that
when there is a holiday weekend, and many go to visit family, why doesn’t the
attendance just offset each other but that is not the case, there is just fewer
members attending all wards.  Following our meetings, I went with Brother Okey
to take the Sacrament around to the shut-ins, those that due to health and/or
age are not able to attend meetings.  We visited two widowers that have lost their
wives due to death, the one is in his late 70’s and his wife passed away 2
years ago and the other lost his wife to death three years ago.  He told us
that he is reaching close to 88.  Brother Okey asked him what he was planning
after reaching age 88 and he just said, with a twinkle in his eye, I have got
to first reach that and then we will see.  A third couple, the Hiltons which
Mae &amp; I home teach, did not let us in because he has been sick for a couple
of weeks.  His wife has severe osteoporosis and has been operated on two or three
months ago and the doctor has put a steel rod up her back to hold her spine in
place.  The operation so far has not healed properly and she has had to return
to the hospital for additional operations.  The doctors cannot find anything
wrong with Harold except they feel he has Dementia and due to his wife’s
condition, he is reacting to it emotionally.  Mae had dinner ready when I got
back home.  After dinner, I helped Mae clean up the dishes and then she went
with me to take the Sacrament bags back to Brother Decker.  We then visited
with Brother and Sister Jorgensen as he is still laid up with his leg
operations.  After returning home, we enjoyed the evening together.  We didn’t
do much but were together.  We started to play a game of Rummy but soon
realized that our deck of cards was missing some cards and had duplicates of
others.  We spent some time sorting out our card decks and threw a couple of
decks away that were incomplete and put the rest into complete decks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
Mae and I slept well last night and upon waking, we spent some special time
together.  Words can never describe the love I have for that special girl.  As
I contemplated our love, I thought of our children, grand children and
great-grand children.  I thought of the experience I had yesterday taking the
Sacrament to some of the shut-ins in out Ward.  After breakfast (what a
wonderful breakfast of waffles, covered with almond butter, yogurt and fruit
along with a side order of scrambled eggs) I decided to write my special
family.  As I wrote about my experience I tried to type the word “Philosophy”
but could not spell it right.  I first tried “Spell Check” but could not come
close enough for it to recognize what I wanted.  I next asked Mae, but she
couldn’t get it.  I tried the dictionary but didn’t have luck with it.  I next
called Shellie.  That was interesting as when the phone rang, I didn’t get an
answer but it said that the customer I was calling didn’t have a mail box set
up.  I hung up and almost immediately my phone gave me a written message that read
“I will try to call you later”, then my phone rang!  I answered it and it was Shellie! 
I asked her how she did that and she asked “Did what?”  When I told her of the
message that appeared, she said that she hadn’t sent the message but was just
trying to figure out how to answer the new phone that she and Roy had just
bought.  I told her that we had just bought new ones too and were having
difficulty trying to figure out how to use them.  Anyway with Shellie’s help, I
got the word spelt right.  Below is a copy of the letter I wrote and sent to
all of my family, that Mae had Email addresses for.  It will be interesting to
see if I get any response from it.  This afternoon I worked on my storage carts
and I prepared and roasted a chicken on my new rotisserie spit for our grill. 
It took longer than I expected, but it turned out good.  Mae baked a vegetable
dish, rice with gravy and a tossed salad to go with my chicken.  After eating
dinner, I cleaned up the grill and put it away.  I put all my tools away before
quitting for the day.  Mae and I then read a couple of articles out of the Ensign
and then we played a game of Rummy in which I won tonight.  </p>

and I got up about 7am and started the day.  Mae was busy with house work most
of the day.  She started out going to Gifford’s where she picked berries.  I
didn’t think she would get many but she got more than expected.  I worked on
the carts most of the day.  When I finished welding the second cart, it is
still ½“ to high for the totes we have.  I also needed some more welding rod,
so this afternoon Mae went with me to get the welding rod.  While I was getting
that, Mae called a hardware store and found the casters that I need.  As we drove
to the hardware store, we passed Best Buy and I wondered if they had totes, so
we stopped to check.  They had some that will fit on the carts under the
house.  We bought 7 of them but when we got to the car Mae realized that the
clerk had only charged us for 6 of them.  I went back in and paid for the 7<sup>th</sup>
tote and they were appreciative that I came back in and paid for it.  It took
us a few minutes to find the hardware store and when we went in, they had the
casters at the checkout stand ready for us.  When we got home, I cleaned up my
tools and locked them up.  Mae had dinner ready so we ate.  We watched a show
on TV, and then we played a game of Rummikub which I won, before going to bed
at 9:40PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early and was afraid that if I got back into bed I might wake Mae, so I
went into the frontroom to sleep in the recliner.  I had a headache and could
not go back to sleep.  After some time I got up and took two Acetaminophen
(Tylenol) and went back to bed.  I still did not go to sleep but enjoyed just
laying next to Mae.  We got up and had breakfast and I soon went to work on my
storage carts.  Mae went out to eat lunch with some of the Sisters in the
Clinton Ward.  She enjoys keeping that friendship alive.  After the luncheon,
Mae went to Scott’s where she took Kaitlyn and Kaden to the Layton Park where
they enjoyed feeding the ducks and playing.  This afternoon I finished the
carts and I put the totes, that we had bought yesterday, on the one cart, just
to see how they fit.  As I did so I was one short on the totes but had 7 lids. 
There were only 6 totes instead of 7.  I wondered how we had made that mistake
as I was sure that we had seven after the experience yesterday of finding that
the cashier had only charged us for 6 and I had gone back and paid for the 7<sup>th</sup>
one.  I cleaned up my work area and put tools away.  When Mae came home I
mentioned that we were one short on the totes.  Mae told me that she had taken
one to put items in from Scott’s.  That solved the problem.  I received some
return e-mails on the portion of my journal that I had copied and sent to my
family.  Some of the replies were very critical and I can recognize why.  You
would think that after 78 years I would learn something!  I too often say
things in such a way as to be offensive to others.  I am often reminded that I
am a long ways from being even close to perfect!  Also as we drove to and from
David and Shauna’s home, Mae read an article from the Ensign, by a lady that
fought cancer.  In her article she commented that she realized the her fight
was challenging, but she had never experienced a divorce, abuse, the death of a
parent or child, job loss, poverty, addictions, having a child with
disabilities or many other major storms that have burdened the lives of
others.  That is so true and I should not expect everyone else’s life to be
compared to mine.  Deanna told me the other day that some things are sacred to
her and maybe now or never should they be shared with others.  <b>I need to
remember that we each have our own life to find and live the best we can.  </b>I
am sorry that I shared my journal with others.  I did get a special return
email from Becky about it.  We drove up to Morgan this evening to be with David
and his family.  Before going to David’s, we drove on up to Morgan where we
went to the Browning Outlet Store and I bought 2 Browning hats.  Shauna had
dinner all ready when we got there.  It was a great meal with much effort going
into it.  We enjoyed the evening with them.  They do have a special family.  It’s
now getting quite late and I am very tired.  I forgot to put in this entry that
I got a call from Bishop Presnell that Evelyn Hilton had been taken to the
hospital in an ambulance this morning.  I called their home number and had to
leave a message for Mike, her son.  Mike, Evelyn’s son, called me while we were
at David’s and told me that her Doctor was out of town and another Doctor
changed her morphine prescription from 90 mg. to 180 mg. and she evidently went
into overdose shock. They are keeping her in the hospital tonight as she is not
out of danger yet.  I called Bishop Presnell and passed that information on to
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up about 7:30am and Mae was already up.  The house was cold so we had to
turn on the furnace for a few minutes just to warm it up.  I put in calls to
Murdock Chevrolet to schedule time to have our car serviced.  They had an
opening at 10:30am so we ate and I took the car in.  They did need to change
the air filter and so that was not on the warranty, but everything else was
ok.  I finished cleaning up and then took my tool trailer down to the storage
lot and brought my boat back.  Mae and I went shopping at Sportsman Warehouse
where I bought some fishing equipment and a pair of warm socks for Mae.  We
next went to Home Depot where Mae paid the minimum payment on her account. 
That is where we charged Marianne’s swamp cooler.  We hope that the utility
company soon sends us the refund on that item.  We next stopped at Wall Mart
for some hot dogs, to be used for fish bait, and a couple of other items. 
After getting home, Mae started dinner and then went to our ward choir
practice.  While she was gone, I mowed the lawn and entered this entry.  When
she got home, we ate and then went up to the McKay Dee Hospital to see Evelyn
Hilton but she had been discharged.  We came back and stopped by, but Harold
said that she wasn’t up to having company, so we left.  We watched a show on TV
while we ate our dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were both up before 8am but by the time we ate and got going it was getting
about 10am.  I did call the VA hospital in SLC and with the help of a very
polite receptionist, I got an appointment for the Sleep Center department for Tuesday,
September 27.  I then took water over to Jackie and visited with her for an
hour.  I started making Almond Butter.  Darma came over and brought us a couple
of apples and visited for a little while.  At 2pm Bishop Presnell came and got
me and we went down to Marianne Ray’s to visit.  While there Bishop informed
her that they had made some changes in the Home Teaching / Visiting Teaching
and Mae and I would no longer be assigned to her.  When I got back home, I
finished making my almond butter and then started grilling some chicken for dinner. 
Sandi and Gary came for dinner with us.  They set their camper up at Willard
Bay North area.  After dinner we played one hand of “Hand and Foot” and after
the first hand we called it a practice hand as we don’t know all the rules for
the game.  We then played a game of “31”, which Sandi won.  They then left to
get out to their camp and we got a few things ready to go out fishing with them
in the morning.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up about 6:25am as nature called, although the alarm didn’t go off until
6:30am.  I was sorry that I hadn’t realized the time and shut off the alarm as
Mae hadn’t slept very well. We had set the alarm to wake us so we could go help
clean the church.  I told Mae to go back to sleep but at first she refused
until I got upset with her, then she gave in.  I got me a dish of cereal and
then went over to the church to help clean.  I was glad that I did as there
wasn’t very many that showed up.  When I got home Mae was up and had almost
everything ready to go.  We got to Willard Bay about 9:30am, but it took us a
little while to find their camp.  It was after 10am before we got out fishing,
but that is about all we did was “fishing” as there wasn’t any “catching”. 
That seems to be my luck at Willard Bay!  We came back into shore shortly after
noon as some of Gary’s family was coming to join them.  After eating, Mae and I
went out fishing a little longer but didn’t have any luck.   Before docking, I
drove over to the beach area and we found Sandi and Gary’s sister (Samantha)
out on kayaks.  We visited with them and took some pictures.  Sandi also told
me that she loved my email. That did me some good for everyone else, that has
commented about it, except Becky, has been critical about it.  We loaded the
boat and cleaned it up before coming home.  We tried to find the BYU vs Utah
foot ball game but couldn’t find any station on our TV that broadcasted it.  We
were able to find on the internet that Utah beat BYU 20 to 19.  I wished that we
could have seen it as it must have been a very good game.  We watched a pretty
good show on Netflix before taking our showers and going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were lazy and stayed in bed late.  I went into the front room and watched the
last part of the Tabernacle Broadcast.  It was very good.  While Mae started
her hair, I prepared breakfast of egg omelets.  klaus Decker brought a package
to us that had been delivered to their place by mistake.  It was my clock that
we ordered for my Christmas present from Mae that I really want.  We have a
clock in the front room, but you can’t see it well.  I want one that sits on
top of the bookcase that has big numbers and I can see from sitting in the
recliners.  After breakfast I repented of my pride, and hung our flag, not to
honor the perpetrators that destroyed the Twin Towers, killing an untold
number, but remembering the many that died and gave so much of themselves in
that terrible, humiliating, tragedy!  And I believe there will be many whose
names are very familiar to the people of the United States.  Sacrament meeting
was very good, but I am afraid that I fell asleep for part of it.  Brother
Gifford gave the lesson in priesthood meeting and I really enjoyed it.  Sister Terkelson
gave our S.S. lesson and did a good job with it.  After getting home, Mae and I
tried to get our calendar straightened out as the next few days are going to be
busy.  I upset Mae as I tried to get the calendar on the Ipod cleaned up.  I
need to learn more patience and to speak with a gentler voice.  Mae went
visiting and I took a nap in the recliner.  This evening we went over to Justin
and his mother Lily’s home for a barbecue that they had invited us to. 
Justin’s wife Karen was also there and we enjoyed meeting her.  There was a
good size group from Lily’s church there and we enjoyed visiting with many of
them.  After returning home, I wrote in my journal and then played games on the
computer waiting for Mae to play her brain games.  However Marianne called and
Mae talked to her for quite a while.  It is now too late to play games with Mae
so I will finish this entry and play another game of Hearts on the computer while
waiting for Mae and then we will go to bed. </p>

got up at a fairly good time and soon had breakfast.  Mae got the washing going
and after breakfast, I took the boat down to Peterson Marina and had them check
the prop, as I was worried that it had too much play in it.   After checking
the prop the head mechanic said it was just fine.  That report made me feel
more at ease.  After returning home, we got packed and we left for Chubbuck
about noon.  We arrived there shortly before 2PM.  Rick and Georgia arrived
within 30 t0 40 minutes after we got there.  While we were still outside
getting things into the house Kim and Jeanenne also arrived.  Angela soon had
lunch ready of serving taco salad with all the trimmings.  We had a wonderful
afternoon visiting and even playing a game of Crochet in the back yard before
the weather turned off cool enough that we went indoors.  Angela then served
dinner of chicken enchiladas.  After a wonderful meal and visiting, Kim and
Jeanenne left for home.  The rest of us visited and enjoyed the evening playing

and I got up early and left for Preston to attend the funeral services for
Michiline Young.  Karen Hyer called Mae the other day to see if we were coming
to the funeral as they wanted to see and visit with us.  They were one of the
couples who we served in the Philippines with.  They have a home in Preston. 
They came soon after we got there and Mae visited with Karen on the couch in
the entry way of the church and Charles and I visited in the overflow of the
chapel.  It was a nice funeral and we got to know more of Michiline’s siblings.
 We went out to the cemetery and then returned to the chapel where a meal was
served.  Following the meal, we helped put the table and chairs away.  I guess
that is a standard practice in this ward.  Even Bruce helped and we didn’t
think that was necessary for him to help when he is the grieving spouse.  We
stopped and visited with Irven and Sandy for a while.  We played a game of
Mormon Bridge before starting home.  While we were in Logan, we looked up Brother
Fred and Sister Edith Amunson.  They are now in the Williamsburg Retirement
Center.  We miss them since they have moved from our ward.  We enjoyed a nice
visit with them and also ate dinner with them in the dinning room.  We came
home from there and were quite tired.  Mae wanted to check on our bank account
and saw a charge she didn’t recognize.  She saw that our credit card had been
used and asked me about it.  I got my card out of my wallet and then we
realized that it was the clock that I had ordered through Amazon and they used
out credit card to run their charges.  We watched a show on TV before going to

ready to pack into the truck, I realized that I didn’t have my wallet!  We
started looking without success.  We were not very concerned about losing it
yesterday as we remembered looking at my credit card last night.  We went
through all our baggage without success.  Mae thought that we could go without
it, but I wouldn’t have my driver’s license or any identification.  We were
planning on me buying an Idaho fishing license, but would have to have my Utah
fishing license for that. We kept looking everywhere when at last I suggested
that we start one bag at a time going through every item.  I went through two
bags while Mae started through our large suitcase for the third time, when she
pulled out one of my jump suits and found the wallet in the pocket.  I had that
jump suit on when we had looked in my wallet for my credit card.  I had laid
the jump suit on the bed planning on wearing that one today.  However when Mae
saw it out on the bed, she just packed it.  We were glad to finally find it,
but we had spent all morning looking for it.  With it being late, we decided
not to take the truck and boat, so packed the car and left.  It was after 5pm
when we got to Jeff and Gail’s.  We enjoyed the children and this evening Jeff,
Gail, Mae and I enjoyed a game of Hearts.</p>

Jeff’s work.  We ended up discussing the new GPS totally controlled cars.  Jeff
said that tomorrow they will start using those cars in New York City to replace

over.  From the games, we went to Sportsman’s Warehouse where Jeff and I got
fishing licenses, along with a few other items for fishing.  We went out to
Harriman to the fish hatchery, where we saw White Sturgin Salmons.  There were
four of them in the one tank and each one was from 4 to 6 feet long.  We could
lie down on the side of the tank and as they would swim by we could touch them. 
The rest of the hatchery was pretty much closed for the weekend and so we
couldn’t see anymore than the fingerling tank.  Seeing and touching the Sturgin’s
made the trip all worthwhile.  We next drove out to a pond where we did some
fishing but didn’t have any luck there.  We tried a river but still no luck. 
On the way home we stopped at a McDonald’s where we got something to eat.  It

There is also concern that the company may be selling out to Chinese investors,
just a possibility.  Without the HOPE that comes with the Gospel of Jesus
Christ, he seems quite depressed to me.  I don’t know how to help him.  Mae and
I attended the block meetings with Gail and the children.  During the
Sacrament, Ben wouldn’t partake of the emblems and neither did Matt.  The
Priesthood lesson was on the family, demonstrating love for your wife, Family
Home Evening, Temple Marriage, etc., all the things that should hold the family

him to get gas.  While there we washed the car.  As a family we played some
games this evening, but then Ben became unhappy as he realized that he wasn’t

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;background:white'><span style='color:#222222'>                We were up
early this morning to fill an assignment of working in the Welfare Cannery.  We
picked up Brother Max Fife and Sister Judy Decker who went with us.  Our ward
was assigned to have 10 individuals there but the 4 of us was all that showed
up.  This put a hardship on the Cannery, but we did the best we could and we
did enjoy serving there.  We were tired when we got home, and so after lunch we
took a nap.  I believe that I slept for over an hour and Mae slept for over two
hours.  We did get some things put on the carts under the house.  After supper
we went visiting to Sister Lemon.  When we got home we were ready for bed
tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

sleep very well last night and I feel that I am coming down with a cold. 
Neither Mae nor I slept very well.  I am also having cramps in my neck and I am
guessing that it is from the exercise I got yesterday from stacking cases of
tomato soup.  I had to turn the furnace on this morning to warm the house up a
little.  We didn’t eat breakfast until 9am and so we are getting a late start. 
I e-mailed Bruce about two trailer homes in the park for sale and caught up my
journal.  It is sure easy to get behind in my journal but I will try, mainly
because we have been advised that we should.  We are very concerned about our
family.  We have concerns that we never expected to have.  As we discussed the
world situation, as we ate breakfast, we find that our only hope is in the
Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Without it there is little hope.  We had appointments
with Jennie at 2:30pm for me and 4:00 for Mae, and we were there until after 6pm
when we left.  She spent a lot of time with Mae as she has some serious
problems that Jennie is concerned with.  Her blood pressure was really high and
the scan shows she has bacteria in her.  I checked out very good with a lot of
improvement since the last visit.  After getting home I watched a TV show while
Mae worked on the computer.  After that show, Mae came in and watched another
show, before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;background:white'><span style='color:#222222'>                We were up
and started getting ready to go to Salt Lake for the Wedding of Jared Smith and
Tiffany.  This is Barbara and Steve Smith (Roy’s daughter son).  Sister Lemon
called and asked if I could check out her water softener, so I went over and
reset it.  We made it to the Temple with time to spare, but the traffic was
slow due to heavy rain.  Following the wedding, we waited to be in the family
pictures.  It was really cold and raining, so wasn’t very pleasant waiting for
the bride and groom, and they were over an hour before they came out.  Sandy and
Irven went inside where the photographers wait, and we followed them.  After
the pictures, we then went to the Wedding Breakfast.  We had met Charito “Tita”
is her nickname, (Roy’s Filipino girlfriend, who he hopes to marry) when we
came outside the temple.  She is a pretty and nice lady.  We visited while we
ate at the church.  From there we went to a company in S.L. where I purchased a
set of drawer rollers for our computer desk.  When the fellow told me that they
would cost about $2.50, I was surprised that they were so cheap.  I reached for
cash in my wallet and he asked me if I had an account.  I told him that I
didn’t and he said that he couldn’t take cash and so he would just give them to
me.  I offered him a $5 tip but he said no!  Was I surprised!  We left for home,
but before we got to Bountiful the traffic started backing up.  I got to stop
and go most of the way.  We got off the freeway at Clearfield and stopped at Kent’s
for some groceries.  It was still slow traffic until we got almost home.  Most
of the trouble with the traffic was due to the stormy weather.  Roy and
Charito, Charito is the name of the lady that Roy is planning to marry, anyway
they beat us home.  We visited and had something light before going to bed. 
Roy slept in the recliner in the front room and Charito (Tita) slept in the
guest room.  We went to bed shortly after 10PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

got up early and went to the Church house to help clean it.  We had a good
group out and we were finished within an hour.  After returning home, we
prepared breakfast for the four of us.  After breakfast, Roy wanted to go visit
his friend Farrell Blanchard so I helped him find Farrell’s phone number and
address.  Roy and Tita were gone for some time which gave Mae and I a chance to
take a nap.  We slept for over an hour and felt much better after the rest. 
Mae prepared a nice dinner which we all enjoyed.  At 5:30pm Mae and Tita went
to the Women’s Conference at the Stake Center.  Roy and I visited while I
cleaned up the dinner table.  We then went over and bought new windshield
wipers for our car.  We also had an opportunity to visit concerning he and
Tita’s future.  I had checked with Charles Hyer concerning the reverse mortgage
on Roy’s home and there isn’t much chance of adding Tita to it, so as it now
stands even if Roy and Tita were to marry, when Roy dies, Tita would be left
out.  My suggestion, and Charles agreed that Roy should see what the Reverse
Mortgage balance is compared to the possibility of selling the home and coming
out with enough to repurchase, even a Mobil Home.  This evening we watched a
movie on Netflix, but I was unable to understand the wording and so I came out
and worked on my journal and histories.  I started working on some of my early
journals.  Roy came out and we got talking until it was almost mid-night when
we quit and went to bed.  Mae and Tita also enjoyed talking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;background:white'><span style='color:#222222'>                I woke up
with a cold and headache but felt good enough to start egg omelets.   Mae was
soon there to help me.  We had a nice breakfast and enjoyed visiting with Roy
and Tito.  I am impressed with Tito’s concern for Roy’s welfare.  I hope that
we can get things worked out so that if they get married and Roy passes on,
Tito will still have something.  We enjoyed meetings this afternoon.  Following
the scheduled block meeting time, Mae and I met with Bishop Presnell and others
to discuss the Temple Attendances.  We will continue trying to get others to
attend more often.  I had Roy and Tito go to our house after the block meetings
ended.  After we got home, Mae finished a very nice roast dinner.  We then
cleaned up the kitchen and did the dishes.  After that, I suggested that we play
a game of Mexican Train Dominoes.  As it started out, Roy could not get an
understanding of the game.  We were about to give up, but then Roy began to
understand and the game proceeded with everyone enjoying it.  It was between
10:30 and 11pm before we got to bed.</span></p>

sleep well and I woke early.  I was able to go back to sleep but woke about
8:30am.  After breakfast Tito and Roy left to go to Irven and Sandy’s.  They
stopped and saw the Brigham City Temple and also the Logan Temple on their
way.  Mae and I went through our Living Will and then went to the Utah DMV
Department where we got the title of our house transferred to the Trust.  We
then got our Living Will’s Notarized at the America First Credit Union.  After
that we went looking for the Roy Utah Transit station, but had to ask a couple
of times for directions.  It really isn’t far from our house, once we found
it.  Neither Mae nor I felt very good, but we watched a show on TV.  Following
that show Mae talked to Marianne for sometime on the phone.  A show came on
that I didn’t feel was appropriate to watch but I couldn’t get the TV channel
to change.  It was really frustrating, but after shutting the power off and
reopening with Netflix control and restarting it, I got the channel to change. 
I watched a Gun Smoke story before turning it off.  Marianne had kept Mae on
the phone for a long time and I wasn’t very sympathetic and so I upset Mae.  We
have got to get up early so I will close and go to bed.</span></p>

woke at 4:30AM but when I got up, I found that Mae hadn’t slept much so I told
her to go back to bed and I would go without her.  She did get up and fix me
some breakfast and saw me off.  Everything went well on the trip down but when
I got to North Temple and got off, according to the instructions I had printed
from the internet, it gave me about four blocks to walk to make connections.  I
rode the tram to 6<sup>th</sup> and Main where I had to change and get on the
tram that went to the University Hospital.  When we got to the University, I
had to walk up to the V.A. Hospital, just under a mile and all uphill.  It was
quite a walk and I was very glad that Mae hadn’t come with me.  I don’t think
she could have made that walk.  Just walking to it and then inside the Hospital
about wore me out.  It was, with the help of someone that worked in the
hospital, that I was able to locate the sleep center office.  When I walked
into the receptionist desk she couldn’t find an appointment for me.  I was worried,
but they worked me in.  My equipment was checked and they provided me with the
supplies that I needed.  They also set an appointment for me to return on
December 5<sup>th</sup> at 9am to meet with a Doctor.  From there I had to walk
back down to the UTA station for a train back down.  I made it back to 6<sup>th</sup>
and Main, but I was confused with the transfer.  A lady there directed me to go
back to the Salt Lake Central Station and catch the Front Runner from there to
Roy.  By the time I got home, I was tired and didn’t feel very well.  Mae had
got some sleep while I was gone, but neither of us is feeling very well.  After
lunch, I lay down and went to sleep, but Mae couldn’t sleep because I was
tossing too much.  I did fill our water jugs after I woke up.  I watched some
TV and this evening I entered my journal for today.  I’m not feeling very well
and neither is Mae.  Mae beat the tar out of me when we played Rummy.</span></p>

about 5:30 this morning but still don’t feel well.  We slept a little longer
before getting up.  I really haven’t done much but watch some TV and sleep.  Mae
went to Choir practice as she is feeling some better and the choir director
wanted her to come.  Mae prepared pancakes &amp; scrambled eggs for our supper
and then we watched a good movie, a true story of a gymnast who was training for
the Olympics and then got in a terrible accident.  She went on to help others
train in special dancing contests and then went on to her dream to be a gymnast
at UCLA.  I still feel lousy.</span></p>

shortly after 2 am and spent the rest of the night in the recliner.  I didn’t
get much sleep, but also couldn’t find anything worth watching on the TV.  It
is a shame that you have to pick through the filth to find the good on TV anymore. 
Often you think a show sounds like it will be a good show, and then suddenly
evil will stick it’s ugly head up.  I did find some good shows on the BYU
channel.  Mae is so good to me and is trying to help me feel better.  She went
down to Gifford’s where she picked a nice dish of raspberries.  This evening we
were going to settle down by watching a show on Netflix, when the back doorbell
rang.  It was Roy and Tito who had tried to find some place in S.L. to stay but
due to General Conference, it was almost impossible, so they came back to us. 
Although I am not feeling well we invited them in.  we soon went to bed.</span></p>
