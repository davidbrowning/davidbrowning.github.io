<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, October 1, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke this morning between 2:30 am and 3:00 am by the telephone ringing.  When
we finally woke enough to answer the phone they hung up.  I couldn’t get back
to sleep due to coughing.  I finally got up and went into the kitchen where I
read from the Book of Mormon in the writings of Moroni, chapter 1 through 7.  I
next finished my journal entry for September and started October.  The time
sure goes by fast and it is almost unbelievable how the months go by.  I often
thing of Dad Jensen’s comment when I asked him if as time goes by and we
continue to become older, does it continue to go faster?  A few months later
when Dad had a Stroke, he called me to his bed side and said “Do you remember
when you asked it time continued going faster?  Well don’t complain because
when it slows down it just stops!”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
haven’t felt very well today and was up early coughing.  Knowing that if I went
back to bed I would keep Mae awake and with Roy and Tito in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
bedroom and front room I was concerned about waking them.  I set at the
computer desk and did read more in the Book of Mormon.  I love that book and
have great faith in the truth of that book and in the greatness of it’s coming
forth thru the Prophet Joseph Smith.  As I often marvel at my testimony of the
Gospel my mind is greatly concerned as to why my children, with the exception
of Mike and Shellie, have left the church.  It thrills me that though Mike
probably has the greatest pressures of any with his employment, he is still
serving in the Church as Elders Quorum President.  I sorrow for Shellie as she
has the greatest trial with a husband that is inactive.  He is a good provider
financially but his sexual demands and lack of proper support as a father and
husband in the Gospel has been a heavy load for her to deal with.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Roy
and Tito left early to go home.  I did get a little sleep in the recliner after
that.  Mae woke about 7am when Sister Marilyn Bodily called to tell her that
she had 2/3 of a bushel of tomatoes that she could have.  Mae went over and got
it and stopped and bought some supplies at the store.  By the time she got home
the first session of General Conference was on.  After some quick breakfast Mae
started putting up the tomatoes.  I couldn’t let her do it by herself, so I
helped her as much as possible.  We enjoyed conference and by evening put up 17
quarts of spaghetti sauce.  We then watched some TV and took showers before
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 3:30am coughing and was afraid that if I went back to bed I would
wake Mae, so I went into the front room and slept in the recliner.  We enjoyed
the morning session of General Conference.  I worked on my journal while Mae curled
her hair.  This afternoon we again enjoyed General Conference.  I was quite
happy that I stayed alert during the entire session!  I watched the movie of
the Hand Cart Company with Ephraim Hanks and that was sure a touching movie. 
It worries me that if they were required to go through such a trial, then what
might be expected of us in the next short while; I shudder at to think about
that.  There was also a special program with the Tabernacle and a guest group,
which I enjoyed.  Following that I turned on a Western movie, “Gun Fight at the
Ok Corral”.  Because we have seen that several times before, Mae didn’t watch
that with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 7:30am but Mae had been up several times during the night.  I am
still couching a lot and don’t feel up to much.  Mae wants me to call the
doctor but I think I will wait a little longer.  Bishop Mullins got a similar
sickness just before they returned home from their vacation.  I helped Mae
rotate our bed mattress, make beds and helped put the spaghetti sauce that we
put up Saturday away.  I spent most of the afternoon just resting and watching
TV.  This evening Mae and I read from the Ensign for a while and then played a
game of Rummy of which I won tonight.  We got to bed shortly after 10PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 6:30am dreaming about the political dilemma our country is in.  I
was still in such concern that I couldn’t get my mind focused on reading my
scriptures.  I quietly shut the bedroom door so that I would not wake Mae but
then found that Mae was already awake in the front room but laying in the
recliner.  She had slept better than last night but had still woke about 5am
this morning.  She went into the front room so she would not wake me.  I read
while Mae did her morning exercises.  We were starting to prepare breakfast
when Tammy, Dr. Truitt’s nurse called me to ask me about the medical form I had
sent to them to fill out for me.  She visited about D.N.R. form and I explained
1<sup>st</sup> that I am not concerned or have any fear of dying.  My concern
is being found unconchase or not breathing and have the paramedics start life
savings before contacting my Dr. or Hospital where I have already recorded a
Living Will.  After visiting with Tammy, she said that she understood my desires
and would complete and return the form to me.  While I had her on the phone, I
also visited with her about my present health concerns with this cold and cough
I am dealing with.  She suggested that I try a Guaifenesin or over the counter
such as Mucinex, plus I should drink at least 8 glasses of water per day, and
could use a Saline spray.  If I am not feeling much better by Thursday I should
call her back for an appointment to come in.  By the time I finished visiting
with Tammy, Mae had a wonderful breakfast of fish and eggs ready.   After
breakfast Mae called the Hospital and found that Harold had been released to go
home.  She therefore drove down and visited Harold and Eve and they are ok.  On
the way home Mae got the mail, visited Joann Higham then came home and went
down to visited Sister Lyndsay Wayment.  She got back just in time to go to the
Temple.  I took a nap, watched some TV and filled capsules’ with magnesium
powder.  It was about 5pm and shortly after getting home Shellie called and she
was visiting with her for over 2 hours.  Before going to bed we played a game
of Rummy and Mae won tonight.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
feel much better today and so I did a few things around the house that were in
need of attention.  After breakfast Mae went over the budget with me.  As seems
to be the normal, we are always short on money.  I feel that I need to sale my
boat.  Especially this year, I have had little time to use my boat due time,
money and the climate; I have only had the boat out three times.  I became very
depressed at the thought of selling it but I believe that I should be able to
get about $4,500.00 out of it.  It would also decrees the storage lot fee by
ten dollars a month as well as other maintains cost.  I took the boat down to
the storage lot for now.  I put some canning items away on our storage carts. 
I emptied and cleaned our distiller.  This I should do at least yearly, but I
haven’t cleaned it since we move over here.  It was really in bad shape and
took me some time to get it cleaned up.  In between cleaning cycles I mowed the
lawn, ate lunch and watched a TV show.  With Mae’s help we got some of the
house siding trim, from under the house where I had stored it, out loaded into
the pickup.  She and I then took it back to Home Depot and got refunded for
it.  We also paid off the bill at Home Depot, for the air conditioner that I
had installed in Marianne Ray’s home this last spring.  We were suppose to get
a refund from the power company for that cost, but a have concerns that that
refund will never come, and we will stand that expense.  We next went to Costco
for several items.  By that time I was completely tired.  Before going home we
stopped at Bed Bath and Beyond for a wedding gift and at J C Penney’s for some
clothes for Mae.  Although I stayed in the truck for those two stops, I was
completely given out by the time we got home.  Still something needed to be put
away after getting home.  We ate some dinner and I soon went to bed.  When I
went to bed, I ached with muscle, legs and head pains.  Mae has been very busy
today and was tired, but she took the time to rub my legs and feet.  Although
Mae was tired and had sent several hours working on my History and Stories, she
continued working on my computer files.  When our computer crashed last
February and our Grandson, David, retrieved our information from the crashed
main memory, he was able to transfer many files to our Off Line Hard Drive.  We
had been using the Off Line Drive as a backup file for just such an event. 
Anyway, with this transition of files, we ended up with several duplicated
files (with the same name) although with some of those files not having the
same or complete data.  This has caused me great anxiety as I have found
different data, especially in my personal life history and stories.  In fact,
if I had not been for Mae, and the many hours she has spent, I believe that I
would have just given up on these histories and stories and thrown it all in
the trash can.  I often wonder if they are worthwhile or any value!  If it were
not that a Prophet instructed that we should keep a Journal, and for Mae’s
encouragement, I don’t think I would continue.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up at 12:05AM and found Mae still working on my computer files.  I was now
wide awake and so Mae went to bed and I turned on the TV.  A Western show had
just started, that I had not seen so I stayed up and watched it.  I slept well
and didn’t wake up until 8:30AM.  Mae was up and almost ready to go to Scott
and Mishelle’s where she will help Mishelle, as well as go to Grandparent’s Day
with the twins.  She had my breakfast ready before she left.  I started reading
“The Kolob Theorem” by Lynn M. Hilton, PhD for the 2<sup>nd</sup> time.  I read
this book a couple of years ago but find his theories, explanations and
understanding very interesting.  I decided to work on some of my stories.  I
was interrupted by a phone call from Bryce.  We decided to meet north of 12<sup>th</sup>
street and 1900 West and give him his welder back.  After doing that I went
back to my stories until Mae came home.  We ate a quick dinner and Mae left for
choir practice.  I cleaned up the kitchen and wrote more in my journals.  After
Mae returned we watched a show on TV before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 7:30am and Mae shortly after.  After breakfast I went down to Gifford’s
and picked raspberries and dug up the carrots.  Gail brought Rachel to stay at
our place while she and Matt went for haircuts.  Ben didn’t come as he is not feeling
well so he stayed at Gail’s mothers place.  When Gail and Matt returned we ate
dinner and then Mae took Rachel and Matt to a Halloween Park and Gail went to
stay with Ben.  While there Mae purchased 2 nice size summer squash at $2.00
each.  She also stopped and bought us some chicken for our dinner.  This
evening we went to the movie, “The Spirit of the Game” which was taken from a
true account.  We really enjoyed the movie.  On the way home, Mae told me that
Rachel told her of some of the anti-teaching against God and the Church that
Jeff is teaching to his children.  Those things really upset me and left me
unable to go to sleep until after mid-night.  Along with that my C-pap wouldn’t
fit comfortable and so I went into the front room where I had a restless night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up about 7am and started cleaning and preserving the carrots I dug up
yesterday.  Scott and Kylan stopped over with our pressure cooker.  They had
been at the Ogden Airport where Kylan got to go flying with the Young Eagle program. 
He was quite excited about it.  We were able to get the carrots put up by noon,
getting about 25 pints in the freezer.  I laid down to take a short nap, but
Mae let me sleep of over ½ hour.  I prefer not to nap that long as it seems to
through me off on timing.  This afternoon we attended the Wedding reception for
Elaine Blumer and Spencer Burgess.  They were married September 2<sup>nd</sup>
in the Los Angeles LDS Tempe.  The address for the reception was Washington
Park, lower pavilion, exit 134 on I-80, Parley’s canyon, Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Now to put that in the GPS it just doesn’t work.  I know where Parley’s Canyon
is and when we got off exit 134 we found a sign pointing to the left.  My eyes
focused to a golf park to the left but there were highway workers and truck on
the right side of the road and so we did not see the next sign directing us to
turn right.  We kept looking for a entrance to the golf course on the left but
couldn’t see one and so traveled several miles on up the canyon.  Finally turning
around we came back to where the second sign was now in view which then put us
on the correct road.  We sure enjoyed the reception, again being able to see
Jean Burgess as well as Spencer, who the last time we saw him he was just a
little boy and now a tall good looking young man.  His bride Elaine is a
beautiful Young Lady and they just make a beautiful couple.  We also got to
re-meet all the rest of the Burgess family as I don’t believe we have seen them
since Allen’s funeral.  We also got to see Ron and Joan Johnson as well as the
Patterson’s and visited with them.  It was a very enjoyable evening.  When we
got home I was tired and I soon went to bed.  Mae stayed up until mid-night
working on my journals for me.  She edits my journal for me and makes many
corrections for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3:40am and us up for a while.  I read the lesson that I think will be
given in Priesthood meeting, maybe?  I went back to sleep in the recliner and
slept until almost 8am.  After we got up Mae did a little more work on my
journals and then I was able to print of the last three months to put them in
my hard print binders.  We talked to Jeff and found out that he got sick on
Friday, thought he could go back to work on Saturday, but again had to come back
home to bed and he is still in bed today.  We called Sandi and set up next
Friday to go out to her place to get some of our things.  She said that
Thursday or Friday would be good and when I asked her if she didn’t have to
work, she said that it would give her a good excuse to take a day off.  As I
have an appointment at the V.A. on Thursday we set the date for Friday.  We
attended the block meetings, but in Priesthood meeting they announced that
Stake High Priest meeting would be in the Stake Center at 5PM.  Brother
Terkelson and I took the Sacrament to shut-in families during Sunday School
time.  We got it to 3 out of the 4 but then Brother Terkelson had to go home so
he could go to work.  I then got something to eat and went to the High Priest
meeting.  That meeting was very worthwhile.  Following that meeting, I visited
with Bishop Presnell about Brother Funaki being approved to help with the
taking the Sacrament to the Shut-ins and he said that would be ok.  I then
asked if I could have a Priesthood blessing concerning my hearing.  He asked
about our Home Teacher, and I told him that we hadn’t been assigned one since
the Patterson’s had moved.  He asked if Tuesday evening would be ok.  I agreed
to that.  When I called Brother Funaki, he was in Salt Lake picking up his wife
from work, but expressed his desire to help me another time.  I tried to make
arrangement for someone else, but then when I called the one family to go to
they felt it was too late, so I took the bag back to Brother Decker.  The two
of us set and visited for a while.  It is now getting late so we will soon go
to bed.</p>

got started before to lat but the time sure went fast.  I got the garbage out
and then went down to the storage lot where I sealed the roof on the camper. 
Mae brought lunch down to me and we ate there.  I brought our boat back with me
as we are planning on going fishing Wednesday.  Brother Flint gave us five fish
and so I filet them and sealed them in freezer bags. Mae has been busy with house
work most of the day.  I helped her get things ready as we invited Charles and
Carlyon Saunders over this evening to visit and play games.  We had a good
evening but Mae was really on a winning strike tonight as she won every game. 
It’s now late so good night.</p>

slept well last night but Mae got very little sleep, so I tried to keep quiet,
shutting most phone service off so that she might sleep.  Not wanting to spend
the time watching TV, I went to my Stories and Autobiography and worked on
them.  It was 12:30 when Mae got up and so I quit and started other projects. 
Mae called Marianne Ray concerning the Reimbursement we are supposed to get for
the AC unit I installed on her home this spring.  Marianne gave Mae a phone number
to the power company and Mae called.  They said that is was sitting there
because of the difference in addresses as to where the installation took place
and the address where the check was to be mailed to.  She said that with this
call to straighten that out, is should now go right through and we should
receive the check in 3 to 4 weeks.  <b>I HOPE!</b> Mae and I did some yard work
before going visiting.  We were sure to plan for enough time so we would be
home before 5PM because Bishop Presnell said he would stop by about 5pm.  I
wanted a Priesthood Blessing before I go to the VA hospital on Thursday. 
However, I got a call from Dr. Thomas at the VA asking about “What they are
checking me for Thursday” and when I told him that it was not for Dizziness he
said that they would then need to have me take a MRI scan.  I told him that I
had a MRI with Dr. Owens.  He then asked if I could bring him a copy of the MRI
to him when I come on Thursday.  That may cause some challenge as the record
department is closed now and won’t open until 8am tomorrow.  We are going to
try, but we may have to rearrange our fishing trip.  Mae and I did get some of
our V.T. / H.T. visits done this evening.  We got things ready to go fishing in
the morning, before we went to bed.</p>

and I got up early and went to East Canyon Reservoir fishing.  The water is
very low but we were still able to launch our boat.  It was a beautiful morning,
but fishing has been poor.  We quit fishing shortly after 1pm, having caught
only two small fish that we just let loose.  After wiping down the boat we ate
our lunch at a bowery.  I was able to call the Regional Medical Center and
talked to the record department at 8am this morning and they told me that I
could come in anytime before five pm and they could get the information on my
MRI.  Dr. Thomas from the VA Audiology Department called me about 9am and he
was pleased to hear that I will bring that information down to him in the
morning.  Having these cellular phones sure makes it nice to be able to make
phone calls while fishing.  When we got home we cleaned up, then went up to the
hospital and got the records.  We got home shortly before 5pm so I had time to
take a short nap before Bishop Presnell and Bishop and Sister Mullins came. 
The two Brothers gave me a Priesthood Blessing that I requested to have prior
to going into the VA for these tests.  After dinner this evening Mae and I
watched a movie on TV, before going to bed.</p>

woke early this morning but that was ok as we had time to shower, get ready and
have breakfast before leaving for Salt Lake.  Dr. Thomas at the VA really
didn’t have anything that he can do or suggest for my hearing.  He suggested
that I get on a low salt diet and he was willing to write me a prescription for
a drug, that might help but it would cause low blood pressure and might mess up
the Electrolytes.  We decided not to try that, so we just came home.  We
stopped at Toms Market in Clearfield and bought a few items.  We next stopped
at Jennies and got four items the she suggested I try.  I may just have to live
with the problem.  After returning home we ate some lunch then laid down for a
few minutes and took a nap.  We then took the curtains down in the front room and
Mae tumbled them in the dryer to remove the dust from them.  I removed the
blinds and the window screens.  I then washed the windows on the outside while
Mae washed them on the inside.  The one set of blinds broke when I tried to
remove it.  I was able to find a new set of blinds at Wall Mart and so the two
windows in the west side of the front room now match.  Mae had choir practice
at 6pm that she stayed for a luncheon put on by the Cedar Crest Ward so that the
Sisters of the two wards could get to know one another.  After hanging the
blinds and the curtains I got me something to eat and watched a show TV. </p>

was going to be there to help me and when I called, his wife answered.  I
apologized that I got her up, but she said that she was up getting ready for
work anyway.  She told me that she was sure that the sisters at the dinner last
night left the tables up so we did not have to worry about doing it this
morning.  I came back home and we had some breakfast then left, going to the
Graf’s where I borrowed Ron’s trailer.  We then stopped at United Rental where
I rented a dolly.  We next traveled out to Sandi’s.  Gary had already hauled a
lot of our boxes up from the basement to the garage.  Then Sandi’s neighbor
across the street came over and helped me load all the rest into the truck and
trailer.  We backed the trailer across the lawn to the window on the north side
of the house.  Mae and Sandi handed the boxes out the window and Richard took
the boxes from Mae &amp; Sandi and handed them to me in the trailer.  It didn’t
take us very long to get loaded.  Gary got home shortly after that and so Sandi
and Gary met Mae and I at the Costa Vita Restaurant where we ate lunch.  We had
to drive quite slowly, because of the weight in the truck and trailer but got
home shortly after four PM.  When we got home I just quit for the evening and
watched some TV.  Mae kept busy for a while.  </p>

woke at 6:30am and read for a while.  When Mae woke I prepared an egg omelet
for breakfast.  I opened one of our packages of bacon that we bought from Lee
Gifford and repackaged it so that we can get a smaller amount out of the
freezer at a time.  I then seeded 4 pomegranates and packaged them for Mae. 
This afternoon we unloaded the pickup and have it stacked in our driveway until
Tuesday afternoon when Scott and Kylan will help me store it under the house.  Irven
and Sandy stopped by and got the items that we picked up for them at Costco.  We
visited for a while and then they left.  They hadn’t been gone very long when
Irven called to tell us that he had put my watch on his wrist without thinking,
and still had it.  They stopped and visited with Deanna for a few minutes and
then came back to bring my watch back.  Mae invited them to stay and have
something to eat with us.  We had expected the Gifford’s to come over at 5:30pm
to visit and play games.  However, Bruce stopped in as he had been looking at
Amundson’s home, but they are asking quite a bit for it and it needs quite a
lot of repair.  Mae called the Gifford’s at 6pm and they had worked all day
putting up apple sauce and had forgotten about the time, so we will make it
another time.  We invited Bruce to stay and eat and then we played games for a
while.  Mae and I took our showers and then watched a show on Netflix before
going to bed.</p>

Bridge.  Ashley had never played and had to be convinced that she could play. 
It ended up that she won.  The twins were watching Tarzan on Netflix and so
when they all went home Mae and I watched the end of a show.  The show Shanando
then came on and we started watching it.  Mae was tired and went to bed, but I

back to me.  I went to the Bishops Store House in Kaysville and bought some
cardboard boxes to hold the gallon size cans as we have several loose cans of
food storage that I want in boxes before putting them in the storage areas.  I
then stopped at Home Depot and bought some boards to put under the food storage
that we are putting under the house.  I spent the rest of the afternoon getting
the storage area cleaned and ready.  After dinner I made some phone calls to

the Temple and at the Sealing Office before 1PM.  We had a wonderful session
and had 12 from our Ward, plus Janet Rohwer was there and had her parents
sealed together, then she and her Brother and Sister were sealed to her
parents.  Afterwards, she was sealed to her husband. Those were very emotional Sealing’s. 
We then had several family members from Bishop and Ravee Mullins family as well
as Sister Laumer had several family members to have Sealing’s done.  Following
the Sealing session, almost all of the ones that went to the Temple came to our
home.  As soon as all our company left, I went right to work on unloading the
cases of food storage.  Scott and Kylan came over at 5PM and they helped us put
the cases of food storage under the house.  It was late when we finished.  We
sure appreciated Scott and Kylan’s help.  We were sure tired when we went to

new drawer slides on the computer desk.  I visited with Tim about trimming his
windows and we are going to do it this Saturday.  Mae went to choir practice
this evening.  I got the desk repaired before putting up my tools this
evening.  I turned on the TV and watched some of the Western evening shows. 
When Mae got home, she worked on her Ward Histories.  She has also been working
on getting some of our old Family movies that we had recorded on VCR ready to

just starting, so I watched it.  Although I have seen that movie many times and
can almost quote it from memory, I still enjoy the show.  I am not sure that
there is a John Wayne movie that I have not seen.  Mae came out just at the end
of the show.  After breakfast we started work on getting the rest of our items,
that we had stored out at Sandi’s, organized and stored under the house.  We
finished just in time to go to the Gifford’s for the evening.  Originally we
had planned on them coming here, but as they are allergic to cats and dogs and
we are tending Davinci here, so we went to their place.  We enjoyed the evening
playing games and visiting.  They had some flyers on Evan McMullin who is
running as an independent candidate for President of the United States that is
very exciting to us.  We were tired and soon went to bed after returning home.</p>

day, I really wasn’t surprised when it didn’t.  Following conference we went
over to Gifford’s as Sister Gifford asked that Lee and I give her a Priesthood
Blessing.  We came home and had some lunch and then I took a nap.  Mae is busy
editing family videos that she is going to have transferred to digital
records.  I worked on the computer for a while.  Mae and I took Davinci for a
walk, and while we were gone David called and told us that they were at our

traveled right up to the V.A. hospital.  We got there with a little time to
spare and so set in the car and read for a few minutes out of the book
“Unlocking Isaiah” by Reg Christensen.  Mae had been reading it on the way too. 
My appointment went well with Dr. Howell and he ordered me a set of hearing

Bountiful for lunch.  We then stopped at Wal Greens in Roy to get my
prescriptions.  Mae then did some shopping while I took a nap in the car.

13 of The Kolob Theorem this morning.  It really gave me a prospective of how
small the mind of man is to the knowledge of God!  I am enjoying that book.  I
wanted to get right to work this morning, but I had a survey for the VET

for me I didn’t feel that I could refuse them.  I got our drinking water filled

I helped her.  We got 7 large garbage bags of fall leaves gathered up before we
quit.  I filled out today’s journal; we then called Kaden and Kaitlyn to wish
them a Happy Birthday.  Being that it was still early, Mae and I played three
games of “Sequence” in which Mae won two of them.  We then read the story of

that were there.  All of Doreen’s family was there except Blair and Phil,
Jackie’s husband.  I felt good that Irven and I could be there to support
Doreen.  It was good to visit with Lanny and Larue, as well as Jackie.  Their
family has all grown up and expanded as have ours, and it was good to meet some
of them.  Leaving for the cemetery, I was again grateful for my GPS, as we got
separated from the funeral procession by traffic and by putting the name of the
cemetery in, it took us directly there.   We then joined the family for a
luncheon, which gave us opportunity to visit for a few minutes before leaving
for Irven’s.  I got home just after 9pm and was extremely tired.  Good to be

Although I wish that Sandi could return to the Gospel principles, my heart aches
for David, Scott and Jeff.  I got myself some breakfast and then started on
Sandi’s project.  I worked on Sandi’s project until 10:40 pm, just stopping to
have lunch, a short nap and dinner this evening.  Mae had invited Layne Johnson
who recently lost his wife to health problems, for dinner.  It rained today so
I had to move my trailer over to our car port so I could work with my tools and
equipment under the car port and out of the rain.  Mae met with Sister Marge
Becraft at 10 this morning for her to show Mae how to do histories for our
ancestors.  Mae said she learned a lot, but Marge talked so fast that it was
hard for her to take notes and still concentrate on what Marge was showing
her.  After Mae got home, she fixed my vegetable, fruit &amp; Kevir smoothie
and then fixed a sausage casserole, jello salad and vegetable dish (onions,
celery, carrots, zucchini, banana squash, yams and seasonings) in preparation
for dinner tonight.  She also chopped up onions, celery and green peppers to
store in the fridge and freezer.  We had a nice visit with Layne, while we ate
dinner, and then I went with him to look at Marianne’s car as she had called

breakfast at 7:30am and that also let me stop any construction noise.  After
breakfast, I went back to work and now I didn’t I didn’t have to be concerned
about the noise.  Sandi came shortly after I started, and we went full speed
with the project.  Mae had us a very nice lunch.  We got a call from the office
before 4pm that a water main had broken and we would soon be out of water. 
Sandi and I quickly got some containers and filled with water.  It was after 4:30pm
when we quit work on the tree and Sandi went home.  I would have liked to have
finished the project, but I was tired so I just cleaned up and put everything
away.  That in itself took me over two hours.  Mae and I took the car over to
the car wash and washed it as it was very dirty.  Because of setting up my work
area under the car port, due to the possibility of rain, we parked the car in
the North Driveway.  It did rain and brought leaves down on the car and really
made a mess out of it.  We stopped on our way home and got 2 Chicken Burritos
to go with our dinner.  When we got home we tried to find something on TV to
watch but couldn’t find anything.  We even tried to find something on Netflix
but after starting two shows we gave up and went to bed.  The water came back
on before we went to bed, but I was too tired to take a shower then, so we just

broadcast, but fell asleep before it finished.  When I woke a rebroadcast of
General conference was on.  I watched the opening talk of President Monson and
then fell asleep again.  I did get my journal entry for yesterday entered and
then worked on today’s entry before getting ready for meetings.  Meetings went
very well.  Bishop Presnell asked if I would help Brother Lumar give Brother
Jensen a Priesthood Blessing following the Block Meetings, which we did before
coming home.  After getting home Mae got us some dinner.  We then went down to
visit Wendell Siglin.  He is the one family we have had trouble making a Home
Teaching visit.  He was home tonight and also his wife Linda.  We broke the ice
with Linda tonight and had a great evening visiting with them.  We also visited
the Hilton’s again for a few minutes.  Evie is really having a lot of pain
health wise.  After getting home, I called Brother Okey and gave him my Home
Teaching report.  I called and visited with Grant Young for a few minutes this
evening.  They are doing well and their new home is coming along quite well.  I
did ask him about Siglin’s TV and he said it sounded like a technical problem
and they would need a tech to check it out.  I then called the Siglin’s back
and gave them that information.  Mae and I then turned the TV on and watched a
show about the Alamo.  We had seen a show on the Alamo several years ago but
this was a variation of the show that we had not seen.  We watched it and so
didn’t get to bed until late.</p>
