<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Neither
Mae nor I slept the best last night so we were late getting up.  After getting
breakfast, I worked most of the day cutting door jamb material.  Mae also came
out and helped me, especially as we ran the material through the plainer. 
Besides other things, she worked on our budget and got the bills paid.  She is
really good at that and I am afraid that I make it hard on her because I don’t
earn enough and I spend too much.  This afternoon we took time to go to the
nursery and buy some squash and cucumber plants and replant them.  The ones we
planted from seed didn’t grow.  This afternoon Bishop Mullins came and got me
and we worked on Marianne Ray’s car getting the electrical problem repaired so
her door window and rear view mirrors will work.  We also checked her air
conditioner to be sure that the one on Bishop Mullin’s will fit Marianne’s
home.  We then checked her kitchen sink faucet as it is leaking around the
spray nozzle, but it is not an emergency now.  I didn’t get much more done on
my project except just clean up and put tools away.  This evening Mae and I
watched “The Pursuit of Happiness” on Netflix.  It was taken from a real life
experience.  It was a good movie and really made us feel grateful for what we
have.  The experience of the fellow being “down and out” and then the IRS
taking all his money out of his Bank Account sure brought back memories for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
eating breakfast I filled water jugs and took a bottle over to Jackie across
the street.  I worked on the doors.  Mae helped me a couple of times.  About
11am we went down to Marianne’s and helped her move some furniture so that her
washer could be replaced.  We had lunch then I had lain on the log but when I
finished, I fell asleep so Mae let me take my nap there.  I worked on my doors
for a while and then after eating dinner, Mae and I went over to visit Jackie
as she wanted us to come to visit her.  When we came home it was calm (no
wind), so we used some Seven on some of our plants to kill some bugs that are
starting to eat the plants.  We then walked down to Lee’s and put some Seven on
some of our plants there.  When we got back home we played some games of
Rummikub.  I won 2 of 3 games.  Mae talked to Jeff this evening and he sounds
more upbeat than he did the other day.  Things are better since his previous
boss, R.J. quite the company and Lisa now realizes that Jeff is her boss and
she doesn’t have R.J. pushing her up the ladder.  Jeff would like us to come up
more often and stay a week.  He is volunteering to pay for our gas to come up. 
We will have to see how the schedule works out.</p>

.5in'>I woke at 6:30 this morning.  Mae was already out of bed and I soon
realized that she was in the front room asleep in the recliner.  That meant
that she didn’t sleep well last night, so I tried to be quiet and let her
sleep.  I enjoy reading the scriptures especially in the morning.  I had said
my morning prayers, shaved and was just about to get into the shower when Mae
came in.  She is such a joy in my life and the thought of her leaving this
earth before I do brings tears to my eyes.  She is truly my very best Friend here
on earth.  Mae suggested, last night, that we eat out side on the deck this
morning for breakfast.  Mae made a wonderful pan of blue berrie muffins and I
made an egg omelet.  It was a very pleasant and beautiful morning.  We had just
finished eating and cleaning up when Mike, Becky. Maddie and Jessie came to
bring Mae her Mother’s Day present.  Besides a beautiful card, Mike had found a
giant “Jack” that reminded him of when they were children and Mae would play
Jacks with them on the floor.  Mae loved to play jacks and could usually beat
everyone she played.  That was truly a beautiful Mothers Day gift.  They are on
their way to Montana where they have a Condo for a week.  Mae sent a text to
both Mike &amp; Becky thanking them for stopping in and for the beautiful
Mother’s Day card and gift Mae expressed her love for them and Becky texted
back expressing her love for us and for the example Mae has been to her and the
love and support Mae has given her.  I texted Becky back and told her how much
I appreciated her love, support and strength that she gives to Mike, especially
when you realize that you two are the only ones, of our family, who are working
for an eternal marriage.  Becky texted back saying that we have raised a
wonderful family and that she is lucky to be a part of it.  Mae texted her back
saying that Yes, we do have a wonderful family and we love each of them dearly. 
I worked 4 hours and 45 minutes on Irven and Sandy’s stand for their 200 gallon
water barrel.  When I quit I had to hurry and take a quick shower and we met
Maggie and Bill Klass at the Golden Corral for dinner.  We enjoyed the visit
with them and were glad to be able to see them as they are moving to St.
George.  It is now after 10PM so we need to get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up in time to be at the Church house by 7:30am to clean the building. 
There was a few there but not what we should have.  Mae and I started cleaning
the restrooms.  After we had them clean and the paper refurnished, Mae left and
went to a Utah Daughters of the Utah Pioneers meeting that was held in Layton. 
I then moped both bathrooms, the kitchen and under the drinking fountains. 
Brother Jones and I were the last ones there.  Brother Jones gave me a ride
home.  I walked down to get the pickup and camper but when I got there I
realized that I hadn’t brought the keys to the camper with me, so I had to walk
back home, get the keys and walk back down.  After getting back home I filled
the water tank and hooked up the battery charger, plus turned the refrigerator
on.  I next mowed the lawn before going into the house and getting something to
eat for lunch.  It was almost 2 pm when Mae got home.  I was a little upset
over that as I just hadn’t expected her to be that long, and I couldn’t reach
her on her phone.  With me being upset that upset Mae as she said she had told
me that it was a conference and would last that long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was a normal Sunday, but I had planned on helping take the Sacrament around to
the shut-in’s.  However Sister Barns had asked me to give some information
during the 1<sup>st</sup> part of Relief Society.  It took longer than I had
expected so by the time I got into Priesthood all the assignments had been
passed out.  When we got home we mainly got some dinner and relaxed the rest of
the evening.  Our air-conditioner is not working so it is quite hot in our
house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up early and got packed to go camping.  We got away at 9am and Bishop
Mullins and RaVee were ready when we got there.  We went to Weber County Camp
Grounds just below Causey Reservoir.  Being a Monday Morning most of the camp
sites were empty.  We got a nice area where we both could set up our campers. 
After getting set up and having lunch, I took a nap.  This afternoon the four
of us played a game of Rummikub, which Mae won.  We had our individual dinners
and then we held Family Home Evening with Bishop Mullins leading the
discussion, discussing the Gift of the Holy Ghost.  After the discussion we
went to our camper where Mae and I played a game of “Farkel” before going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept well, but I got upset when we got up so I went for a long walk.  I walked
up around Causey Dam and quite a ways around the North side.  On the way back I
saw Mae in the upper B camp site.  We walked together back to our camp site. 
Part way back we saw a trail that went up the hill sideways.  I climbed up it a
little ways but it looked too steep and poor footings so I started back down
and slipped.  Lucky for me I grabbed a bush or I would have fallen into a
wash.  Nothing hurt except my pride.  This afternoon we played games with
Bishop and RaVee.  This evening I built a bonfire and we roasted hot dogs for
dinner.  We have sure enjoyed being with Bishop Mullins and RaVee today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up and had a nice breakfast.  Bishop came over and visited with us.  He
wanted to apologize to me that he had not helped me chop wood and build the
fire last night.  We assured him that there was nothing that he needed to
apologize for.  After breakfast Mae and I went for a walk, going over to the
“A” area to look at the lodge and camp grounds there.  That area rents for $120
a night for the whole area.  You have to make reservations for it on the 1<sup>st</sup>
of November in order to have a chance of getting it for the next season.  After
lunch we packed up and came home.  I stopped at “The Nut and Bold” store and
got a handful of washers for 75 cents.  At Home Depot or Lowes that would have
cost closer to 5 dollars.  At home we got unpacked and then I took the camper
down to the storage area and unloaded it.  We ate some dinner as we watched a
couple of TV shows.  Our AC unit is not working but we might be able to get a
repairman out tomorrow.  The house is sure hot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were a little later getting up this morning although we slept well.  Mae gave
me a hair cut before breakfast.  I went over to Durk’s and got the materials I
need for Irven and Sandy’s job.  As I started for home, I got a call from
Mountain Air to let me know that the Technetium was on his way to our place.  I
got home a few minutes before he got here.  It was just a High Temperature
protection switch that had tripped and he showed me how to check for it.  He
also serviced and washed the compressor while he was here, as is a standard $79
for coming out.  He also showed me how to reset the switch myself if it should
happen again, plus he showed me how to wash the coolant filters.  We sure felt
blessed that that was all that it needed.  What a relief and a Blessing.  The
house sure is much more comfortable now.  Mae went to the Temple but she said
that she and the Harper’s were the only ones that went.  I stayed home and
finished building the stand for Irven and Sandy’s water storage, plus got
things packed up to take to their place tomorrow.  Mae and I went up and
watched Conner’s baseball game this evening.  The team they played weren’t very
good and they won 19 to 1.  We enjoyed the evening and were glad that we
supported David and Conner.  I went to bed by 10:30pm as I want to leave for
Irven’s about 6am tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t get away until almost 7am for Irven’s.  I stopped to fill up with gas at
the Chevron station when Mae called me to let me know that I had left some of
the sheets of Irven’s bill on the kitchen counter.  She drove it down to me. 
Mae is going to tend Scott and Mishelle’s children today and tonight so they
can get away for a little anniversary trip.  I got up to Irven’s about 8:30 and
went right to work setting the water tank up.  I didn’t have all the parts we
needed so Irven and I went into Smith Field and bought the few items I needed. 
I did stop and have lunch with Irven.  The quote that Chris gave me originally
was wrong and Irven and Sandy were upset over it.  I called Chris and he
doesn’t know what happened so he lowered the price by $50 so that it was just
what the tank cost them.  Irven was still upset and so I lowered it another $10
out of my money.  They accepted that price.  I finished up and picked up my
tools and came home.  I am glad that I am finished with that job.  Due to the
road repair on the Freeway, I took the old highway through to the interstate
entrance just north of Smith and Edwards.  As I came past Bryce’s home, I
stopped to see how Deanna was doing, but they were not home.  It was 7:30pm
when I got home and put my tools away.  I called and talked to Mae, but decided
that I was too tired to go to Scott’s (where Mae is) to stay for the night.  I
got something to eat and watched some TV before going to bed.  As I was typing
this entrance a fire truck stopped in front of our house.  I went outside to
see what was going on and found that they were over at Jackie’s.  Her son and
daughter-in-law were there along with several paramedics.  She finally let her
son drive her to the hospital to be checked out.  I hope it works out ok for
her.  I watched a show on TV before going to bed.</p>

woke at 5:30am and as normal read for a while.  My I pod reminded me that we
had cleaning assignments at the Church house this morning.  I made it, but
there wasn’t very many there.  I did the restrooms but when I looked at the
kitchen the floors looked good so I let them go this time.  I repaired some of
the sprinkler heads on our lawn and got some lunch.  By then I had to get ready
to attend Emily’s Music Recital that will be at the Layton Library.  I got
there just as Mae and Scott’s children arrived.  The Recital went very well and
Emily did especially well.  Emily was happy to see that Kylan, Ashley &amp; the
twins were there with us.  Following the recital we went over to the Dollar
Store to get some items for the Bushnell cousin’s reunion that will be held
next Saturday.  From there we went back to Scott and Michelle’s until they
arrived home.  We visited with them for a little while before coming home.  We
went to the wedding Reception for Jacob &amp; Aubry Steadman.  They sure seem
like a cute couple.  Jacob’s father was our Bishop when we moved into the
ward.  He is now in the Stake Presidency.  He’s a great man.  After getting
home we watched the show “Seventeen Miracles” and enjoyed it again.  Each time
we watch it. I think we appreciate it even more.  I was in quite a lot of pain
when we went to bed.</p>

woke feeling some better and after taking a shower and shaving, we had
breakfast.  I went into the front room to read but I fell asleep again.  Before
going to church, Mae visited Jackie across the street.  We then visited Harold
and Evelyn Hilton for a few minutes before going to Church.  Harold is really
having troubles and Evelyn fell last night and is hurting some.  She is walking
much straighter than before the operation.  Sacrament meeting was very spiritual
today, even more than usual.  Glory and Lee Gifford were at meeting today.  It
was sure good to see them.  Mae and I came home after Priesthood meeting and
Relief Society meeting as Gail and the children came over for dinner with us. 
We sure enjoyed having then come.  Gail told us that Jeff had called and told
her that his back has cramped up last night.  She had him take some medication
and that seemed to help, but he had to fly out today for New York.  I sure hope
he will be ok!  We enjoyed having Gail and the children here for the afternoon
and evening.  We got word that Roy and his Granddaughter Joylin will be here
about 1AM in the morning.  It is now after 10PM and we are still trying to
figure our calendar as it is sure full.</p>

and I woke about 7am but tried to be quiet so that Roy and Joylin could sleep,
however, we realized that they were not here.  All evidences indicated that
they had came but were now gone.  We tried to contact then by phone and they
later texted back that they would return later.  We got busy with things around
the house.  Jimmy knocked to tell us that we had a broken water line in front. 
I spent most of the day working on sprinkler lines.  It seems that the old pipe
saddles are giving way and the gasket is blowing out.  When I went for parts I
bought some extra so that I would have then on hand for future problems.  I
also set up a drip line around one of the shrubs and a drip line to Mae’s
hanging plant, this will save her the trouble of remembering to water it.  Mae
went out to lunch with some of her friends in honor of Dian Graff’s Birthday. 
Roy and Joylin returned and so I let them sleep for a while.  They had left at
6am and driven to Blackfoot, Idaho to see Joylin’s brother.  He has just become
engaged to a girl there that he had met on a Seminary trip to Nauvoo, before he
went on his Mission.  They have kept in touch and have announced their plans to
get married.  However, he has joined the military and has now finished Basic
Training and is now going for more training.  Joylin wanted to<span
style='color:red'> </span>meet this girl and see her brother before he leaves. 
I continued my projects until they got up.  I went to Del Taco and bought some
Chicken Burritos for lunch.  I spent some time visiting with Roy and Joylin,<span
style='color:red'> </span>which also slowed me down with my projects.  I was
just finishing when Mae came home.  Mae made us a nice dinner with me grilling
chicken breasts.  This evening Charles and Caroline Saunders came over for an
evening of visiting and playing games.  Roy and Joylin joined us.  Roy still
has problems with remembering and being able to understand the rules (He has
dementia), but we still enjoyed the evening.  At 10:30pm Roy and I took Joylin to
the Amtrak station in Salt Lake, as she will take the train back home.  It was
late when we got back home, so soon went to bed.</p>

showed Bob and Roy David’s property that they plan to build on in 2 or 3
years.  We then drove back down Ogden canyon and returned Bob before Roy and I
returned home.  Mae had spent the afternoon with Jeff’s family at Dinosaur Park. 
This evening we started watching a show “To Catch a Thief” and Mae joined us
but Roy went to sleep.  Mae also went to sleep for part of the show.  When the

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>            Mae made a nice breakfast
of fish and fried potatoes.  Gary and Sandi left before the rest of us, as they
have to stop and put Pipper in a kennel before going on to the campground, as
no dogs are allowed in the camp grounds.  Roy followed Mae and I until we got
to Jennifer’s home in Paradise.  He left his car there and rode the rest of the
way with us.   I was amazed at the road that we had to travel for the last 4
miles to the campground.  It was just a one lane, narrow, windy dirt road. 
When vehicles met, one or the other had to pull over so the other could squeeze
by.  I was glad that Scott and David did not bring their trailers.  Gary did
have some trouble and bent his jacks as a car would not yield for him and he
pulled off the road too far and dropped a wheel into a rut.  When we got to the
Camping area it was very nice.  Several members of the family came with some of
them sleeping over night.  We enjoyed visiting and becoming reacquainted with
Family.  Irven’s family had a nice dinner for all that came.  </span></p>

and went for a walk.  We again joined with family members for breakfast,
visiting and games.  Mae and I left for home just before noon.  We came home
and met Mae’s siblings and companions at our church house where we had lunch. 
We had planned on having several cousins on the Bushnell family line here for a
cousin’s reunion, but with Aunt Joy passing away, that changed the plans.  We
had the lunch catered and Mae had to order in advance and the meal had to be
paid for, so us and Mae’s siblings paid for it, ate it and shared the rest to
take home.  Terry &amp; Angela were sick, so couldn’t come.  We enjoyed the
time together.  Mae and I thought that we would have the evening together as
Roy is going to stay at Irven and Sandy’s for a few days.  Things didn’t work
out quite that way, as Roy had put my wallet in his pocket this morning.  Plus
when he got to Irven’s he realized that he hadn’t brought his medication. 
Irven called and Mae checked his clothing bag and found his needles and a black
pouch that she thought contained the medication.  In talking to Irven, we
decided to meet in Brigham City to make the exchange.  We did and when we got
home Irven called to tell us that Roy’s medication wasn’t in the bag.  Mae
checked and found some more things thinking she had the medication.  As we got
on the freeway, I had Mae try to call Irven to be sure we had what Roy needed,
but she couldn’t get the number to work.  When we got to Brigham City again, I
was right and we still didn’t have the right medication.  Irven, Sandy and Roy
stopped and got something to eat and then they came to our place.  Mae thought
she had searched everywhere, but searched again and found a pocket on the front
of Roy’s hanging bag that had the medicine he needed.  It was late by then and
Sandy didn’t feel that she could drive home that late as she was already too
tired to drive.  They slept at our place.</span></p>

our place about 7am.  They had just left when Mae looked in Roy’s room and his
medication was there on the dresser.  She ran out but they had already left. 
She grabbed our keys and tried to catch up to them but when she got to 12<sup>th</sup>
Street she had no way to know which way they had gone.  She tried to call them
using my phone but she didn’t get an answer, so returned home.  When she got
home she woke me and we decided that we would just have to wait until they got
home before we could reach them.  I rven called and told us that Roy did have
another bottle of medication so he would be ok.  Mae had been really worried,
so he had left in her pajamas and without her purse with her driver’s license
to try to catch up with them.  Today is Mae and my 57<sup>th</sup> wedding
anniversary and after things settled down from Roy’s forgetfulness, we had a

get a perm.  I got the bed made and then went down to Lee Gifford’s where I
picked 2 gallons of strawberries and most of the peas.  After returning home, I
rebuilt two dining room chairs of the dining room set we got from Bob.  It was
after 3pm when Mae got home from getting her hair done as she also did some
shopping.  I helped Mae clean the strawberries and get them ready to freeze. 
Mae finished the weekly washing and folded the clothes and put them away.  We
watched some western shows on TV while we ate our dinner.  I worked on my
journal entries, catching them up to date, as the past few days has been so
busy that I haven’t spent much time with my journal.  It is now almost 10pm so
we had better get to bed as tomorrow we will attend Aunt Joy’s Funeral in Fillmore.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>            I woke earlier than 5am
and so got up.  We had our breakfast and arrived at Rick and Georgia’s by
7:20am.  They we almost ready and we soon left for Fillmore.  Traffic went well
and by driving in the Fast Lane we made very good time.  When we arrived at
Fillmore the GPS gave us the wrong location to the Chapel, however, we were
there in plenty of time.  Uncle Van and Aunt Allison were there as Aunt Joy had
specifically asked Uncle Van to speak at her funeral.  The funeral service went
very well, however, with the exception of the Bishop telling us that Aunt Joy
had arranged to have a current Temple Recommend before her death; there was
very little reference to religion.  We felt sure that Uncle Van would speak
more on the plan of salvation, as he has been a bishop and temple worker, but
he had a stroke and is still not doing too well, so that’s probably why.  He
mainly spoke about memories of his sister. I felt badly about that and sure
hope that my funeral is a religious service.  I worry about that with the
present feelings of my children concerning the Church!  At this point Mike is
the only one that holds a current Temple Recommend.  I believe Shellie’s hold
up is Roy and I hope someday he will wake up.  After the services, we went to
the cemetery which is a fairly short distant east of the chapel.  Before
leaving the church parking lot, I realized that Uncle Van and Aunt Allison had
left to drive to Yellowstone National Park, without anyone else going with them
to drive.  I know that they were driven to Fillmore by their daughter but did
not know that no one would continue to accompany then to Yellowstone.  That
really upset me as Uncle Van can’t drive and Aunt Allison is not in good enough
health to drive that far.  Had I realized that, I feel that I would have driven
them myself.  About that time Bryce, Terry and Kim’s daughter, Summer,
commented about Kim leaving them in the parking lot of the church and he walked
to the cemetery.  That left them no options but to also walk.  Bryce commented
that he was getting too old to walk like that and Kim commented back that he
knew how they felt because he also was getting older.  I interrupted telling
Kim, “No you don’t know what it is like to grow old!  Just wait a few more
years and then you will begin to find out what it is like to grow old!”  I
guess I spoke out of turn and felt bad after I had said what I did.  The
dedication of the Grave was given by Aunt Joy’s grandson and I felt he did a
very appropriate dedication.  We then went back to the chapel where the Relief
Society Sisters fed us a very nice meal.  The traffic was a little slower
coming back but we still made pretty good time.  Mae and I went Home Teaching /
Visiting Teaching to Sister Leah Nelson and Sister Ray when we got home. 
Bishop Mullins stopped and talked to us for a minute in-between our visits. 
After getting home I went over to Bishop Mullins and returned the church key to
him that we had borrowed for last Saturday.  I also talked to him concerning
removing his swamp cooler and installing it on Marianne’s home.  We were tired
when we got home and so soon went to bed.</span></p>

back to bed.  I did get up with plenty of time to get to my appointment at the
VA.  However, several things came up and I suddenly realized that I was late
leaving for my VA appointment.  I rushed and was only a few minutes late, but
was still able to get my test taken.  After getting home Bishop Mullins stopped
by mainly to let us know that several people here in the trailer court have had
things stolen during the night.  He just wanted us to be warned.  I guess I had
better be more careful about leaving things out and my shed and trailer unlocked. 
I caught up my journal, called both Layne Johnson and Richard Flint arranging
for them to help me on Friday at 8:15AM to change Bishop Swamp cooler to
Marianne’s home.  Mae went outside and worked in her flowers for a while. 
After lunch I had an appointment with David so Mae went with me.  He checked my
head and froze one spot that has been giving me problems.  He also looked at
the mole on my neck and decided to biopsy it to have the lab check it out. 
While there he also checked a mole on Mae but felt certain that is was ok.  On
the way home we stopped at Home Depot and bought some air filters for the
furnace and some roof sealer for our camper.  We then went to Wall Mart to get
some yams.  While there we bought some potato wedges and some fried chicken. 
We ate that for our dinner.  We stopped at Bishop and Ravee Mullins before
coming home.  We next stopped for a few minutes at Lee and Glory Gifford for a
short visit before going H.T./V.T. to Hilton’s and to Wendell Siglin.  Neither
Evelyn nor Harold are doing very well.  We had a good visit with Wendell. 
After getting home we enjoyed a small dish of frozen yogurt.  I finished this
entry and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

morning I took the camper down to the storage lot.  I dumped the tanks, then
unloaded the camper.  Mae called me just as I started pulling the pickup out
from the camper and I lost my trend of thinking and pulled the electrical plug apart
as I hadn’t unplugged it.  We went to the Temple for the 2pm session.  Brother
Max Fife was the only person that went with us.  I guess we should say we went
with him as he drove.  After returning home Mae and I went over to Home Depot
where we opened a special account under Mae’s name and purchased a swamp cooler
for Marianne Ray’s home, and charged it on the new account.  We learned that
the power company is paying practically everything for a new swamp cooler as
this will help the energy.  You purchase the cooler and then send in for the
rebate.  We talked wth Bishop Mullins and decided this would be better than to
get his down and give to Marian.  We then attended our Ward social and enjoyed
that.  We stayed after the dinner and helped clean up.</span></p>

Layne Johnson.  The three of us worked most of the day getting the old unit off
and installing the new one.  I was there over 11 hours.  I was sure tired and
hurting by the time I got home.  Layne and Richard were good helpers but they
had to be given direction as to what to do.  I had Layne go home soon after we
got the air conditioner on top as he was really tired and his back was
hurting.  Richard stayed longer and Roy came down and helped me some also.</span></p>

although my legs and feet are giving me a lot of pain.  We went over to the
Clinton 20<sup>th</sup> Ward for Sacrament meeting as Breanna Campbell gave a
talk before she leaves on her mission to Europe.  Another young couple, Laurie
and Pedro Del Va, who has recently moved into the ward, spoke and gave
excellent talks.   After Sacrament meeting we went over to visit Bob.  We
invited Bob to come over and have dinner with us.  He seemed to be having a
little trouble with walking so I asked him if we could get a wheelchair for
him.  He refused saying he could walk.  When we got home and tried to get him
up the steps he collapsed and Roy and I could not get him any further than the
back entrance way. Mae tried to help and got the crutches from the shed, but he
couldn’t use them. I finally got him on to the floor and turned him onto his
back.  Mae called Grant who didn’t answer so I had her call the Paramedics, who
came and took his vital signs.  Grant got Mae’s message so soon called and he
and Stacey came over. They were at the air show, so not far away. The
Paramedics got Bob into Grants car and they drove him up to the hospital.  Mae
cooked us a nice dinner of pork chops, rice, gravy, vegetables and salad.  Just
as we set down to eat, Georgia called Mae and they talked until we had finished
dinner and had most things gathered up and in the dish washer.  Bishop Mullins
got word that the Paramedics were at our house and he came right up.  I should
have called him as he was concerned as to my health because of Friday at
Marianne’s.  Scott brought Kylan over to stay with us so that he can go fishing
with Roy and I tomorrow.  It was about 10PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

bathroom and to make it worse he fell into the tub.  Mae heard him call for
help and woke me.  For a little while I thought I was going to have to call 911
again as I couldn’t get him up.  He seemed to be disorientated and didn’t know
which direction he was trying to move.  With a quick prayer he finally
responded and I got his feet under him.  I then helped him into bed.  When he
laid down he just kept saying “I think I’m ok now” repeating it over and over. 
I was nervous about leaving but I checked his pulse and then Mae’s.  His pulse
seemed weaker than Mae’s but he continued to insist that he thought he was ok
now.  My alarm went off shortly after 4am.  I didn’t feel good about waking Roy
so slept a little longer.  It was almost 8 when we got off.  We had to stop at
Wal-Mart to get Roy and Kylan fishing licenses.  It was after 9am when we got
on the water.  We fished until after 1:30pm and never even had one strike.  We
gave up and came home.  After getting home Roy, Kylan and I laid down and took
a nap.  Mae cooked a nice lasagna for dinner.  After dinner we drove up to
Heifer to watch David’s ball team play but the other team didn’t show up.  They
had a practice game for a little while before going home.  We got a text
message form Grant that Bob is responding to the treatment.  He had a serious
bladder infection also and mrsa infection, which seems to be a very great concern. 
He will remain in the hospital for a few days.  Roy seems to be doing much
better today.  On the way home from the ball game, we stopped at Costco where
we bought 4 frozen yogurts for a treat, and then we took Kylan home.  </span></p>

After breakfast Roy and I went into town to take a pair of Roy’s pants to the
cleaners.  We also got a trailer plug to replace the one on the camper.  After
getting home we went to the storage yard and took my boat, and then we loaded
the camper onto the pickup.  I tried to install the new plug but couldn’t
figure out the wiring.  We took the camper up to the house to work on it
there.  I worked for some time and finally drove down to the RV Center on 1900
W and almost to 12<sup>th</sup> Street.  He is booked full for the next several
weeks.  I explained my problem and he gave me an Electrical Diagram to follow. 
With that Diagram I was able to get the plug rewired and working.  Day’s repair
shop called and they have my generator repaired.  Mae went up to get it.  It
cost $139.00 but I guess that’s cheaper than buying a new generator.  Bruce
Young called just as we set down to dinner.  He will come to our place this evening. 
After eating dinner, Roy and I went down and put the cover on the boat.  It was
about 9:30PM when Bruce, Mitchline and Katie arrived at our place.  They had
planned on staying at a hotel with the internet but come to find out it was
just WYFY and Bruce’s program doesn’t work on that.  I believe that he can hook
up to our system and it should work for him.  We made beds on the front room
floor for them and I gave Bruce a spare key to our house.  With us going
camping until Saturday evening, they can stay here until then.  Actually, Bruce
will take Katie to visit her sister Jamie and he will take Mitchline to her
daughter’s home.  This is the main reason they came, Mitchiline wanted to see
her new grandbaby.  Mitchiline has cancer and has been fighting it for over
four years, but it is getting the best of her now.  It was after 11PM when we
got to bed.</span></p>

prepared breakfast, ate, got things packed and cleaned up the house before
leaving.  We had to get gas in the truck, then Roy’s pants from the Dry
Cleaners.  When we stopped at the Dry Cleaners I realized that we hadn’t put
the tie downs on the camper.  I am glad we saw that and got them on.  We went
to WalGreens to buy Roy some insulin but they wanted $139.00 for a bottle, so
we decided that we would take a chance on him having enough.  We next stopped
at a Sub Way and bought some lunch.  It was about 1:30PM when we got to the
Weber Memorial Camp Ground.  We got set up and just relaxed the rest of the
day.  Roy tried fishing but fell into the river.  The restroom that is close to
us was quite a mess so I took a broom and swept it out.  We finished the
evening by playing Rummikub and Mae &amp; I wanted Roy to win so we cheated so that
he could.  We went to bed just after 10PM.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>            It was really a relaxing
day as the camp ground is still quite empty although towards evening more
started coming in.  Mae and I did go for a walk to the entrance of the park to
try getting phone reception, but was not able.  I wanted to make contact with Scott
to be sure that he knew where we were located.  Mae felt that we should put
something in the campsite next to us to reserve it for Scott and Mishelle. 
However, before we did that someone else came and reserved the site.</span></p>
