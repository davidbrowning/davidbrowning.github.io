almost 9AM.  After a nice breakfast, I returned a call to Bishop Mullins.  He
just wanted to be sure that we were aware that Lynn Ray passed away on the
morning of December 31, 2015.  We had received a phone call as we were
traveling home, that Lynn was in the hospital and they put him on a ventilator
trying to keep him here until his son could fly in from Italy.  Bishop Mullins
said that it didn’t work and his son wouldn’t get here until the evening of
January 3, 2016.  After breakfast we called Bryce and Deanna and made plans to
pick them up at 3:30pm this afternoon.  We packed, planning on staying over at
Irven and Sandy’s tonight.  As we were gone on December 31st, we couldn’t have
a New Years Eve party so had decided that we would have a New Years Day party. 
However, just as we were leaving the Ray’s home, Irven called and said that
Sandy wasn’t feeling well so they canceled the party.  We went home and
unpacked the car; we then lay down and took a nap.  After dinner we watched the
movie “An Affair to Remember”.   Although we have seen it many times, we still
really enjoy that movie.  Just as it was finishing, Bishop Mullins came and I
went with him to visit Marianne and give her a Priesthood Blessing.  When I got
home, we couldn’t find anything else that we thought was worth watching so we
went to bed and cuddled.</p>

where he and I started building a “climbing wall” in his garage.  Shauna and
the children went to a cousin’s Baptismal ordnance.  We worked until almost 5pm
when I left to come home.  I quickly changed clothes, and then Mae and I went
to Gale’s mother’s home where we were invited to eat dinner.  After dinner
several of us played a game of “Mormon Bridge”.  By the time Mae and I got home,
I was really tired and really hurting all over.  I went to bed while Mae stayed
up and took her shower.  Before showering, Mae tried to comfort me and warm me
up, as I was very cold.  She is sure a sweetheart and special wife.</p>

morning I read Hebrews chapters 2 and 3.  With the Book by David J. Ridges, “The
New Testament Made Easier”, I am gaining a love for the New Testament that I
have never had before.  While I took my shower this morning, Mae edited my
December journal.  I then got it printed off and added to my written journal
for 2015.  Mae does so much for me.  I don’t think I can ever repay her for her
love!  Scott and his family came over at 12:10pm and brought Mae’s Birthday
gift.  We only visited with them for a few minute,s as we had to pick up
Brother and Sister Sheers for Church.  Marianne Ray called to see if we could
pick her up for Sacrament meeting, but when I told her that we had to pick up
the Sheers, she said that she would come up by herself.  We saved a place for
her but when she didn’t come, Mae went down to get her.  She was just late. 
After sacrament meeting, Marianne had Mae take her back home.  After meetings,
I took a district and with Dave Johnson, we took the Sacrament to shut ins. 
This year our Ward has the late schedule and so it was dark by the time we
visited the last family.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  After dinner we
had planned on taking a plate of food to Marianne, but she went shopping and we
have never heard back from her.  We went down to the Hilton’s to get a good
phone number and then went by Marianne’s to see if she was home, but she wasn’t
there.  I entered this entry and it is now almost 9pm so I think we will go to
bed.  I am also trying to figure out what we need for David’s climbing wall.
Marianne called about 9:30 apologizing and saying she had gone visiting friends
as she didn’t feel like going home since Lynn wasn’t there.</p>

having figured out, in my sleep, how David and I will frame the climbing wall. 
Mae made a nice breakfast and then I went to the Nut and Bolt store and to Home
Depot for supplies.  David and I worked the rest of the day on the wall.  It
was 6pm when I got home, very tired.  Mae prepared something for me to eat and
I showered and went to bed.  David paid for the materials and then gave me
$140.00 for me helping him.</p>

8:00 this morning.  After breakfast, I exchanged some materials and then went
back up to David’s.  I built a 45 degree rectangle section of the wall and that
took me most of the day.  I stopped on the way home at Harvest Moon Health
store for some things Mae needed, and then came on home.  I showered and then
Mae had dinner ready, so we ate.  We then went to the Church House where we got
our Temple Recommends renewed.  From there we went to the Stake House to get
them signed by the Stake Presidency.  We then went to Farr’s Ice Cream where we
bought us each a Frozen Yogurt.  They are much more expensive than the ones we
used to buy at the Maverick stations, but now the Maverick stations have
discontinued carrying the Frozen Yogurts.  When we got home, we watched the movie
“Young Abraham Lincoln”.   We sure enjoyed it.</p>

morning until almost 8am.  After breakfast Mae and I had doctor appointments as
new patience of Dr. Flinders at the Roy Tanner Clinic.  We needed a new Doctor
with the death of Dr. Lee.  That went well and we feel good with Dr. Flinders. 
We picked up a couple of prescription for me, then stopped at the bank and made
some deposits, before coming home.  We stopped at Lee’s Gun shop and got the
.22 that he refinished for Jeff.  It sure looks nice.  I texted Jeff about the
inscription I will have put on the gun.  He is excited about getting it. The
day went quickly but busily. David called me this evening with some questions
about the wall.  I will go up Saturday, and with his boys help, we will try to
get the wall finished.  David has to fly out of town on Friday morning and
won’t get back until Saturday evening.  Mae and I watched a show on Netflix
titled “Second Chance” that was a good show.  I sure enjoy being with Mae!  Mae
gave me a hair cut before we went to bed.</p>

well last night and got up about 8am.  I had gotten up and read for a few
minutes before lying back down with Mae.  I prepared breakfast, while Mae
showered and got ready.  We picked up Sister Janice Richie to go to the Temple
with us.  We had Brother Richard Flint ride with us, when we got to the Church
parking lot.  Bishop and Sister Mullins went to the Temple too, and then when
we got there Brother and Sister Decker were also at the Temple.  Following the
session, we all went to the cafeteria and ate lunch.  After getting home, Mae
went visiting a couple of the neighbors.  I took a nap.  At 3:30pm Mae and I
went down to Lee and Glory Gifford to visit with them.  They are going to South
Africa for possibility three years to help their daughter and son-in-law adopt
three children.  They wondered if we would be interested in taking care of
their yard, while they are gone.  We would get whatever fruits, berries and
vegetables that we raised and he would pay me for taking care of the yard.  It
is an interesting proposition and I have mixed feelings at this time.  Mae
attended Choir practice this evening as the Choir is going to sing at Lynn
Ray’s funeral tomorrow.  While there most of the choir also went to the
viewing.  I worked on my journals, editing my 1973 journal.  Mae got home about
8pm.  After Mae got home, she started taking down Christmas decorations, so I
pitched in and we got all the inside decorations packed in their containers. 
We were tired when we went to bed.</p>

worrying about Sandi, as she goes to court today to settle with Nick as to the
divorce settlement.  This has been a great strain on Sandi, as Nick is trying
for ½ of everything, including the house.  Also in general, I am concerned with
2/3’s of our children and their relationship with the Lord.  We got going quite
early this morning as we have Lyn Ray’s funeral today.  We picked up Brother
and Sister Sheers and gave them a ride to the funeral.  Sister Sheers is a
cousin to Marianne, however, they are much older, he is 94 and she is 90 years
old.  They both have to use walkers, but they still keep going.  Lynn’s funeral
service went very well.  Mae sang in the choir and I was asked to give the
benediction.  We did not go to the  dedication of the grave, as Brother and
Sister Sheers were exhausted, just with the viewing and funeral.  Mae went out
to eat lunch with Georgia, who took her out for her Birthday.  I finished taking
the outside lights down and getting them boxed up.  Mae got home before I was
finished, so she helped me put all the decorations away.  While Mae was busy
cleaning up the house, as we have invited Lyndsay and Darrel Wayment and Judy
and Klaus Decker over this evening to play some games and visit, I installed a
CO alarm in our house.  I then took over the vacuuming and did that for Mae. 
We got good news from Sandi this afternoon.  The Judge awarded Nike half the
furniture, and the safe with what funds are left in it after Nike illegally
removed about ½ of the total amount against previous court orders.  That was
the total settlement that Nike gets.  That was quite a thrill to see, that
because of his greediness, he really lost out.  Sandi had originally offered
him $20.00 plus half of the furniture and belongings.  Sandi gets to keep her
home.  The Judge told Nick that he wasn’t fair for him to get half the house
when he didn’t put any money into it, and she had put in $350,000.</p>

morning, then after getting up and having an egg omelet breakfast, we went to
the Temple and did Baptisms for the dead.  A sister, in our ward, had found
these names of her ancestors and asked if we could have them done.  I did one
name plus 5 from the Temple file.  I then had the privilege of doing the
baptizing of Mae for three names.  We were both confirmed for the names we
brought plus some additional names from the Temple files.  After returning
home, Mae worked on her Ward Historian calling and I watched a couple of
movies.  We went down to Sister Ray’s and helped her move some furniture. 
Because of some of my weaknesses, I went to bed feeling depressed.</p>

depression, and then added to it with my concerns for our children.   I had a
bad head ach so I took some Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and laid in the recliner. 
I was cold and so put a blanket on, but when that wouldn’t warm me up, Mae
brought the electric blanket and put that over me.  I did get feeling well
enough to attend our block church meetings, however, I forgot to take my
glasses with me.  Our Sacrament meeting as well as Priesthood meeting and
Sunday school were very special so I was glad that I did attend.  After getting
home, I had just changed clothing when Bishop Mullin’s called and asked if I
could find someone to help me administer to him and Sister Mullins.  I called
Lee Gifford, who replied that he would need to re-change into his suit and he
would go with me.  Both Bishop Mullins and Sister Mullins were very sick.  It
was a privilege to give them a Priesthood Blessing.  Mae had a nice dinner
ready when I got back home.  After dinner I went back into the front room where
I laid back down in the recliner and put a blanket over me.  I went right to
sleep and slept for sometime before Mae came in and woke me.  We read 3 chapters
in the book “The Infinite Atonement” by Tad R. Callister.  That is a great
book!  As I write this entry I am sneezing quite a bit.  Hopefully with more
sleep, I will be feeling ok to go up to David’s in the morning to help him.</p>

breakfast.  I left before 7am to pick up some materials before going to
David’s.  David and I worked until noon, when I left to join Mae at Kim and
Jeanenne’s for a family sibling gathering.  We enjoyed a wonderful lunch,
followed by watching a show of Sergeant Alvin York, who Kim explained was the
highest decorated Soldier during World War 1, starring Gary Cooper.  I had seen
the movie before but with Kim’s explanation of the story, it was much more
enjoyable.  I then went back to David’s and we finished the climbing wall.  It
was 8 pm when we finished.  I then had some dinner with David before coming
home.  It was after 9 when I got home.  I was feeling ok when I got home, but
when I set down my energy completely left me.  Mae tucked me in bed and I went
right to sleep.</p>

7am before getting up.  Mae was up by then also.  Mae made a wonderful
breakfast of waffles and eggs.  She is sure special!  After eating, I was still
sleepy and was cold.  I laid in the recliner, where Mae tucked the electric
blanket around me and I went back to sleep for over an hour.  After showering
and shaving I took some items to the D.I.  I also stopped at Star Engraving and
ordered a plate to be installed on Dad’s .22 rifle for Jeff.  From there I went
to Murdock Chevrolet and had our car serviced.  When I got home, Mae was
watching a Western movie on TV, while she put our three week’s nutrient pills
into our containers,  so I set down and watched the ending of that show and I
watched a 2<sup>nd</sup> show.  Mae cooked chicken, rice and gravy for dinner. 
We were to go to Patterson’s at 6pm, home teaching and visiting teaching but
they weren’t home so we went to Marianne Ray’s where I also checked out her
furnace to find why it was not heating.  She had changed the filter on the
furnace and hadn’t got the door on right so that the switch wouldn’t reset.  We
visited with her for a few minutes and Mae gave her a lesson.  We then visited
Sister Leah Neilson.  After returning home, Mae and I played some games of
Rummikub in which Mae ended up the winner.  I entered this entry and we went to

minutes.  That sure seems to help.  Bishop Mullins called and asked if I would
help him administer to Ravee this morning.  I hurried and took my shower,
changed clothes and went down.  Ravee is really sick.  I anointed her and
Bishop Sealed the Anointing and gave her a beautiful Priesthood Blessing. 
Afterwards, Bishop gave me a blessing that I might not contact any infection
due to entering their home.  I sure have gained a love for that couple since we
have moved into this Ward.  After returning home and having our breakfast, I
had Mae lie back down and sleep longer.  She hasn’t been feeling very well the
past couple of days.  I did a few chores around the house and started this
entry, before working on my diary entries.  Mae slept for over an hour.  I
worked on my Diary entries, mainly editing the 1973 entries.  I am expanding
several of the entries to the best of my memory.  This evening Mae and I went
H.T &amp; V.T. to Brother and Sister Patterson, Sister Lemon and to Brother and
Sister Hilton.  We still have the Siglin’s to try to catch.  It is now almost
10pm so we will call it a day and go to bed.  We changed our mind about going
to bed and instead we watched “Music From the Heart” on Netflix.  It was a good
show, but as the show progressed the main person in the film started using the
Name of God in vain.  At first it was questionable as to what she said but
towards the end of the film it became obvious.  It was mid-night when we got to
bed.</p>

morning and I was going to go out and clean walks, but Mae convinced me that we
had too much to do, plus it wasn’t very much yet.  As soon as we had breakfast
over with, we went down to the Roy Tanner clinic and picked up the
prescription  that Dr. Flint had written for Mae, took it up and left it with
Wall Green’s to have it filled.  We then went to the Layton Tanner Clinic where
we both had a bone density test.  We next picked up Bob and went up to the PX
on base where we bought some groceries.  Next we went to the Sizzler to
celebrate Bob’s Birthday.  Irven and Sandy joined us there.  We had an
enjoyable lunch with Bob.  After eating, we took Bob back to the center,
stopped at Wall Greens and got Mae’s prescription and then came home.  After
putting the groceries away both Mae and I took a short nap.  Mae went to choir
practice and I worked on my journals.  After Mae got home, she worked on her
Ward History for a while and then we turned on a show on TV.  We watched a dumb

found it dumb.  It’s now 11pm and we are going to bed.</p>

removing some of the snow, from the snowplow, a man from #299 had me come to

appreciation for me cleaning his walk and driveway.  Mae has worked most of the
morning on the Ward History.  She laid down this afternoon for a while as she
isn’t feeling the best.  I went down to the office and visited with them about
some of the snow removal problems, but the only thing they could say is that I
should take it up with the owner, Mr. Jay Nye.  I came home and worked on a
letter to him but I am still not sure just how it should go.  Mae got dinner
ready even though she is sick.  While eating, Mae told me that she had talked
to Shellie by phone.  As Mae told me of her conversation, for some reason it
really upset me.  Then Mae got up to clean up the dinner dishes.  I asked her
to leave things and I would take care of it, but Mae didn’t hear me.   I lost
my temper as Mae continued to clean up, and I slammed my hand on the table and
asked (almost ordered) her to let me do that.  I shouldn’t have lost my
temper.  I get upset too fast, and Mae didn’t even realize what I had said.  Sometimes
I sure don’t understand this life!  This evening Mae and I watched a movie that
showed some of the trials that both White and Black races experienced during
the period of the 1950’s (especially in the Southern States) when the Equal
Rights were being fought for.  I couldn’t help being grateful that I was born
in the West and a member of the Church with Its teachings.</p>

very well last night, so I tried to be quiet when I got up so that she could
sleep longer this morning.  I woke at 3:30am, read another chapter in the New
Testament and checked to see if we got very much snow during the night.  In as
much as it hadn’t snowed but a skiff, I went back to bed and woke again at
6:30.  I finished reading the writings of the Apostle Paul.  I am so grateful
that our Stake Presidency challenged us to read the New Testament this past
year.  I haven’t completed it yet, but DeAnn Jones suggested that we get the
book, “The New Testament Made Easier”, written by David J. Ridges.  That has
been one of the greatest books, I have ever read, to help me understand the New
Testament.  I have read many times the Four Gospels, Mathew, Mark, Luke and
John and have always enjoyed them, but the rest of the New Testament I have
never understood.  With this book I have really enjoyed the writings of Paul
with an understanding that I have never had before.  Last night and this
morning I read the book of Hebrews and thrilled at its messages.  I just wish
that I could get my family to read this book.   I went over to FedX in Clinton
and made some copies for Mae.  While, in the area, I picked up some Get Well
cards for Mae.  I also bought some Chobani yogurt for us.  Mae isn’t feeling
well today, although she tries to keep going.  I talked to Bishop Mullins twice
today and he is feeling some better but Revee is in the hospital, very sick. 
They think she has a strain of Swine Flu, and it has coated her lungs and she
can’t breathe.  This evening we watched the BYU vs Standford in men’s
volleyball.  BYU won although it was a close game.  Following the game, we
watched part of the show “The Gospel of John”.  We weren’t very impressed with
the production.  We finally turned it off and went to bed.</p>

was up for a while before Mae got up.  Mae still isn’t feeling well so she will
stay home from Church today.  I did lay back down for a while, getting a little
more sleep.  Mae did prepare a nice breakfast and after eating, she went back
into the front room and rested in the recliner while I cleaned up the kitchen. 
She also got a temple announcement made up for me to have read in Sacrament
meeting, Priesthood meeting and in Relief Society.  She sure takes good care of
me!  Mae stayed home today, not feeling the best and not wanting to take a
chance of carrying this stuff to anyone else.  I took the camera with me and
took some pictures of the Ward Clerks, the Relief Society Presidency and the
Sunday School Presidency, for the Ward History Mae is keeping.  Bishop Mullins
is still sick and did not attend meetings today.  I believe that Ravee is still
in the hospital with this sickness.  There are several from our ward that are
home with illness.  When I got home, Mae had spent most of the time talking to
Shellie and Sandi on the telephone.  Mae made a nice dinner this evening.  I
cleaned up the kitchen for her and then both Mae and I took a short nap.  This
evening I worked on transferring my 1970 thru 1974 Diary into my computer
journal entries.  This has been quite a project, but if I do not get it done
before I die that information will just about be worthless because there would
be almost no one that could read my hand writing and the information is so
sketchy that most would not know what I was writing about.   Mae has been
working on ward historical records and our home records.  It’s getting late so
we had better get to bed.</p>

but fearing that if I got back in bed, I would wake Mae, I went into the front
room and slept for a little while in the recliner.  I got up about 7:30 as I
wanted to go up to David’s and get my trailer and tools.  Mae got up and
prepared breakfast although she still isn’t feeling well.  After eating, David
called to let me know that it is snowing at his place.  With the grade of his
driveway, it is not safe to try to get my trailer down from his home.  We will
have to wait for another day.  I called Roy this morning, just to check on
him.  He says he just keeps going because there isn’t much else you can do.  He
said that he is sure grateful for Barbara and Russ and all their help.    David
called back this afternoon and said that the driveway was clear, so I went up. 
It started snowing here as I left, but by the time I got to the canyon, it
wasn’t snowing there.  With Tyler, Emily, Connor and David’s help, we got the
tools loaded and the garage cleaned up.  I am glad to have my tools back home. 
I watched a show on Netflix, when I got home, as Mae was busy on the computer. 
Before going to bed, Mae and I played a game of Rook.  I started out getting
way ahead, but then Mae had a good hand and ended up winning. </p>

night, but Mae hardly slept at all.  I tried to let her sleep this morning, but
that didn’t work either.  Bishop Mullins called to ask if I could come down for
a minute.  I went right down.  He had an inspector come down to their place to
see if there was any gas that might be escaping that might be causing their
illness.  It checked out ok, but the inspector had to shut the gas off to the
water heater as it does not meet the mobile home requirements.  When Bishop
asked what he needed to do, the man told him that he had to install a new water
heater, however, when he went to leave he said:  “I would just turn it back on”. 
Bishop Mullins had some questions as to how to restart the heater, so he asked
if I would check it out.  It relit just fine.  I was glad to have gone down,
that I might check on he and Ravee’s health.  Ravee is still in the hospital in
quite serious condition.  He still isn’t feeling well.   This afternoon I did
some errands and then went over to visit Bob.  He is doing ok but is glad to
have company.  He was watching “Pearl Harbor” but was going to start it over for
me.  However, I didn’t have 3 hours to watch it so he put on “The Bad Man and
the Angel” starring John Wayne.  That was a good show.  After the show ended,
we visited for a few minutes, although, most of the conversation has to be on
the white board.  I picked up a bottle of probiotics from Jennie’s office
before coming home.  Mae had been on the computer most of the day and also this
evening working on the ward history for 2015.</p>

Mae was still sleeping.  I thought that she may have taken some sleeping medication
that the Dr. had her get at the pharmacy, so I tried to let her sleep.  Not
wanting to disturb Mae, I went into the front room and cuddled up in the
blankets.  I turned the TV on to get some news, but I think the TV is about a joke! 
Mae came in about 8am having slept all night and she hadn’t taken anything to
help her.  That was good news.  I took my shower and we ate breakfast.  I
called Bishop to check on him and Ravee.  They are about the same, but he is
afraid that he might loss her unless the Doctors can get this infection to
clear up.  I heard that she has double pneumonia, and that she has a condition
where, under certain circumstances, her arteries become inflamed.  This also
happened and it is affecting her heart.   I worked on my journals for a while,
in as much as Mae hasn’t got on the computer this morning.  With only one computer,
and it doesn’t work the best, it makes it a little inconvenient.   I did get
quite a bit accomplished on entering my Diary, before I turned the computer
over to Mae.  While Mae worked on her ward history and presentation, I watched
some western movies while I made up capsules of Ambrotose.  We got a call from
Doctor Flinders office with the bone density test.  I have Pre-osteoporosis 
and Mae has osteoporosis (Mae’s mother had it really bad).  We are yet trying
to determine what we are going to do about these test results.  Mae is quite
sure the Doctor is going to want her to take Fosamax, but she is concerned with
the side effects.  Before we went to bed, we played a game of Rummy with me
winning this time.  We did call Jeff to wish him a Happy Birthday.</p>

last night.  I prepared egg omelets for our breakfast.  I got the bathroom
cabinet drawer repaired.  The guide had come apart and it was in such a small
area that it was hard to reach into the back to rescue the bracket, but I
finally succeeded.  I checked out the ceiling fan in the dining room and found
it was solid.  While I was working on it, I cleaned the fans.  I installed our
thermometer outside on the east patio, so that we can read it from the bathroom
window.  I got myself some lunch as Mae was gone shopping.  At 1pm, I met Lee
Gifford and went over some of the pruning of his trees.  I am not sure just how
I feel about keeping his yard up for him while he is gone for up to 3 years.  We
went over to the church house at 5:30pm, but no one came to go with us to the
temple, so Mae and I left for there.  We did meet Shelia and Tom Harper at the
Temple and accompanied them through the session.  It was different as Tom is
completely deaf, so I had to have the temple officiator get him a monitor,
which meant we had to sit on the back row.  Sheila has poor health and is in a
wheel chair, so they took her and Mae, to the front where they have a space for
a wheelchair.  The sister officiator helped Sheila during the session, but
afterwards, Mae had to go into Sheila’s booth with her and pretty much undress
her from her temple clothes and redress her.  In as much as no one else came
from our Ward to the temple and the Harper’s were tired, we just came home.  I
don’t know what to do or how to do it, but my assignment to encourage our ward
members to attend the Temple, isn’t working very well.  As we got home, we
received a call from Jeff indicating that Matt is sick with a fever, so I guess
we won’t be going up there tomorrow.   I guess we will go to bed early tonight.</p>

and tired.  After breakfast, I slept in the recliner.  I guess it’s a good
thing we didn’t go to Jeff &amp; Gail’s home today.   About 11am, I decided to
go talk to Lee Gifford about the decision that I didn’t want to take care of
his yard and all his trees and plants.  I had my coat on and the keys to the
car, just ready to start the car with the remote control, when Lee called me. 
He realized that I felt overwhelmed yesterday.  He said that he would get a
lawn specialist to care for the yard, and that the trees would be ok, even if I
didn’t prune then while they were gone.  I could use just the grow boxes that I
wanted, and do with whatever fruit and berries that come on.  I could also let
others use some of the planter boxes if I don’t use then.  We had a good talk
and so I will do that.  Mae has been so good to me all day, but I have been
asleep, watched a couple of western shows or read.  This evening we called Deanna. 
She told us that the cancer tests are positive, but at this point they haven’t
determined the suggested treatment.  Mae made me a wonderful dinner this
evening of chicken steak with rice, vegetables and gravy.  Mae has been on the
computer most of the day researching materials as she has been asked to help
with a Relief Society Women’s Conference in the Clinton Stake on the 25<sup>th</sup>
of February.  This evening we tried to find something on TV, but couldn’t, so
we went to Netflix where we watched “Anchors Away”.  It was a good show.  It’s

exercisers that Mae was taught.  I feel that I need them too, as I am not doing
a lot of work now.  Mae made waffles for breakfast.  Mae told me the other day
that she had bought me something for my Birthday.  While we were eating, Mae
and I got talking about our diet, which is very restrictive for me.  I was
enjoying buying a Frozen Yogurt from the Maverick gas stations but now they are
taking all those machines out of their stations as they can make more money by
using that space for a coffee machine.  Without that access, we have gone to
Farr’s Ice cream but it is so expensive there.  Anyway, Mae got excited and
wanted to give me my Birthday present early.  I relented and told her that it
was up to her.  She jumped up and brought me a “Dole Yonanas” healthy dessert
maker that turns frozen fruits into a soft serve desert.  I thought it was
quite cute, at her excitement, as well as her love in wanting me to have
something special.  She is a very special wife and sweetheart!  This morning I
have been reading from The New Testament and from Dallin H Oak’s conference
talk.  Oh, the hope I get from the scriptures and our Current Church Leaders. 
I just wish that my children could or would search them and return to the truth’s
of the Gospel.  We had a late lunch and then Mae wanted to work on the
computer, so I took a nap and then turned the TV on to BYU and watched a women’s
basketball game.  BYU won, but it was a close game.  I then tried to find
something else, when the TV controls locked up and I couldn’t get anything to
work except the on/off, the volume and Netflix.  Other than that, it was stuck
on one channel and I couldn’t find out what channel that was.  I maybe should
have lessened to it because it seemed to elude that Obama is going to try to
have marshal law and he will continue to rule our government.  I tried to call
Comcast, but the technician couldn’t help me.  All of a sudden the TV began to
work.  I don’t know what happened or what I did.  I watched two western shows

After breakfast, I worked on my journals for a while.  At 12:00 noon I quit and
got ready for church.  Meetings went well today.  After returning home, I went
with Brother Daryl Green to take the Sacrament to Sister Jeneane Browning and
to Harold and Evelyn Hilton.  We were going to a Sister that lives in #244 but
when we got there, no one was home.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home. 
After eating and cleaning up, I took a nap.  Mae got on the computer, working
on her presentation for the Clinton R.S. Women’s Conference.  She is making a
Power Point Presentation, so I set the projector up for her, so she could see
how her presentation looks.  I talked to Irven on the phone for a while and I
also called and talked to Sandi for a few minutes.  Mae finally quit working on

When Mae woke, she fixed us some dinner.  After cleaning up the dishes, Mae

morning and Mae was in the front room sleeping in the recliner.  I read chapter
1 of Revelations doing quite a bit of cross referencing and rereading.  With
the help of David Ridges’ book, it sure brought great insight for me.  After
Mae got up – she hadn’t slept very good again last night, we had breakfast
before cleaning up and going into Dr. Flinders to have him remove some
pre-cancer spots on me and to talk about Mae’s osteoporosis and her concern
about taking Fosamax.  Dr. Flinder’s said that in his 8 years of practice, he
has never had or heard from any other Doctor, of anyone having serious side
effects from taking it.  He felt that the chances of not taking it and falling,
breaking a hip or back is way more of a risk than taking it.  After leaving the
Doctors office, we did some shopping at Winco.  When we got home, Marianne
called and wanted Mae to pick up some prescriptions.  We did it for her.  Mae
spent most of this afternoon and evening working on her presentation.  I took
the light that we have above the picture of Christ apart, trying to find out
why the one light will not come on when we turn the switch on.  Each time we
turn the light off, when we turned the light back on, only one light will
glow.  We have to twist the one light in order for it to light up again.  The
lights work good until you turn it off and then the next time you turn it on,
you again have to tighten the lamp.  Being totally disgusted with it, I completely
disassembled the lamp and checked every connection but found nothing wrong,
however, when I reassembled the light, it now work perfectly.  Oh Well! It
works.  I started to watch a show on TV, when David called asking about Aunt
Deanna, also about places to hold our Family camping trip this year.  After
talking to him, I called and talked to Deanna and they feel some better with
the test results today.  She does have cancer, Adeno carcinoma located in her
liver.  Presently it is about the size of a softball.  The Doctor, they went to
today, feels that if they can shrink the cancer with the use of Chemo therapy
then a Liver Specialist may be able to operate and remove the cancer.  The
concern right now is they cannot locate the source of the cancer.  They will
take more tests tomorrow.  Our love and prayers are sure with them.  David’s
second reason for his call is the Ken Browning Family Reunion.  I called Trail
Creek Lodge and visited with Sid about their facilities.  The result of the
call sounds very positive and it looks like unless David gets some negative feelings,
we will probably go that direction.</p>

that I should hold up on sending my letter to Mr. Nye concerning the snow

condition, but is showing some response to treatment.  I started working on my
Diary this morning.  Mae has been busy most of the day, with part of the time
preparing dinner for the Sister Missionaries this afternoon at 5PM.  She also
took the Ward High-Lights out to some of the Sisters.  Of course, when she
stopped at a couple of the Sister’s home, she went in and visited for a while. 
I did get a nap in but other than that I worked on my Diary.  Shortly after 4PM,
Mae made the comment that we should have invited Donna Beus and Darma Cosper,
widowed neighbors of ours, to join us for dinner with the Sister Missionaries. 
She called and both accepted and were here before 5PM.  Mae had a wonderful
dinner prepared and we enjoyed the Sisters.  They were a delight to have. 
After they left, the four of us enjoyed just visiting and getting better

article from the Ensign “When a Child Leaves the Church” February 2015 page
44.  This is one area that I have more discouragement and depression than any
other experience I have yet encountered in life’s journey so far.  We are
having great empathy at this time for Bryce and Deanna as well as Bishop
Mullins and his wife Ravee Mullins.  We are also very concerned about the choices
that Brad and JaNae are making, with special concerns for their children.  Life
sometimes is hard, but I guess we were never told that it was to be easy.  I
took my tool trailer down to the storage lot.  When I got there, some of my
area had been plowed in.  It took me sometime to break the ice packed snow bank,
made by the snow plow, and clear out the snow so that I could back the trailer
in.  This afternoon Scott and his family stopped by to leave Kaitlyn with us
while the rest of them went to Powder Mountain night skiing.  Scott took Kaitlyn
skiing last week so that he could spend time teaching her how to ski.  Tonight
he will spend one on one with Kaden.  It is just too much to do both at the
same time.  We enjoyed having her with us, and she enjoyed especially having
Grandma to herself.  She stayed with me while Mae attended choir practice, and
we watched a show on Netflix.  When Mae got back home, we played a game of “Old
Pig” and put some puzzles together.  I then watched a western show on TV, while
Mae played more games with her.  Scott came to get Kaitlyn about 10:30pm.  He
looked like he was worn out.  Mae set down and watched the end of the show with
me.  I worked a few minutes on my journals before we went to bed.</p>

last night but Mae didn’t get much sleep.  I am enjoying the New Testament with
the aid of Brother David Ridges.  That has really helped to understand it much
better.  Mae and I worked together on preparing breakfast as well as cleaning
up after.  I worked quite a while on my journals.  I especially spent a lot of
time writing some of the stories that I heard Dad tell.  I did some extra
research by using the Family History programs of the Church.  Mae helped me
with some editing.  I fell asleep while Mae was working on the computer, but
was suddenly awaken by Sister Deann Hodges knocking on the door.  She came to
get some name slips that she had asked Mae and I to help get some of the work
done in the Temple.  After lunch, Mae laid down and rested for a while.  This
evening we relaxed and watched a good Western Show on TV staring Jimmy Stewart
and Audi Murphy , “Follow the River”, before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I went out with the
snow blower and removed snow from several driveways and when I returned home to
clear my own drive way, it was already cleared.  I believe it was Tim next door
that cleaned it.  I went up to the Pharmacy and picked up a prescription for
Marianne Ray and one for me.  When I returned, I picked up Mae and we took the
prescription to Marianne.  When we got there Mae took the prescriptions in and
I cleaned Marianne’s walk and driveway from snow with her snow shovel.  I then
went in and repaired her fish tank pump.  It only needed a gasket to be
straightened out so that it would not leak air into the line.  When we got home,
I got on the computer to check out some information added to Dad’s record on
“Family Search”.  Someone had added that they had seen Dad in a wheelchair
before his death.  I know that this is wrong as I’m sure that Dad was never in
a wheelchair in his life.  I wrote up a rebuttal to that statement, which took
over a type written page to explain why I feel I can make that statement.  That
took a long time.  The snowplow came through the park, and afterwards I went
back out and cleaned out driveways again.  This evening Scott and his family
came over for dinner, to visit and to play games.  Mae made a wonderful
dinner.  After the children finished eating, they began to be quite noisy in
their play.  By the time I finished eating, I was feeling very uncomfortable
with the noise.  I went into the front room but then felt that I would be rude
to stay in there especially if I started reading a book or watching a show.  I
went back into the dining area but again the noise made me uncomfortable.  I
went back, not knowing just what to do.  Scott came in and asked if we could
talk.  We talked for sometime about my concerns with my boys leaving the
activity of the Church.  Before Scott’s family left we saw Kayden’s drawing on
our white board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Although I slept ok,
I woke up with a lot of anxiety about our plans of a family reunion.  I am
concerned with the idea of Sandi inviting her boyfriend to join us.  Also, I am
concerned about Mike’s acceptance on him being there.  I suggested that we
attend Breanna Lindford’s Missionary report in Kaysville and then travel on
down to Provo to visit with Pat Bradfield, who is doing very poorly with her
health.  Following, we could go visit Mike and Becky to find out Mike’s
feelings as to Sandi’s boyfriend coming to the reunion.  Mae called Mike and
asked if we could come down to visit them and Mike invited us to eat with them
at 5pm.  We got to the ward in Kaysville ok.  As the sacrament meeting started,
I immediately recognized that the speaker system did not work for me.  The
amplification hurt my ears and especially my right ear.  I had to cover my
right ear during the complete meeting.  I wished that I had a set of ear
plugs.  I have never experienced that implication problem before.  Also the
room was so noisy, but I guess I am spoiled with the reverence in our “ward”. 
Mae had called Pat, but had to leave a message.  Pat returned the call, but
said that her son’s children were sick and she didn’t think we should come
today.  David called to return my earlier call, but right at that time, we were
driving, just approaching American Fork.  Snow started as we got to the summit
of Point of the Mountain and the roads were slippery.  We had decided to go
through American Fork instead of taking the higher way, because of the snow. 
Not being very familiar with that route, heavy traffic and the falling snow, I
needed Mae’s help, so I had to tell Mae to tell David that I would call him
back.  When we finally got to familiar area, I stopped and called David back. 
He helped me with some medical questions.  Becky had prepared a wonderful meal
by the time we got there.  Following dinner Mike, Becky, Mae and I visited for
quite a while on my concerns with our Family Reunion.  If I am right in Mike’s
feelings, he would prefer that Gary does not come, but if Sandi invites him, we
shouldn’t say that he cannot come.  However, he added; don’t expect me to
welcome him with open arms.  My feelings are still quite unsettled, but I am
leaning toward Mike’s feelings.  I feel that Sandi is, in many ways, following
the same path that my Sister Margaret took and I am concerned as to the
outcome.  We really enjoyed the evening with Mike and Becky.  It was 9:30pm
when we got home.  I caught up my journal for the past two days before we went
to bed.</p>
