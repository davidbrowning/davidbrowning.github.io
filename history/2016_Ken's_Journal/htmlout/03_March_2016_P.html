Nathan and Addie off to school (Addie goes to preschool). We did get along with
the children very well although it was quite a lot of work for us. &nbsp;Jacob
still had some diarrhea, but seemed to be feeling okay.  Nathan had a cold or
virus, but was doing okay also.  Mae brought a lesson on “Obedience” for Family
Home Evening.  We let the twins play in their playroom upstairs while we held
it with Nathan &amp; Addie.  They participated and it went well.  Afterwards we
played games and ate cupcakes which Mae had bought and brought for the
refreshments.  Their bedtime wasn’t until 9Pm for all of the children, so after
we got them all to bed, both Mae and I were tired, so we went to bed also.</span></p>

to get Nathan and Addie off to school and get the twins up, dressed and fed. 
We took the twins for a walk in their double stroller.  They were excited to go
and the weather was nice.  I wondered if either of the twins were asleep, so I
checked and Luke was almost asleep, so we took the twins out of the stroller
and I held each one by my hands and we walked the rest of the way to their home
while Ken pushed the empty stroller.  At home, Mae and I fed them lunch and we
put them down for their naps.  Chelci said they take their nap from noon to
3:00 pm.  They slept even later than that.  Addie came home and Mae fixed us
all lunch and we played games with Addie.  She loved doing that.  They have a
cute dog that is well trained – a black Crocker Spaniel. When Nathan came home,
he and Addie did their chores, and Nathan did his homework.  He complained that
his stomach hurt and he didn’t feel well, so I called the man who was supposed
to pick him up for scouts to tell him that Nathan was sick and wouldn’t be
going to scouts.  He rested on the couch with his iPod, playing games. He still
complained that he wasn’t feeling well and didn’t think he would be able to go
to school the next morning.  Mae found out that he had a spelling test and a
math test the next day, so she helped him study for both tests and told him
that he should try to go to school and if he felt worse, he could call us and
we could come get him.  I got Diarrhea so didn’t sleep much.. </span></p>

Bismo, when she took Nathan to his piano lesson this morning, and that seemed
to settle things down. &nbsp;I was concerned about taking my regular morning
Acid Reflux prescription with the Pepto Bismo so I went without it a couple of
days, I think that was a mistake as this night I got Acid Reflux really bad, so
didn’t sleep really good again.  We took the twins and Addie for a walk again
this morning as they love doing that.  Addie had her dance class today after
lunch and a neighbor picked her up and brought her home.  When they got home,
the neighbor asked if Addie could come over and play with her daughter for a
couple of hours, so we let her.  That way Mae and I were able to take a nap and
rest while the twins took their naps. When the twins woke up, they wanted to go
outside and play.  They have little cars they play in, plus a swing set and the
lifetime airplane we gave them – so they had a good time and Mae stayed with
them.  When Nathan got home from school, he was excited to show us his papers
that he had gotten 103% on his spelling test.  He went over the 100% because of
extra words he could spell.  He also got a 98% on his math test.  Mae was glad
she had helped and encouraged him to go to school and take the tests.</span></p>

today.  At first they were just annoying, but they kept coming and going.  At
night they got worse and again I didn’t sleep well.  We are amazed at how good
the twins (Jacob and Luke) have been for us.  They love to eat, so they climb
up into their chairs and fasten themselves in.  It’s hard to get them full,
especially for breakfast.  We fix scrambled eggs and they want more and more. 
They also eat fruit and cereal in a bowl, but without the milk.  They drink
milk in their Sippy cups.  They are easy to change their diapers as they lie
right down on the floor and hold still.  Chelci has taught them well.  They are
easy to dress and go to bed. They each have their own colored pinkie and they
only get their binkies when they take their naps or go to bed at night.  They
go right to sleep.  They are happy when they wake up in the mornings.  They
fight some over their toys, but most of the toys are duplicates – so they each
have their own.  As Mae is fixing the meals and she hears them fighting, by the
time she climbs the stairs to their playroom, they are happy again as one of
them has given in to the other.  Nathan and Addie have been great too. But we
are tired and glad that we will be leaving in the morning, since neither of us
feel well and we are tired from having to get up early each morning, especially
when we haven’t slept well.  We are happy that Chelci and Steve were able to go
on this cruse for their 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary and they wouldn’t have been
able to if we hadn’t changed our plans to go to Shellie &amp; Roy’s tomorrow
instead of last Friday. </span></p>

morning at 8AM and got the children so that Mae and I could continue on our
planned trip to Arizona. &nbsp;By the time we got packed up, and the house
cleaned up, I was feeling much better. &nbsp;We debated as to whether we should
continue on our trip or return home to be sure that I was ok. &nbsp;By the time
we got to the I-215 junction I felt well, so we continued on. &nbsp;We arrived
at Judy Giles, in Kanab, early evening and soon went out to eat at a Mexican
restaurant and enjoyed visiting with Judy there and at her home. &nbsp;When we
went to bed, my hiccups returned and I was awake most of the night, they got
really bad and they were loud and several coming at a time, which really hurt
my stomach. &nbsp;. &nbsp;</span></p>

.5in;line-height:normal'><span style='color:black'>We got up about 5am and left
Judy’s, debating on whether we should return home or continue south. It was
snowing quite hard this morning. &nbsp;We left Judy’s, then stopped at a
service station where we could use the canopy to protect us from the snow as we
straightened items in the trunk. &nbsp;Still debating which way we should go,
we offered a prayer. &nbsp;After praying, I turned south and started out.
&nbsp;We only went a few miles when the hiccups became very severe and my
stomach went into convulsions. &nbsp;I stopped the car and turned around with
the decision that I needed medical assistance. &nbsp;It was snowing very hard
and with it being dark I tried to drive on. Mae set our GPS up looking for a
Instant Care facility. &nbsp;Following the GPS we drove North on Highway 89.
&nbsp;When we got to the Sand Dunes road, the GPS indicated that we should turn
off the Highway. &nbsp;I was sure that the road only went to a dead end in the
Sand Dunes so I drove on. &nbsp;A mile further the GPS again indicated that we
should turn onto the North entrance to the Sand Dunes but I drove on. &nbsp;By
the time we got to the next town we found a Service station that was open.
&nbsp;By then I was hurting so bad that I had to have Mae take over driving.
&nbsp;Mae went into the station and asked the attendant where we might find a
Instant Care facility. &nbsp;He indicated that the closest Care facility was
back in Kanab. &nbsp;I made the decision that we should go on. &nbsp;It was now
light enough that Mae could drive, although the roads were still snow packed.
&nbsp;By lying very still the hiccups and stomach spasms seem to settle down.
&nbsp;We called David to get some advice from him and he recommended that we
find some place that could do a scope to find the cause. &nbsp;We determined to
continue north and David would try to find more information and get back to us.
&nbsp;We continued driving north trying to get to Provo as there isn’t much
before then. &nbsp;David contacted Mike and then he drove to Mike’s in American
Fork to pick him up and have him go with him. &nbsp;David also had Scott call
us to get our insurance information so he could find a health facility that
would accept our insurance. &nbsp;David and Mike continued driving south to
meet us, where they could take over driving for Mae. &nbsp;With the use of cell
phones we were able to meet at signpost #83 (I think) where David drove our car
and Mike drove David’s car. &nbsp;Mae rode with Mike giving her some relief.
&nbsp;We determined to continue on to Ogden if I continued to feel ok. &nbsp;We
left Mike at Provo where Becky met him. &nbsp;Mae went back to driving our car
and following David. &nbsp;We drove on to Ogden where I went into the Emergency
entrance at the Ogden Regional Hospital. There they ran a complete set of tests
from blood test, to x rays and everything in between, but couldn’t find anything
wrong. &nbsp;By then all my symptoms had subsided. &nbsp;The Doctor finally
told me that as far as they could tell I was perfectly ok and she saw no reason
that we could not continue on our trip. &nbsp;David stayed with me through the
whole experience. &nbsp;I felt bad that I put everyone through so much trauma
just to find out that I was ok. &nbsp;It was great to be able to have a good
visit with David as he drove our car and while we were at the hospital.
&nbsp;Mae and I came on home where we stayed for the night. &nbsp;</span></p>

stake to read this book along with the Book of Mormon.  We will finish reading

chicken and salad before going to Judy’s again. &nbsp;We really appreciated

had a company make the drawers.  Shellie sanded and refinished all the cabinets
in the kitchen and bathrooms.  They look beautiful.  Now they are going to get
marble put on the counters in the kitchen and get new sinks and appliances. We
enjoyed being with her and Jase until Roy got home.  The weather was in the 70s
while we were here so we ate our meals out on their patio overlooking the lake. 
Jase and I went fishing this afternoon and each of us caught a fair size bass. 
I was very glad that Jase had caught the first fish.  I have hopes that he
might gain a love for fishing that will help him enjoy life, but his interest

enjoying a wonderful breakfast, I set up the laptop computer and started to
work on my journals. &nbsp;While I was doing this, Mae &amp; Shellie were
visiting out on the patio and Shellie told Mae that her and Roy don’t have
temple recommends now and are not wearing their garments.  Shellie said that
Roy has never wanted to pay tithing and she has insisted that they do it so they
could have temple recommends and go to the temple.  Roy didn’t like to go to
the temple, but would occasionally go with her.  With the trials and problems
of their sons, Shellie had gone “over the edge” and got so depressed and
despondent and, I guess, angry with God, that she quit going to church for a
while and so did Roy and Jase.  They finally came back to church, but are not
partaking of the sacrament as she told Mae that she didn’t feel worthy to
partake of it since she isn’t keeping her covenants.  She even turned down a
calling in Relief Society.  Her R.S. President told Shellie that she trusted
her and would wait until she felt she could accept a calling again.  This, of
course, was very hard on Mae, but she had suspected as much as Patsy (Roy’s mom)
had called her and told her she didn’t think they were going to church or the
temple now.  Mae was hoping that wasn’t the case – but it is. Shellie told Mae,
as she knew that we would be planning to go to the temple with her this week. 
Mae told me about it on Thursday morning when we woke as she didn’t want to
tell me this day or night as she wanted me to get a good night’s sleep and knew
that I wouldn’t if she told me before.   This is really hard on Mae and I since
out of our six children, there is only one now (Mike and his wife) who have
temple recommends.  Sandi is even having her boyfriend, Gary, living with her
now.  I keep asking myself “What have we done wrong in raising our children?) 
Mae keeps telling me that she feels we did the best we could and that they have
their free agency to make these choices.  We just wish they would read the
scriptures and pray sincerely and they could gain their testimonies back.</span></p>

it off and restarting it. &nbsp;Again it failed to reboot. &nbsp;I called

Sheila Harper’s van had broken down and they couldn’t afford to have it
repaired. &nbsp;I felt great concern about their situation. &nbsp;I decided to
attend the Gilbert Arizona Temple this morning. &nbsp;Before going into the
Temple, I called Bishop Mullin to ask about the Harper’s situation. &nbsp;He
hadn’t heard anything about it but will check into it. &nbsp;I did add their
names to the prayer list. &nbsp;I went through the Initiatory area before going
through an Endowment session. &nbsp;I really enjoyed my morning in the Temple.
&nbsp;Mae &amp; Shellie took out special Easter plants that Shellie had
decorated with ribbon and decorated foam eggs, to her 10 neighbors. &nbsp;Mae
also went visiting teaching with Shellie since Shellie’s companion couldn’t go. 
While Shellie was fixing supper, she suggested that Mae and I relax and let her
do it herself this time, so Mae began reading in the book “The Infinite
Atonement” out loud to me.  Shellie was listening also as Mae read.  Finally, I
and Shellie got discussing “Church Activity” and I think I blew it!  We both
got upset and I said too much.</span></p>

computer, and the problems that we are having with our children, especially
after hearing that Shellie is struggling, and she has always been our “strong”
one, I became quite depressed. &nbsp;I finally decided to take a walk. &nbsp;I
walked quite a while. &nbsp;I stopped at a park to rest and was there quite a
while. &nbsp;When I started out again to go back to Shellie’s, I ended up lost
as to how to find my way out of the area I had walked into. &nbsp;When I
finally got to a main street I walked back to a shopping center where I knew
where I was and set at a table and rested before going on home. &nbsp;When I
got there Mae was very upset with me as she and Shellie had been very worried
as I was gone 4 hours and hadn’t taken my phone or any water. &nbsp;They went
out looking for me in Shellie’s car for about an hour. &nbsp;</span></p>

doesn’t like to play games, other than games on the computer or TV.  He loves
“Mind Craft” and “Blender”.  He is very creative.  He did play “Battle Ship”
once with Mae.  She asked if he wanted to play it again, and he said: “Maybe
another day”.  </span></p>

suggested that she drive us to a beautiful area where she bikes.  We did that
and then walked for probably a couple miles or more, all around beautiful lakes
and landscape.  We really enjoyed this.  We then went to a place which has
frozen yogurts with all the toppings.  We have gone there before when we have
been here.  It is made with all pure ingredients, but they are really
expensive.  I bought them for us and for the three of us, it cost $19.00.  They

this morning and got away for home just before noon. &nbsp;As we left, Mae
became concerned that we hadn’t looked for a computer. &nbsp;One of the reasons
that we left today is that David, our Grandson, told us that he could help us
with our computer problems if we could go to his place on Saturday afternoon.
&nbsp;I told her to get on the GPS and find a Best Buy store near where we were
then and we would stop.. &nbsp;We found one in Tempe and stopped there.
&nbsp;We were there for almost three hours and purchased a new Hewlett Packard
Notebook Laptop. &nbsp;The Salesman told us that they could get the computer
set up for us in just a few minutes. &nbsp;However, when we went to the geek
squad they said that it would take over night. &nbsp;We told them that we were
on our way to Utah and could not wait for that amount of time. &nbsp;They did
get the basic setup done and we left forhome. &nbsp;The GPS got us lost and we
took a longer way through Phoenix. &nbsp;When we got to the GAP the GPS again
gave us faulty directions to go to Page Arizona. &nbsp;I am concerned with the
GPS in giving me false directions. &nbsp;We got to Judy’s about 9:30 this
evening and soon went to bed.</span></p>

Judy’s, just saying thanks and giving her a hug. &nbsp;We just got some fruit
at a service station and ate chicken, that Shellie had left over and sent with
us. &nbsp;When we got to Panguitch, the rain turned into snow which continued
until we got to Payson. &nbsp;Roads were slippery with many accidents and
travel was slow. &nbsp;It was 12:30pm when we got home. &nbsp;We quickly
brought in most of the travel items and just kept what we would need for
staying overnight at David and Sierra’s. &nbsp;Mae took the ingredients that
she would need to make Lasagna for dinner. &nbsp;It was almost 4pm when we got
to David’s. &nbsp;He started right to work on our computer trying to recover
some of the main files from the crashed computer. &nbsp;He also got our new
computer set up so we can start using it. &nbsp;&nbsp;While the computers were
processing, we had dinner and then after cleaning up from dinner, Sierra, David,
Mae and I played games. &nbsp;David would have to check on the computers every
little while to be sure they were still going ok. &nbsp;We sure enjoyed little
Henry and he is growing so fast. &nbsp;They also have a dog named Tasha, the
same name that Shellie’s dog is named. &nbsp;She is a well behaved dog but
still likes to play.</span></p>

Sierra to feed. &nbsp;David was able to finish up startup procedures on our new

will take it to work with him tomorrow and try there where he has more and
better equipment. &nbsp;We were able to get home in time to attend our Block

Sister Leah Neilson being the narrator. &nbsp;Mae also sang with the choir
today. &nbsp;After returning home we had dinner and then we were able to bring
up the Women’s Conference on our “Smart TV” and listen to the speakers that

Funeral for Kent Tule Murdock. &nbsp;I served in the Bishopric, in the
Clearfield 1st Ward in 1970 with Kent Murdock as Bishop.   I served as 1st
Counselor and John Rose as 2nd Counselor. &nbsp;Kent has sure been a great man.
&nbsp;Although the service was very appropriate, it left me depressed as I
recognized that almost all of his very large family is very active in the
Church and holding important leadership positions. &nbsp;It breaks my heart,
when I see only one of our six children holding Temple Recommends in our
family. &nbsp;I don’t know why, but we just keep praying! &nbsp;After the
funeral, we went over to visit Bob. &nbsp;We took him out to eat at Sizzler’s
for lunch. &nbsp;We then went up to the Commissary on Hill Air Force base.
&nbsp;Mae likes to do some of her grocery shopping there as she can get California
Mixed Vegetables and she can’t get this kind anywhere else. &nbsp;This evening
Mae and I watched a very good movie “A Matter of Faith”. &nbsp;I just wish that

happened on the days that I was unable to have a computer. &nbsp;I am unfamiliar
with this new computer and keyboard so it is easy for me to become frustrated.  Our
grandson,&nbsp;David, called and said that he had both good news and bad news
for us concerning our computer. &nbsp;The good news was that he was able to
recover most of our files from the hard drive and will send them to us on a
thumb drive. &nbsp;The bad news is that the computer is dead. &nbsp;The hard
drive failed because of mechanical failure and is not worth the cost to repair
it. &nbsp;We are ok with that as we now have the new computer. &nbsp;That is
really a blessing that David has the knowledge and ability to help us with these
files. &nbsp;This afternoon I started working on our food storage under the
east deck. &nbsp;We have lost the inventory of what we had and so I am
rebuilding that inventory. &nbsp;After 3 hours under that deck, I was beat and
cold so I quit for now. &nbsp;I got on the new computer, and with Mae’s help I

it. &nbsp;Rick and Georgia stopped by to bring us some salmon that we are going
to prepare on Monday when Mae’s siblings and spousses are gathering here at our
place. &nbsp;We enjoyed visiting with them, but I am afraid that we kept them
too long. &nbsp;We took some items to the D.I. and then stopped and visited
Scott and his family for a few minutes. &nbsp;Mishelle had dinner ready for her
family and they invited us to eat but we had just eaten before we left home, so
we just set close to them and visited. &nbsp;We did share one of Mishelle’s
fresh baked rolls. &nbsp;They are too good to pass up. &nbsp;We then went over
to Weber State University in Layton where we thought that we came to hear Jonathan
Johnson, who is running for election for the office of Utah State Governor.
&nbsp;Irven and Sandy had told us of the meeting, however, they were mistaken.
&nbsp;They thought it was a town meeting where Jonathan would speak.  This was
an opportunity for Delegates to meet the Candidates. &nbsp;We did get to meet
Mr. Johnson and visit for just a minute with him. &nbsp;We were impressed with
him. &nbsp;Mae and I came back home. &nbsp;Mae got on the computer as well as
the phone, so I went into the front room and watched a show on Netflix that was
pretty good. &nbsp;Mae also edited my March Journal entries trying to help me
