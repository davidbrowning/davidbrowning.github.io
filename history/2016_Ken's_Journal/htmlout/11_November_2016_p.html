<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Being that we were late going to bed last
night, we slept in this morning.  After breakfast, I helped Mae by cleaning up
the kitchen while she showered and got ready to go to the Temple.  Last night
we took the time to fill out our “Voter Ballot’s” except I goofed and signed
Mae’s envelope, so Mae called and they told us to cross through my signature
and then Mae could sign above it.  We have lots of questions and concerns about
this election and those running for office.  I am not sure how Mae voted on the
Presidential office, but I <b><u>would not</u></b> vote for either Clinton or
Trump!   This afternoon we attended a session at the Ogden Temple.  Bishop
Presnell and Brother Wimmer also attended the session with us.  After getting
home and having some dinner, I got under the house and found where a duct taped
opening in the furnace vent pipes had opened and was letting a lot of air escape
under the house.  Mae got started cleaning up the outside for winter so I
helped her for a while.  It was after 8pm when we quit and came in.  I finished
adding to my daily journal and then we played two games of Rummikub and we both
won one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 2:  I went off all my previous supplements
today and went strictly with the Life Vantage Protandim.  I really haven’t
noticed a different one way or the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, November 2, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went over to Ron Graf’s planning on
helping him install a bathroom fan, light and heating unit in their bathroom. 
When I got there, Ron had gone to the V.A. in Salt Lake.  I came home and
worked on Sandi’s Christmas tree the rest of the day.  Mae came out and helped
me put my tools away and cleanup about 8PM.  I was tired so we watched a show
on T.V. while eating dinner and before going to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 3:  no noticeable difference on way or the
other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, November 3, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae didn’t sleep well last night so I let
her sleep in.  I went over to Ron’s and worked the day on his project.  We got
quite a lot done, but ran into some concerns with the wiring.  By 5PM I was
tired and so we quit for the day.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  She
went to choir practice this evening.  Bryce and Deanna stopped by.  They had gone
to a wedding reception nearby but when they got there no one was there.  They
realized that it should have been tomorrow night.  I watched some shows until
Mae got home and then I took a shower before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 4:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  Mae had me take Probiotics and three Ambertose before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, November 3, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked over at Ron’s today and finished
the insulation of the bathroom combined vent-light-heater fixture in their
bathroom.  I had to remove and install a new switch box as the original box
would have never allowed for the switch with all its wiring, to fit in a
standard switch box.  It was also quite a job to work in the attic to run and
connect the wiring.  I was tired when I came home.  We watched some TV and then
played a couple of games of Rummikub, which I won, before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 5:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  Mae talked to Nancy and she feels that I am taking a big chance of
going backwards if I lay off all my supplements.  She also feels there is
nothing that should counter anything in ether the new product or the
supplements I have been useing, we decided to take the two of them together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, November 5, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke up early and so after breakfast I
started on Sandi’s Christmas tree.  I worked all day getting it finished. 
Before quitting for the day, I took water over to Jackie.  She is having
trouble with her car.  I will go over Monday morning and check it out.  We
tried to find a show to watch but there wasn’t much on.  We did remember to set
the clocks back an hour.  Just to let you know I still do not believe in Day
Light Saving Time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 6:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, November 6, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The morning went well and after the
Tabernacle Broadcast, I took a nap.  Mae has been busy on the computer still
finding work that needs to be done with her pictures.  We took Brother and
Sister Sheer to meetings this afternoon.  Brother Funaki called and told me
that he would not be able to help me take the Sacrament out to the shut-in’s
this afternoon.  Meetings went well and following the Block program, Bishop
Mullins went with me to cover 5 homes to take the Sacrament to.  It sure opens
your eyes to see some of the shut-ins.  Shortly after getting home, Brother
Gifford called and ask if I could help Bishop Mullins administer to him as he
is having heart problems.  I went right down and it was a privilege to assist
Bishop Mullins.  Mae had a nice dinner ready when I got home.  Scott, Michelle
and their family came over as Mishelle wanted Mae to teach her how to make
Peach Cobbler.  We played some games and enjoyed the cobbler after it was
cooked.  I tried a small dish of the cobbler but I am afraid that it contained
too much sugar for me to be eating.  I entered this entry and Mae played Jacks
before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 7:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  Because of today being Fast Day I didn’t take my normal medication or
nutritional pills today and along with the small dish of desert, my stomach
isn’t feeling well tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, November 7, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went over to Jackie’s and tried to get her
car to start.  Justin soon came over and the two of us tried to check out the
problem.  The battery seems to be ok, but there is no power going to anything
else.  Not even to the emergency bypass switch on the transmission so that we
could shift it out of park, so we could push the car backwards.  We finally
visited with Jimmy and used his recharger.  After letting it recharge for a
while we were able to get it to start.  I drove the car out to a shop ear
Willard and Justin followed me out and brought me back.  They will call me when
they get it repaired.  After I got home, Sandi called and said that she would
be over in a few minutes. She had attended a funeral in Roy and so drove her
pickup, making it possible to take her Christmas tree back with her.  I had
answered her call and told her that I had to run to a neighbors home, but would
be right back.  When I got back, Sandi’s truck was parked in front of our
house.  I came in and couldn’t see her, so called to Mae, asking where Sandi
was?  Mae said that she hadn’t got here yet.  I was surprised at that answer
and said that her truck was out front.  Sandi then called out that she was in
the bathroom changing clothes.  She had knocked on the door, but Mae didn’t
hear her, so she thinking that Mae had gone with me, came in and was changing. 
We all got a laugh out of that situation.  Mae had lunch ready so it was
special to have Sandi eat with us.  After lunch, I showed Sandi how to assemble
the tree.  I will be glad to see it when she is finished decorating it.  After
Sandi left, Mae and I worked in the yard the rest of the day, getting leaves and
trash gathered up, trimming some of the shrubs and the lawn mowed.  Mae worked
in the flowerbeds and I fertilized the trees and yard.  We were tired when we
finished and came in.  We ate some supper and watched three western shows on TV. 
We played one hand of Rummy which I won and then we got ready for bed, as we
are both tired tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 8:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  I have had some constipation but this is the results that comes with me
fasting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, November 8, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke at 5:30am and found a note that Mae
hadn’t been able to go to sleep until after 1am.  I read for about an hour and
still did not want to wake Mae so I went into the front room.  After my morning
prayers, I felt cold and so wrapped up in a blanket and fell asleep until
almost 8am.  Mae had got up by then so we ate some breakfast.  After breakfast,
Mae took her shower while I did up the dishes, I then updated my journal.  Mae
left at 10am to go with Diann Graf shopping at the Base Commissary.  I moved
the blinds from the south windows to the east windows, and installed the new
blinds on the south windows.  Mae came home about 2pm and we ate some lunch.  I
had just finished installing the blinds before Mae got home, so after eating we
took a short nap.  We then went to Costco to get some pictures and Christmas
cards that Mae had ordered and while there, we got a few grocery items.  We
then stopped at Café Rio and ate. We thought that was the same place we ate in
Tooele, but we didn’t care for it as well as when we were with Sandi and Gary. 
Mae’s carpet cleaner came today so when we got home, I unpacked and assembled
it, while I watched some western shows on TV.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 9:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, November 9, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting the day started, I went to
work on the toilet in the 2<sup>nd</sup> bathroom and changed the float valve. 
The auto shop that repaired Jackie’s car called and said that the car was
ready.  Mae had taken Jackie to see David as she has some problems with some
growths on her neck, just behind her ears.  I called Jason and him and I went
out and got the car.  I then helped Mae put up tomato sauce, which took most of
the afternoon and evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 10:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, November 10, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I started two projects today along with
helping Mae some with putting up apple sauce.  I changed the flush handle in
the 2<sup>nd</sup> bathroom, which gave me some problems, and I am reinforcing
and modifying the fruit cabinet.  When I went for parts, I took the yard trash
to the Roy City but they only accept trash twice a year and that period is over
so I took it to the Ogden trash yard and that was a mess just trying to get in
due to so much congestion getting to the weigh scales.  I was over an hour
there.  I did get the toilet repaired, with a little modification.  Mae was
busy putting up apple sauce and I did help her some.  She also helped me get
the fruit out of the cabinet so this evening our dining table is still full of
jars.  Mae attended choir practice this evening but came home early so that we
could go to Bountiful and attend the viewing of Grinn &amp; Kathleen Clark’s
daughter-in-law.  On the way back home we stopped and bought Marianne two cans
of pumpkin for her dog.  It’s getting late so we are off to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 11:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  I have had a head ache most of the day, but I don’t think it has
anything to do with the supplements I am taking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, November 11, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I got up at 7am and Mae got up shortly
after.  It was after 9am by the time we finished with breakfast.  I went to
work on rebuilding Mae’s fruit closet.  I worked most of the day on it and quit
just in time, and with Mae’s help, in putting tools up.  We made it just in
time to attend the Ward Veterans Day dinner.  It was a very nice evening,
beginning with two scout troops presenting the posting of the Colors and the
Pledge of Allegiance, and then followed with a wonderful dinner, and a group
that played and sang patriotic music.  Bishop Presnell asked Mae and I and
Bishop Mullins to meet with him in his office.  We discussed one of the
families that are assigned to Mae and I as Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching
Families.  We really couldn’t shed any further information on the case, but to
reassure him that we felt that he was handling it correctly in our opinion. 
After we returned home, Mae and I put all the bottled fruit away in the
remodeled Cabinet.  We still have room to put empty bottles in the cabinet for
storage.  It is now late, we are tired and we are going to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 12:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, November 12, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae got up and left at 8am so she could go
to the air field for R.C. Airplanes.  Kylan goes there to fly his air craft’s
almost every Saturday morning.  She enjoyed being with Kylan and watching him
fly his planes and see how the men there come to Kylan for advice and help. 
Kylan is 16 and they are in their 50’s and 60’s.  Mae then took Ashley to
Wendy’s for a treat and then to the park, for a walk, while they visited
together.  Afterwards, Mae took Ashley home and took the twins (Kaden and
Kaitlyn) with her to the Layton park to feed the ducks, take pictures and play. 
Mae enjoys these grandchildren, as she does all her grandchildren, and loves
spending time with them and making memories.  I put a few more items in storage
and moved more bottled items into the fruit cabinet.  I went with Bruce to look
at mobile homes but there isn’t much on the market right now.  I cleaned up the
fall leafs, getting three bags full with more still falling.  I got the
skirting caulked this afternoon.  I was just finishing when Mae got home.  I
changed and we went back over to Scott and Mishelle’s and tended their children
while they went out with some friends.  We watched a show on Netflix then
played games with the children.  I was sure tired when I got home at 10PM.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 13:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, November 13, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It was a normal Sunday, starting with listening
to the Tabernacle Broadcast.  We commented that we will miss this with the
changing of our meeting schedule next year.  Meetings sent well and we enjoyed
them.  Elder Jones reported on his mission to Sweden and it sounds like he felt
pretty successful at what he was able to accomplish.   Brother Gifford gave the
Priesthood lesson and did a good job with it and Sister Terkelson gave the
Sunday School lesson and gave a very humble but good lesson.  Bruce attended
meetings with us.  We would have liked to have invited him to spend the evening
with us, but we had been invited to dinner and the evening with David’s
family.  We really enjoyed the dinner and evening.  David would like me to
finish his basement for them.  He would like to know just how much it will cost,
and that is hard to say at this point.  I will go up next Saturday and we will
draw up some plans.  After dinner, we played some Rummy using playing cards and
that made it interesting.  We were late getting home and to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 14:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  My hearing still fluctuates quite often.  I am fearful that the new
hearing aids will still not work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, November 14, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke at 7:30 am but Mae was not in bed
with me.  I read the Priesthood lesson for next Sunday and instead of it lifting
me, it left me quite depressed.  The lesson is on teaching and I feel that I
have been quite a failure both as a student and as a teacher.  Brother Flint
invited me to go fishing with them, but they are going tomorrow and that is our
scheduled Temple Day, so I called and canceled out.  I hated to, as Tuesday
looks like it will be the end of fishing for the year.  Roy called and said
that he and Tita are now planning on getting married on February 14, 2017.  I
hope it is what is best for both of them.  I was busy all day with Blocking up
my tool trailer and winterize my boat.  I worked right up to the time that we
went over to the Saunders’s where they, the Graf’s and Mae and I played games. 
We had a good time being together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 16:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, November 15, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae had an appointment with Jennie this
morning.  While she was gone, I winterized the camper, which took most of the
morning.  We attend the Temple this afternoon, doing Initiatory Ordnances.  We
had 5 Brother and 3 Sisters attend and accomplished 55 ordnances.  After
getting home, we had lunch and took a short nap.  I then went right to work on
making a boat cover that will hold the winter weather out of the boat.  Mae and
I went Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching to Sister Neilson and to Brother and
Sister Hunsaker and their daughters Kensie and Kaylee.  When we got home I
caught my journal up to date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 17:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, November 16, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked on getting my boat cover designed
and built.  In between, I checked on Marianne’s kitchen water tap.  The winds
came up quite hard in the afternoon and I moved the car out and laid the tarp
out in the car port where I put the grommets around it.  We had the Sister
Missionaries over for dinner at 5pm and so we invited Bruce to come for dinner
also.  I worked right up to the time for dinner.  After dinner, Bruce help me
and we quickly finished the boat cover and put it on the boat.  I believe it
will do a very good job of protecting my boat.  I was sure tired tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 18:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other, however tonight I am very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, November 17, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I slept until 7:50 am before waking up.  I
really did not feel like any more projects today.  I decided to just relax.   Mae
was hurrying to get a soup put together for the R.S.  luncheon prior to sacking
candy for the Bishop Store House to have for special treats for families with
children.  I asked Mae if she needed help, and so I helped her prepare
vegetables for the soup.  It turned out very good, but was more like a stew
that a soup.  I then went over to the Church house and helped sack candy.  We
had a good time and with everyone’s help we assembled 245 Christmas sacks of
candy.  I did eat a chocolate Kiss and ate Mae’s soup, plus a fried scone.  Mae
and I then went shopping for some chicken and yams.  Bruce called and asked if
I was going to look at the one Mobile home.  I had forgotten that I was going
to meet him at 1pm.  It was 3:15pm when I got back home.  I went with Bruce to
look at a couple of mobile homes.  Bruce is quite interested in one of them. 
When we got back home, Mae had dinner ready. We invited Bruce to stay this
evening for dinner and to attend the Stake Fireside with us.  After dinner, Mae
went to choir practice.  Diann Graf went with Mae.  Bruce took a shower and
went with me to the Stake center for a special Fireside.  Diann and Mae met us
there.  The Stake Relief Society arranged for the Fireside with Elder Lynn
&amp; Ann Summerhays as guest speakers.  The theme was “Our Love for Jesus
Christ” and it was a Very Special and Spiritual evening.  At the closing of the
program, Elder Summerhays ask President Hall, as the presiding High Priest over
our Stake, to give a special blessing to all of us.  What a special thing this
was.  I only wish I could have had a recording of that Blessing.  My one regret
was that we didn’t have a much larger percentage of our Stake in attendant for
such a Blessing.  There were refreshments of Home Made Cinnamon Rolls, which I
did not dare eat, although they looked so tempting.  I am really hurting
tonight.  Bruce rubbed my feet with oils when we got home and much of the pain
had left when he finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health - Day 19:  no noticeable difference one way or the
other.  I definitely feel much better with Bruce’s foot rub.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, November 18, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was busy most of the day in the house
doing Almond Butter, capsulating  some of our minerals and making chicken
burger.  This evening I cut Mae’s hair for her.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Health - Day 20:  I haven’t felt
any improvement by taking the Life Vantage produce so I think that Mae is going
to take the remainder of my pills and she if she recognizes any results from
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Saturday, November 19, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                We got up and Mae
got breakfast for us.  I went up to David’s and figured materials and floor
layout for their basement.  It was 1:30pm when I got home and we soon ate some
lunch and left for Mike and Becky’s.  Becky soon had a nice dinner ready for us
before we went to the School play of the Little Mermaid.  Jessie participated
in the play.  It was enjoyable but I was unable to understand probably 90% of
the words.  It was 10:30pm before we got home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Sunday, November 20, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                We were late
getting up but I really didn’t worry about that with is being Sunday morning. 
We tried to turn on the Tabernacle Choir Broadcast but for some reason our
internet was out.  When I tried to find the problem I only made it worse. 
Bruce has decided not to buy the trailer in the court, but is going to rent an
apartment in Orem so that he is closer to his children.  I certainly don’t
disagree with that decision.   He had wanted to be here in this nice mobile
home park with us, but he wanted a confirmation that this is where the Lord
wants him to be, so he went to the temple and prayed in the Celestial Room.  He
felt he was to live in Orem with his children.  Bruce attended meetings with us
today.  After returning home from meetings, Mae cooked chicken, etc. for
dinner.  When we finished with dinner, Mae and I went to the Viewing for Ken
Shaw.  He died of cancer November 16 after fighting it for several years.  He
kept going almost to the end.  While we were in Wasco California on our Service
mission, Ken and Vivian came and served with us for nine months.  I don’t
remember him ever missing a day of work but there were times that I could tell
that he didn’t feel the best.  When we came home, Bruce had found the problem
with the setting on the TV and had it running.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Monday, November 21, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                I got up at 7am
but things went slow for me this morning.  Bruce has rented an apartment in
Orem and left today.  I took my boat down to the storage yard and took my tool
trailer off the blocks.  I went down to Boemans Steel to check on a steel
I-Beam.  I will need to have an engineer give me the specks in the I-Beam
before they can order it.  I am trying to get a hold of Chad to see if he can
do that.  I took my tool trailer up to David’s, then came back to The Home
Depot and purchased the framing material for David’s.  It took me two trips to
haul it up there.  Tyler, Emily and Connor also help me carry the material into
the basement.  It was 7PM when I got home.  We ate supper and then I called
Chad and visited with him about the beam for David’s house.  We tried to get to
bed early tonight because we have to go to the V.A. in the morning.  My
appointment is at 9 am in SLC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Tuesday, November 22, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                We got up early,
got ready, ate breakfast and left for the Salt Lake V.A. hospital.  We got
there about 8:30am and so set in the car and read for a few minutes.  When we
went in, to check in, we were an hour early.  We, therefore, went to the lab
and I was able to fill in a question sheet and have them draw blood for some
testing they are doing.  We were back at our Audiologist appointment on time. 
When they started testing the new hearing aids they found that the left hearing
aid was not working.  They will have to send them back to the factory for
repairs.  We had to set another appointment for Dec. 15<sup>th</sup>.  We did
get some other errands done on the way home.  We had a man coming to check out
our water softener this afternoon, but he got in a traffic jam on the freeway
which blocked traffic on the north bound lane at 3300.  He asked if he could
come tomorrow about noon.  We then drove up to Morgan to find out about a
building permit for David and Shauna’s home.  It could take them a couple of
weeks to get the permit approved.  On the way home, we stopped and talked to
Shauna about the permit.  We then went out to Larson Digital where we got an
external hard drive with all the pictures on it.  We then went to a U.P.S.
store and got our Christmas letter printed.  Scott brought my compressor back
this evening.  This evening we tried to watch TV but again couldn’t get it to
work.  We called Grant.  He couldn’t figure out the problem, but as we talked
Mae thought that it might be the batteries in the remote and that’s what it
was.  We watched TV as we put address labels, stamps, Christmas cards and
letters in envelopes to send out to friends and family.  We watched “Winchester
76” staring Jimmy Stewart.  It’s late and past bed time.</p>

Thanksgiving Day</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                I woke up not
feeling very well and quite depressed.  After breakfast I drove up to David’s
and got some tools out of my trailer.  We borrowed Bishop Presnell’s key to the
Stake Center.  We have been preparing for having our family together for a
Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow and are estimating that we will have 35 that will
be here for dinner tomorrow.  I laid down and slept for over an hour after
returning from David’s.  Mae and I went over to check the kitchen supplies at
the Stake Center, this evening.  Before going to bed, Mae and I played three
games of Rummikub, in which I won two games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                Today was a busy
day from the time we woke until 7pm this evening.  Then we quit and watched a
TV show before going to bed.  Ever thing went well with our Thanksgiving
dinner.  We held it at the Stake Center.  Sandi and Gary came first bringing us
a 4’ Christmas wreath and Gary helped me hang it on the front of our house. 
They then helped us take all the food over to the Stake Center.  We went right
to work with the finishing touches for dinner.  Jeff helped me carve the turkey
while others set up the tables and chairs.  Mike mashed the potatoes, and
thought my beater really worked well.  Place settings were set for each
individual with place cards being made up by Gail.  It was a great thrill when
Chelci arrived with JaNae’s children.  We felt that was almost a miracle in
itself. What a joy it was to have them with us.  We felt bad the Steve and
Jacob couldn’t come as they were not feeling well this morning.  With that
exception, along with JaNae and Brad not coming, as well as Shellie’s Family,
we had all our Family there.  Everyone seemed to just have a great time.  As
evening approached all pitched in and helped with the cleanup.  What a great
Thanksgiving day!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                Both Mae and I
slept well last night.  After breakfast we started in decorating the house for
Christmas.  It was after 6PM when we finished with the outside decorations. 
Mae also got a good start on the inside decorations, in between helping me
outside.  We were tired so we watched two TV Westerns and went to bed late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Sunday, November 27, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                We slept in until
8am before getting up.  We showered and then watched the Tabernacle Broadcast
before eating.  We then took a short nap before getting ready for meetings. 
Meeting went well and we enjoyed the block time.  As we were getting ready to
leave, Bishop Presnell asked us to wait for a minute. He then finished his
conversation with someone else and made the comment to them, “his parents had
four boys, the youngest and the oldest brothers became inactive and to this
date still are, where he and his other Brothers both stayed active, have served
missions and were married in the Temple.  He still wonders how this is, as they
were raised in the same family with the same parents.”  Bishop Presnell then
visited with Mae and I concerning the Temple Session Tuesday.  After we got
home we had nice dinner of left over Thanksgiving Dinner.  David called me and
sent me the specifications that Chad calculated out for a beam to support the
removal of the one bearing wall.  I still had a couple of questions and so I
called and discussed them with Chad.  After talking to him, I am ready to
proceed.  I helped Mae get more of the Christmas cards ready to mail.  We
played a game of 99, using face cards so that we might play with the Siglin’s
if they should accept the offer to get together.  We used 5 pennies to play the
game. Mae won the game.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                I got up at 7am. 
I read from the book “The Infinite Atonement” and really enjoyed that.  I wish
that I could remember and recall that which I read.  It snowed quite heavy
during the night.  I shoveled our driveways, plus Jackie’s driveway.  I made me
a list of several items I wanted to accomplish today and by evening I had
finished all, plus I did more decorating outside and then put up our Christmas
tree inside.  Part if the things I accomplished was to remove the water spray
hose from Marianne’s kitchen sink and get a new one from Durk’s and replaced
that.  It’s now after 10pm and I am tired.  Mae has been busy with washing and
canning yams.  We did have the company that built our water softener come, and
make a small repair on it, and now it should work ok.  I had also gone to Home
Depot and checked on post anchors.  The one that looked good to me did not have
a down load weight capacity on the box, so I asked one of the clerks there. 
She didn’t know, but called Simpson Tie.  She wrote the down load on a card and
gave it to me.  It was only rated for 1,200 lb.  That isn’t very much so I
again contacted Chad.  He did more checking and found that the rating should
have been 12,000 lb. download.  That is quite a different story!  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Tuesday, November 29, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                I spent most of
the morning figuring on David’s home.  At 10am I went to Leah Neilson’s and
figured the materials to add a porch light to her trailer.  I picked up
materials for David’s job, plus got the measurements for his bath tub and
required dimensions needed for a stackable washer and dryer.  I picked up the
support post for the I-Beam that will replace a bearing wall.  Conner got home
in time to help me carry those posts into the basement.  I have been having
problems with the lock on the tail gate of my truck and when we went to unload
the post, the lock would not release.  I had to remove the lock to get the gate
open.  I found that the lock was rusted until the lock was frozen.  I am trying
to get it to loosen up with WD-40.  I was tired when I got home.  Mae has been
busy canning more yams as well as many other things.  This evening we attended
an endowment session at the Ogden Temple.  We had 15 of our Ward members at the
session.  We were very pleased with that support.  After the session we
returned to Bishop and Sister Presnell’s where we enjoyed visiting and enjoying
refreshments of pie and ice cream, furnished by the High Priests Group
Leadership.  The Presnells had popcorn and a frozen sugarless desert for Mae
&amp; I and themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Wednesday, November 30, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                I went to Bowman
Kemp at 7am and ordered the beam for David’s home and to United Rental and
checked on equipment that I will need to rent to install the beam and to drill
holes in the foundation wall for the fireplace and the dryer vent.  I also
picked up some of the bolts and ties from Bolt &amp; Nut and from CFC, getting
better prices and quality than I get at Home Depot.  Mae put up another 14
quarts of Yam’s today.  When I got home I was really tired so we just relaxed
and watched TV this evening.</p>
