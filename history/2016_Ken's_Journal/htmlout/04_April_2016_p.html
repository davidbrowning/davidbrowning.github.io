<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke a little before 7am and as normal read for a while in the scriptures.  Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night so I tried to let her sleep in.  When I went
into the front room Kylan was up. We started talking and soon Ashley came in. 
The three of us visited until Mae got up.  I prepared breakfast of egg omelet
in a large frying pan.  It took a little longer to cook but it turned out ok
anyway.  After breakfast we played games with Kylan and Ashley.  Kylan then
walked down to where he could watch the airplanes land and take off.  He has an
app that allows him to see the approaching and take off schedules off mainly
commercial airplanes.  Ashley and Mae went for a walk and enjoyed visiting
together.  I worked on the new computer trying to learn how to find and store
documents.  When they returned Mae prepared lunch and we started another game. 
We just got started when Scott, Mishelle and the twins came.  We visited with
them and the game got put away.  We have enjoyed having Kylan and Ashley with
us for a while.  After they left we went over to Costco looking for a seasoning
that Shellie recommended to use when cooking salmon, which I will be doing on
Monday.  They do not stock any of that brand in any of the Costco stores in
Utah.  We, therefore, went to Wal-Mart where we found another brand and hope
that it will be ok.  After getting home we watched a show on Netflix that Kylan
and Ashley recommended.  It was ok, but I had a hard time hearing and following
the dialog.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
Mae and I slept well last night.  We prepared our breakfast in time to eat in
the living room as we enjoyed the 1<sup>st</sup> session of General
Conference.  After the session ended, I went to Home Depot to check on materials
for a project I am helping Mike do in their back yard.  I returned home just
before the 2<sup>nd</sup> Session of General Conference started.  We again ate
lunch while enjoying conference.  Following that session I brought my tool
trailer up from the storage lot and got tools ready to go to Mikes.  We then
watched the Priesthood Session of General Conference.  It was as wonderful as
the other sessions and we were thrilled when President Monson addressed the
conference.  I believe he is about 20 years older than I and so he is getting
quite old.  It is sad as they grow old, but we have sure enjoyed having that
great man as our chosen leader and Prophet.  I called Bishop Mullins concerning
Marianne’s problem with her washer.  He is quite concerned as to how to help
her.  I will call Richard Flint and see if the two of us can work on the washer
together.  Richard was not home but I left a message for him.  I helped Mae set
up the dining table so that we will have that ready for Monday.  Mae is also
editing my March journal for me.  She is sure a wonderful wife and sweetheart. 
Somehow I have duplicated my journal files and Mae and I have spent almost an
hour getting that straightened out.  This new computer is a learning
experience!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept well last night getting up about 8:30.  I started the 2<sup>nd</sup>
book of “The Book of Mormon Made Easier” by David J. Ridges.  Meanwhile Mae got
up and started work on my March 2016 journal entries.  With the crash of our
lap top we lost a lot of data but with David M. our grandson, much of it was
recovered.  While Mae took time to do her hair, I got February and March
printed off and put in my Journal binders.  We really enjoyed the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Conference
session this morning, and was especially thrilled when President Monson spoke. 
I do sustain him with all my heart as Prophet, Sear and President of The Church
of Jesus Christ and accept that he is the only one holding all the KEYS of the
Priesthood today.  I laid down for a while after the morning Session.  After I
got up Mae had lunch ready, so we ate and then watched the afternoon and
closing session of April 2016 General Conference.  Again it was a very
enjoyable conference with Elder Holland closing with great encouragement for us
to continue on.  Mae then laid down and tried to take a nap but phone calls
soon got her up.  I worked on my journals and I believe that I have 2016 up to
date and backed up to a hard print out and on the cloud.  We watched a show on
Netflix that was fair but nothing special.  Bob called and wanted us to come
over and watch “Big Country” with him but we declined.  I went through the
movie listing and found very little worth watching.  We went to bed shortly
after 9PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t sleep the best last night but Mae got a phone call after we went to bed
so she didn’t get to sleep until after mid-night.  She got up about 7am and I
got up about 7:30am.  After breakfast we got busy around the house and then set
our goals and effort toward getting ready for Mae’s siblings and their spouses
to arrive between noon and dinner at 1pm.  Working together we were ready.  Kim
and Jeanenne were unable to come due to sickness.  We were especially grateful
when Deanna came with Bryce.  The salmon turned out very good and I sure
appreciated Shellie’ instructions as to how to prepare and cook it.  We enjoyed
a very nice dinner and especially enjoyed the visit that we had with each other
after dinner. When everyone left for their homes, Mae and I finishing the
cleanup, then Mae got us some left over’s for our super.  We watched a
detective show on Netflix titled “Laura” which was quite interesting.  We then
did up our dishes and entered this entry before going to bed, quite tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
missed setting the alarm and so we didn’t get up until after 7am.  We quickly
got our things put together, fixed an egg sandwich and put things into the
pickup and left for American fork.  It was just after 10am that we got to Mike
and Becky’s.  Mike and I went to Home Depot and bought material to build new
gates to their back yard.  We worked until almost 6pm before quitting for the
day.  I was quite tired when we quit.  After dinner I started this entry and
then Mike had me try out his massage chair, which really did work good and
helped me.  Mike, Becky, Mae and I played a game of rook at which Mae and Becky
won.  We went to bed about 10:30pm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
had breakfast before Mike and I got started on his gates.  We got the main gate
on the west side built and finished before lunch.  After lunch I took a 15
minute nap but I didn’t go right to sleep like I normally do as I was thinking
of a way that I might get some money on consignment for my tool trailer and
tools without losing access to them for a few years.  I did sleep for a while
and then Mike and I built the gate for the east side.  We got that finished and
then built a stand for Becky’s grape vines.  We just have a little more to do
before that is finished.  We quit and picked up all the tools before going in
for dinner.  I again used Mikes massage chair and it really helped me again. 
We played four games of Rummykub with Jessie and then Mae and Becky challenged
Mike and I to another game of Rook but tonight Mike and I beat them.  We had
some Yogurt, strawberries and Granola before we got ready for bed.  I also
entered my journal before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke about 6am, Mike and I got started about 7:30 adding wire guides to the
grape trellis we built yesterday.  We were just finishing when Mae called us
for breakfast.  We quickly finished up and came in to eat.  Mae had cooked
trout and fried eggs, they were very good.  After breakfast I went up and used
Mike’s massage chair.  That sure felt good.  We packed and got headed for home
just before 9am.  We stopped at Costco and purchased gas before heading home. 
I took the wrong road and it took us a couple of extra miles to find the
Freeway entrance.  As we approached the North side of Salt Lake we had a tire
tread break off.  I was able to pull off the freeway onto a safe area.  With
the tools I have in the trailer we jacked up the trailer and removed the tire. 
When the tread tore off, it ripped the fender well off and bent it up quite
badly, so I had to remove it.  When I went to mount the spare tire I found it
was low of air.  I had to disconnect the trailer from the pickup, have Mae stay
with the trailer and I took the tire to get it filled.  The next exit took me
into Beck Street where I found a Diesel Truck shop so I stopped and they filled
the tire for me.  I continued on Beck Street to 3<sup>rd</sup> West and 400
North, turning west and right back onto the freeway entrance.  I mounted the
tire and we were soon on our way again.  Mike had an appointment with his
brother, David, that morning, so passed by, but as he did, he saw us over to
the side of the road so he called to see if we needed his help and if so he
would get off the next exit and come help us.  I told him we were okay, so he
went on.  He called us later and told us he wanted to pay for the cost of the
tire.  We stopped in Clearfield where we bought some groceries at Tom’s Market.
We also bought us some chicken for lunch and some Yogurt. We come on home where
I unloaded our clothing we had taken with us.  Both Mae and I were tired so we
lay down and took a nap.  I woke with a cramp in my leg and that brought me up
in a hurry.  Marianne Ray wants me to have someone assist me in giving her a
blessing for her health.  I got Brother David Presnell to assist me.  Mae also
went with me and after giving Marianne a blessing Mae and I stayed and gave her
a Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching message.  After coming home I finished
this entry before we played a game of Rummy and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                As
I was studding this morning, I read “A Voice of Gladness” given by Marvin J.
Ashton in the April 1989 General Conference.  It really lifted me and gives me
encouragement to just continue trying, but to give Thanks to God for my many
blessings.  I saved this article in my <u>Church</u> folder and also printed
off a copy that I will take to Marianne Ray.  Mae gave me a haircut before I
took my shower.  I made some calls to find prices on a tire for my trailer and
to price a new fender.  Costco had the best price on the tire and the fender
would cost $150.00 to order one in.  I think I will try to straighten the old
one out.  I worked on it until noon when we had lunch.  I took a nap and then
went to Costco and bought the tire.  I went to Bowen Lumber where I bought a
1¾”  X 3’ W X 6’8” H solid core door, plus a 2” X 10’ X 16’ board for $50.00. 
While there I got a call from Costco telling me that they had my tire ready.  When
I returned home Mae was working in the yard digging weeds out of the grass and
her flower garden.  We watched a show that was ok, while we ate our dinner.  We
had started another show but it was all in Spanish and so we switched to the
other show.  After the show ended Mae and I finished playing the game of Rummy
that we started last night.  I won.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
read the Priesthood lesson for tomorrow and really enjoyed it.  I made
breakfast for us this morning.  .I prepared an egg omelet and it turned put
very good.  After breakfast I worked on my trailer but I think that I am going
to order a new fender, I have straightened some of the fender but there is one
part that is pretty bad and I am afraid that it won’t straighten.  I started
repairing the holes that got torn on the trailer.  I needed some parts so went
up to Auto Zone but they didn’t have what I wanted and so I went to Home
Depot.  That took the rest of my morning.  I took Mae over to Dianne Graf’s
where she, Dianne and Camille Smith went to Salt Lake to a cooking class.  I
went over and visited with Bob.  Anyway we watched two videos.  We don’t visit
very much because of Bob’s hearing but he enjoys having someone there.  It was
after 5pm when I left.  Mae text me that they were still eating and would still
be a while.  I came on to Roy where I filled the car with gas and stopped at
Del Taco and bought a Steak Bean Burrito for my dinner.  Just as I drove into
our driveway, Mae called and said that they were at Dianne’s.  I went over and
got her.  We stopped at Kohl’s where Mae bought a blouse.  I entered today’s
journal entry while Mae started preparations for tomorrow’s dinner.  Sandi and
Gary will be coming out to have dinner with us tomorrow.</p>

woke up at 6:30 this morning.  I reread the Priesthood lesson and again was
thrilled at the great message concerning the fact that The Church of Jesus
Christ is Christ’s church.  It does not belong to any mortal man or men but it was
organized and led by those chosen, called by and controlled by the Lord.  I
then worked on my Diary adding some information that I feel should be added to
clarify some of the details that were taking place with my job while at
Commercial Security Bank.  I took a nap before we went to church.  I really
enjoyed the Testimony meeting as well as Priesthood and Sunday school classes. 
Bishop Mullins talked to Mae and I, asking us to meet with him in his office
after the regular Block meetings.  I came home for a few minutes between
Priesthood and Sunday school to turn the oven on.  While I was at home I texted
Sandi to let her know that we had an interview right after meetings, so we
would be just a little late getting home.  However, after meetings when we went
to the Bishops office he was not there.  We couldn’t find him so we came on
home.  Sandi and Gary were there but hadn’t been here very long.  Mae had a
nice dinner almost ready.  After eating we visited and played some games. 
Garry hadn’t played either Marbles or Rummy and so we taught him both games. 
After Sandi and Gary left for home, I Mae and I looked at our yard to see what
plans we need to figure on there.  We also walked down to Gifford’s home to see
what is ready to do there.  After getting back home I worked on my journal
while Mae called and visited with Jeff, mainly about the reunion plans.  We
went to bed about 10PM.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night and so I got some breakfast and took the
pickup over to Dee’s Service where I got it inspected and renewed the
registration.  I went over to Western Trailer Service and checked on parts and
costs for a new fender for my tool trailer.  I then went on home and found that
Mae had slept until 9:30 before getting up.  I checked with two other shops
about rebuilding the old fender and both advised that I get a new one.  While
out I got one of our propane tanks refilled.  I went back to Western Trailer
Service and had them start on the new fender.  They will call me when it is
ready.  Depression set onto me, but I went down to Gifford’s where I weeded the
raspberries and put the trellises in the grow boxes for the tomatoes.  Bishop
and Sister Mullins stopped and visited with me about the four of us going to
some of the new Temples here in Utah that we haven’t been to.  Also they would
like to take a couple of days and go camping.  This evening Mae and I looked
over our calendar and picked some possible dates for those activities and gave
them to Bishop Mullins to see how those dates will work for them.  We read an inspiring
article in the April 2016 Ensign, by Elder Kim B. Clark “The Redeeming and
Strengthening Power of the Savior’s Atonement”.  We then watched the movie on
Netflix “The Enemy Down Under” starting Robert Mitchum.  We really enjoyed that
movie and are going to recommend it to our children.  I filled out my journal
entry and we soon went to bed.</p>

problem stems from my depression and concerns for our financial ability’s.  She
also has so many concerns about our children and others in our Ward, plus
friends and acquaintances.   Somehow she just needs to relax, ????  I worked on
my trailer most of the day.  I have the side panel damages looking fairly good,
but I am still having some concerns with the electrical problems.  This evening
Mae and I were going to go Home Teaching, but Sister Leah Nielsen isn’t feeling
well and the Hilton’s are not home.  Mae wanted to get on the computer so I

got up at 7:30am but Mae hadn’t slept well again last night.  I tried to be
quiet so that she could sleep.  Bryce and I went to Salt Lake to the Veterans
Administration to check on my eligibility to receive medical benefits.  To my
surprise I was accepted on the program.  As we drove back, Bryce brought up
that Irven just keeps insisting that Deanna is wrong in following the Doctors
treatment for the cancer that has attached her.  Deanna told him that they have
sought the Lord’s guidance through prayer, so for now she feel this is the way
she should go.  Bryce is upset that Irven and Sandy are still trying to
convince them that they are wrong.  When we got to Clearfield, we stopped at
the commissary on Hill Air Force base.  I bought some mixed vegetables and some
yogurt.  Bryce also bought a package of mixed vegetables but as we paid for
them I used my Debit card.  When we got to the car, Bryce asked how much he
owed me for the vegetables.  I told him that they were paid for, but he
insisted that he pay for his.  He put $3.00 in my coat pocket.  I didn’t feel
he should pay anything as he had driven from Willard and taken his time to help
me, but that is Bryce for you!  After getting home, Mae made me some lunch and
I took a short nap.  It has been raining most of the day so I haven’t been able
to do anything outside.  Mae did some visiting this afternoon and this evening
we went visiting Sister Lemon and Brother and Sister Hilton.  Sister Lemon is
having heart problems and the Hilton’s are both in very bad shape.  After
getting home, I finished a game of Hearts on the computer and then filled out

to the cafeteria and ate lunch.  It has rained most of the day.  After
returning home from the Temple, I went down and got Randy as he wanted to try
out our T-Zone machine.  It didn’t work for him so he doesn’t think he is
interested in purchasing it.  After taking Randy back home I picked up Ron Graf
at his home.  We went over to Sportsman Warehouse and bought some fishing
tackle.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  This evening we watched a show
on DVD “The Christmas Hope” on our TV in the bedroom.  Although we have seen it
once before, it was still a heartwarming story.  Mae is sure a special wife and

weather is cold and raining and so I find it hard to get very interested in

trailer down to them so that they can match up the new fender for the left side
with the one the right side.  When I left Irven had called Mae and when I got
back home she had just got off the phone with him.  I don’t know what to do
about him as he is sure hurting feelings in his relentlessness in trying to
convince everyone to his opinion.  Mae went over to Scott’s to tend their children
while they attended a funeral of a friend of theirs.  Mae had made me some
lunch so after eating I took a nap.  I then brought in drinking water from our
distiller.  After that I vacuumed the floors for Mae.   I next played 2 games
of Hearts of which I won both games.  I next worked on my Five Year Diary
getting several more entries edited.  It was almost 6PM when Mae got back from
Scott’s and grocery shopping at Winco.  We prepared dinner and ate it in the
front room while we watched a show on the BYU channel.  Scott sent us some
Fertilizer that he had left over.  It seems to really be working good for them
so we will try it.  Our lawn sure needs something to help it out.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 6:30 this morning, but Mae hadn’t slept very well and so she slept
until about 7:30am.  After breakfast I spread the fertilizer on the grass.  Mae
and I then planted some pansies.  I then went down to Gifford’s and planted
some potatoes.  Mae has kept busy cleaning house and getting food ready for
dinner tomorrow.  Bishop and Sister Mullin’s came by and visited for about an
hour or more about plans, that the four of us will go to some of the New
Temples in the Utah area, also about going camping together.  Mae and I did
take a nap after lunch.  This afternoon I dug some strawberry starts from
Gifford’s and planted them in a special pot.  We will see how they do.  After
dinner this evening we had Judy and Claus Decker come over and we played
games.  I helped Mae get the table set up for dinner tomorrow.  Emily will be
playing a violin solo in our Ward’s Sacrament meeting tomorrow and then David
and his family will come to our place for dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke well refreshed at 6:30am and started my normal day.  This morning I read
from the Priesthood and Relief Society Manual, lesson chapter 8 “Taking the
Gospel to All the World”.  I reflected of our being able to go on a mission to
the Philippines.  What a wonderful experience it was for us.  Mae also slept
well last night.  To find out that little bit of information in the morning is
sure comforting to me.  When I find out that she hasn’t slept well, I feel so
helpless and concern that I might be the cause.  That girl is the love and
light of my life with only one exception and that is The Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.  We enjoyed a simple breakfast and after eating, I helped Mae with some
of the preparations for dinner today.  I turned on the TV and listened to the
“Mormon Tabernacle Choir broadcast” and enjoyed the Spirit it brings with it.  I
worked on my journal and Diary entrances while I have a few minutes before
getting ready to attend Sacrament meeting.  (Note:  As I entered my Diary entrance
of October 22, 1974, I indicated that we bought a new freezer.  We are still
using that freezer today.)  During our Sacrament meeting I had the privilege of
helping administer the Sacrament.  Also, Emily played a violin solo,
accompanied by Sister Janice Barnes.  They played Amazing Grace and did a
marvelous job.  I was so proud of her that I had trouble keeping control of my
tears.  Following Sacrament meeting we came home, with all of David’s family, for
dinner.  Mae had prepared a wonderful roast dinner with all the trimmings, plus
appetizers before the meal.  We all enjoyed the dinner.  After dinner we just
visited.  David and Conner played a game of Chess using David’s timer and David
won.  David and I played a game using my timer and I was able to stale mate
that game.  Conner and I played and I won him.  Tyler then played me a game and
he won due to me running out of time.  The timer really changes the game.  We
visited for a while before they left for home.  It has been a wonderful day. 
We had some Peach Cobbler left over so Mae and I took some over to the
Jackson’s as they just came back yesterday, from being in St. George.  We then
took a dish over to Mary, our neighbor on the North East of us.  After coming
home I entered the rest of this entry, while Mae mainly talked to Marianne. 
It’s about time for bed now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep much last night so I tried to let her sleep in for a while this
morning.  After Mae got up about 9am we had breakfast.  She had already done
some of her regular Monday morning washing during the night.  I cooked
breakfast for us when she got up.  I then started some of the items that I had
on my list for today.  When I tried to find the nozzle for the hose, I couldn’t
locate it. Our hose also had a break in it, so I went down to Home Depot and
bought a new nozzle and I repaired the clamp for the hose.  Mae called and said
that Bishop and Ravae were about ready to go for a ride that we had planned
with them.  I quickly came home and we ate a sandwich before going with them. 
We drove up to the South Fork of the Ogden River to the Cauze campground.  It
is not opened, but we walked down into it anyway.  We saw several deer, also a
wild turkey.  We also picked some watercress to bring home.  It was a very
enjoyable afternoon.  This evening we watched a show on Netflix, “Charade” with
Carry Grant and Audrey Hepburn.  Although we have seen it before, it is still a
cute show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept pretty well last night, but we were still late getting up.  After
breakfast I did some work on my journals while Mae was busy with other house
work.  I have just done some little odd jobs, hoping that Wasatch trailer would
call me, telling me that my trailer fender is ready for me to pick up.  Scott,
Mishelle and Kylan came over about 4:30pm and Kylan brought me a chess board he
made for me in his Shop Class.  It has 2” squares for my chess pieces that we
bought while we were in the Philippines’s.  It is really nice and fits the
pieces perfectly.  This evening Mae was on the phone so I turned on the TV and
watched two short Western movies, then when I couldn’t find anything else worth
watching I chose a movie on Netflix “Hiaha; a Dog Tale”.  Mae came in and
watched a few minutes but when it became late we turned it off and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 6:30 and Mae got up about 7am.  We both slept fairly well last
night.  It may seem like a little detail to add in, but it is becoming rarer
the older we get.  Mae prepared oatmeal cereal for our breakfast.  Something
depressed me this morning and has hung on most of the day.  I called Wasatch
Trailer and they told me that my trailer wheel well would be ready about 11am. 
I had several errands to run so I loaded the ladders in the back of the
pickup.  I then started checking for a RV/Marine batter for our camper and
found that there are only 2 or 3 companies that build batteries so I should
check on the warranty and the price and buy the cheapest one.  About the time I
was ready to leave, I noticed that the secondary water was on and I had to shut
off all my sprinklers.  I took all the metal (tongue &amp; yokes from under the
trailer and other pieces of metal to get rid of) over to the salvage yard, took
the ladders over to Scott’s and bought some items at J &amp; J Garden shop
before I went to get my fender.  They still didn’t have it ready for me.  That
upset me and as I drove home I became more and more upset.  I ate some lunch
and then took a nap.  Our water has been off due to a broken water line, but as
of tonight they don’t know where the break is.  We had the Sister Missionaries
here for dinner.  We did do some work in the yard before quitting for the day. 
We finished watching our show that we started last night.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:

appreciate our ancestors, especially the convenience of instant running water
with just the turn of a valve.  After breakfast both Mae and I took a bucket
bath before leaving for the Timpanogas Temple with Bishop and Sister Mullins.  We
arrived at the Temple just in time to be on the 11am session.  It was a very
nice session and we sure enjoyed the beautiful Temple.  After the session we
stopped outside long enough to get a picture before returning home.  We stopped
at the Golden Corral where we ate and visited.  Bishop Mullins is sure busy
with phone calls from members of our Ward.  He had four calls that came in
while we were in the Temple and two or three calls more before we got home. 
When we got home our water was on, so we are very happy about that.  We took a
nap and then I called Wasatch Trailers and they do have my fender ready to
pick-up.  We will do that on our way to S.L. to attend a special open house for
Tayler Paige’s graduation from Utah State, in interior design.  We enjoyed
being there to support her in her academic achievements.  It was almost 9pm
when we got home and we were both tired and ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up about 7:30 this morning and Mae got up at 8:30am.  I made an egg omelet
for breakfast while Mae did her exercises.  After breakfast I wanted to apply
some weed control, but due to the windy condition, that was not possible.  I
cleaned out both of my sprayer tanks.  I wanted to work on the trailer but I
needed my voltage meter, which yesterday I had blown the fuse.  I went up to Auto
Zone to buy a fuse but none of their fuses would fit.  Their suggestion was
either an electrical outlet company or maybe Radio Shack.  I called Mae and had
her look on the internet for a Radio Shack.  She found one in the Five Point’s
area in Ogden, but the one in Clinton has closed up.   I went into Ogden to
Whitehead Electric, but after a lot of searching, they didn’t have a fuse. 
They suggested that I go to an electronic supply company on 27<sup>th</sup> and
Wall Avenue.  I went there, but they did not have one that size.  They
suggested that I go to Radio Shack, so without any other suggestion I went to
the Five Point area.  There I found the Radio Shack.  They did not have a fuse
of the exact voltage strength, but did have one that would protect my voltage
meter until I could get the correct fuse.  As a package of four fuses was only
$3.75, I purchased the package and then they ordered me the other package which
will be shipped to our home address in a couple of days.  From there I stopped
at the grocery store in that area to buy some items for Mae, and they also had
some dark ground cover bark, so I bought a sack of that.  When I got home I
added the bark to the front flower bed to finish covering it.  We had run, out
with the bark I had bought previously, and so this finished the job.  Although
I did get some things done, I felt that most of the day was wasted running
around.  We ate dinner and watched a show “How to Steal a Million” which was
quite cute.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up and had to hurry to attend a track meet at David High in Kaysville.  Tyler
was running in the hurdles at 8:45am and then later after 1pm he would participate
in the long jump.  Tyler came in 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> in the
hurdles and was quite unhappy about that.  We didn’t stay for the long jump and
haven’t heard how he came out in that.  About 2:30pm we took our T Zone machine
down to Randy’s so that he can try it out.  He may be interested in buying it
from us for $1,000.  I cannot use it due to my eyes and Mae doesn’t take the
time to use it.  It would sure help us out financially at this point.  After
setting the machine up at Randy’s, we took Randy with us and went up to Lael
and Neal Wall’s, where many of the cousins on the Porter side met for a party
to eat, visit and keep the family together.  It was late when we got home,
showered and got to bed.</p>

slept well last night and enjoyed a relaxing morning before attending Church. 
Sacrament meeting was quite special.  Following the Sacrament, Brother Thomas
Harper spoke using sign language and Sister Harper translated for us. 
Following Brother Harper, Brother Dick Terkelson introduced him and his wife,
before he gave his talk.  He and Sister Terkelson  are a new couple who recently
moved into our ward and the Monte Vista Mobile Home Park.  After his talk,
their daughter, Jennifer West, played a Violin Solo.  Sister Janice Barnes
accompanied her and did a remarkable job.  I spoke to Sister Barne’s after
meeting and told her how talented she is.  Sister Terkelson then gave the
concluding talk.  I also enjoyed the Priesthood class and the Sunday school
class.  After coming home and having some lunch, we went visiting some in our
Ward and then went over to visit Bob.  Bob played the show, “Once in a Life
Time”.  Although it had one bedroom scene that could have been left out, the
rest of the show was very good.  After getting home I caught my journal up
before we went to bed.</p>

about 9am.  I did get the lawn mowed before it started to rain and it rained
and hailed quite hard so it stopped me from doing much outside.  Mae went to a
Daughter’s of the Utah Pioneers meeting this morning.  I worked on my Diary
transfer to the PC.</p>

Mae &amp; I slept good last night. After breakfast, Mae started working on the
files on the computer desk to sort them out and get them organized better.  I
worked on the tool trailer most of the day.  I couldn’t find the wire
connectors and the crimper tool that I thought that I had bought the other day
when I purchased the battery for the camper.  The only thing I can conclude is
that I left them at the store.  Bishop Mullins stopped by to tell us that he
and Revee won’t be able to go to the temple with us for our ward temple day on
Thursday as a niece is coming from Florida and they will meet her and take her
to lunch in Richfield.  In talking with him, he told me that he had a crimper
tool that I could borrow – so I went to his house to get it.  Sister Scheers
called Mae to ask if she could take her to the doctor as she is in a lot of
pain and thinks it is her kidneys.  Mae took her and Arnold to the Instacare in
Roy.  They were told that there would be a 2 ½ hour wait, so they told Mae to
come home and they would call her when they are finished with the doctor.  Both
Mimi and Arnold are in their 90’s and use walkers.  After a good spaghetti
dinner, Mae continued to work on the files, and I watched a couple of Western
movies.  Mae typed this entry for me while I was getting ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We were late getting up.  After breakfast I
finished work on my trailer.  We got things packed up and left for Mike’s
before noon.  We stopped at Costco in Bountiful where I fueled the car.  While
I was getting gas, Mae went into the store and bought some chips, some Granola
bars and a frozen Yogurt.  We got to Mike’s about 3pm.  Mike and Becky had
already left and Mae and I spent the night with Mattie and Jessie.  After
dinner the four of us played games until bed time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, April 28, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke up at 5:30am and let Mae sleep a
little longer.  Mattie and Jessie got themselves ready for school.  Mae got up
and got some breakfast ready.  I took my shower and after breakfast and the
girls left for school, Mae took her shower.  Mike left me a Thank You note with
$150.00 in it for my helping him with the gates.  I wrote a note to him
expressing my gratitude for him (he is the only 1 out of 6 that has a Temple
Recommend now) and returned $50.00 asking him to give it to Becky to help with
the dental work she needs.  The $100.00 covers the tire that I blew on the
trailer.  Mae and I were ready to attend the Temple when we left. As we drove
home, we called Mike and wished him a Happy Birthday.  We got home in time to
stop at our house and empty some of the things in the trunk and go to the
Church House where we met the Shaw’s and took them with us to the Temple. 
Following the Temple Session, the four of us went to the cafeteria and ate
lunch before coming home.  After Mae and I got our things unpacked, I did some
figuring on a water storage rack for Irven and Sandy.  Mae was tired and so she
took a nap and slept about 1 ½ hours.  When she woke up, we called Connor and
wished him a Happy Birthday.  After dinner Mae read for a while then we went
into our bedroom to watch a movie on VHS, “The Fugitive” starring Harrison
Ford.  It was quite a suspenseful show.  Bob had loaned it to us the other day
when we were visiting him.  Iren called part way through the show and talked
for some time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I got up at 6am and let Mae sleep until

while Mae did her exercises.  We left the house about 9am, stopping at the post
office, at Harman’s for some groceries and at the Credit Union to deposit some
money in our account.  We next went to Garf’s and they followed us to Murdock’s
Chevrolet where we left our car for them to service it.  We rode with Ron and Diann
from Murdock’s to the Bountiful Temple where we attended an Endowment Session. 
Diann had names for us to take through.  After the Temple the four of us went
out to Chuck-A-Rama for lunch.  Ron and I got talking about going fishing and
maybe it went too far and I think we will go both Monday and Tuesday.   Mae and
I took a nap when we got home.  I helped Mae get some things ready for this
evening as we have invited David and Pat Presnell over this evening.  When Dave
and Pat came, we played the first game of marbles.  Dave had problems
remembering the moves, plus he and I seemed to have very bad hands.  Mae and
Pat won without any challenge and I became a little irritated with Mae sending
us back so often.  Mae and I seem to be a little on edge with each other
tonight.  That isn’t normal.  Well it’s time to go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 30, 2016</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We slept in not getting up until late. 
After some breakfast, I started looking on the Web to be able to reserve a camp
site at East Canyon Reservoir.  I called Ron Garf to be sure that he still
wanted to go up Monday morning, stay overnight and come home late Tuesday
afternoon.  I didn’t get an answer and was not sure just what to do.  I went to
go outside and Ron had just come to the door.  Ron is excited for us to go, so
we made reservations, then we started getting the camper and boat ready.  We
worked on them until after 5pm when Ron went home.  Marianne Ray called Mae and
needed someone to pick up a prescription for her.   Mae and I went and got it,
then we did some shopping mainly for things I need for the fishing trip.  Mae
is sure a special wife and sweetheart.  </p>
