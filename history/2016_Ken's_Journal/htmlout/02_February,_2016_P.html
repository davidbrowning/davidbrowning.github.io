<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
started a liver cleanse this morning but by noon, she was so sick to her
stomach that she gave it up.  I didn’t feel very well today so really didn’t do
much today.  I did read more of Revelations during the day.  I worked on some
more histories that I am writing and I e-mailed some information to Betsy
Browning, concerning someone’s entry on Family Search that Dad Browning
“Charles Browning” was in a wheelchair before he died.  I wanted to make a
correction to this entry.  Mae helped me quite a bit by editing some of my
works including my January journal.  I got January’s journal printed and stored
in my hard copy folders.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3:20am and was afraid that if I went back to bed I would wake Mae, so I
went into the front room and lay in the recliner.  Still unable to sleep as I
continually thought of anyway I might be able to help my children see the needs
to change and live the Gospel of Jesus to the fullest extent one can.  After
getting things cleaned up after breakfast, Mae put our pills together.  She set
up three weeks at a time and it seems that she always has to refill the pill
boxes.  It is hard to believe how fast those three week go by.  While she was
doing that we watched a good western show on TV.  I started a second show as
Mae wanted the use of the computer.  The show hardly started when they took the
Name of God in vain, so I just turned it off.  Mae is putting a lot of work
into the presentation she has been asked to give for the Clinton Stake Relief
Society meeting on the 25<sup>th</sup> of February.  In some of Mae’s
perpetration we got on Family Search and noticed that Betsey had made a
correction to Dad’s record.  It is ok but I thought it was my place to enter
that information as I was the one that found the error.  Oh Well! It’s
corrected.  I started reading more in the Book of Revelations but I fell asleep
and slept for quite a while.  We had lunch when I woke and then I was going to
restart my reading, when Gary Nelson came.  We enjoyed having him come to
visit.  He had some time before an appointment to go Square Dancing.  We visit
and then Mae prepared some dinner for us including Gary.  He then left for
square dancing.  He told us that he is presently going square dancing eight times
a week.  After Gary left I helped Mae do up the dishes.  I then went to my
reading and Mae worked on the computer.  I am almost finished with the reading
of the New Testament and I can say that for the first time in my life I have
thoroughly enjoyed from Acts to Revelations and it is all due to “The New
Testament Made Easier” written by David J. Ridges.  I have always enjoyed
Mathews, Mark, Luke and John but have never been able to understand until this
time the remainder of the book.  Mae and I played three games of Rummikub and I
skunked her tonight.  THAT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR ME, SO I HAD TO ENTER THIS IN
FOR THE RECORD.</p>

woke at 3am but went back to sleep and got up at 7am.  I prepared breakfast of
omelets, to try out a larger frying pan.  It worked ok so that is what I will
use when we got to Irven’s Thursday.  Mae and I went to Home Depot, where I
returned some extra materials from David’s job.  We did some shopping at Home
Depot, the $1.00 store, Wal-Mart’s, Cost Co, Good Earth Health store and went
to Dr. Flinder’s.  For our lunch we started with corn nuts at the Dollar store,
potatoe wedges at Wal-Mart, samples at Cost Co and before we left Cost Co we
bought a frozen yogurt, eating it as we drove to the Doctors office.  This
evening Nolan came over and rubbed my back and really gave me some relief.  We
sure enjoyed having him come and enjoyed his visit.  Mae had cooked a wonderful
soup and she invited Nolan to eat with us, which he did.  It was good to have
him here.  Before Noland left he commentd that tonight is the first time he has
eaten a real meal for a long time.  His meals usually consist of Granola bars. 
I finished reading the New Testament this evening before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
started reading the Book of Mormon this morning.  After breakfast Mae and I
started packing to go with Bryce and Deanna to Logan.  Bishop Mullins stopped
by to ask us if we would check to see how Dorma Cosper is doing and also find
out how Sister Jeneane Browning is doing.  He has been so busy with Ravee being
so sick that he hasn’t been able to catch those two Sisters at home.  Dorma was
not home while we were still home and we left for Bryce and Deanna’s right
after noon.  Bryce, Deanna, Mae and I met Irven and Sandy at the Logan Temple
at 2PM.  During the Session, Mae and I were asked to be Session Witnesses.  It
was a very enjoyable session.  All of us went to Irven and Sandy’s where Irven
and Sandy prepared a very good dinner of Corn Beef Patties.  After dinner we
visited and played games until quite late before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in and when we got up I prepared a large egg omelet for breakfast.  We
did some visiting but Bryce said that he would like to drive to Idaho to see
Terry and Angela and their new home.  Therefore Bryce, Deanna, Mae and I got
our things packed up.  I think that Irven and Sandy were just a little hurt
with us leaving so soon.  If we would have had a larger vehicle I am sure that
they would have liked to gone with us.  It was somewhere around 10:30AM when we
got away.  We drove to Chubbuck getting there about 1PM.  We stopped at a
Smiths grocery store and bought something to eat at the Deli Bar.  We planned
on eating it before going to Terry and Angela’s, however Bryce hurried and ate
his food and drove to Terry’s.  Deanna and Mae finally got him to drive about a
block further where the rest of us finished our lunch.  We then drove back to
Terry’s where we visited with Terry and Angela and saw their new home.  It is
quite a lovely home and quite large.  We enjoyed visiting with them.  We left
for home about 3pm.  Bryce got me telling him some of my life history from the
time I went into the Air Force until Mae and I moved into Ogden.  By that time
we got to Bryce and Deanna’s home.  I wish that I could have had a tape
recording of our visit.  It would have filled in a lot of my life history.  Mae
and I then drove on home.  It was after 5pm when we got home.  After unpacking
Mae and I went over to Darmma Cosper’s home and visited with her for a while. 
We returned home and got some dinner and watched a TV show before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Shortly
after getting up this morning we had our breakfast.  David called just as we
started and asked if he could borrow a tool from me, which of course I said
that he could.  He stopped in and we went down and got the tool, plus I
returned his drill to him, which had been put in my tool trailer when we
cleaned up his garage after building the climbing wall in it.  I also gave
David “the In Store Credit” I had received for the materials that I had
returned.  I then drove down to Bountiful to Dr. Toone’s office where gave me
an adjustment.  From there I went to see Bob.  His hearing aid has quite working
and so I had to use the white board to communicate with him.  He was asleep
when I entered his room and so I woke him.  The TV was on and was tuned into a
BYU basket ball game which we watched.  During the first half of the game, the
two teams stayed almost even, trading positions on the score of leading back
and forth.  In the 3<sup>rd</sup> inning BYU seem to be in lead most of the
time and in the last quarter BYU took and held the lead to the end of the game. 
It was a good game.  I left Bob and went to a copy office where I had them make
some copies for Mae.  On the way home I stopped at Wall Greens and canceled my
prescription that Dr. Flinders had given me for a muscle relaxer, as David had
looked at the one prescription that I have from Dr. Lee and said that it was
still good for another year.  Saved us a little money and at this time we need
to do that.  Mae and I had some lunch when I got home.  I then laid down and
took a nap for a while.  I did work on my Diary editing more entries.  This
evening Mae and I planned on watching a TV show or one on Netflix but Marianne
Ray called and talked to Mae for over two hours.  Mae did come in for the tail
end of the 2nd show.  </p>

woke early and then I fell back to asleep but was woke by some kind of noise. 
Weather it was a real noise or something in my dream but when I woke I was
quite depressed.  I guess my concerns are over our finances as we aren’t doing
very well.  I have a feeling that we should sale our camper and pickup, plus my
boat and tool with the tool trailer.  Mae doesn’t feel that way but as I see
our finical situation we have little money to use those items and I am getting
to old to do much side work.  We will have to see how things go.  Meetings went
well.  After the block programs Brother Jeff Jones and I went out taking the
Sacrament to some of the shut-ins.  When we finished and I got home, Mae had
dinner ready.  After dinner Mae and I went up to David’s where some of our
family had got together to watch the Supper Bowel.  I really wasn’t interested
in the Football game as I haven’t followed it at all, but is was a good game. 
After getting home I entered this entry to my journal before we went to bed.</p>

woke about 6:30 and laid in the recliner in the front room.  I woke about
7:45.  After breakfast I helped Mae change and make the bed.  Mae has been busy
getting the washing going.  Mae went with me at 10:45am to Rosie Harper’s place
to find out what needed to be done to fix a tap that is leaking.  Tom and
Sheila are Rosie and Sarah Harper’s parents I believe by adoption.  Tom came
over to help me.  With him being Deaf and communicates mainly by sign language,
it made it interesting but we did ok.  The tub faucet wasn’t just leaking but
it was running a steady stream.  After getting the faucet disassembled I
decided that it was due for a complete replacement.  I went over to Durk’s in
Layton to get a new faucet.  While in Layton I picked up the plate for the 22
rifle for Jeff at the Engraving shop.  I came back and installed the new faucet
but by the time I finished with the job, I had put in about 6 ½ hours.  Mae has
been on the phone or at Marianne Rays quite a bit of time today.  I am not just
sure what is to be done with that lady.  Mae has also been on the phone with
both the power company and the gas company and has put our billing on an
equalization plan that will allow us to budget easier.  She also talked to the
power co. as to why after all the insulation and repairs I had made to our house
the bills are about the same as last year?  He told her that last year the
average temperature was 10% warmer than normal and this year it is 20% colder
than normal. Therefore if our bill is about the same, then we are actually
saving about 30% over last year.  That helped us feel better about all the work
I have been doing.   I was sure tired when I got home this afternoon and just
quite.  I did watch a show on Netflix, then filled in this entry and went to
bed.</p>

was up some during the night but did get enough sleep.  We had a relaxing
morning and Mae made Skillets (fried eggs over hash browns, however in our case
over sweet potatoes) for our breakfast.  I did some chasing that took about 3
hours.  I took the 22 rifle down to Lee’s Gun shop to have the engraved plate
mounted to the stock.  I then went to Wall-Mark and the dollar store where I
purchased Mae a nickels and ear ring set, a nice Valentine’s Day card,   and a
dozen silk long stem roses and vase.  This afternoon we went visiting the
Hiltons and Brother Siglin as Visiting Teacher and Home Teacher.  For a message
I used President Uchtdorf’s message in the February Ensign, “Landing Safely in
Turbulence.  I related two incidents that I experienced when I worked in Alaska
and how we had to travel by airplane.  1<sup>st</sup> when we arrived at
Anchorage Alaska and the turbulences we encountered as we crossed over the
Mountain to drop into the Anchorage airport and 2<sup>nd</sup> when we
transferred from village to a village.  Both occasions, it was the pilots
continual watching the guide lines that made it possible for the planes to land
safely on the runways.  When we got home and started to get dinner, however
Marianne came here and she talks continually.  Instead of eating we just left
the food and went visiting to Sister Leah Neilson.  She is such a delight to
visit.  I gave the same message there but with different emphases.  She is such
a delight to visit and is trying so hard for the Eternal Reward.  When we got
home and about ready to eat Mae noticed that she had several missed calls and
while she was trying to contact the missed callers Marianne called again.  I
personally feel that this whole thing with Marianne is being handled wrong as I
don’t think Mae should be involved with it, not alone being right in the middle
of it.  Mae is also trying to line up a Temple trip with her siblings.</p>

didn’t sleep the best last night.  I slept ok but woke at 4:30am and though I
went back to bed I didn’t get much more sleep.  We prepared breakfast and then
Mae got ready to attend the Temple and then went down to see if she could get
things arranged, with the power company, to have Marianne’s power turned back
on.  That was 8:30am am she got home after 10am.  Bryce came, Kim and Jeannine
came, Georgia and Rick came and Terry drove down from Pocatello to be with us. 
We enjoyed a beautiful session at the Temple and then all of us went downstairs
and ate lunch together.  It was very good for all of Mae’s siblings to be there
together.  On the way home we stopped at Seagull Book where we bought a few
items.  We then went to the Dollar Store for a few items before coming home. 
Brother Lee Gifford stopped by to give me the check for the parts I purchased
at Durk’s plumbing for Harpers tub that I repaired yesterday.  Mae went down to
Marianne’s and found that the power had been turned back on just before Mae got
there.  After some dinner we went visiting to Sister Lemon and to Marianne
which completes our monthly assignment.  We haven’t visited with the
Patterson’s as it is their turn to visit with us.  So I don’t know how that
will be counted.  We played Rummikub this even and I won 2 out of 3 games
tonight.</p>

Harper, Mae and myself in attendance.  I feel bad that we don’t get more to go
but we enjoyed the session.  Ton is so amazing to help as he is totally deaf
from birth and only reads at a third grade level.  The first time that I
assisted him the monitor that is provided had closed caption but this time it
was done in American Sign.  I asked Sheila which was best for Tom and she said
the American Sign as he only has a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade level of reading. 
Sheila is also confined into a wheel chair as she had polio as a child.  To me
they are both amazing.  Following the session we all went to the cafeteria and
ate lunch.  After getting home Mae did up some washing in preparation to go to
Jeff and Gales tomorrow.  At 4pm we went with the Full Time Sister Missionaries
to visit Jackie McDough, who lives across the street from us.  Although Jackie
has not been baptized a member of the Church, she is an amazing Lady and a
daughter of God.  Mae attended choir practice this evening.  This evening we
did more preparations in getting ready to go to Jeff and Gales tomorrow.</p>

he had Jeff’s 22 Riffle ready.  I drove down to his shop and got the riffle. 
We got talking and I spent almost an hour there.  When I got home we packed the
car.  We then went to the service station and fill the car with gas and took it
through the car wash.  It was 1pm when we actually got away and it was after
3pm when we got to Jeff’s home.  We got most everything unpacked by the time
Jeff got home from work.  Jeff then took all his family and us out to eat at
Golden Corral.  We first went to Cost Co. where Jeff bought three canoes for
the children.  He plans on purchasing some larger ones when those come into the
store.  After returning home the children soon went to bed.  The four of us,
Jeff, Gale, Mae and I then played a game of Rummikub.  While playing, we also

hotcakes and eggs.  Mae, Gale, Jeff and I discussed in more detail the Family
Reunion plans.  I am concerned that there is more details we need to settle
before a final decision can be made.  I don’t want to heavy of a load to be
placed on Jeff and Gale.  While Mae and I ate Gale was also making preparations
for Rachael’s baptismal.  Mae and I were going to play a game of Old Pig with
the children when Mae stood up to take a glass of water away from the table
when she stepped on a piece of plastic and slipped, falling to the floor.  She
says that she is ok, but I am quite worried.  I went with Jeff to do some
shopping and looking for a Gun Rack that he could mount to the wall to display
his riffle.  When we finished shopping we met all the rest at the school where
Ben played basket ball.  Ben is learning and seems to be enjoying the game. 
After returning home Mae and I had some lunch.  Mae is hurting and I am quite
worried but she insists that she is doing ok.  I laid down and took a nap and
then entered some into my journal.  The family is watching Star Wars on Netflix

downstairs to our room and worked on my journals.  After the movie ended Jeff,
Gale, Mae and I played Harts in which Gale won with Jeff loosing the further I
have ever seen him loose a card game.  Mae and I took our showers before going
to bed at 11:30pm.</p>

were able to sleep until about 7:30am before getting up.  I really enjoyed my
scripture reading this morning and especially a cross reference to Ezekiel
18:21-32.   We joined with Jeff, Gale and the children for breakfast of eggs
and hash brown potatoes.  We attended the Church block meetings at 11am to 2pm
and really enjoyed the meetings.  The noise of being in a family meeting is
sure much harder for me to hear the talks than in our Ward where we have no
small children.  Everyone just seem to eat lunch when they felt like it but
this evening we had a very nice dinner as a family.  Before going to bed Jeff,
Gale, Mae and I started a game of Hand &amp; Foot.  Mae is still felling ok
after her fall.  What a blessing that is as she really slipped and fell quite
hard landing on her butt.  At this point she is having very little effect over
the fall she took.</p>

of Presidents Day there was no school today so the children were home.  Mae and
I spent most of the day with the children so that Gale could get some things
done around the home.  This evening Jeff, Gale, Mae and I continued our game of
Hand &amp;Foot of which Jeff and Gale won.  It looks like everyone of our
family are in favor of holding our Family Reunion here at Jeff and Gales this
summer, July 7<sup>th</sup> through 11<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up at 4am and read for a while using Brother Ridges book, the Book of
Mormon made Easier, and really enjoy his concepts and insight.  I also enjoyed
the concept that a Brother made in Sunday School when he told of his son saying
that if he became a God, he would create a world where he could have beautiful
streams where in he could just go and catch 20 lb. Rainbow Trout’s.  He then
said to his son that if every time you always caught the same size trout every
time you cast in, wouldn’t it soon become boring?  That thought has made me
realize that if we always have the same perfect day; day after day that soon
would become quite a bore.  Liken that to those that think that if they achieve
Terrestrial Glory, they will always be happy.  Then realize that only will the
Celestial Glory give us continual advancement and expansion.   Brother Ridges
also gave me more insight on “Forgiveness”.  I have not got a complete
comprehension of the principle.  My question is, if you forgive and forget, do
you just wipe out that memory from your life?  I can’t comprehend that, yet!  I
went back to bed and slept until after 8am.  Mae was up when I woke, so we got
ready and prepared breakfast of fried trout, egg’s and toast.  Gale had an egg
with us but didn’t try the trout.  After cleaning up I went downstairs and
worked on my journals.  I took a break and had some lunch and then continued on
my journals.  I am now on March 20, 1974 of my Diary.  </p>

was up at 5am and enjoyed reading in the Book of Mormon with David Ridges added
insights.  It helps me gain greater understanding of the Scriptures.  I am so
grateful for the testimony of the plan of life, my Savior and his atoning
sacrifice; the goals the Gospel give to me, my Temple Blessings and the desire
to have my wife for all Eternity.  I hope that somehow I can pass that on to my
children!  Although you can see, off in the far distance, the mountains, it
seems so different to be so far away from them.  I helped Gale hang shelves and
pictures on their walls.  When Ben got home from school, he and I went down to
their neighbors two houses to the west.  Gale had called earlier and they have needed
tools to cut Ben’s pine wood derby car out.  He has a band saw that is very
accurate and then a belt sander that finished the wood so that it is ready to
paint.  He also made some fins that Ben wanted to have on the car.  That sure
made my job a lot easier.  We glued the fins onto the car and I put the first
coat of paint on the car.  Mae had made lasagna for dinner, which we ate when
Jeff got home from work.  After dinner and we cleaned up the kitchen and then
all of us went into Jeff and gale’s bedroom and watched part of a Star Wars
movie until the children had to go to bed.  Mae, Jeff, Gale and I then played
games until 9:30PM.  I then put the first coat of paint on the pine wood
derby.  We then got ready for bed and I added this entry into my journal.</p>

am not sure what happened to my journal entry yesterday but this morning there
was two entries and as far as I can see this is now the same as the second
entry for February so I will delete the other.  I woke early this morning and
read for a while before coming back to bed.  When I went back to bed I could
see stars from our window but when we woke later it was raining.  I am kind of
depressed with life this morning but hope I can get out of it.  I put a 2<sup>nd</sup>
coat of paint on the pine wood derby.   I hung wall items for Gale this
afternoon.  We got a text about 4:30PM from Shauna informing us that Tyler and
Emily were in an automobile accident this afternoon as they were returning home
from school.  We called back to get more details.  Evidently the Morgan area
received quite a bit of snow today.  As they were returning home from school in
their little red car, another vehicle cut close in front of them and splashed heavy
slush onto their windshield.  Tyler applied the brakes, tried to get the
windshield wipers on to removed the snow, and pulling off the road, over
steered and took out several gard poles.  Both Tyler and Emily received some
injury but not serious.  The car was totaled and that is sad but we are
grateful to hear that Tyler and Emily are ok.  Jeff and I went shopping this
evening to get final supplies for Ben’s Pine Wood Derby.  We got back home just
as Gale was taking Ben to basketball practice.  Mae had dinner ready.  After
eating Jeff, Mae and I played a game of Harts.  I won this time.  Jeff was very
tired this evening so we let him retire early tonight.  We went downstairs and
I worked on my journals before we went to bed about 10:30pm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
breakfast this morning I worked on the pine wood derby car.  With Matt’s help I
got the axels polished and the tires sanded smooth.  I put a 3<sup>rd</sup>
coat of paint on the car.  When Mat left for school, then Mae, Gale and I went
to the Twin Falls Temple where we went through a Endowment Session.  Mae and I
were asked if we would by the company witnesses.  Following the Session we went
into town where I filled up the car with gas.  We then went to a bakery where
Gale bought some bread.  At the bakery they also gave us a sample of their
bread.  We then went next door to a yogurt shop and bought a yogurt for each of
us.  I was really impressed with their yogurt and the price was much more
reasonable than the shop in Ogden and Chandler.  After getting home I finished
the car by adding the lead weight to the car, making template of a light ling
strike that I then painted on both sides of the car and then mounted the
wheels.  It turned out pretty sharp, now it depends on the speed.  Mae offered
to tend the children so that Jeff and gale could go out this evening for their
wedding anniversary.  She then watched the Star Wars movie while I worked on
the Pine Wood Derby car.   Before going to bed Mae and I got everything of ours
that we could pack and put in the car so we can leave early for home in the morning.

last night that he was thru with my plainer so I had to rearrange things in the
car so I could but the plainer into the car.  It was 6:15am when we got away
for home.  We drove straight through until we got to Ogden where we made a stop
at Winco in Ogden for some groceries.  After unpacking Mae and I took a short
nap.  This afternoon I went over to Scott’s where I patched a spot where they
had water damage in their RV.  I stopped on the way home and bought us some
chicken for dinner.  I spent the evening with me.  I helped Mae some with
getting dinner ready for tomorrow.  Mae already had a lot ready for dinner
tomorrow, as she has invited David’s family over for dinner.  I did give her a
hair cut before we showered.</p>

cold.  I woke feeling much better.  Meetings were very enjoyable although we
were sorry that Emily was not on the program playing the violin.  When we got
home I helped Mae finish up dinner before David and his family got here.  We
had a very nice meal and they enjoyed coming.  We found out that it was Tyler’s
girlfriend that caused the accident as she was teasing Tyler by splashing snow
on him.  They found out that it isn’t a good thing to play around at 80 mph on
a freeway.  We can just be grateful that it wasn’t much more serious.  David
told us that he has been asked to give a speech as the main speaker at a Pharmaceutical
Convention and will be paid $1,250 for a 1 hour presentation, plus paying for
his flight, meals and room.  Wahoo!  Mae and I played a game of Rummy and I

3 or 4 time before that.  She went right to work with regular duties.  We
exercised before breakfast however I think I did more than I should have with
my right shoulder.  I am not sure but I am possibly getting authorizes in the
shoulder.  That seems to come with old age!  I really enjoyed reading the 5<sup>th</sup>
chapter of our Priesthood Manuel “President Howard W. Hunter” this morning.  I
received quite a bit of insight about “Receiving Revelation” and maybe it was
also due to the talk Scott and I had Saturday while I was at his place.  Mae
and I went down to Gifford’s and visited for a little while and them Lee took
us out and we went over some of the gardening with him while Mae took some
notes.  After lunch I took a short nap.  This afternoon I went a store (Scrubs)
that sales Dansko shoes to Roy, but they didn’t have my size.  While there I
stopped at a hobby store looking for a Chess Timer, but they don’t carry any
but they called a Hobbie store in Clearfield and they have Chess Timers.  I did
go there but I believe that I can find one on line at a lower price.  I bought
a set of shelves that I can use to store our water storage on, at Home Depot.  After
dinner this evening I assembled the shelves and then Mae and I watched a
western show on TV that was pretty good.  </p>

and put the cases of bottled water on them.  It worked prefect for the water
but I am not sure where I am going to store the glass and screen to our front
storm door.   I helped Mae with her power point presentation adding some
animations, creating some more slides and changing some sequences.  I set up
the projector and had Mae do some practice with the live presentations so that
she is familiar with the mouse in advancing the slides as she gives the
script.  We also did the display table arrangement.  I watched a couple of
shows today, one on TV and one on Netflix, while Mae practiced her
presentation.  I believe she is about ready.  We had Brother and Sister
Patterson come over for our monthly visit.  I also took some stew that Mae had
made, down to the Hilton’s.  I also visited with Roy a couple of times today. 
He seems to be doing ok.  I also called Irven and Sandy concerning the Browning
Reunion he is trying to get together this summer.</p>

Sealing office where Sister Harper had made arrangement for us to do some
family sealing’s.  It was a very Spiritual and enjoyable experience.  We
stopped on the way home at Costco where I returned the flash light that David
had given me last year for my Birthday, as it doesn’t work and there is no
place where I can get it repaired.  Mae also picked up a few groceries that we
needed.  When we got home I packed all of the items that Mae needs for her
presentation into the car.  I then took a short nap before we went to the
Clinton Stake center where we set up her displays and the projector.  I had
forgotten to bring our screen but Steve Smith was there and he was able to get
one for us.  I have a little time before the program will start so I entered
this journal entry.  Well Mae put on the presentation for two group and went
way over the 50 that she had planned on having.  The first group consisted of
over 40 Sisters and the 2<sup>nd</sup> group was almost that full.  It went
well and I think that everyone that attended enjoyed it.  In appreciation of
Mae participation in the program the Stake R.S. Presidency gave Mae a loaf of
Great Harvest bread and a nice thank you card.  It was about 10PM when we got

10am and they were ready for us to ride with them.  We stopped at Bob’s and I
returned his white board to him.  We drove to Salt Lake where we went to the
Church Museum on West Temple.  This is the first time that we have been there
since they have completely rebuilt it.  It is amazing and very enjoyable.  We
only saw the part of the main floor with still a lower floor and an upper
floor.  It was really a Spiritual experience to be there.  By then we had been
there for almost 4 hours.  We were tired and hungry and so we left the Museum. 
From there we went to Chuck-a Rama for dinner.  Ron insisted on paying for the
meal.  I did beat him to the tip.  We had a wonderful lunch and then went up to
the Salt Lake Cemetery South of the University of Utah.  Ron drove through the
cemetery where we saw at least 2 dozen deer that stay and feed there year
around.  All the deer that we saw were does without even seeing one buck.  That
was interesting.  We came back to Ron and Dian’s and from there Mae and I did
some shopping.  We got home after 6pm where we took a short nap.  At least I
took a nap but Mae only rested.  We then went to Dave and Pat Presnell’s where
we played games and visited with them.  Pat had treats for us to enjoy as we
enjoyed the evening.  We played Trans America and Dave won that game, we then
played Farkel and I lost out almost right from the first.  Mae took the lead,
while Pat and Dave stayed close to each other.  Dave was a little ahead of Pat
and Mae went over the limit so she would win.  But we each got one more try to
catch Mae.  Neither pat or I could even get close.  Dave in next roll scored
all die and so got to start over and continued scoring all die the second,
third and fourth set and with the fifth set he passed Mae and won the game.  It
was 10:30PM when we got home.  Before going to bed I entered this entry.</p>

message concerning the Eternal Blessing of the Temple.  Although very inspirational
it still left me depressed because of our children and the decisions they are
making toward the Church.  I get depressed trying to find out what we can do to
get them to research and pray.  Mae gets upset with me because I can’t just
have Faith that it will work out.  Our children are Sealed to Mae and I as long
as we live for our Blessings, but what about our grandchildren and
Great-Grandchildren and on beyond that?  We had some lunch and then I took a
nap.  Mae laid down to take a nap but she got a phone call and was still on
that call when I got up.  I tried to find the Paradise Reservoir, where Irven
is setting up a Browning Reunion, on the map but could not locate it.  Mae went
down to visit with Marianne Ray but as usual Marianne took total charge of the
conversation and didn’t hear anything Mae was trying to discuss with her. 
Bishop Mullin’s stopped by to see if I would, with help from others, install
his swamp cooler onto Marianne’s home.  I told him that I would be willing to
do that.  Sister Mullin is still a long ways from being well.  Mae and I went
over to Scott’s and visited with them for a while.  We went over to visit Bob
shortly after 8PM and watched the show “Roman Holiday” with him.  Although we
have seen it many times it is still a good movie.  It was late when we got
home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t sleep much last night so after breakfast I laid back down and slept for
about an hour.  Mae had been doing laundry and house cleaning all morning.  I
woke back up about the time she left to go out to lunch with some of the
Sisters in the Clinton Ward, for Wanda Miller’s 89<sup>th</sup> Birthday.  I
guess I can’t complain about be in 77.  Mae had taken the garbage out to the
street for me before she left.  There was laundry in the clothes dryer so I folded
them and put them away.  I read another chapter in the Book of Mormon.   I then
got some lunch and then tried to find something to watch on TV but that is a
waste of time.  Mae came home about 2:30pm.  She said that she had a good time. 
I went down to Durk’s and bought some part so that I can build a clothes rod
that will fit in the car.  Using a rod to hang the clothes on when we travel is
a lot better than putting them in the suit cases and lying then in the trunk. 
I worked on my Five Year Diary getting quite a bit more transcribed into the
computer files.  I also backed up some of my journal files onto the external
drive.  Mae has kept busy with laundry and starting to pack for our trip to
Shellie’s.  This evening we read more from the book “The Infinite Atonement”. 
That is a marvels, informative and Spiritual book.  We then turned on the TV
and watched “The Keys to the Kingdom” staring Gregory Peck, on Netflix.  It was
a very good show and though Mae only got to see a little over ½ of the show
because of Marianne Ray, she still enjoyed the show. </p>
