woke about 3am and tried to go back to sleep but finally got up at 4:50am.  My
legs and feet feel some better, but they still have an ache that starts in my
feet and goes up to the top of the thigh.  I read another chapter in the Book
of Mormon, had my morning prayers and then worked on the computer, starting
another month in my journal.  As I start this new month, it just amazes me that
another month has gone by.  Mae came out about 6:45am.  I feel bad that she
worries so much about me, especially when she doesn’t sleep well most nights. 
I sure have to count my blessings, especially with such a wonderful wife as I
have!  Mae needed the computer so I got off.  She is figuring our budget and I
guess that takes priority.  I watched a western movie on TV while Mae was
working on the computer.  I was able to complete the list of our families
Birthday and Wedding Anniversary, that Mae had put together and wanted me to
rearrange the print layout of the list.  I was able to transcribe several more
day entries from my Diary, on to the computer.  I also sent the following

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
woke about 5am with leg cramps and went into the front room where she slept in
the recliner.  I got up and read from the Book of Mormon as usual.  As I read 3
Nephi and especially chapter 7 this morning, I feel that the very same things
are happening in our government both nationally and locally.  How much longer
can it continue???? I tried to lie back down, but couldn’t relax and so I got
up and showered and shaved.  Mae soon woke and started her normal morning
routine. My feet and legs are bothering me quite a lot today.  I have taken
Ibuprofen to get some relief.  After breakfast, I laid down in the recliner and
watched the show “Saints and Soldiers – the Void” on Netflix.  It is a very
good show.  I went with Mae to pay the rent, take ward “High Lites” to 3
Sisters in the Ward, picked up the dry cleaning and took a suit to be cleaned
and then went grocery shopping.  Winco has riding shopping cart and so I took
part of the shopping list and picked up those items, while Mae used a regular
shopping cart and picked up the other items.  We also practiced using our
phones, while shopping, to talk to each other.  I do enjoy being with Mae and
she is my Eternal Sweetheart!  This afternoon Mae prepared dinner of Lasagna,
vegetables, toss salad and garlic bread.  We had invited Dennis and Judy
Patterson over for dinner before they move from the Ward.  They will be moving
to South Ogden, into a Condominium with a full basement.  They have a daughter
and her son who will be moving into their basement.  Dinner was excellent, as
normal for Mae, and we had a very enjoyable evening.  We did play some games
after eating.  We sure hope things work out for them.  I have been working on
my Diary getting it transferred into our computer.  This evening I finished the
final entry of the five years.  I certainly understand what President Kimball
meant when he said that a Five Year Diary wasn’t worth much.  As I have retyped
the entries I have tried to make corrections and additions that will give these
entries greater meanings and more detail.  I have also been able to remember
and enter greater detail to many of the daily entries, as well as making the
entries readable, due to my hand writing in such small space and small
writing.  It is now 10:30pm and we are going to bed.</p>

hadn’t slept the best and so we slept in for a while.  I cooked scrambled eggs
for breakfast.  Mae worked on her presentation about her Grandmother and
Grandfather Porter.  I was hurting, and so rested in the recliner and read an
article from the Ensign.  Brother Klaus Decker came by to see me, as he heard
that I wasn’t feeling the best.  We visited for a while.  That was special of
him to be concerned about me.  I took a nap and then we had some lunch.  Mae
and I went over to Jennie Porter’s for me to get a scan and see what I needed
to do with my health.  We never finished there until 5:45pm.  We then stopped
at Kent’s grocery store for a few groceries.  As we left the store, Mae told me
that they had a good sale on strawberries.  I turned around and Mae went back
in and bought a flat of strawberries plus a couple of other items.  We then
went to Good Earth where Mae went in and purchased a few items. When we got
home, we watched a show on Netflix while we ate our dinner.  Mae then wanted to
wash and freeze ¾ of the flat of strawberries so I helped her.  We started to
bed about 10:30pm.  It was much later when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke shortly after 4am, so went back to bed.  When I went back to bed, I
remembered putting my Cpap back on, but later I remembered checking to see if
Mae was in bed.  I must have taken the Cpap off and fallen asleep as when Mae
woke me about 8am, I didn’t have the Cpap on.  We got up and got going quite
fast as Gail and the children are planning on being here at 9:30am, as she had
an appointment with a hair dresser at 10am.  She didn’t get here until 10 to 10
and left Ben and Rachel here with us.  We enjoyed having them stay with us. 
Mae took them to the Roy City Park to play.  I filled our water containers and
took a 2 gallon bottle over to Jackie.  Mae prepared a nice lunch for all of us
while Gail and Matt were gone.  Before lunch, I played a game of Parcheesi with
Ben and Rachel.  Gail &amp; Matt came and we had lunch.   After lunch, we
played a game of Skip-Bo and then a game of Old Pig.  Gail and the children
left between 4 and 4:30pm.  I reset the timer on our sprinkler system.  I hope
that I set it right.  I worked on Mae’s presentation, trying to put it on
Microsoft Power Point.  I became very frustrated with the system as they have
made changes to it and I cannot get it to come out like I want it to. 
Yesterday, Jennie told me that I was dehydrated and needed to drink more water. 
I have tried to drink often, but it seems that I just have to keep running to
the bath room.  Mae read her scriptures while I tried working on this
presentation.  I quit, and we watched a wonderful true story movie called
“Marie Storie” it is about a deaf and dumb girl who was like a wild animal. 
She was brought to Notra Dame and a num worked with her for 9 months and
finally had success teaching her brail and opened the world for her.  The num
had bad health and finally died, but Marie kept learning from the other nuns
and helped other young girls who came there.  It is quite a story, very
moving.  As we exited Netflix, a western movie with Charleston Heston was on
and we watched the end of it.  It is now almost midnight.  Goodnight.</p>

got up at 6:45am and started my day.  I would like to go fishing but kind of
feel depressed over it.  Mae soon had breakfast ready.  After breakfast, I
called Ron and we set a date of going fishing on Aug. 10<sup>th</sup> and we
are thinking about going up to Heber reservoir this time.  I went down and got
our mail hoping that our check for Marianne Ray’s air conditioner and also the
check from Beneficial Life, but neither came today.  I returned the magnetic
inserts to Lee Gifford as they won’t work in my slippers.  While there, I
picked vegetables from the garden and took them a zucchini squash.  I went to
Durk’s and picked up some sprinkler parts.  They suggested that I bring a
sample of our water to them and they will test it to see if our softener is
working.  I went to Best Buy and purchased a Thumb Drive and a Personal Cloud
Storage unit to add to our computer.  This afternoon Bishop Presnell stopped in
to see how I am doing and to check on two of our Home Teaching families. 
Bishop Jim and Ravee Mullins also stopped by to see how I am doing.  That was
special of both of them.  With Mae’s help, I got my journal files transferred
to our lap top computer from our back-up external file.  With the crash of our
previous lap top computer we are sure thankful for the backup file and the many
files that David was able to salvage for us.  I started writing “My memories of
Bob” and spent some time on that.</p>

morning I woke at 6am and did some studying in the scriptures.  Mae slept until
7am.  This morning I replaced 2 sprinkler heads.  I had Mae get me some more
parts at Durk’s and have our water checked for softness and it failed with the
hardness being 10, where as it should be almost a 0 to 2.  I mowed the lawns
today, they were looking quite bad.  I talked to Jarred concerning the test and
he gave me two phone numbers to contact and they could come out and check our
softener.  This afternoon I added a sprinkler head in front to try to do a
better coverage.  I grilled chicken and hamburgers for dinner this evening. 
Scott, Michelle and their family came over for dinner.  Mae had made Funeral
Potatoes and a fruit salad to go with the grilled chicken and burgers.  After
dinner Scott and I hooked up the “Cloud” and then Scott started getting it
downloaded.  He spent over 3 hours trying to get it to work and was about to
give up when he recognized one switch setting on our computer that wasn’t
letting anything else get access on our computer.  Michelle was trying to get
our new phones set up for us.  The kids played and they were very loud.  It was
10PM when Scott and Michelle finished getting the Cloud and the phone set up. 
They left for home at 10PM.  I helped Mae straightened up the house.  Mae did
up the dishes while I entered my journal.  We are both very tired but still
appreciated Scott and Michelle’s help.  </p>

were up before 7:30am.  I am feeling fairly well and plan on attending our
meetings.  I am concerned about fasting today with the need to take pills and
water.  Mae is going to fast, but I prepared me some breakfast.  Bishop Mullins
stopped in this morning at 9am to see how I am doing.  We got taking about my
journals and how I am keeping them.  He asked the same question that I often
asked, that is, “What is the good of keeping the journals?” and the only answer
that I could give is “That a Prophet, President Kimble, has told us that we
should keep them.”  That is the reason I do this because I often wonder if my
children or their children will ever refer to them.  Mae worked on her
presentation for the Byron Porter Reunion, and I set up the projector so that
she can go through her presentation.  We did watch the Tabernacle Broadcast
this morning and then Mae started working on her presentation.  She has learned
quite a few abilities of the new presentation features.  We attended our
meetings and enjoyed them.  I missed Sunday school so that Lane Johnson and I
could take the Sacrament to some of the home bound.  Lane has a meeting to
attend at 4:14PM so by going during Sunday school, we should be able to
accomplish our assignment and still give Lane time to attend his meeting. 
However, Brother Johnson of the Bishopric stopped us before we left the
building and wanted to visit with Lane.  That put us behind but we did visit
two homes.  I had Lane take me home and let me off and he went to this
meeting.  I called Brother Klaus Decker and he went with me to catch the last
two.  Mae was busy on her presentations when I got home.  We had some dinner
and then she went back to work on the presentations.  I watched two shows on TV
and then got ready for bed.  After Mae quit on the computer, I entered this
journal entrance before we went to bed.</p>

she hadn’t been able to sleep so to let her sleep longer but no longer than
10am.  I got up at 7:15am and tried to be quiet.  Her phone and the house phone
started ringing before 8am and woke her.  Somehow, we have got to stop these
calls from coming in.  Most of them are coming from unknown sources or just advertisings. 
I called on our water softener and was given help on resetting the unit.  Mae left
at 10:30 to go shopping with Diann Graf at the PX on base.  She was busy the
rest of the day trying to get some laundry done, meals and get her presentation
ready for the Porter Reunion at Layton Park and Surf-n-Swim.  She hurried to
get dinner ready so we could eat before we left, as she would be giving her
power point presentation while the family members were eating.   When we got
there, I started setting up for Mae’s presentation, but forgot to bring the
power cords for the computer, so had to drive back home to get them.  When we
got it set up, Jerry had his sound system set up for her.  She waited until
after 6 pm to begin as not many came for the dinner, most came just for
swimming.  It went well anyway, and those who were there, enjoyed hearing the
memories of Grandpa and Grandma Porter and the pictures &amp; text in the P.P.
Presentation.  We enjoyed watching Scott’s family swim.  They had Maddi and
Jessie with them.  Gail was there with her children as she has been down all
week with doctor appointments and hair appointment and her nephew’s wedding. 
She will leave early tomorrow morning to go home to Kimberly, Idaho.  Mae &amp;
I enjoyed visiting with cousins, siblings and family while others swam.</p>

getting a beep on our phones.  There was a setting that we had not entered that
was causing it.  She went to the dry cleaners and picked up my suit.  When she
got home, we went into the Temple.  Bishop and Ravee Mullins also attended the
session.  During the session, I got drowsy and so took a mint.  Very shortly
after eating it, I started into pain in various parts of my body.  After the
Temple Session, Mae needed some things from Costco.  I let her out at the front
door and then I got gas in the car.  I was then able to find a parking spot
near the front door so parked the car and I went inside and went to a table and
waited for Mae to finish shopping.  This evening we went V.T./H.T. to Sister
Leah Neilson and to Sister Marianne Ray.  We then came home and got things

got up at 2am and got ready to go fishing with Ron Graf.  Ron was out here
before 4am.  We hooked up the boat to his truck and left shortly after.  We
went to the east dock of Strawberry Reservoir and started fishing there.  Ron
did catch two at that site, but the one was quite small so he let it loose.  We
tried to fish through the canyon, but again didn’t get anything.  We came back
to the east end and there we did get a little more action.  I did get a couple
of strikes, but lost the one just before getting to the boat.  We did have some
wind, but overall it was quite a nice day.  About 1pm we had a rain storm come
in, but it didn’t do much.  We had put on our rain gear and when it started to
sprinkle, the rain on my cap seemed to make quite a tapping noise.  At first I
thought that something was wrong with the boat.  It is amazing to me that
mechanical noises are so loud to me.  We gave up and loaded the boat.  Ron
wiped the boat down while I cleaned the fish.  Ron drove and after going through
Heber, I fell asleep.  Ron missed the turn that takes us over to Weber Canyon
and came down Parleys Canyon.  That took us a little longe, but we got home
about 5PM.   Ron helped me cover the boat and take it down to the storage.  I
showered and cleaned up before we went V.T./H.T. to Sister Shirley Lemon and to
Brother and Sister Hilton.  I was very tired when we got home so we soon went
to bed.</p>

again gave me a hearing examination.  The tests showed about the same thing as
last time but he still doesn’t know why my hearing continues to change.  He
said that he could either order hearing aids now or do more testing to try to
find out the reason why my hearing changes.  I feel like hearing aids now will
be a waste of time and money.  We forgot to get the previous testings, that I
have had done, so we will try to get those to him.  I didn’t feel good when we
got home, so I soon laid down and took a nap.  Mae prepared a nice dinner to
take down to the Hilton’s, but when we took it down, they were gone, but Mike

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
getting up, Mae cooked us a fish breakfast.  I got a call from Brother Lee
Gifford asking me if I would help him administer to Sister Lemon but then he
called back and said that her Grandson had came to give her a blessing.  Mae
and I went shopping and purchased new Led lights for our kitchen florescent
light fixture.  The new tubes didn’t solve the problem, as we also needed a new
ballast.  When I installed new tubes and the new ballast, the light shown so
much better that we decided to replace the 2<sup>nd</sup> fixture.  While out
shopping, we looked at new floor covering for the kitchen, the hallway and the
2<sup>nd</sup> bath.  This evening we finished reading the book “The Message”
by Lance Richardson.  Although we read it sometime ago, we still really enjoyed
the message.  Mae wrote up the experiences I am having with my hearing and sent
it to Dr. Howell at the Veterans Hospital in Salt Lake.  She also sent him test
records and experiences we have had with other Audiologists.  I am having quite
a lot of pain throughout my body but that is still a question as to what is
happening.</p>

getting up and having breakfast, I put a new ballast and new Led tubes in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
kitchen ceiling fixture.  That took me quite a while as my feet are hurting
this morning.  Mae also tried to get help from Best Buy with a problem we are having
with our MyCloud.  She tried for almost an hour, but she could never get them
to answer her call.  I filled water bottles and took a 2 gallon bottle over to
Jackie.  I mowed our lawn and then went in and rested most of the afternoon. I
took a nap, but woke up with my feet hurting.  This evening we attended our
Adult Session of Stake Conference.  The theme was on Missionary Work, it was a
very enjoyable meeting.  Following the meeting, I asked Bishop Mullins and
Brother Lee Gifford if they would give me a Priesthood Blessing.  I appreciated
them doing this for me.  I now pray that I can have the faith to trust in the
Lord’s will.</p>

got up shortly after 6:30 this morning so that we could be at Stake Conference
which started at 9am.  It was a very good meeting with Elder Peterson of the
70’s presiding.  I had some trouble hearing the speakers.  It was also chilly
in the Tabernacle and so I put my suit coat around Mae most of the meeting.  My
legs gave me quite a bit of pain through the meeting and after we got home, I
watched a devotional talk on the BYU channel 21, a talk by Linda Orchard, which
gave me great encouragement and hopefully courage to keep going. (<span

Mullin brought me some cream (Voltaren Gel) for me to try.  I applied it to my
right ankle, which is hurting me the most today, and it seem to have relived
some of the pain.  We started watching a movie on Netflix that wasn’t rated and
seemed to be a good movie, but after getting into it the Lord’s name was taken
a couple of times so we just shut it off.  We did watch a good movie on the
Hallmark channel.   </p>

room, so I wouldn’t wake Mae, but the alarm went off at 6:15 am and woke Mae anyway.  
(It was set for yesterday, but went off again this morning).  I read scriptures
and we ate breakfast about 9:30 pm.  Bishop came about 9:45 to check to see how
I was doing.  My feet feel quite a bit better so I wanted to get out and work
on the doors for the storage area under the trailer.  I worked from 11 am to 8
pm and only quit to come in for meals.  Mae did the laundry, cleaned the house
and organized files and papers.  I am tired.</p>

mail for the letter from Beneficial Life but it hadn’t come.  I stopped at Peterson
Medical to check on our bill with them but they couldn’t help me.  I then went
down to Good Earth and checked on our order for my cereal, but it hasn’t come
in yet.  I worked on the trailer most of the day.  Bishop Jim and Sister
Mullins stopped by and visited for a few minutes.  They sure show a lot of
concern over my health.  Brother Lee and Sister Glory Gifford came over and had
dinner with us.  Following dinner we enjoyed sitting in the front room and
visiting.  Before going to bed tonight, we had watched a show that showed a
young couple go to be together although they were not married, but just because
they decided that they were in love.  This is the “Worldly Trend” now.  Then
Mae also showed me a message on our phone that told that Joshua and his partner
were married.  I think of our children that have left the Church and I get
discouraged.  Add to that and I think of the evil that is taking place in our
government and especially in the upcoming election.  </p>

woke shortly after 4am and was quite discouraged.  Concerned that if I went
back to bed, I would wake Mae, I went into the front room.  I didn’t have my
glasses so I just guessed at the TV channels.  When I turned the TV on, the
first picture that came on was of a nude women standing up in a bath tub.  I
switched channels and got some weird show that I switched and found a Navy show
that was good.  I started work on the trailer and had just got started, when
Mae called me for breakfast.  My discouraged mood remained with me most of the
day.  I did get quite a bit done on the trailer and then about 3:30pm, we went
up to David’s and enjoyed being with his family.  Shauna is in Chicago this
week on special training.  Mae had prepared dinner and we took it up there and
cooked it while we visited with Tyler, Emily and Connor until David got home
from work.  We then ate and visited and watched some of the Olympic races on
TV.  We came home getting here about 9:30pm.  I caught my journal up before we
went to bed.</p>

worked most of the day on building doors for the cabinet over the freezer, but
when I finished I had mounted the hinges on the wrong side.  I am not sure yet
what to do, to totally restart or try to patch and salvage what I can.  Mae
spent a lot of time shopping - some for me and some trying to decide what to do
for the flooring in our house.  We were both tired so quit and watched a Dories

I got the doors, re-cut, painted and hung for the cabinet above the freezer,
even though I was interrupted twice by visitors.  Bishop Mullins and Ravee came
first and then Bishop Presnell stopped in.  They were all concerned about my
health and I appreciate then stopping by.  I was able to complete the cabinet
doors, paint them and get them hung.  They sure improve the looks of the hall
way.  Mae has invited JaNae and her children out for dinner but they were later
getting here than we expected.  I had just finished and took a shower when
JaNae and the children arrived.  They didn’t get here until 7:30PM, but Mae
still had a nice dinner ready for them.  We had a very enjoyable evening with a
good dinner. They all helped clear up the table and then we played games until 10:30PM
before they left for home.  The first game that we played was “Old Pig” which
Kennedy won and then we taught them how to play Mormon Bridge.  Although we
only played 7 rounds of Mormon Bridge, instead of the normal 10 rounds, Dawson
won that game.  As they prepared to leave, we were showered with hugs and
Kisses.  We sure went to bed feeling that the evening and time was well spent.</p>

getting up and eating breakfast, I started work on the house projects.  I spent
most of the day just designing a jig for my router to reset the lock sets in the
doors and jambs.  I should have purchased a jig set when we went to Mountain
Tool and Die in Salt Lake a couple of weeks ago.  At that time we still hadn’t
received the insurance check from Bob’s passing and were not sure whether or
not we would be getting it, and so I just bought what I needed at that time. 
After getting the jig designed and built, I set the one door and jamb and got
that door finished.  I was interrupted by a visit from Tim next door who came
and asked for some advice on finishing the window jambs in his trailer after
having new windows installed.  I showed him what he needed and I will try to
help him finish them.  He said that he would pay me to help him.  I finished up
in time for us to attend Gary Nelson and Marilyn Branham’s wedding and
reception.  We met Lois and Jerry, Margie’s sister and brother-in-law, who were
there and we enjoyed visiting with them.  I told Jerry that I had just entered
him into my journal when I was retyping my 1974 Diary.  We enjoyed visiting
with them.  They served refreshments and a light luncheon after the Wedding,
but there wasn’t much I could eat so I took Mae out to eat at the Golden
Corral.  After returning home, we watched a Humphrey Bulguart movie but it was
only an ok movie.  </p>

went in and watched The Tabernacle Choir program.  Another show came on and I
started watching it, but fell asleep.  When I woke it was time to go to
church.  Meetings were very good today and as always we enjoyed them.  Brother Fife
gave the opening prayer in Sacrament meeting and I really appreciated his
mentioning that we were thankful that for now, we still enjoy and appreciate
our Religious Freedom.  Brother Okey asked if I would be willing to pick-up the
items that will be donated to the D.I. Drive in the morning.  Of course I said
that I would, and Brother Decker volunteered to help me.  Following meetings,
we had some lunch and then I worked on my journal.  I worked on writing some of
my memories of Bob, Floyd Robert Young.  Mae spent quite a while editing my
memories.  She is sure a great help to me in helping me to get things done
right.  It was about 11PM before we got to bed.</p>

longer but she didn’t. I picked up Klaus Decker and we used my pickup to drive
around the park and we collected items set out for the Deseret Industries. 
Being that it is Monday morning, it was sometimes difficult to know what was
going to the D.I. and what was set out for the garbage.  Also, there were some
items being donated to another organization.  After canvassing our ward and
delivering what we collected to the D.I. pod at the church parking lot, I took
Klaus back to his place.  We set and talked for a while before I came home.  On
arriving home, I found that Mae hadn’t gone back to sleep, so she didn’t get
much sleep last night.  I went right to work installing the locks on the
doors.  Mae got some breakfast ready for me.  After lunch I installed more of
the trim on the skirting of the trailer house.  I need a hammer drill to
install the thresholds under the doors.  We ate some dinner and then went over
to Home Depot where I bought some plugs.  We then went to United Rental in
Clearfield, and I rented a hammer drill.  We went to the grocery store for a
few items and then went to Charles and Karen Saunders where we visited and
played games. It was a nice evening.  On the way home we stopped and filled the

When I got back, I started work on the trailer but then had to shower and get

get a lot of Sealings completed.  After returning home we had some lunch while
we watched a western movie.  Mae and I went shopping at Good Earth, Bed Bath
and Beyond and then at Costco for a few items.  Mae had put a chicken in the
oven to roast while we were gone and it turned out very good.  David M. (our
grandson) called and confirmed that they will be here tomorrow evening.  We had
planned on going to our son, David’s Thursday evening, but David called and
said that Emily has a horse riding class after school and the violin class
following that and David will be taking her to those activities, so he will
have to cancel with us on Thursday.  We will wait until Shauna gets home and

setting the other bedroom up so she could use that bed when she couldn’t sleep
and was afraid that if she came back to bed she would wake me, but Mae didn’t
like that idea.  I was going to start work on the trailer as soon as we
finished breakfast, but Mae was going to go down to Gifford’s and pick tomatoes
and berries, so I went down and helped her.  After returning home, I started on
my projects when Delaine Jackson came over and asked if I could check her hot
water heater.  Bob has gone on a fishing trip to Alaska so she is without
help.  I found that the pilot light had gone out.  I re-set it and it lit ok. 
Later we checked and the heater seems to be ok.  I again started work on the
trailer, but had interruption for lunch.  I wanted to finish installing the
thresh holds and weather stripping before David, Sierra and Henry came for
dinner.  I quit work at 4pm, put tools away and had time for a shower before
they came.  David soon went to work on our computer while Mae finished dinner
preparations.  We enjoyed a wonderful meal as always, which Mae prepared, and
then David worked more on our computer settings.   He added settings on our
phones as well and showed us how to use them.  We gave him the Dell computer
and keyboard and he showed us how to use the two monitors.  He also showed us
some more features on our phones and helped us with some of the setting on
them.  I used the two monitors just to see how they worked.  In some areas I
think it will be a good feature.  It is now 9:30pm and I think we are ready to

I mowed the lawn and then searched for the sample of the siding on our trailer
that I had taken off.  I wanted it so that I might find out how to paint the
siding.  I was unable to locate the sample.  I took the lock back to Home Depot
to have is repaired.  It took a little while, but they were able to repair the
lock.  I next went to Wallmart where I bought some sweet potatoes, a watch for
Mae and some cooked chicken for me as it was already after noon.  I next went
shopping at some Paint Stores to price paint and to see if they could tell me
how to re-paint our house and keep the same pattern as we presently have.  None
of the ones I went to could tell me how to do it.  Irven and Sandy came and
visited for a little while but mainly to pick up the Coconut Oil we had bought

like a slow motion movie mainly consisting of why I resigned and changed
employment.  When I woke, I was in a very depressed state and that feeling
remained with me most of the day.  Also when I woke, I was depressed as to how
my family has left activity in the Church.  I don’t know if the two are related
or not.  Between my employment and my family, I am very depressed.  After Mae
got our breakfast, I went outside and worked on the doors and riveted several places
on the aluminum siding.  I got a call from Brother Okey asking if I could get
together with Brother Fife and the two of us administer to Sister Diane
Millspaw.  We did that after lunch, and then I took a thumb drive containing my
Five Year Diary over to the U.P.S. store in Clinton and had them print them
off.  When they finished I went to pay them, but I had left my wallet home and
had to drive back home and back again to pay for the printing.  I stopped at
Wall Mart and purchased a binder and some index divider sheets to put my Diary
in.  I looked at some paint supplies at Home Depot before coming home.  I
finished some work on the house and put my tools away.  Mae came out and helped
me.  We ate dinner while watching the show, “The Great Escape” on TV.  I put my
Diary in the binder.  Maybe I should work on transcribing my hand written
Journals from 1975 through 2002.  That would be 27 years of journals to
transcribe.  I am not sure if that time would be of value or not.  I have found
where I have written on the computer from 2003 to 2010 but I can’t find where I
have printed those years off on a hard copy.  I will have to check on that.  We

the Sacrament.   The Sunday School class lesson was centered around Captain Moroni.
 The subject started to turn to politics so I just kept my mouth shut.  After

Ervin fell and broke her arm), then we stopped to visit Fred and Edith Amundson
(they weren’t home), then to Wendell Siglin (he wasn’t home), and finally to
Harold and Evie Hilton (neither of them are feeling well.)  We did go by
Marianne Ray’s, but she wasn’t home.  After that we drove over to visit with
Scott, Mishelle and their family.  Scott and Kylan were down to the air strip where
Kylan was flying his Drone, so we went there to watch him fly it.  He sure
enjoys his R.C. aircrafts.  We came back and visited with them and they showed

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up about 7am, but Mae didn’t get up until after 9am as she hadn’t slept
well.  I made the bed and got cold cereal and toast ready for breakfast.  After
eating, we went down to Gifford’s and picked black berries, a few tomatoes and
carrots.  I then sprayed the bushes for insects that are causing damage to
them.  I got tools ready and set up to cut the metal for the cart that will
roll under the house.  The new tools, ear muffs and face shield, that I bought
yesterday, was a great help to me.  I was tired when I quit and came in at
5PM.  After dinner, I watched some TV while Mae worked on the computer.  We
played three rounds of Rummy Cube and Mae won two rounds.  I entered this entry
before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early but then went into the front room and slept for another hour.  Mae
made a nice breakfast of pan cakes and eggs.  After breakfast, I made a trip to
Home Depot for some cinder blocks.  I used them as stands to lay the angle iron
on to construct the fame for my storage carts.  When I got the welder out, I
found that it did not have the male plug to hook into the 220 amp dryer
outlet.  I went back to Home Depot, but they didn’t have just a plug, so I went
to Whitehead Electric where I got what I wanted at a much cheaper price.  While
I was gone, Mae inventoried the food storage under the bed in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
bedroom.  That was really quite a job to do.  When I got back, Mae went
shopping for food storage supplies.  I got the first cart finished, but need to
make some modification to lower the cart so it will accommodate the standard
size plastic totes.  Other than that, I think the carts will work great.  I do
need to get a 40 amp breaker as the 30 amp breaker trips with the welder load. 
I also need to find out where Bryce buys his welding rod as I don’t have enough
to build two more carts, which I want to do.  After putting away my tools, I
came in for dinner which we ate as we watched a show on TV.  </p>
