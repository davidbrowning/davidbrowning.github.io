<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Today
being Fast Sunday we fasted before going to our meetings.  We enjoyed the
Sacrament Service and are grateful to be able to renew our covenants with our
Lord.  We enjoyed the Testimonies that were given.  Following the other classes,
I volunteered to take the Sacrament out to some of the shut-in’s within our
Ward.  They sure seem to appreciate that service.  I was accompanied by Brother
Robert Laumer and enjoyed his companionship.  This evening we got some of my
items packed into the camper so that tomorrow Ron Graf and I can leave early to
go fishing.  Mae is sure a sweetheart in helping me.  We didn’t get finished
and into bed until after 10Pm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
left home just after 5am and Ron met me at the mouth of Weber canyon.  When we
arrived at East Canyon Camp Grounds we found the camp site that we had
reserved.  We set up the camper and then found out that the rest rooms were not
open for use yet.  We were ok as we have the camper.  We went fishing and by
11:30am we both had limited out.  We came back to our campsite.  Ron went up to
the ranger gate and asked them if we could change to a site that was closer to
the restroom that is open.  They told us that it was ok, however, none of the
restroom had hot water in them yet.  We made the move anyway, but set the
camper up so we could use the restroom in it.  We next cleaned our fish at the
camper as the fish cleaning station is not open for use.  After cleaning and
filet them we seal-a-mealed and froze them.  We went back out fishing but it
was slow and we only caught two fish.  We left my boat tied to the dock for the
night.  After some dinner we were tired and soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 4am with my face being very cold.  We had left the heater off as Ron
likes to sleep with it being cool.  I realized that it was so cold that the air
going through my C-pap was almost freezing my face.  The furnace soon warmed the
camper up.  I slept for another hour before getting up.  I cooked fish, French
toast and scrambled eggs for breakfast.  Fishing was slow this morning and at
noon we went back to camp and got some lunch, packed up the camper and moved it
from the campsite.  We ate some lunch, then went back out and fished until
almost 4pm before we limited.  We cleaned the fish and then came home.  We
decided not to fill the gas on the boat and trucks before we came home.  Ron
took the boat with him and will bring it back tomorrow.  When I got home I was
tired and so Mae helped me unpack.  I seal-a-mealed the fish and put them in
the freezer.  We ate some dinner while we watched a pretty good show on
Netflix, before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was sure good to sleep in my bed and be home.  I got up at 7am and helped Mae
get breakfast.  I sure do love my wife.  This morning after a nice breakfast I
started the water on the lawns.  Ron came to bring my boat back.  We cleaned
the boat and got the camper about ready to unload.  Mae went to Dinosaur Park
with Kaitlyn and Kaden.  Ron and I finished cleaning the boat and put it away
before Ron went home.  I started working on the camper when I got a call from Coventry
Insurance to set up a date and time that they could have a nurse come to our
home to give us our annual checkup.  I had to come into the house to get the
day planner.  After making that appointment I tried to find out a question
about our Medicare Insurance but was put on hold for 45 minutes before they called
back.  While waiting for that, I caught up my journal and ate some lunch.  When
they called back they really couldn’t answer my question.  I took a nap and
finished my journal before working on my camper trying to find out an
electrical problem.  After Mae came home from Dinosaur Park, I went down to Marianne’s
to check out her sprinkler system.  I found out a couple of problems, but need
her to check with the previous owner as to where the other two control valves
are located.  I have still got to figure out her timer.  Scott, Mishelle and
their family came over for dinner this evening.  After dinner Kaden &amp; Kaden
watched cartoons on the TV, Scott took a nap, Ashley did home work, while
Kylan, Mishelle, Mae and I played two games of Marbles.  Kylan and I won the
first game, with Mae and Mishelle winning the second game.  It is after 10pm so
time to go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked on the camper and found the problem with the brake lights. Mae and I
mowed and trimmed the yard.  This afternoon we went down to Gifford’s and did
some weeding and watering.  I took Mae to choir practice and then I went after
some parts.  Mae called me and said that only three showed up so they visited
for a few minutes and then one of them brought her back home.  Mae is going to
spend the night with Sister Karen Wheeler as she is afraid to stay alone at
night and her mother is in the hospital.  I watched a show on TV before going
to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
came home shortly after I got up.  I had read the Priesthood lesson before she
got here.  We talked about it and that brought up the financial concerns.  Mae
cooked us fish and eggs for breakfast.  I worked on the camper in the morning. 
Bob called and wanted to go to Dr. Toone and so I called and got him an
appointment.  I took him to Bountiful and let him out at Dr. Toone’s, before I
went on to Costco where I bought gas for the car and a few groceries.  I went
back and picked up Bob, taking him back to the retirement home.  I then went to
Durk’s where I checked with Chris about the cost of a 200 gallon water storage
tank.  When I got home I changed clothes and went to Sister Jeneane Browning
where Brother Fred Amundson and I gave Sister Browning a Blessing.  Mae and I
then went to Sister Tammy Reuzi’s Viewing.  On the way home we stopped at the
store for a few groceries.  This evening we watched a good movie before going
to bed.</p>

and Gary took Mae and I out for breakfast at the Star Café in Clearfield, for
breakfast.  Sandi and Shellie also gave Mae a hanging planter for Mother’s Day. 
We enjoyed a nice breakfast at their treat in honor of Mothers Day.  We
returned about noon.  We packed a few items and drove up to Logan where we had lunch
at David and Sierra’s.  They had Paige &amp; Garrett, Mike, Becky, Maddy and
Jessie, plus Garrett’s parents there for lunch.  From there we all went up to
Utah State University and attended graduation exercises for Paige
Kirschbaum’s.  Mae and I left before the graduation ceremony was finished
giving out diplomas, as Paige had already received hers.  We were concerned at
the long walk back to our car, as Mae’s shoes were really uncomfortable and had
hurt her on the long walk to the stadium, but as we started to walk, a shuttle bus
driver asked us if he could give us a ride to our car.  He had one other
elderly couple that was also on the shuttle bus.  He let us right off at our
car.  We were sure happy for that service.  From there we went to Irven and
Sandy’s where they had dinner ready for us.  It has been quite a day of meals
that we didn’t have to prepare.  Andrea also came to spend the night with
them.  Irven and I discussed a water storage system for them.  Irven is excited
about trying to start a company of installing water systems for people.  I told
him that I wasn’t interested in doing that, but would help him.  The five of us
played some games before going to bed.</p>

prepared breakfast for us this morning.  Mae and I then came back home to get
ready to attend our ward meeting schedule.  Scott and his family came before
meetings, to wish Mae a Happy Mother’s Day.   Mishelle also wants me to remove
the hood above the stove so she can refinish it, as their Mother’s Day gift for
Mae.  Mishelle also gave Mae some earrings that she made, and they gave her a
nice card.  After meetings, I prepared lunch for Mae.  Marianne brought Mae a
Mother’s Day Gift of several items that she had at her home.  One was a set of
Ozzie and Harriet on DVD and then a bear that is holding salt and pepper
shakers.  We will put that in our camper.   David and his family came to wish
Mae a happy Mother’s Day.  Mae and I watched three shows of Ozzie and Harriet
before going to sleep.</p>

let me sleep in until almost 8 this morning.  I read the Priesthood lesson and
became very depressed as I think of my family, most of them not having a
testimony of the Gospel.  The gospel means so much to Mae &amp; I and we know
it is true.  After breakfast and my shower, I started working on a broken
sprinkler pipe in the front yard and on our camper.  I took Lee Gifford’s trash
out to the curb.  On the way home I stopped and borrowed a ladder from Darrel
Wayment.  I got the broken pipe fixed, but am having trouble with the camper. 
This evening we went over to Caroline and Charles Saunders where we played a
game of Hand and Foot.  Charles and I won tonight.  It was a good evening.  We
are late getting to bed.</p>

were up and started the day ok, but we spent most of the day doing gardening at
our place and Gifford’s.  I worked some on the camper, but am still stumped
with the wiring.  It may be in the plug that hooks the camper to the pickup
power.  Scott came over, after he got off work, to get the stove hood. 
Mishelle &amp; Scott want to clean it up and paint it.  This will be their
Mother’s Day gift to Mae.  This evening Mae and I went visiting to Sister
Neilson and Sister Ray.  We enjoyed the visit with Sister Neilson as she is
such a special person. It’s not quite 9:30PM but I think we will soon be going
to bed.  I’m tired tonight.</p>

got up this morning and went to the VA Medical center in Ogden where they drew
blood and took a urine sample in preparation for my physical on the 24<sup>th</sup>. 
We came back home and had breakfast as I had to go fasting.  I worked on the
camper for some time and finally took it over to the shop to have them find out
what is wrong with the electrical.  I did lay down in the recliner and took a
nap.   I then went to work on our garden boxes.  I went to Durk’s for parts and
then to Home Depot for other materials.  Mae has been working on packing so
that we could leave for American Falls at 7am tomorrow.  We went Home &amp;
Visiting Teaching to Sister Lemon.  From there we went to the Hilton’s but they
were not home.  We stopped at Siglin’s, and though Brother Siglin wasn’t home
we visited a few minutes with his wife.  When we came home, I worked on the
watering system until after 10PM.  Mae has been busy packing all day so that we
could leave for Jeff and Gail’s at 7am in the morning, however, Jeff called and
they are afraid that Gail is getting whatever Jeff has had for a couple of
days.  Jeff is feeling much better but Gail is sick so they didn’t want to take
the chance of us getting it.  We will call at 6am in the morning.  It is now 11
pm and we are just going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night, but I slept ok and was up before 6am.  We
called Jeff and Gail and decided that we would go.  It was 7:55am when we left
home.  We stopped for gas and then drove straight thru, only making one
bathroom stop.  We arrived at the school in plenty of time for Grand Parents
Day and were able to make connections with both Rachel and Ben so that the four
of us ate lunch together.  We got to go to Rachel’s class room and see their
work there.  Then we went Ben’s class room where they had several short plays
concerning various historical events during the settlement of our country.  I
didn’t get very much out of that as the children read their parts, which
covered their mouths so I could not see their lips plus children are hard for
me to hear their speech anyway.  Gail had brought Matt and joined us after
lunch.  Mae went with Gail and Matt to a dairy farm, for Matt’s field trip, so
I came on to Jeff and Gail’s home where I brought most of our things in and
then took a nap.  Later we played some games with the children, but their
chattering soon got to me, so I came downstairs and worked on the computer.  When
Jeff came home from work, he started cooking chicken on their outside grill.  I
went out and helped him and it gave us a chance to visit.  He told me of a new
system of building things through a system much like Ink Jet Printing, except
this is using various kinds of materials from plastic to metals.  The design is
done through Auto Cad Design and then fed the design into this equipment which
builds the unit.  He is looking into this system for Chobani, as it will save
their company millions of dollars in inventory.  We also talked about the new technology
in the new electric automobiles that are now on the market.   It was very
interesting to hear of the great and new technology that is changing our
environment as well as the future.  As I see it, the only thing that can stop
the increase of knowledge is the great increase of human sin.  Dinner turned
out very well.  Jeff has an electronic food thermometer he uses, that is very
accurate as to the cooking temperature of the foods, thus giving greater
determination as to when the food is done.  This evening Gail had some ladies
over for a Book Club.  While they we meeting, Jeff and I played a few hands of
Rook and when we quit, Jeff had won.  We soon called it a day and all went to
bed.</p>

Mae and I slept well last night, not getting up until just before Ben and Rachel
left for school.  We took showers and had some breakfast with Matt as Gail went
to the gym and ran some other errands.  After getting some breakfast Mae spent
time with Matt until she got him off to kindergarten.  This afternoon I did
some work on Gail’s garden trying to figure out a watering system for her. 
This evening after Jeff got home from work; we went down to the river with the
kayaks and enjoyed a couple of hours there.  Jeff still isn’t feeling the best
so he didn’t get wet.  It was after 8PM when we got home.  After getting the children
down to bed, Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played the first round of Hand and Foot before
going to bed.</p>

slept in until 7AM and both Mae and I slept ok.  Jeff left with several other
men, and they went bike riding (motor cycles) until about 1PM.   Gail had made
muffins for breakfast, so Mae and I cooked bacon and scrambled eggs to go with
that.  I did some figuring on the irrigation setup for Gail’s garden.  I then
went to the store and purchased some materials.  From there I went to the store
and purchased some filtered water.  Gail had jugs for 18 gallons and I bought
an extra 2 gallons container and filled it with water for Jackie, who lives
across the street from us.  Shortly after I got home Gail took Matt and Rachel
to a Birthday Party.  Jeff had us watch the movie “Caption American” which was
an OK movie.  We had planned on going back to the river but the weather has
turned off cloudy, windy and a little cold.  Jeff really sounds like he is
really getting a bad cold and Mae has suggested that he might see a Doctor, but
he won’t.  I really hope that neither Mae nor I get it.  This evening we, after
the children went to bed, watched “The Iron Man” witch was interesting but I
really don’t care for these shows that are so far out of reality.  I sure love
being with Mae and appreciate her love for me.</p>

woke about 7AM and I have enjoyed reading the scriptures but it is now almost
9AM and I will have to hurry to be ready for meetings.  Mae was making Lasagna
for dinner so I helped her with it.  We drove our car to meetings.  The
meetings went well, however, I forgot my glasses and so after Sacrament meeting
I hurried back to Jeff and Gail’s and got them.  As I came out of their
subdivision and turned onto the main road, I suddenly noticed a motorcycle very
close to me.  That worried me, wondering if I just hadn’t noticed it when I
turned through the intersection.  I got back to the chapel in time for most of
Sunday school.  We had a nice dinner after getting back home.  The evening went
fast and it was soon time for the children to go to bed.  Jeff, Gail, Mae and I
continued our game of Hand and Foot.  Although, Mae and I did better, we still couldn’t
make up for the bad hand we played last night and we lost the game.</p>

mowed the lawn for Jeff.  I was quite impressed with their lawnmower, but it is
the only one for their large lawn.  This afternoon I worked on getting the
watering set up for Gail’s garden.  Jeff talked to a lady that does landscaping
and it looks like Jeff is going to spend quite a lot of money changing his
watering system.  Mae held Family Home Evening with the children before Jeff
got home from work, while Gail &amp; I worked on the garden watering system.  I
sure wish there was some way I could talk to Jeff about the Gospel.  I was sure
tired this evening and was ready for bed.</p>

but we made it upstairs in time to tell Ben and Rachel good bye.  After
breakfast, we got the car packed and left for home by 10am.  We were home by
1pm and got the car unpacked and things put away.  I started on our garden
boxes and got a water system installed before it got dark, anyway close enough
that I just had to use lighting to finish an electrical connection.  I called
Jeff and suggested that I come back up and bring the equipment to install
Bubblers around his trees.  I called Jeff with my suggestion and after he had
time to think about it, he decided not to do it at this time.  We had a light
late supper, and then I caught my journal entries up before we went to bed.</p>

were late getting up so I prepared breakfast of French toast and eggs.  We had
just finished when Woody from Darren Badeaux RV called and told me that my
camper was fixed.  We went over to get it and the price simply floored me.  It
upset Mae also.  Parts were about $19.00 but the labor was over $350.  That put
me in a depression most of the day.  Mae went with me this afternoon to run a
few errands.  I was upset over the traffic backup caused by some highway work,
feeling that UDOT should try to arrange better traffic control.  Then I tried
to get the Propane tank on the RV filled and they told me that that tank can no
longer be filled.  We then went to Jerry’s Nursery and that took some time
trying to find it.  All in all I don’t think Mae enjoyed being with me.  When
we got home I went down to Gifford’s and planted 6 pepper plants and weeded and
cut runners out of the strawberries.  This evening I worked on the sprinkler system
for our yard getting it adjusted a little better.  It was late when we quit and
came in.  After some dinner we watched a show on Netflix before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up about 7am but then went back to bed with my sweetheart.  I am sure
thankful that I have her, as I don’t know how anyone can make it in this life
without a wonderful companion like I have.  I sure have to thank my Heavenly
Father often for the wife he blessed me with and for the Eternal goals that we
have.  After showering and shaving, I prepared breakfast again of French toast
and eggs (same as yesterday because Mae requested it) while Mae planted some
flowers that were given to her yesterday by Chris Castilo, who lives across the
street.  Chris also wanted some rocks removed so she could plant some
tomatoes.  After breakfast, I made some calls and found Avus RV will check my
Propane tanks for they think they are ok to refill.  I took the tank down to
them and Justin, the mechanic  there, who is State Certified, checked the tank
and said the that they were ok to refill until December 31<sup>st</sup> of this
year and then the tank will require recertification.  That will entail removing
any rusted areas, checking the welds and repainting the tank and then it will
be ok for another 5 years.  It cost me $10.00 for the fuel and it was filled. 
Mae went grocery shopping, and I started preparing working on the yard when
Bishop Mullin’s stopped by to talk to me about some problems he would like Mae
and my help with.  I did get some rocks removed for Chris and used them in a
area in our back yard.  I came in the house as Mae left for choir practice. 
Mae had my dinner ready for me and I turned a show on TV and watched it while I
ate.  Mae and I watched another one on Netflix when she got home.  I entered
this entry before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at a decent time, but we were late getting breakfast.  Just as our food
was cooked, Bishop Mullins came to talk to us about rescheduling our camping
trip, due to the prediction of cold and rainy weather.  We rescheduled it for
June 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>.  After breakfast, I
wrote a letter to Kevis, although we don’t know his address yet.  Mae then
wanted me to reseed some areas of grass.  I hope it grows, because I lost my
cool with Mae and hurt her feelings.  I finished getting the camper ready for
use, then we took it down to the storage lot.  This evening we went Visiting
and Home Teaching to the Patterson’s.  We then went over to Clearfield to visit
Sister Evelyn Hilton at the Rocky Mountain Rehabilitation Center.  It was right
across the street from Chandler Garden’s where Bob is at and so while there we
visited Bob.  He seems to be doing well.  We got interested in a BYU vs SCU
baseball game and stayed and watched it.  In the opening of the 9<sup>th</sup>
inning SCU 8 and BYU 6, BYU made 3 rums winning the game.  We were glad that we
had stayed and enjoyed the game.  It is almost 11PM so good night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
rained quite hard during the night and early morning.  We slept in until after
8am.  I didn’t get much accomplished until almost noon and then I started
working on our food storage under the east deck.  That was quite a job but I
got the inventory of what we have stored there finished.  I was excited to find
the almonds under there.  We had 75lb of almonds that I thought we had lost
when we moved from Clinton.  This evening we visited Harold Hilton at his home. 
Evie had told us of how he had a seizer when he came over to see her the other
day and we expected to see him quite scrapped and bruised, but he looked good
and is doing fine today.  We attended a Wedding Reception of Rodney and JoLynn
Stevenson’s daughter Rachel to Joseph Limb.  It was good to again see Rodney
and JoLynn as well as their family.  Their children have sure grown up since we
have moved from Layton.  It was also good to see and visit with several friends
that we knew from the Country Creek Ward that.  From there we went over to Evie
and took her some flowers.  She also asked me to give her a Priesthood
Blessing, which I felt privileged to do.  After returning home, we watched a
show on TV that depicted some of the history of Colorado from its origin until
present, and it left you with a sick feeling to think where Colorado, as well
as our nation, is now.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning.  I prepared breakfast while Mae did her hair.  I also
caught my journal up to date and worked on my Diary.  Meetings went well and
following our meetings we went up to David and Shauna’s for dinner.  That was
very enjoyable and dinner was great.  David and I got talking about the farm in
Grantsville and before long David started criticizing the Church, and of course
that riled me until we just had to quit and drop the subject.  Mae was trying
to talk to Shauna and we were so loud, it upset her and she could hardly talk
to Shauna.  She told Shauna she wished David &amp; I wouldn’t get talking about
the church.  After dinner David, Shanna, Emily, Mae and I drove over to see the
lot that they are trying to purchase in Ogden Valley.  It is a beautiful
building lot.  I hope that it all works out for them.  We got home after 9PM.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
rained hard during the night and so we slept in this morning.  I did some
cutting of material for the door frames that will give us access under the
mobile home.  Mae decided to clean the bed spread quilt today so we took it off
and I took Mae to the Laundromat.  While she was washing the quilt, I went to
Home Depot and got the materials for the stand for a 200 gallon water barrel for
Irven and Sandy, plus a little more materials for our house.  When we got home,
there was some of the quilt that wasn’t quite dry and so we moved chairs into
the front room and laid the quilt over them to let it finish drying over
night.  We watched a show on TV while eating dinner but it was longer than we
expected, plus it didn’t end, as it is one of these series they now have on
TV.  We won’t watch it again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
had to be up early as I have an appointment at the V.A. with my primary
Doctor.  It was a complete physical.  We were very pleased with my primary
doctor selection.  It will be almost a month but then I will go to the V.A. in
Salt Lake with an Audiologist to see about my hearing.  Irven and Sandy had called,
just before we left for my appointment, and want some things from Costco, so we
stopped there on the way home.  Scott brought the kitchen range hood that they
have repainted for Mae over, and so I spent the afternoon reinstalling it.  Mae
is sure pleased with it and it looks so much better than before.  After dinner
I did the dishes and cleaned up the kitchen while Mae went over to visit Sister
Darma Cosper.  Darma’s sister Jeneane Browning is now under Hospice care and
isn’t expected to live much longer.  This is really hard on her as Jimmy, her
husband, passed away on December 24<sup>th</sup>, then about a month later her
older Sister died and now her youngest sister will be leaving her and they have
been really close.  Jeanenne lives here in the park also.  I also played a game
of Harts and won that game.  I am winning quite a few games, due to the game
that I play.  The Jack of Diemen’s is worth +10 points and I am capturing it
often.  I looked for a Medical Alert necklace but quit as they want $40 for
one.  I will look into this more before ordering.  It is now 10:30pm so we had
better get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up this morning and got ready to go with Bishop and Sister Mullin to the
Payson Temple.  Mae had started breakfast while I showered and dressed, and
then I finished breakfast while she got ready.  Bishop and Ravee came just a
few minutes after 9am.  Riding in the car in the back seat I could hear very
little of the conversation as we drove.  We got to the Payson Temple just after
11am so went on the 11:30am session.  Mae and I were asked to be the company
witnesses so that was special.  The Temple is very beautiful and we enjoyed
attending the session.  On the way home, we stopped at the Sizzler in Bountiful
and had lunch.  Shortly after leaving the Temple, Bishop got a call informing
him that Jeneane Browning, of our ward, passed away this morning.  That is
really a blessing as she has been sick for some time.  After getting home, Mae
and I went over to Sister Darma Cooper to visit her as she was Jeneane
Browning’s older sister.  We then walked over to Tim and Charlene Smith’s down
east of us and visited with Tim for a few minutes.  Charlene was not there
today.  This evening Mae and I played three games of Rummikub before going to
bed and I won 2 out of 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
cooked fish and eggs this morning, and while I got breakfast Mae vacuumed the
car.  While Mae got ready to go to the Ogden Temple, I took the car over and
got it washed.  We went over to the church house and Kerry Shaw soon joined
us.  Tom and Sheila Harper also met us in the Chapel.  I set with Tom in the
back where they had a screen set up for him in American Sign.  It is really
amazing to watch Tom respond when you realize the effort it is for him being
deaf and dumb.  Then when we were ready for the Prayer Circle, Sheila was going
to come back to sign for Tom, but when Tom saw Sheila start to move her
wheel-chair, he got up and went to the front and the two of them participated
in the prayer circle.  Mae and I also went up and I had trouble controlling my
emotions to see Sheila sign for Tom.  Following the session, I asked Sheila if
they were going to join us for lunch but Sheila declined saying “There was too
much month left and not enough money.  I had to admit that is a problem with
many of us.  I wanted to just invite them and I would pay for it, but I
hesitated too long and we really don’t have the money to pay for them.  Kerry,
Mae and I ate lunch in the cafeteria, although Mae and I just had a salad
today.  This evening Mae and I went over to Georgia and Rick’s where we got the
flowers for Memorial Day.  We then went to the Layton High School Auditorium to
see the Legacy Junior High choir perform.  Ashley participated in the program. 
I was amazed at the number of students that participated and the full house
that was there to support them.  It was a very good program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Irven
and Sandy came at 7:55am, just as we were getting up.  We had picked up some
items at Costco. for them.  Mae made a wonderful breakfast of hot cakes &amp;
eggs.  I started working on Irven and Sandy’s water storage, but decided to
modify my table saw so that I can plug in my vacuum into it, so that when I
start the saw, the vacuum will also start.  That turned into more of a job than
I had anticipated.  Mae and I took time to go to the Gifford’s and work on the
gardens and spray the fruit trees.  We also had a company come and power wash
our house for us.  It needed it but we are sure short on cash.  I got the
electrical changes made to the saw and then put up my tools for the day.  After
some dinner, I finished putting up the materials and locked my tool trailer.  This
evening we watched a show on Net Flex before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was after 8am when I got up and Mae was up a little before that.  After
breakfast I got a few things ready to take to Morgan as we go up there for
Memorial Day.  I then went down to the storage lot and put the camper jacks
down so it will take the weight off the truck.  We don’t want to take it off
the truck as on the 6<sup>th</sup> of June we are going to go with Bishop and
Ravee camping for three days.  We then attended the Viewing and Funeral service
for Jeneane Browning.  It was a very appropriate service and there were a lot
of family in attendance.  We came home from the services and got things ready
to go to the Morgan Cemetery to decorate Mae’s families’ graves.  Sandi met us
at our place, where she left her car and she road up with us.  We had several
of our family members along with several of Mae’s siblings and their families
also came.  Georgia and Rick were not there as they are on vacation to Europe
and none of their family came either.  It was good to have Terry, Angila and
some of their family with us.  We met back at the Morgan City park where we ate
together and then joined in various activities.  It was late when we got home
and to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in until almost 8am.  It was a relaxed morning with a light breakfast. 
We both did some scripture studding this morning as well as reading the first
chapter of “Following Christ”.  That will be the subject that Bishop Mullins
will be using for his combined Priesthood and Relief Society lesson today.  We
enjoyed all of our meetings today.  This evening the Graf’s invited us over for
dinner.  They served a very nice dinner.  Following dinner Ron, Dianne, Loran
(their niece), Mae and I played some games.  It was an enjoyable evening and we
got home about 9PM.  I entered this journal entry before going to bed.</p>

spent most of the day working on the door jams that will go to the three
entrances underneath the house.  This evening we invited Tim Grogan, next door,
to have dinner with us.  We then went to visit Evie Hilton and then over to
visit Bob.  It was 9pm when we got to Bob’s but he wanted us to stay and watch
a movie with him.  We didn’t, as we were both tired.  When we got home we soon
went to bed.</p>

woke early and Mae didn’t sleep very well last night.  About 7am Mae laid back
down and I let her sleep until 8am when I got breakfast for us.  We had a good
turnout for the Temple this morning.  The Baptismal workers couldn’t have been
more pleasant and made the time there so enjoyable.  After getting home and
eating, Mae put up her hair while I took a nap.  This afternoon we went to
Jerry’s Nursery and bought some Banana Squash and Cucumbers plants and came
home and got them planted.  We went down to Gifford’s and worked in the garden
there.  Bishop and Brother Presnell came by to see if I could check the
electrical out on Marianne Ray’s car.  I told them that I could check out part
of it but could not promise that I could find the problem.  Bishop will come by
when he can tomorrow and I will go down with him and we will do what we can.  I
made Almond Butter this evening.  Mae got our food inventory under the East
patio entered into our computer.  That will help us know what we have and where
to find it.  I made up some Crunchy Almond Butter and also typed up the recipe
of the way I made it.  It was much easier than using the Vitamix to grind it,
also less messy.  I also called and talked to Barbie about Roy coming up this
summer for a couple of weeks.  It is now 10:45pm so we will call it a day.</p>
