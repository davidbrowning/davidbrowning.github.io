<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up by 5
AM so I could read my scriptures and be ready to go to work early.  Bob
prepared biscuits and gravy for breakfast this morning.  Bob, Bruce and I
started removing shingles by 7 AM.  Bob was soon very tired so I had him quite
and get down.  When we got the one side cleaned off, I started laying new
shingles while Bruce kept removing the old shingles from the other side.  I
took a short nap after we had lunch.  About 5 PM we quite again and I took a
short nap.  We worked a little longer until Micheline had dinner ready.  After
eating I again laid shingles until dark.  I went downstairs at 9:30 PM and
wrote my journal entry before showering.  When I got out of the shower I found
that Mae had sent me her garments by mistake.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up until 5 AM again this morning.  Both Bob and I slept in recliners last night
as we didn’t sleep to good the night before.  My stomach was bothering me when
we went to bed last night.  Bob tried to help us again today but he only lasted
for a few minutes.  I had him get down as I was worried about his health.  I
finished shingling the back side as Bruce worked on stripping the front.  We
had to strip the front right to the sheathing as that side was completely
deteriorated.  I again took a nap after lunch.  We worked until almost 5 PM
when we got down and I took another short nap.  We worked a while longer and
then ate dinner and worked until dark.  It really helped me when Bruce was able
to keep me supplied with shingles.  After stopping for the day, Bruce,
Micheline and I visited for a while and ate watermelon.  Mae called and we visited
for a few minutes.  She had attended her aunt Merlynn’s funeral today.  Mark
had came up to get Bob and Mae sent me up some garments with him.  Mark and Bob
went up to Victor to attend a school reunion.  I was very tired tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got an
early start on the roof but soon found that we were out of shingles.  I called
Mae and had her go to Roofer Supply in Ogden and get me another square of
shingles and a package of Ridge and Hip shingles.  I had thought that 2
packages of shingles would do it, but as I made the order I asked for a full
square.  I was sure glad I did because we only had 3 shingles left when we
finished.  From Bruce’s measurements I had figured it would take a total of 11
square but I was closer to 13 square.  I am not sure whose fault it was on the
figuring but I am sure glad Mae was able to bring the other up to us. 
Micheline had lunch ready when we finished the roof.  I repaired some of the
Sufis on the back eves before quitting.   It was 3 PM when I headed for home. 
I had to stop in Logan and get natural gas for the pickup.  Regular gas is too
expensive when I can use natural gas.  It was good to get home.  We ordered
Chinese food to be delivered and we relaxed and watched a couple of shows on
TV.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7 AM and so had to hurry a little to get to Church on time.  I had filled
out our donation slip and in the hurry had made an error.  Bother Rogers called
to see what I wanted to do with the $30 extra so we put it into Humanitarian
Aid for the hurricane relief.  We had enough Chinese food left over that we
were able to have it this evening.  Bob came home after he returned and told me
of the experience he had with Mark’s driving.  It was really quite funny as I
had just told Mae that I was glad that I didn’t go with them as I was sure Bob
would be upset with Mark and his driving.  It has sure been nice to relax
today.  We started to bed fairly but then we rubbed each others feet and talked
for a while.  It was almost 11 PM when we went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM and started getting ready to have our family come.  I cooked us an egg
omelet for breakfast.  Both Mae and I worked all day getting ready for our
family to come.  I burned all the branches that were left out back and got a
nice fire pit ready to use to Dutch oven chicken and vegetables.  I had mowed part
of the back yard before starting the fire.  Bob came out and finished mowing
the back lawn.  About noon I put three Dutch Ovens on to cook.  We had corn on
the cob.  Sandi came and got a peach cobbler ready to cook.  By 2:30 PM most of
our family had arrived and we started to eat.  We had plenty for everyone.  We
had Bob, Carroll and Mark come and eat with us.  Nick didn’t come with Sandi as
he was working but he came later.  Jeff and Gail came late as they were with
Gail’s family this morning.  With the exception of Shellie’s family we had all
of our family here.  After eating we visited and played games.  Some of us
played Horse Shoes, some played Frisbee and others played volleyball.  I guess
it was around 6 PM when all of them had left and then Mae and I had some
cleanup to do.  We were sure tired when we finished.  We rubbed each others
feet.  I fell asleep in the chair for a while.  We took hot bath to relieve
some of the back pain and applied Thera-gesic.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We have
decided to send Roger Sylvia the $300 dollars that he feels he needs.  This is
to be a loan, we will see.  We received a letter from Loreta P. Emdrina from
the Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch.  We think she might be the President of the
Primary.  She has a sad story and would like financial aid.  There are so many
and how or who do you help?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae let me
sleep in until almost 8 AM and then we spent some time together.  Bob had
cooked some extra sausage so sent some down for us.  After breakfast I put the
tools away that I had taken to do Bruce’s roof.  Mae made a lunch and we drove
up to the Uinta’s to look at some property.  Before we left Roy we stopped and
sent a Western Union money transfer to Roger Sylvia in the Philippines.  We
stopped in Evanston to get natural gas and found that they had moved the pump
location to Quest Star yard.  The lady that was at the office, let me fill up
there.  We checked at the Bear River Lodge but Adam Pulley wasn’t there.  We
went to the lots and hiked up through them.  We got to far west and went on
some other property.  We will have to check on some things with the county and
state before making any decision.  We started reading the book “Natural Cures They
Don’t Want You to Know About” by Kevin Trudeau.  It gives you quite a bit to
think about.  Mae warmed up some dinner after we got back home.  We watched a
DVD “For Ever”.  I had to make my journal entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, September 07, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After getting
up and getting ready for the day, I prepared breakfast of French toast and
eggs.  I then spent the morning working on David’s garage plans.  This
afternoon I got materials priced out on the plans.  BMC told me that the bid
would only be good until Friday as they are having material prices jump up so
often.  I got the lock changed on my pickup cab back door but it doesn’t work
much better that the old one.  Mae and I went to the Ogden Temple this
evening.  After getting home we watched TV for a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, September 08, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I cooked
breakfast of pork chops and fried potatoes.  I worked most of the day on
David’s plans.  Mae took Georgia out to dinner as it is Georgia’s Birthday
today.  David stopped by to look at the plans and the pricing.  He said that
they decided to wait for a few months before doing the job.  Mae and I watched
a show on the Hallmark channel this evening.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, September 09, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I spent all
morning finishing up David’s plans.  Mae was busy with the house.  Mae left
about 11 AM to run some errorns and then to take Kylan and Ashley to Dinosaur
World.  I worked on the front sprinkler system all afternoon and was unable to
get it repaired.  I finally told Bob to get a new valve and I would install it
tomorrow.  We went to a dance with Georgia and Rick.  It was put on by the
three Kaysville Stakes.  They had a band called “Phat Daddy” and they were fair
but too loud.  Bishop Kent and Darla Rampton came mainly to visit with us.  We
visited with Rick and Georgia when we went back to their place so it was 11:58
PM when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, September 10, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Irven woke us
at 8 AM asking if they could bring their things snowy equipment over today.  At
first I said yes but then I called and ask them if I could have a week to get
ready.  I spent the rest of the day working on the sprinkler system.  I
replaced the one valve, changed the one sprinkler head to another line and
replaced the electrical line to the one timer.  I think it should work ok now. 
Jeff called and said that they were at a fund raiser for the hurricane victims
and there was a motor scoter for sale for $200 and wanted to know if I would
like to buy it.  I told him to check it out and if it looked good get it.  He
did and now he is enjoying riding it.   Mae has been busy all day cleaning
house.  She prepared for Smoky &amp; Sylvia Barns to come for dinner at 5 PM
but they didn’t show up.  Mae called and left a message for them but when they
didn’t reply she called Irven and Sandy who wasn’t home.  She then called Scott
&amp; Mishelle but they had other commitments.  She called Bob and Carroll but
they had just eaten.  Irven, Sandi and Mark came over to bring some storage so
we had just invited them when Sylvia called.  We had to excuse our self with
Irven and Sandy and we did have Smoky and Sylvia come.  It was a bad start but
ended up having a good evening.  After eating we played a game of marbles and a
game of knock.  They went home about 10:30 PM.  We soon went to bed as I have a
Stake Priesthood meeting in the morning at 7 AM.  Good night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 AM and prepared to attend Stake General Priesthood meeting.  Bob and Mark
were also ready and we arrived there just before 7 AM.  It was a very good
meeting and I enjoyed the Spirit that was there.  The meeting was well attended.
It was quite chilly this morning and you can feel Fall coming.  Mae had
breakfast ready when I returned home.  We then attended the regular Sunday
Meetings.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner after meetings so I ate little
as we had invited Jeff, Gail and Marcie for dinner at 5 PM.  I took a nap
later.  Shortly before 5 PM Jeff called and said that they were trying to get
Gail into a Doctor as she is in quite a bit of pain.  They weren’t able to come
to dinner.  We put things up and warmed up some stew.  David invited us to come
up this evening so we went up and played games and visited.  We got home at
9:30 PM and called Jeff.  They were just leaving the hospital.  Gail has a
tubular pregnancy and she will have to go into the Dr. tomorrow and have it
checked and probably aborted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and after using the bathroom and reading my scriptures I went back to bed for a
while.  It was 9 AM before we ate breakfast.  I took bob with me and we went
looking for tool boxes &amp; shelving for my trailer.  I bought a small bench
press that was on sale and then it had another $5.00 off as the box had been
destroyed.  I got home about 4:30 PM and helped Mae get dinner ready.  Melia
(Terry &amp; Angela’s daughter), Troy, Weston and Mckayla came over for dinner
and Family Home Evening.  We had a wonderful evening, with then leaving after
8:30 PM.  We tried to reach Jeff and Gail to see what the results were.  Jeff
said the Doctor wants her to come back tomorrow.  Jeff has been riding the motor
scoter; he bought for me and said it needs a tune up.  I told him to have it
done.  We started for bed at 10 PM but then we remembered that we hadn’t call
David to wish him a happy Birthday so we did that.  Then Bryce called to return
my call from this morning.  I asked him if I could come down tomorrow and
borrow his welder to work on my trailer.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, September 13, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
until 8 AM so that put me late getting to Bryce’s and going there always takes
longer than planned.  I worked on our bank statement until after 2 PM.  Bob and
I went over to Ogden and checked with a couple of places for shelving but
didn’t find anything.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home and then Bob and I
went Home Teaching.  We visited the Jackson’s but Darren wasn’t home.  The
Mitchell’s left a note on their front door telling us they would have to
reschedule for next week.  I tried to find something on TV but there wasn’t
much so I shut it off.  I started writing on some of my personal history and
wrote for over 1 ½ hours.  Boy there is a lot to remember and write down and
the more I write the more I remember.  I quite at 10:45 PM and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 but let Mae sleep until almost 8 AM as she hadn’t slept very well last
night.  Bob and I went to Salt Lake looking at shelving for my trailer.  We
were able to find some that I bought that was about 1/3 off any thing else we
have looked at and much better quality.  We stopped at Wholesale Electric and
bought some parts and then went over to Home Depot and bought some more
material.  After getting home and eating I took a nap and then we started
installing the electrical into the trailer.  Mae has been sorting through the
storage items and preparing for dinner this evening as she has invited Irven,
Sandy, Brice, Deanna and Bob for dinner.  We had a very enjoyable evening as we
ate and visited.  Irven and Sandy stayed and we played games.  It is 11 PM and
I have to be at Randy’s at 5 AM to go fishing with him in the morning.  Good
Night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This morning
Randy and I left to go fishing at 5 AM.  We were at Strawberry Reservoir about
7:30 and fishing by 8 AM.  Fishing was steady all day with most of what we
caught we had to release because of size.  On Strawberry fish have to b e less
than 16” or over 21” and most of what we caught was between that.  I believe it
was really good therapy for Randy to enjoy the activity and to talk.  The day
was beautiful and pleasant.  The afternoon wind came up but never did get very
hard.  After loading the boat we cleaned the fish and then I went into the
lodge and found out the prices for staying over night.  We stopped in Heber
City at Caroline’s Frozen Yogurt and bought a Yogurt to eat on the way home. 
It was after 9 PM when I got home after putting the boat away at Randy’s.  I
was very tired and soon took a shower and went to bed.  Mae was busy all day
with the house.  She is still sorting and filling storage items and the many
articles she has collected over the years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
early and went up to David &amp; Shauna’s to tend the children for them while
Shauna takes a class in nursing that she has to take in order to keep her
Nursing Certificate.  I slept until 7:30 before getting up.  After getting
dressed and etc. I needed to go over to Ogden to sign some papers on the loan I
had given JAY BIRD INVESTMENTS.  Sherrie called and asked Bob if he could take
her car into Lelis Transmission.  I need to set up an appointment to have our
car and pickup serviced and so told Bob I would meet him there and bring him
home.  When I went to US Title they told me that Mae needed to also sign the
papers.  Geralyn let me take the papers to Mae and then bring Mae’s drivers
license back.  I set the appointment at Lelis’s and when Bob got there we went
over to Home Depot where I bought a bench vise and a bench grinder.  I was
looking for some electrical parts and would have had to buy a complete roll of
flexible conduit but a man that was buying some electrical part said if I would
buy the few fittings he needed he would give me the parts I needed.  He is a
electrician and had the parts I needed.  That was fair for me because I only
needed 18” of the flexible conduit and his parts came to less that the conduit
I would have had to buy.  We went up to David’s and Mae signed the paper.  I
got my generator while I was there.  We took the papers back to US Title Co.
and got our check.  We made $556.53 on that loan so it was very worth while.  We
next went out to get natural gas in my pickup, came back and deposited the
money in the bank in Roy.  By the time we finished and got home it was 2 PM.  I
got some lunch and laid down for a ½ hour nap.  Bob helped me and we made a
stand for Irven.  That took me longer than I had thought.  Mae came home just
as I was finishing.  She went with me and we took the stand over to Irven &amp;
Sandy’s.  Irven is doing worse today.  We visited with them for a while.  I
wasn’t feeling the best when we came home.  We had some fresh peaches and
cottage cheese for super before I entered my journal entry and got ready for
bed.  Mae was tired from tending children today.  She puts a lot into it but
she wants to be a good Grandmother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
got going around 8 AM.  I flayed the fish and got them taken care of.   Mae was
on the phone for a while with Sister Smith.  I worked on my trailer until
almost 4 PM.  We hurry to get to Maddox’s where we were to meet with other
friends for dinner.  We were early so went across the road to a fruit stand
where we bought a ½ bushel of peaches for $8.00 and 12 ears of corn for $1.00
and a watermelon at 15 cents a lb.  Dennis &amp; Eleanor and Margie &amp; Gary
came but Ron was sick so he and Pat couldn’t make it.  After eating we went
over to Margie &amp; Gary’s where we visited and we taught them how to play
“Knock”.   It was 10:30 before we got home.  I carried in the items we bought
while Mae made up some whey and put dishes away.  I filled in my journal for
today.  We read the lesson on the way home and it made me discouraged as it is
about raising your family in the Gospel and we are concerned as to how Sandi is
doing and very concerned about David and Jeff.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6:45 AM but I just couldn’t get over the depression from last night.  It was
really a struggle for me to go to meetings this morning.   I went fasting sa I
just didn’t feel like eating.  Meetings were good.  We came home and got
something for lunch.  Ma3e and I then walked over to Von Nederhouser’s and
wished them well on their mission call.  I went on to attend Ward Welfare
meeting and Mae came on home.  When I got home I took a nap.  Mae had invited
Scott and Mishelle and the children over for dinner but Mishelle was helping
her Aunt so she didn’t come.  Mae cooked corn beef patties for dinner.  We
enjoyed visiting and playing games with Scott, Kylan and Ashley.  They left
about 8:30 PM.  We did some more cleaning from dinner and the games.  I called
Brother &amp; Sister Johnston and set up a time to go Home Teaching to them.  I
then filled in my journal entry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6:30 AM and I thought I had plenty of time to make the appointment to have the
pickup into Lelis Transmission.  I had prepared breakfast and we were saying
morning prayers when I realized I was already late leaving.  I ran to get my
keys and ran out the door telling Mae that I had to go.  She finished getting
my breakfast ready so I could eat as I drove.  I was 15 minutes late getting
there but they were late getting his mechanics there so it worked out.  When I
got back home Bob came and helped me work on the trailer.  Becky brought
Tayler, Maddi and Jessica up and Mae took the girls to Dinosaur Land in Ogden. 
They didn’t get back until 4:30 PM.  I was suppose to have been showered and
ready to go when they got home.  I really had to hurry.  We got there at the
same time Mike got home from work.  Becky had prepared a nice roast dinner.  We
visited and enjoyed being there.  We left a little after 9 PM. for home.  We
had to stop for gas before getting on the freeway.  It was 10:30 PM when we got
home and we soon went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I took the
car in first thing this morning and got the transmission serviced.  Bob helped
me and while it was being serviced we picked up materials for the trailer.  Mae
went to the Dr. this morning to have her feet checked.  She is having quite a
bit of leg cramps.  I worked on the trailer most of the day.  This evening Bob
and I went Home Teaching to the Mitchell’s and the Johnston’s.  Mae put up
peaches this evening and I helped her a little when I got home from H.T.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up and so it just carried over with not getting started until 10 AM. 
Kip called to see if I wanted to have him give my name to those that had small
job.  I told him that would be ok.  Steve ____ soon called to have me talk to
them about finishing a bathroom for them.  Mae went over to Scott &amp;
Mishelle’s to help Mishelle can peaches.  Bob helped me work on my trailer all
day.  We were able to get the welding done before quitting at 6 PM.  Mae asked
me to plant a rose bush for her and to install the storm window in the storm
door.  We ate dinner and then turned on a show on the TV.  I filled some
capsules while watching the show.  We watched a couple of M.A.S.H. shows before
going to bed.  I also filled in my journal during commercials.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We enjoyed
being together this morning but I had an appointment with Steve and Linda Stone
in Layton to visit with them about finishing a ¼ bath and wash room for them. 
I was there until 11 AM.  Mae went over to the Hook Fishing shop and got her
fishing license and a fishing pole and reel.  I was going to meet her there but
didn’t make it.  From there she went to the Davis School District office and
meet Jackie.  They had lunch together and went walking.  When I got home I
prepared some lunch and then worked the rest of the afternoon on my trailer. 
When I came in for super we started getting ready to go fishing tomorrow.  Mae
went to the store for a few groceries.  I took a look at her pole and real and
couldn’t get the drag on the real to work.  I went upstairs and had bob look at
it and checked to see if he had a real but he doesn’t.  Irven and Sandy stopped
in to visit for a few minutes.  Mae gave me a hair cut this evening.  I then
showered and got ready for bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and met Judy and Randy at their home.  We soon were packed up and left
for Strawberry Bay Reservoir.  We got there by 8 AM, checked in with the lodge
and were soon fishing.  Mae caught the first fish but as normal we had to
release it because it was over 16” and less than 21”.  It was very enjoyable
having Mae and Judy with us.  We fished all day and were able to keep 6 fish. 
We went to the restraint and got some take out for dinner.  They wouldn’t let
us stay and eat at the restraint as they were closing soon.  We checked in at
the lodge and got our rooms.  We ate in Randy &amp; Judy’s room and then played
a game of “Knock”.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We met Randy
and Judy at the restraint at 7 AM for breakfast.  We were able to start fishing
at 8 AM.  Again we were able catch several fish but were only able to keep 4
because of size.  We quite fishing at 11:30 AM and loaded up the boat.  We
stopped at Caroline’s Frozen Yogurt as we went through Heber City.  It was 2:30
PM when we got home.  We took Mae home first so that she could get ready to attend
the Relief Society Conference Session at the Conference Center with our Wards
Sisters.  After getting home I showered and took a nap.  Bob then went with me
to Willard where we bought four boxes of peaches.  I flayed the fish we brought
home.  I watched a show on TV and filled in my journal.  Mae called and told me
that they were stopping for some dinner before coming home.  It was late when
we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and did not want to get up but know that we would have to hurry to get to
church on time.  Meetings went well although I wish I could be more alert by
the time Sacrament started as I often fall asleep during the meeting.  I again
did that today.  We came home and took a nap.  We worked together preparing dinner
and came up with a nice meal.  I called Roy and visited for a while with him. 
Barbara has been in the hospital with meningitis and has just got out.  Roy and
Linda have had the children but Russell is going to come and get them
tomorrow.  They have received a call from the Missionary department asking for
some more information from their Doctor before sending them a mission call.  Bob
and Carroll had some of their family come so we went up stairs and visited a
few minutes with them.  I recorded a documentary on channel 11 about the
Prophet Joseph Smith.  Jeff and Gail came over and we visited and played
games.  They left shortly after 9 PM so I downloaded some pictures from our
camera and entered my journal.  It has been a very enjoyable day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up a
little after 6 AM but let Mae sleep until 7 AM.  I prepared breakfast of fish,
fried potatoes and eggs.  Mae helped Shauna bottle peaches and then she went to
American Fork and helped Becky put up peaches.  I worked on my trailer all day
but it didn’t seem that I got a lot done.  Bob didn’t help me today as he
helped Carroll put up peaches.  Mae didn’t get home until after 7 PM.  She was
tired but still kept going.  I lied down and watch a documentary about the
Prophet Joseph Smith before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
went into Ogden this morning and looked at a boat.  It is an older boat but we
are thinking of getting it.  I made an appointment with Fred’s Marina to check
the engine on the boat to see if it still is in fairly good condition.  I will
take it over tomorrow evening and they will check it out on Thursday morning. 
We also looked at a carport cover and are thinking we should get one.  I talked
to Bob and Carroll about putting a car port in.  we will see how they feel
about it.  I worked down to Randy and Judy’s this afternoon, repairing a water
line.  I was able to remove the line, repair it and pull it back under their
back addition.  I did not get it completely finished before time to quite so I
will have to return tomorrow.  I took my trailer with me on this job and it
went well.  Mae prepared small red potatoes with peas in cream tuna gravy for
diner.  It was very good.  This evening Mae and I went over to Robin Walker’s
where I gave Robin and her son Kyson a Priesthood blessing.  Robin’s husbands
left her for another woman and have left the family in a real trial.  Mae has
been working all day on her lesson that is coming up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early this morning so I could go into Ogden and get the boat.  Bob went in with
me.  Mae prepared breakfast after I got home.  I then went over to Kaysville
and took Mae’s fishing pole and reel back to get the reel fixed.  The problem
was that the line was slipping on the reel.  They fixed that in just a few
minutes and I was on my way.  I stopped at Durk’s and bought a small tub cutter
and then went down to Randy’s and finished repairing the water line.  I also
repaired a area in their soffit where the birds are getting in and nesting. 
Mae prepared a nice dinner of halibut, baked potatoes and backed squash.  I
took a nap after eating.  Bob and I mowed the lawns and trimmed the edges.  We
took the boat over to Fred’s Marina to have the engine checked out.  If the
engine is ok then I will have them do some other work on the boat.  I serviced
the car this evening.  Mark packed some of his items into my pickup so we can
take them down to St. George tomorrow.  I set up stairs and watched the TV and
visited with Bob &amp; Carroll.  Mae had the Sisters jeer this evening for the
book club.  I took a shower and entered my journal before we went to bed.  Mark
could not get a hold of the man in Mesquite Nevada in order for us to go down
there tomorrow to get Mark’s motivator.  We will have to try another day. 
After the Sister’s left our place we got ready for bed and I filled in my
journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I started out
this morning with plans to move more tools and materials into my trailer.  Bob
then invited us up for a waffle breakfast.  That took until almost 10 AM. 
Irven called and asked if I could stop by and help them with a want ad for a
cabinet they want to sale.  Fred’s Marina called with their findings with the
boat I asked them to check for me.  There is quite a lot of work that the boat
and motor needs and they felt it would be a unwise purchase.  I stopped at
Irven and Sandy’s then went over and got the boat.  I returned it to its owner
and told him that we wouldn’t buy it.  On the way home I stopped and looked at tent
trailers at two lots.  The one that we looked at earlier had been sold and what
I looked at today is much higher than I wanted to go.  Bob checked with the
city and they won’t let us put the driveway in like we want to.  Bob and I
looked through the paper and found a couple of trailers that we might be
interested in.  Mae and I watched a movie that Bob had recorded some time ago. 
We really enjoyed it.  I filled in my journal entry and we went to bed about 11
PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob and I
went to the Clinton city office this morning.  I explained to those at the
building office that we had a problem and would like to have their help in
solving the problem.  I explained that they had notified us that we could not
park on the road, that we could not park on the grass and now we are told that
we can not cut another driveway approach.  They agreed that we could do none of
those things but when I pushed for an answer they just became upset with us and
said it was our fault that we had built the house where we did.  We ended up
leaving the office very upset but accomplishing nothing.  We looked at some
tent trailers but didn’t see anything that excited me.  we found a fishing boat
at Intermountain Boat &amp; Truck Sales that I put $200 on it to hold it for me
until they get it repaired so I can finish checking it out.  It was 12:30 when
we were going home.  As we approached a Tamale store when Bob said he wanted to
buy one so he could try them.  I drove in and I asked to buy one for a sample
to try.  The clerk gave us each one to sample.  We liked them so we bought some
to take home.  I ate 2 more for lunch.  Mae took Tyler and Emily to Dinosaur
Park.  She got home after 3 PM.  we changed clothes and went to Bountiful where
we picked up the Clarks.  We then went to the BYU Wilkinson Center in Provo
where we enjoyed a Philippines Angeles Mission Reunion.  It was a great evening
being with and visiting with so many return missionaries from that mission.  We
enjoyed being with the Clarks and having them ride with us.  It was after
mid-night when we got home. </span></p>
