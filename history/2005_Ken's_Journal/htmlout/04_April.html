<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up early and left for Salt Lake.  We
stopped and got some breakfast on the way.  We arrived at 9:55 AM, at the
Church House where the Funeral services are to be held for Enid Porter Degraw. 
I felt good at the timing until I got out of the car and realized that we had
left some of our clothes at Bill &amp; Joyce’s.  That included my suit coat and
tie.  Kim and Georgia arrived just then and I asked Kim if he had an extra
tie.  He did, so I just went with a shirt and tie.  The funeral services were
very appropriate.  Bryce had Mae &amp; I ride with him to the cemetery.  Uncle
Wayne dedicated the grave.  He is quite remarkable as he is now 93 years old. 
We returned to the church and ate lunch with the family.  Mae and I came on home
to get ready for the weekend.  While Mae started preparing some food to take to
David’s, I made some phone calls to price tires for the snowmobile trailer. 
Bob came out to help me remove the tires.  We worked all evening taking the lug
nuts off.  After getting 9 of the 10 lug nuts off, the 10<sup>th</sup> lug
stripped just before coming off.  Now we couldn’t get it on or off.  We thought
that we might cut it if we had a coal chisel.  I couldn’t find one so Bob
called Home Depot in <br>
Riverdale.  They were closed but told him if we would come over they would help
us out.  We went over and the manager let us in, gave me a 3/4” coal chisel and
when I offered to pay he said no I could just have it.  Boy! That was special. 
I was sure tired when we quite for the night.  I had to take a hot shower to
warm up before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 02, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up early to get the tire off the trailer
as I had an appointment to get new tires mounted at 9 AM.  We couldn’t cut the
lug with the coal chisel so had to rent a cutting torch and cut it off.  It
took the morning to get the tires back on the trailer but I also bought me an
artic suit and boots.  Mae was ready to leave to go up to David’s by the time I
finished.  We stopped and bought Mae an artic suit also on the way to David’s. 
We felt that the Sportsman Warehouse  in Riverdale gave us a good buy.  David
and Shauna invited all of us to their place to watch to General Conference on
their big TV Screen.  Mike’s family, Scott’s family, Jeff &amp; Gail and Mae
&amp; I were all there.  This evening all my boys, David (Mike’s son) and I
attend General Priesthood meeting.  We ate and played games until 10 PM.  All
except for Mike’s family then went home to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, April 03, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went back to David’s again this morning.  We
got there about 9 AM with the rest coming up shortly there after.  Sandi came
out with us today.  We really enjoyed having so many of our family together. 
With all the children and the visiting we had a difficult time paying close
attention to the General Conference sessions.  David and Mike prepared
breakfast of biscuits &amp; grave.  They were very good.  After the second
session of conference we had dinner of baked potatoes with all the trimmings. 
David asked if we men could help him move some of his furniture as tomorrow a
man will come to repair some problems with the sheetrock.  When we got home I
got things about ready to go snowmobiling tomorrow morning.  Mae was quite
tired but helped me.  Bob and Carroll had us come up and we visited for a
little while before coming back downstairs.  It was 10 PM before we got to bed
with me taking time to catch up my journal entries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, April 04, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left this morning and went up to Randy &amp;
Judy’s cabin in the Uinta Mountains.  It took us longer to get there than we
thought but we made a few stops on the way.  Judy fixed some lunch and then we
went snowmobiling.  We went up towards Lyman Lake but Mae’s machine was low on
gas so we came back.  I went down to the Bear River Station but they were
closed.  I drove all the way to Evanston, a distance of 30 miles, and realized
that I had for got to bring my wallet.  I just returned and we, Randy, Judy,
Mae &amp; I, played games and visited until late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, April 05, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I took the snowmobiles to the Bear River Station
and was able to get them filled with gas today.  The four of us again went
snowmobiling and went all the way to Lyman Lake today.  I got stuck as we were
trying to get all the way to the cabin there.  With Randy and Mae’s help we got
it out.  We next had trouble getting one of the snowmobiles to start.  As we
left to return to Randy &amp; Judy’s cabin I took off to have a little fun and
really ended up with my machine stuck and to far off the road to get Randy and
Mae to help.  I left my machine and crawled out to the road.  Randy and Judy’s
machine is having belt trouble and he didn’t have an extra belt with them.  We
left my machine for now and will have to go back for it later.  Their machine
made it back to the cabin.  We ate lunch and packed up to come home.  We
stopped at a shop on the way out and bought a new belt for Randy’s machine. 
Mae and I stopped in Evanston and ate some dinner at a Chinese restraint.  We
were until almost 9 PM before we got home.  We had called Bryce, on the way
home but he wasn’t home, so Mae left a message asking him to call me.  Bryce
called but will be working tomorrow.  We took hot baths trying to get the
stiffness out after the two days of playing around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, April 06, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This morning I made some calls to see if I could
find anyone that could go with me to retrieve our snowmobile.  I called Grenn
Clark and talked to Sister Clark.  Grenn was on a job but she gave me his phone
number.  Bryce called and said that he thought that Nolan would be able to help
me.  I called Nolan and he said he could go with me.  Mae prepared some
breakfast and some lunch.  I met Nolan at 10:15 AM at his parent’s home.  We
were up to Randy’s cabin by 12:45 PM.  We installed the new drive belt onto
Randy’s snowmobile, then took it into the shop in Evington and had them adjust
the drive pulleys.   It was after 4 PM when we got back and started going to
Lyman’s Lake to get my snowmobile.  When we got there we found that it wasn’t
as far off the trail as I had figured.  When I had left the machine I had moved
to the right thinking that I could see a trail but has wrong so went back to
the left before finding the trail.  Another thing is the trail mad a right hand
bend just a short distance before the area I had found it.  As it turned out the
machine was only about 150 feet off the trail.  With the shovels we were able
to dig the snow away from the machine and with the two of us were able to
easily tip it out of the snow.  We packed a trail for a short distance in front
of the snowmobile so I could get it started and by giving it plenty of power
was able to break through to the main trail.  We then took time to go back to
Lyman’s Lake and drove over to the lodge and cabin area.  They were unlocked so
I showed them to Nolan.  We then started back.  Part way my machine tour a
drive belt but I had a spare so with a little lost time was able to change it
and again be on our way.  All went well and I got home about 9:30 PM.  Mae said
that Bob was concerned and worried about me all day.  He came downstairs almost
as soon as I got home.   I sure appreciated Nolan’s help and willingness to go
with me.  Mae isn’t feeling too good this evening.  We soon went to bed being
very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, April 07, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After breakfast I got some of my tools and went
over to Scott &amp; Mishelle’s to shape some boards for Mishelle.  Kip was out
front so we visited for a few minutes.  Gail, Becky and Shauna came as our
daughter-in-laws are getting together to make clocks.  Mae came to tend the
children for them.  I router the edges of four round boards, drilled a hole in
the center and router a indent for a clock motor to be inset from the back.  It
was after noon before I finished up and came home.  I stopped and looked at a
covered trailer as I am thinking that is the way to keep my tools plus it would
be of good use if and when we start building.  I then came home, ate some lunch
and took a nap.  Bob had Grant come over and we took a piano and entertainment
center down to Sheri’s.  I then took the snowmobiles down to Randy’s and
unloaded his.  I had forgotten to bring the key to my snowmobile so had to
return home and get it.  I brought my two snowmobiles back and parked them in
the shed.  Mae got home and helped guide me.  She then followed me to Randy’s
and we filled his van with fuel and returned it to him.  We were both very
tired by the time we returned home.  Mae had tended the kids all day.  When we
went to bed Mae isn’t feeling very well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, April 08, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was up early and as I try to do read a chapter
from the scriptures.  Having the palm pilot helps me.  I have also played a
game of checkers most mornings.  I am not sure if that is a good thing or not. 
I let Mae sleep in until she woke at 7 AM.  She still doesn’t feel the best. 
Mae went down to Randy’s for a treatment this morning.  Georgia is coming over
today and the two of them are going out for lunch.  She wants the apartment
looking nice, especially with Georgia coming.  I cleaned the windows in the sun
room and Bob helped me by assembling the bar stools.  We had it about done when
Mae got back from Randy’s.  I then went upstairs and mounted Bob’s cupboard
over his stove and the cupboard that came out we mounted at the end of the
cabinets.  I brought my tools in and installed the trim around the top of the
cabinets.  This I had never done since I had installed their cabinets
originally.  It was late when we finished putting the tools back.  Mae had
supper ready when I came down.  We watched some of the BYU scripture study
while eating.  We then watched a show on TV that was pretty good.  Mae gave me
a hair cut before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 09, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke up at 4:45 AM and couldn’t go back to
sleep so worked on the computer for a while.  Mae got up about 7 AM but I was
tired and went back to bed.  I got up about 11 AM and we had breakfast.  We did
some shopping today and just enjoyed being together.  I got some parts and
installed our TV, VCR &amp; DVD in our bedroom.  I must not have them quite
right but we watched a movie on TV before going to bed.  Mae called David &amp;
Leah Frandsen this evening.  They are to ones that Sister Nadado knows and
asked us to contact them for her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, April 10, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended the Clinton 20<sup>th</sup> Ward
this morning and told the bishopric that they could send for our membership
records.  We thought that it would be Fast &amp; Testimony meeting today but
they must have had that before General Conference.  We were made welcome to the
ward by many.  This afternoon we had Jeff &amp; Gail, Scott, Mishelle, Kylan
&amp; Ashley over to eat dinner with us.  Mae made a nice roast and all the
trimmings.  We played games for a little while.  Irven and Sandy came just as
the kids left.  We visited for a while and then Irven taught us a card game
called “knock”.  Bob came down and played with us also.  It was late when we
got to bed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, April 11, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up late and after breakfast I went
upstairs to get started on Bob &amp; Carroll’s fireplace plans.  Grant and
Stacy came, and in visiting with them, I mentioned that I was having problems
with my DVD player.  Grant came down and showed me how to control it.  They
stayed and visited with Mae for a while.  Grant brought over a new hood for our
stove that matched the stove better.  After planning Bob’s fireplace, Bob and I
went over to Home Depot to get the materials.  We were gone for over 3 ½
hours.  I almost missed my appointment with Randy for a treatment.  After the
treatment, I replaced a filter on Randy’s furnace.  After returning home, I
decided to put a coat of “Quick Set” on Bob’s fireplace.  I didn’t finish until
after 9 pm.  Mae kept busy today doing laundry, mopped the kitchen floor,
dusted throughout the house, vacuumed and then typed letters to some of our
friends in the Philippines.  I dyed Mae’s hair before we went to bed, so it was
after 11 pm when we retired – very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, April 12, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I slept in until almost 8 AM.  We had cold
cereal for breakfast and then I got started on Bob &amp; Carroll’s fireplace. 
It took a while to get all the tools collected and ready to start work.  I had
Bob do some running to get materials.  I bought a new Hammer Drill in order to
put the mounting holes in the brick.  I am using David’s tile saw but I don’t
like it very well.  The one I want will cost over $500.  I am trying to decide
if I should just buy one as I will need it for our house.  I worked until 5:30
PM and then cleaned up.  Mae fixed dinner of warm ups as we have a lot of left
overs.  We went over and got our income tax returns from Ed Sorenson.  We will
get $1,900 back this year.  I worked on my journal as Mae had bought me some
pre-punched paper to print 2003 journal on for a hard copy.  Mae also got our
family picture framed and is having our cross-stitch of Christ mounted and
framed.  Mae hasn’t been feeling very well the past few days but she keeps
going.  She called Kevis and we sang Happy Birthday to him.  She talked to
Shellie for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, April 13, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke up at 4 AM and was up for a few minutes
but was afraid of waking Mae if I crawled back into bed so I laid in the
recliner and went back to sleep.  Mae woke me at 8 AM.  After breakfast I was
going to have Mae take the pickup and get it inspected and registered.  She
still isn’t feeling well so I did it.  Bob went with me.  Because we had dropped
the insurance on the truck while we were gone I had to go to Farmington to get
the license.  I was glad that I didn’t have Mae do it for me.  On the way home
we looked at trailers and I decided to get an up grade from the one I had
originally looked at.  It will cost me another 600 dollars.  I worked on Bob’s
fireplace this afternoon and we got all the main tile set.  By the time we got
tools put away it was 7 PM Before I got downstairs.  Mae went to a study group
and to Home Making this evening.  I showered and cleaned up getting ready for
bed.  I was going to watch the rest of a video but Mae came home and we watched
the video of Jeff and Gail’s wedding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, April 14, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in and then Bob called from one of the
Tile stores trying to explain what they had.  I had him come and get me and
Carroll and we went back.  We selected a different tile and edge for the
hearth.  It will take a couple of days for it to come in.  When we came home I
took a nap.  Mae and I then went to the Hook &amp; Fly shop where I bought a
fishing license.  We then went to Wasatch Trailer sells where I bought a new
trailer.  When we got home I helped Mark and Bob load the tree trimmings and
the packaging that our items had been sent from the Philippines into the truck to
take to the dumps.  We didn’t have time today as we had a Stake Temple Day at
5:30 PM.  Mae didn’t feel well enough to go so Bob, Mark and I went.  When we
got home I popped some corn and we watched a show on TV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, April 15, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and had breakfast then Bob and I took
the load of tree trimmings to the dumps.  Before going I climbed up in the big
cotton wood tree to the west of the house and removed some dead branches.  When
we got back we took the cupboard out to install a dishwasher.  Bob went to
Durk’s Plumbing for parts and a new garbage disposal.  Mae came home at 3:15 PM
and said we needed to leave for Bountiful.  We were to pickup the Clarks and
then go to 45<sup>th</sup> South and State St. to a Chinese restaurant where we
were to meet the Frandsen’s.  They are the missionary couple that helped Bessie
Nadado to return home from Russia.   We had a very pleasant evening and enjoyed
the visit with the Frandsen’s.  Brother and Sister Clark invited us in when we
got to their place.  We played a game of Rummy as we visited.  It was after
9:30 PM before we got home.  We just left the mess and soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 16, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and left for Sandi’s.  We stopped at
Mc Donald’s on the way and got some breakfast to eat on the way.  We got to
Sandi’s at 8:30 AM.  Sandy was soon ready and we went over to Brad &amp;
JaNae’s.  Mom held our new Great Granddaughter most of the time.  She is cute
but we are not predigested or any thing likes that.  I visited with Brad and
bought a case of oil for our truck and car.  We were there for an hour or so
before going back to Sandi’s.  Sandi fixed lunch for us before we came home.  I
changed clothes and started right to work on our kitchen.  I got the dishwasher
installed and a new garbage disposal installed and the outside storm door
closer reinstalled.  We had to hurry in order to be ready for the evening
session of the Clinton Stake Conference.  I was afraid that I would be too
sleepy to stay awake for the session but the speakers were very good and we
really enjoyed the meeting.  After we got home Bob called down and told me that
there was a show on about the Wind Talkers and the code that the marines used
with the Navajos during World War 2.  I stayed awake to the end but Mae went to
sleep just before it got over.  It was after 1AM before I went to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, April 17, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 6:50 AM and started top get ready
when Bob came down and invited us to have breakfast with them of biscuits &amp;
gravy.  We went into Ogden with them to attend Stake Conference.  When we got
home Bob invited us to eat lunch with them.  Bob had prepared chicken, potatoes
and gravy for dinner.  After eating I visited for a while.  Mae went down
stairs and I thought was going to go to sleep but she went down stairs and worked
on the computer sorting pictures.  We drove up to David &amp; Shauna’s at 4
PM.  They had a nice roasted ham dinner ready shortly after we got there, so we
ate again.  After dinner we visited about building a shop for them and did some
analyzing of the selected sight.  David, Shauna, Mae and I played a game of
“Settlers” and then David showed what his neighbor to the west was doing to
install a rock retaining wall.  He is concerned as the contractor is digging
into David’s property.  His neighbor came to check some measurements, so David
went over to visit with him about his concerns.  When Mae and I went into the
house Shauna was upstairs putting the baby to bed so we left a note and left
for home.  I made my journal entry before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, April 18, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up at 5:30 AM but let Mae sleep in.  She
got up and fixed me some breakfast before I left with Bob at 7:45 AM.  We went
looking for tile but didn’t have much success except we returned the tile we
had bought and got Bob’s money back.  I went to Randy’s and got a treatment. 
Bob and I looked for tile but still with out success except we were given a
suggestion that we trim the hearth with wood.  Mae &amp; I left for Provo about
2:45 PM.  We went to the B.Y.U. campus and found Britney (Granddaughter to
Joyce &amp; Bill Stoddard) and got our clothes that we had left when we stayed
with Joyce &amp; Bill.  We then drove to Pat &amp; Ron Bradfield’s and visited
with them for a while.  We stopped at a Wendy’s drive in and got something to
eat.  Next we stopped at Mike &amp; Becky’s.  Mike had taken David &amp; Page
to the Jazz ball game so I visited with Becky while Grandma played with Mattie
and Jessica.  We left and got home before 10 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, April 19, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I worked on Bob &amp; Carroll’s fireplace all
day, getting done about 5 this afternoon.  Mae has been visiting friends and
family most of the day.  She didn’t get home until 7 PM.  We watched two series
of Bonanza this evening.  I got up to enter my journal and made entries to our
checking account first.  By the time I got this entry made it was after 11 PM. 
Randy and I had planned on going fishing today but the weather was cold and
rainy so that got canceled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, April 20, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I worked with Brother Clark on a commercial job
he has been doing.  We laid tile in a room that he had enclosed.  I laid the
tile while he kept me supplied.  He said after we had finished that it had been
a long time since he had been a hod carrier.  It took us about 5 hours to
complete the job.  We went over to his place and sister Clark prepared us some
lunch.  It was fun to visit with them as we ate.  Grenn paid me $120 for the
work.  I was tired and cold but we watched a Bonanza movie before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, April 21, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I prepared breakfast this morning and then went
upstairs and worked on the fireplace for Bob and Carroll.  I was able to finish
it today.  The fireplace finished very nice.  Bob &amp; Carroll are very
pleased with it.  After putting away all my tools I went down stairs and took a
nap.  Mae had gone shopping and didn’t get home until almost 5 PM.  She bought
me a calculator and a watch.  The calculator is a science calculator so I
wasn’t too pleased with it.  My actions upset Mae.  Sometimes it is very easy
for me to say the wrong thing.   We ate some dinner and then drove to Mike and
Becky’s.  Just before getting to Mike’s place he called us.  Maddi came to him
and asked, “Just how many minutes will it be before Grandma and Grandpa will
get here?”  Mike told her he wasn’t sure but they would call us.  We were just
about 10 minutes away from their house. The two girls were especially anxious
and waiting when we got there.  Mike helped me load a backup program on our
laptop computer for my palm.  We played games for a while this evening before
we went to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, April 22, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke up at 5 AM and couldn’t go back to
sleep.  I was up for a while and finally laid down.  I just got to sleep when
Taylor’s alarm went off and woke me.  Becky made breakfast of waffles.  They
were very good.  Becky and a couple of other mothers have a program where they
take turns in letting the little children spend some time together in
activities.  Each mother takes her turn and today was Becky’s turn.  Mike,
David, Mae and I played a game of Rook and then a game of Cities.  Mae and I
prepared lunch of hoagie sandwiches.  We left their place about 3 PM and went
to Payless Shoes and bought Mae a new pair of dress shoes as she had forgotten
to bring some with her.  We then went to the Little American Hotel where we met
the Hyers, the Maharrys and the Clarks and we ate and visited until late.  It
was expensive food but very good.  We sure enjoyed visiting with the couples
now that we are all home from our missions.  We visited with Bob and Carroll
after getting home.  They bought me a can of razor spray that I wanted.   I
then down loaded pictures from our camera to the computer.  I then filled out
my journal for today.  We were late going to bed.  Good Night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 23, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in a while, anyway Mae was able to but
I woke before 5 AM.  We went out to Sandi’s where I installed the electronic
dog fence for her.  Her renter next door came over and helped me and I was glad
for the help.  By the time we finished I wasn’t feeling very well.  On the way
home we stopped at a Maverick to get gas and a yogurt.  It took me until we had
passed Salt Lake before I finished eating it.  When we got home we just relaxed
and watched a good show on TV.  We were very tired so we went to bed.  I got to
sleep before Mae had got in bed.  I woke a few minutes later with acid reflects
that about choked me.  The rest of the night I slept in the big chair but
really felt bad and hurt all over with pain.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae came in and woke me as we had over slept.  I
guess I had forgotten to turn the alarm on after setting it.  Although I didn’t
sleep very well and really don’t feel very good we went to church.  Brother
Robins of our Bishopric ask if Mae and I would speak in Sacrament meeting, May
15<sup>th</sup>.  Bob invited us to have lunch with them but I was worried
about having more stomach problems so we reclined.  We ate just a light lunch. 
I set in the recliner and took a nap.  We went over to Scott’s at 4:30 PM but
Scott was still at the church until almost 5:30 PM.  We played “Old Pig” with
Kylan and Ashley while we were waiting for Scott.  After eating we just
visited, coming home at 8:30 PM.  I filled out this journal entry before we
went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke about 6 AM but Mae slept until 7 AM.  I can’t
play checkers as my free trial time has ran out.  I fixed breakfast as Mae
started the weekly wash.  Mae went to a treatment with Randy at 9 AM.  I went
to an appointment with Dr. Lee at 9:30 AM.  After finishing the Dr appointment
I went to Ogden to the Concrete Specialty store and asked for some information. 
I also stopped at a health store and bought some HCL with Pepsin.  Mark thinks
it will help my stomach problems.  I have taken some he gave me for 5 meals and
it seems to be helping.  I worked on plans for David’s shop.  This evening Mae
and I went up to David’s and I used my transit to see how much excavation we
need to do.  David got home shortly after we got there and helped me lay his
shop out.  Shauna fixed some dinner for us.  Mae played games with the children
while I worked on the shop.  We got home about 9:30 PM and soon got ready for
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up about 6:30 AM but then went back to bed
and didn’t get up until 8:30 AM.  Bob and I cut down a tree in his back yard. 
It took most of the day but we got it down before quitting.  I was tired so
took a 45 min nap.  I worked on David’s shop plans this evening.  Mae went out
to eat lunch with some of the women at the School District office.  She then
went over to Scott &amp; Mishelle’s and started sorting and getting our things
ready to be taken out of their house.  We had a member of the Bishopric and a
member of the High Priest group Presidency come this evening.  They gave Bob
and I the assignment to be Home Teaching companions.  Mae had brought some
chicken home with her so we ate it while watching some TV.  It was late when we
went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I slept in until 6:30 again this morning and Mae
slept a little longer.  After breakfast Mae gave me a haircut.  We then got
ready to go to the Temple.  We stopped at the Distribution Center in Layton but
it was still closed so we went over to Wal-Mart.  We bought a Weed Eater so we
could trim the lawn after Bob mowed it.  We also bought a few other items.  We
them went back to the Distribution Center where I bought me some white pants, a
belt and a tie.  It was almost noon when we got to the Temple.  Mae and I were
asked to be the witness couple for the session.  We enjoyed the session and
after talked about it for a few minutes before going down to change.  We went
to the cafeteria and ate lunch.  While there we met Lynn Penrod.  He is a
temple worker and has been there for eight years now.  He said that Darline
doesn’t have very good health so is unable to work with him.  It was good to
visit with him.  On the way home we stopped at Smith’s and bought some Birthday
cards for Mike and Conner.  We went to the Clearfield post office and mailed
them and then went to Wineger’s and bought a few groceries.  It was raining
hard when we got home.  I checked with Bob about going home teaching but we
found that it was done for this month before Bob and I were assigned together. 
I went up stairs to look at the fireplace for Bob has added another finish coat
to the wood.  Mae got right on the computer to work on pictures.  She stayed on
it all evening.  I watched a fair TV movie “Independence Day” but well over
half of the time was advertising.  It was after mid-night when we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up at 6:30 but Mae hadn’t slept very much
last night so I let her sleep in.  I caught my journal up.  A few days ago Mark
suggested that I try taking HCL with Pepsin to help my digestive system.  He
gave me a few to try and I have bought a bottle of them and I take one with
each meal.  Since doing this I have not suffered with acid reflux even once. 
This has been such a relief to fine something to help.  Mae got up at 8:30 AM,
I was working on a new budget sheet on our computer.  Jeff came over and brought
our old computer.  We were just ready to eat breakfast so we invited Jeff to
eat with us.  We set up the computer and checked the boot up.  We got visiting
with Jeff and he is having trouble with his testimony of the church.  We
visited for quite a while about his feelings.  I feel that his problem stems
from the fact that his girl didn’t wait for him and Jeff is blaming God.  I
just pray that somehow he can overcome this and realize that he has the best
blessing.  After Jeff left I went over to Rodney Porter and got the chimney cap
I had Rodney’s men make for me.  Bob and I cut up some of the tree we cut down
Monday.  It started to rain and got cold so we quite for today.  Mae and I went
over to the health store in Roy and bought some capsules and some acidophilus. 
We then went to Layton and bought a surge protector strip.  I cut Mae’s hair
this evening for her.  I set up and watched a show on TV again until
mid-night.  Mae went to bed earlier.  I finished my journal entry before going
to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae got up before I did and I didn’t get up
until 7 AM.  I slept most of the night in the recliner.  Bob came down and
invited us for breakfast of biscuits and gravy.  I started working on setting
up the inter-net and wiring our computer power supply.  I had to add a ground
wire to the wall receptacle.  I got the inter-net set up and started working on
the bank Statement.  I spent most of the day on the computer.  Mae and I went
over to Scott &amp; Mishelle’s about 4 PM.  I let Mae off and I took some
things to the Deseret Industries.  When I returned to Scott’s they were still
there.  The key to their one car broke so I let them take my pickup so we could
have a car to take the children to the park.  We enjoyed taking the children to
the Layton Park.  They played on the toys and enjoyed feeding the sea gulls and
the ducks.  It was getting late when we returned to their house.  Mae made some
soup and toast for supper then we let them watch a DVD.  I fell asleep during
the show.  It was almost 10 PM when we got home.  I hooked the trailor up to
the pickup so it will be ready for tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 6 AM so that we could get over to
Scott’s about 8:30 AM to start moving our things out and over to our place. 
David came down to help but should return home around noon.  Jeff and Gail came
over although Jeff cut his finger quite deep yesterday.  We got one big load
ready before lunch.  The rest went home after we got it loaded.  I repaired a
drawer in Scott &amp; Mishelle’s kitchen cupboards.  Mishelle prepared some
lunch for us.  We checked into renting a storage shed but I think we have
decided against it.  Bob and I set some shelving up in the S. E. bedroom and
brought some items in from the trailer.  This evening we had an invitation to
be with the Howe’s and the Klass’s  for dinner at the Howe’s.  We had a
wonderful evening.  It was after 10 PM before we got home.</p>
