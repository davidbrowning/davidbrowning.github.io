<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t feel
very well last night and so slept the first part of the night in the recliner. 
Mae doctored me up and started me on vitamin C.  I was up a couple of times but
could go back to sleep.  I slept in until almost 11 AM when Mae went to get a
treatment.  I got up and fixed myself some breakfast.  I put the fireplace back
together and decided that we will keep this one for now.  I have stayed down
all the rest of the day.  We watched two good holiday movies on TV this evening. 
Carroll has also been sick with a cold for a couple of days.  I don’t know if I
picked this up from her, although I really haven’t been around her, or if it is
from the moving of Mark’s storage items.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was awake
several times during the night and so didn’t worry about betting up early this
morning.  Mae really takes care of me and spoils me badly but I kind of like
it.  She is a special and most important person in my life.  The only thing
more important in my life is the Gospel, for in it she is mine eternally.  I am
very concerned for my family and especially Sandi, David &amp; Jeff.  I rested
most of the day and only did a little figuring on Richard Hinton’s job.  Mae
attended Grandparents Day with Kylan.  He was so excited to have her there. 
Mae and I watched two good Christmas shows on TV this evening.  Mae has really
enjoyed shopping for Christmas gifts for our children and grandchildren.  I
think she is almost ready for Christmas.  I filled in my journal entry and we
played a couple of games on the computer before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
although I spent much of the night in the chair.  I am feeling some better
today.  Mae went over to Jeff and Gail’s and got her phone.  She then went shopping. 
I took it easy most of the morning although I peeled potatoes for the High
Priest party this evening.  At 2 PM Brother Bodily and I went up to the red
church house and set up tables and chairs for this evening.  We then went over
to Brother Smith’s and cut up the turkeys that Steve had cooked.  We put the
meat in the cookers to keep it hot for this evening.  Mae had prepared a power
point presentation for this evening on our Christmas experience in the
Philippines.  We went to the church about 5 PM and help with the last minute
setup.  The dinner turned out very well and we had a good attendance.  The
program consisted of ½ doz. Individuals telling about some of their
unforgettable Christmas experiences.  It was very good with a good verity of experiences. 
We were cleaned up and home by 9 PM so we were able to watch a show on TV that
we had wanted to see.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I again slept
most of the night in the chair.  I am sure glad that we have that chair.  It
was after 7 AM that I got up so had to hurry to get to church.  I went over at
8:20 AM to set up chairs.  After church Mae put on a roast for dinner.  We
decided to learn a game we got in the Philippines so we played two games.  I
took a nap and then helped Mae with the last of the dinner preparations. 
Scott, Mishelle, Kylan, Ashley, Jeff and Gail came over for dinner.  Jeff and
Gail went home after we played a game of Mormon Bridge.  The rest of us watched
the First Presidency’s Christmas message before Scott and his family went
home.  Mae and I cleaned up a little and then I made my journal entry.  We
played a few games on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and read my scriptures and so went back to bed.  Mae got up and started her
washing.  I got up about 8 AM so was late getting started.  I got on the
internet and retrieved the forms to close out our investment with Western
Reserve Life.  We opened the account with them because of Robert Park.  I had
invested my retirement Tooele Army Depot of almost $8,000 with Beneficial Life
and after 3 years hadn’t made anything.  Robert talked me into investing with
him.  By the time I paid the penalties for early with draw I had $7,300 that I
deposited into WRL.  Then we had 9-11 which destroyed most investments and it
had never came back so I now get $3,400.  Great investment!  I left to get some
prices for the Hinton jog.  I went out to Intermountain Boat and Truck and
looked at the boat I had looked at earlier this Fall but decided I didn’t trust
the repair job.  They have another boat that looks very good but it would cost
me over $5,500 and that is a little high for me.  I ordered a mirror for Mae’s
birthday.  I also purchased the materials to install new lights over the fire
place and in the hallway.  I was able to get the one light above the fire place
installed before Tina Linderman came for dinner with us.  Tina told us that she
woke one night and felt that we were in danger.  She got out of bed and knelt
asking for our protection.  She wondered if that was the time we came so close
to an automobile accident.  We felt special to Tina as she told of the
experience.  After dinner we played some games.  It was about 10:30 when Tina
left.  I filled out my journal entry and we soon got ready for bed.  I did get
my home teaching report in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept most
of the night in the chair due to stomach problems.  I woke at 4 AM and it was
after 5 AM when I went back to sleep.  I then slept until 8 AM.  I spent most
of the morning working on the bid for Mr. Hinton.  I helped Bob put curb
warnings on Sherrie’s car.  I then spent the rest of the day installing new
light fixtures in the hallway.  I had just finished when it was time for Mae
and I to go Home Teaching to Sister Robin Walker but when we got to her home
she wasn’t there.  We came home and I cleaned up my mess while Mae fixed some
dinner.  There wasn’t much to watch on TV this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and after getting ready we went to Ogden where we changed our Social Security
check deposit from Wells Fargo to American First.  We also stopped at Kim’s
office to change our automatic withdraw to American First.  However he wasn’t
there so we went to the Temple and attended a session there.  We went back
after the session to Kim’s and caught him just as he was about to leave.  We
got the change made.  We next stopped at Wendy’s and got a hamburger and
fries.  We went to Best Buy to get some printer cartridges but they didn’t have
what we needed.  We went to Office Mac and found then plus a few other supply
items we needed.  Mae was on the computer, after we got home, getting ready for
a R. S. meeting this evening.  I started to change the light switch location in
our bedroom but ran into several wiring problems and was not able to change
it.  I was really quite frustrated before I quite.  We gave up on finding
anything worth watching on TV and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4
AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  So as to not disturb Mae, I set in the big
chair and finally got to sleep.  Mae then let me sleep until after 8 AM.  I
sent a e-mail to Richard Hinton and while I was on the internet saw that we had
received a e-mail from President Mercado of the Guimba District.  He told us
that Roger was not able to go to New Zealand as he had planed, due to
government interference.  I balanced the bank statement which took some time. 
Mae went visiting teaching.  I worked on an electrical project in the sunroom
but didn’t get it finished.  Shellie called and visited with us for a little
while.  I had to go to Home Depot for parts and stopped and picked up a gift
for Mae.  Bob and I took the generator to Alan Birch to see if he can get it to
work.  Mae and I watched two Christmas shows this evening.  We were late
getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I again woke
very congested so after being up for an hour I went back to bed until almost 9
AM.  Mae is still suffering with a rash that we think is an outbreak of
shingles.  She has an appointment to go into the Dr. on Monday.  We ate a light
breakfast as we will go with Bob and Carroll to Maddox’s for dinner in honor of
their 50<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary.  I was going to work on the
electrical but decided to stay warm.  We picked Irven and Sandy up at 12:15 PM
and met Bob, Carroll and Mark at Maddox’s.  Rich and Lois soon arrived.  We had
a very enjoyable time visiting and eating.  The food was very good.  After
eating we went to Irven and Sandy’s and played games.  It was fun to have Bob,
Carroll and Mark be with us.  Bob brought some brownies for refreshments, so he
stopped at a Maverick and bought me a frozen yogurt.   Mae and I left at 6:15
PM and went to Morgan where we attended a music recital that Emily participated
in.  It was very well done.  We went back to David and Shauna’s for
refreshments.  Shauna had got frozen yogurt for me so I guess I have had my
share of yogurt this evening.  We got back to Irven’s at 9:15 PM where we ate
some spagitti and salad.  We then played some more card games and visited.  Bob,
Carroll and Mark had gone home earlier.  It was almost mid-night before we got
home.  It has been a very enjoyable day.  During the past few days we have been
reading excerpts from Stephen A. Browning’s journal as compiled by Betsy
Browning.  We finished it this evening and have found it very enjoyable and
enlightening. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up
early and put the turkey bones from the High Priest party on to cook.  Later
when I got up they didn’t smell very good and when I tasted them they were
worse.  I throw them out and we got the bones from our Thanksgiving turkey out
and started over.  I haven’t felt very good today so I didn’t do much today.  I
did help Mae peel potatoes and cut up vegetables for the turkey stew.  Mae
attended a baby shower for Cassie Gall.  I watched a couple of shows on TV and
took a couple of naps.  This evening we went to the Ward Christmas party.  It
was ok but they didn’t put in a lot of effort.  With Mae’s encouragement, Bob
and Carroll’s children did get together to wish their parents a Happy 50<sup>th</sup>
Wedding Anniversary.  We went over to it after we left the Ward party.  We then
drove around and saw some of the Christmas lights.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and turned on my day planner when I realized that there was Stake High Priest
Quorum this morning at 7 AM.  I was glad that I had woke because I had time to
make it to meeting.  The meeting was very good and the speakers gave very good
talks.  After meeting I helped set up chairs for Sunday services.  We got that
done just in time for Priesthood meeting.  After meeting I went home and took a
nap.  Bob woke me and I went with him back to Sacrament meeting.  With the nap
I was able to stay awake during the meeting.  When we got home we warmed some
stew and had lunch.  I took a nap and then helped Mae get dinner ready.  I also
had time to type on my personal history.  David, Shauna and the children came
for dinner at 4:30 PM.  Dinner was very good.  We played a game of Settlers
before they left for home.  I took the garbage out this evening.  I helped Mae
clean up so we were able to relax before going to bed.</span></p>

early and after reading my scriptures I went back to bed.  Mae got up about
7:45 AM but let me sleep until almost 9 AM.  I fixed some breakfast but it was
11 AM before we ate it.  I checked the inter-net and found that my e-mail to
Richard Hinton did not go through so I resent it correcting the address.  I
worked on the electrical outlets in the sunroom and setup an outlet and one in
the sunroom that is operated with a switch and is protected by a GFI outlet. 
Mae worked most of the afternoon on her book club lesson for next week.  Bob
called and told us that there was a good show on so we watched that and I finished
my electrical project while the advertisements were on.  We also ate some
dinner.  This evening we watched a talk from the recording of General
Conference and we watched the movie “Saint’s &amp; Soldier’s”.  I made my
journal entry before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went to
the Temple with Bryce and Deanna.  After the session we ate lunch in the
cafeteria.  We enjoyed the opportunity to visit and when we took them home we
went in and visited a while longer.  We plan to go to the Temple next week with
them and after we will come to our place and share some of the presentations
that we made on our mission with them.  We will copy any they want to take with
them on their mission.  Bob and Carroll fixed dinner this evening of a cabbage
casserole.   Bob and I went Home Teaching at the Mitchell’s, then Mae and I
went home teaching to the Walker’s and then Bob and I went to the Johnston’s. 
We missed the Jackson’s as brother Jackson had to referee a basket ball game in
Logan this evening.  Mae watched a show on TV and when I got home I watched the
last half of it.  We relaxed and enjoyed the rest of the evening.  Mae talked
to Jackie this evening and she did quite well in her test that she was so
concerned about.  Mae also visited with her sister for a while.  I had time to
make my journal entry and play ½ doz. games on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
7:30 AM and after a normal morning I drove out to Grantsville to look at
Sandi’s patio door.  Sandi had forgotten to unlock the door so I had to call
her and she came over and let me in.  I replaced the weather stripping and
measured the lite opening.  I went into S.L. to Door &amp; Window Bargain, but
they were closed.  I called and left a message and then waited for over two
hours but no one called are came.  I came home and will have to check later. 
Mae was gone shopping when I got home.  At 5:30 PM I went over to the church
and helped set up chairs and tables for the Relief Society’s Christmas dinner
and program.  We had several High Priest that came and helped serve and cleanup
so it was quite an easy job to help with.  Mae went over to Scott &amp;
Mishelle’s and tended their children while Scott and Mishelle went to his
company’s Christmas party.  I watched a couple of shows on TV before Mae got
home.  </span></p>

and then after getting up we went to the Stare Café for breakfast.  I then took
Mae over for her to get a treatment at Dr. Bennett.  We stopped and got new windshield
wipers for the car and then stopped at Durk’s and paid my bill there.  I then
took Mae to Winegar’s market where she bought a few groceries while I took the
car through a car wash.  Winegar’s did have all that she needed so I took her
to Albertson’s.  After coming home I worked on our bank accounts and then went
down to the bank and got a casher’s check for Coast to Coast Awning to pay for
the awning when they come to install it Monday afternoon.  We received a check
from Western Reserve Life that closed out our investment with them.  We
invested $7,122.22 from my Tooele Army retirement with W.R.L. in 08/14/2000 and
now we get back $3,168.88.  I deposited that and the $886 from closing out our
savings account into our savings account with America First Credit Union.  We
are trying to get everything transferred from Wells Fargo over to America First
before the end of the year.  This evening we started watching a show but before
it finished Meliah and her children came over to visit.  We enjoyed their
visit.  I filled in my journal entry.  I completed the reading of the Book of
Mormon this morning and as always can say that I truly believe that book is of
divine origin and came forth through the Prophet Joseph Smith.  I fully accept
Joseph Smith as a Prophet of God called and ordained of God, having all the
gifts and powers attributed to him.  I know that the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints was restored to earth through the powers Joseph was given and
is the true and only true church of Jesus Christ on earth today.</span></p>

early for the bathroom and to read my scriptures.  I decided to start on the
New Testament and really enjoyed the first 4 chapters of Mathew.  I went back
to bed and Mae let me sleep until 8:15 AM.  Mae and I changed some of the
shelves in the shed and Mae straightened my things onto one set of shelves.  I
got the snowmobiles started and determined what I needed to buy for them.  I
had to go to Farmington and get them registered and pay back taxes on them as
we haven’t registered them sense we went on our mission.  We were going to go
down to Mike’s so we could attend a choirs program that Tayler was in but the
two little girls are not feeling well and we didn’t want to catch anything this
close to Christmas.  Mae called Georgia to see if they would like to come over
and play games.  They told us about a dance at Weber with a very good orchestra
so we went there and had a wonderful time.  Lindsey sang with a group as part
of the entertainment.  It was 11:45 PM when we got home, very tired but had a
wonderful evening.</span></p>

night.  I got up at 6:15 AM and got ready to go.  I let Mae sleep in but she
woke at 7:30 AM.  I was late getting away and found that the roads were snow
covered and traffic was slow.  It was 9:30 AM when I got to Mike’s.  We started
to go to Provo canyon but then we talked about it and changed to American Fork
canyon.  We had a very enjoyable time and the trails were very good.  We got
back to Mike’s just before 3 PM.  I got home about 5 PM.  we relaxed and

American Fork to be with David as he was ordained to the office of Teacher in
the Aaronic Priesthood.  He is sure a good boy and everyone seems to really
like him.  When we got back to their home David played three or four numbers on
the piano for us.  He is really talented with the piano.  Mike &amp; Becky
invited us to stay for dinner.  Becky had made a nice broccoli soup and hot
rolls.  We played a couple of games of marbles of which Becky and I were
partners and won both games.  It was 8:45 PM when we got home.  After taking
Mae in, I stayed out and shoveled the snow off the walks.  I made my journal
entry and then we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep well last night and set up in the chair.  I got up at 7 AM and after
eating some breakfast started to go to Bryce and Deanna’s.  Coast to Coast
Carport called and they won’t make it until tomorrow.  When I went out I had to
shovel walks again.  Bob came out and I helped get the snow blower going and he
finished the walks.  Bryce just had some questions and I spent a couple of hours
visiting with them.  Mae isn’t feeling well and when I got home she was
chilling.  I found the hot bag and heated it for her.  I had her start taking
the “Symptoms of Flue”, juice with vitamin C and Tylenol and any thing else
that might help.  She had very severe stomach cramps.  Carroll sent us two or
three items to try and they seemed to help.  Bob and I were going to put some
shelves in Sherrie’s house but Bob’s truck isn’t running very good.  We worked
quite a while on it and finally gave up.  I watched a couple of shows on TV
this evening.  Mae is feeling a little better this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
7 AM and while Mae showered I prepared oat meal cereal for breakfast.  We then
went to Dr. Francis for him to check the rash that Mae has had for over two
weeks.  He gave her some prescriptions to try to clear it up.  He felt good
with him and will probably use him as our primary physician.  While we were at
the Dr. Office, the installer from Coast to Coast Carport called and said he
will be late and probably will not get here until tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We just received work that
Uncle June (George Bushnell Jr.) died Monday, December 19<sup>th</sup> at
approximately 1 PM due to his tractor rolling over on him.  Georgia called us
to inform us of his death at 5:30 PM.  Mae called Sandi to let her know as she
was close to him.  Mae also called her Brothers to let them know.  We watched
two shows on TV this evening, 1<sup>st</sup> was “Holiday Inn” with Bing Crosby
and Fred Astair, the 2<sup>nd</sup> was “The Christmas Carol”.  We really
enjoyed those two shows.  Mae made divinity candy this evening.  I helped her
some but it was really hard not to eat some.  I did lick the spoons that I
used.</span></p>

sleep in until 8 AM.  Mae prepared breakfast of French toast and eggs.  Bob
called at 9 AM to let me know that there are a couple of shows on TV.  I put
the recorder on but am not going to set and watch shows all day.  I helped bob
take his pickup to the shop but it seemed to run ok after he started it this
morning.  I went on to the service station and filled my truck with natural
gas.  I went over to Sportsman Warehouse and looked at ice fishing equipment. 
Bob and I went down to Sherrie’s and put in a set of shelves for her.  Mae has
been busy getting ready for her meeting this evening.  I delivered plates of
candy to the Smith’s and Bodily’s but no one was at home at the Mcphie’s so Mae
gave it to Sister Mcphie at the book study group this evening.  I went up
stairs and watched a show on TV with Bob.  Mae’s evening went well.  I finished
filling out my journal entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae is
feeling quite a lot better this morning.  I was in a lot of pain during the
night, not so much with stomach pains as with pain in the joints and mussels. 
Mae had an hair appointment to get her hair cut, styled and permanent.  She
then went shopping for a while.  I mainly ended up watching two shows with
Jimmy Stewart in, “The Flight of the Phoenix” and a western one.  Mae got home
about 3 PM.  Scott and Mishelle brought Kylan and Ashley over so we can tend
them while Scott and Mishelle did some shopping.  At 6 PM Gary Nelson called to
inform us that Margie was killed in a automobile accident yesterday afternoon. 
A man possibly had a heart attack and crossed the center line missing one car
side swiping a second and hit Margie head on.  She died instantly.  We will
surly miss that friendship and have great sympathy for Gary and the family.  It
will be a sad Christmas with out her.  After eating some dinner we took Ashley
&amp; Kylan to see the decorations at the Ogden Park.  It was raining but we
walked around for a few minutes.  We also stopped at the Roy City offices and
saw their lights.  We noted that at all the city displays there is no
indication of Christ.  How sad this is and how Satan is winning.  We came home
and watched a video until Scott and Mishelle returned. We really enjoyed the
children and it helped Scott and Mishelle.  We watched a movie, that I had
recorded yesterday, before we went to bed.</span></p>

time.  I prepared breakfast and we talked to David on the phone.  Mae gave me a
<b><u>hair cut</u></b> this morning.  We decided to send some money over to the
Philippines to some of our friends there for Christmas.  I went to the grocery
store for a few items and sent the money.  Mae made crunch and yummy potatoes
for our family Christmas Party this evening.  We went to David’s getting there
at 4 PM.  All our family, except the Seymore’s was there including Nix and
Steve who came with Sandi and Chelci, were there.  We enjoyed a nice dinner and
then had a enjoyable program.  It was a special evening.  All my children
except Scott joined together and gave me a new fishing pole and reel.  Sandi
also gave me a figurine of a little old man fishing.  Nix talked to me alone
and asked if he could ask for my consent to marry my daughter.  I told him it
would be ok with me but it was Sandi’s decision.  I told him that my main
concern was Sandi’s happiness.  It was mid-night when we got home.</span></p>

didn’t feel like going to bed, so we stayed up and played a game of Rummy.  Mae
won the game.  We got to bed around 2 AM and slept until 7:30 AM.  We just laid
in bed and talked until 9:30 AM.  I prepared breakfast of ham, eggs and hash
browns.  We went to Kaysville and took some items to Georgia and Rick.  We then
went to Sportsman Warehouse and bought some ice fishing equipment.  We have had
several phone calls and made several phone calls concerning Margie’s death and
Uncle Jr.s death.  We went over to Sportsman Warehouse and bought a ice fishing
tent, auger, pole and rod holder.  This evening we went up to David and
Shauna’s to spend the night.  It was a very enjoyable evening.  While we were
visiting the front doorbell rang and when we answered it there was Santa
Clause.  He had candy canes for the children and wished each of then a Merry
Christmas.  He called each member of the family by name but David nor Shauna
know who it was.  After the children went to bed David and Shauna got the gifts
out and stuffed the socks.  It was an enjoyable evening but we didn’t get to
bed until almost mid-night.  Sandi called and told us that Nike had given her
an engagement ring witch I was already aware that he was going to for he had
ask me if it was ok with me last night.</span></p>

About 7:30 AM we got everyone downstairs to start opening presents.  It was a
fun morning.  At 9 AM we ate breakfast and got ready for Church.  We went to
Scott and Mishelle’s where we attended Church.  It was a very nice program
although I slept through most of it.  I was awake for President Craven’s talk
and it was very good.  We visited for a while with old friends from the ward. 
After getting back home to Scott &amp; Mishelle’s we opened gifts there.  it
was lots of fun to see how excited Ashley got over every gift.  At 2:30 PM we went
over to Jeff and Gail’s and gave them some gifts and saw what they had got.  We
didn’t get to Mikes and Becky’s until 4:30 PM.  it was fun to give them gifts
and see what they got.  We played some games and left for home about 9 PM.  We
had to bring every thing in and out them away.  I made my journal entry and we
went to bed.  It has been a wonderful Christmas being with our family.  We were
able to talk to our girls by phone.  </span></p>

AM but let Mae sleep until 7 AM.  Mae fixed breakfast and helped me get things
ready to go snowmobiling with Jeff.  Jeff came over here and by the time he
came I was about ready.  We stopped at Checker Auto and I bought a set of
chains for the truck, just in case.  We got up to the parking lot in Monte
Cristo about 10 PM.  We drove towards Hardware Ranch but just before getting
there we had trouble with one of the snowmobiles and turned back.  We loaded
the snowmobiles on the trailer and went down to Huntsville where we were able
to buy some gear oil for the snowmobiles.  We went back to Monty Christo and use
the snowmobiles for about another 2 or 3 hours.  We had a lot of fun and only
got stuck once and I did that.  It was almost 6 PM when we got home.  Mae and I
had some dinner and relaxed the rest of the evening.  Mae has been cleaning the
storage areas all day long.  Coast to Coast Carport inc. was to install our
carport today but Mae had to run and errand for a half hour about noon and that
is when they came.  I guess they will try again tomorrow.  We showered and were
just going to bed when Roy called and said they were in Tooele and will be here
shortly.  They got here about 11:30 PM so we didn’t get to bed until after
mid-night.</span></p>

time to go to the viewing and funeral of Margie Nelson.  We let Roy and Linda
sleep in.  We got there just as the viewing was starting.  Dennis and Eleanor
also Joan &amp; Ralf came and we were able to sit together.  It was so good to
see then and we set up a time to get together in October.  The viewing lasted
until 11:45 AM and the funeral, although good, went until almost 2 PM.  We came
home and I tried to get some things accomplished.  Bob brought us down some
biscuits and gravy for lunch.  I got the sky repaired on the snowmobile and
found out some service I need to do on them.  Roy and Linda had gone visiting
Linda’s mother.  I installed the mirror in the hallway that I bought for Mae’s
Christmas.  When Roy and Linda got home we visited most of the evening.  It was

We were there in time to go into the viewing and participate in the family
prayed.  Uncle George’s casket was of wood design and was very appropriate. 
The funeral services were very well done.  Uncle George died doing what he
wanted to be doing and did not have to suffer long or be in a hospital.  We
went to the cemetery with the family and returned to the chapel and ate lunch
with the family.  We took Georgia to the seminary in Bountiful where Rick was
working.  We got home about 4:30 PM.  We changed clothes and took Roy and Linda
with us to the Chuck-A-Rama in Salt Lake where we met and ate with all our
family except Shellie and Roy.  JaNae and Brad and Chelci also did not make
it.  We had an enjoyable experience being with out family in honor to Mae’s 65<sup>th</sup>
Birthday.  After eating Mae, Roy, Linda and I walked through Temple Square and
walked through.  The lights were beautiful and we enjoyed visiting as we
walking around.  We got home about 11 PM and soon went to bed.</span></p>

cakes this morning.  I worked on the snowmobiles this afternoon changing the
oil in the chain box and greasing it.  Bob cooked liver &amp; onions for lunch
at 3 PM.  I finished the snowmobiles up and then we Roy, Linda, Mae and I went

parking lot so that Roy could get use to driving the snowmobile.  We then drove
out on the South side of the road and road for another hour before going across
the parking lot and towards the Hardware Ranch.  We didn’t travel far as Roy
isn’t use to that kind of workout.  We came back to the truck and ate lunch
about 1:30 PM and then loaded up the machines and came home.  The roads were wet
and slippery all the way home so we traveled slowly.  When we got home Mae was
cooking dinner.  She invited Bob, Carroll and Mark down to eat with us.  We
visited as we ate and really enjoyed the evening.  After Bob, Carroll and Mark
went back upstairs, Roy, Linda, Mae and I played Mexican Dominoes.  It was

ok but quite tuff.  After eating we went up to Rick &amp; Georgia’s.  Lindsay
sang the song, “When They Begin the Beginning” that she will sing at a program
this evening.  Georgia, Rick, Linda, Roy, Mae and I then went to the Conference
center in Salt Lake to the New Years Eve program.  I wasn’t very thrilled over
the program and would have rather been some where else.  Something that I ate
must have had too much sugar in it because I had quite a lot of pain during the
program.  That program let out about 10:30 PM.  We got to Rick &amp; Georgia’s
before mid-night and watched the New Year come in on the TV.</span></p>
