<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I went to Randy’s and got a treatment.  As we
were visiting he said that they were going up to the cabin this week-end.  We
talked about Mae and I joining up with them.  Later I called him back and we
question if I feel well enough to do something like that.  I guess we won’t
go.  Mae stayed home and worked all day.  We watched a couple of movies on TV. 
Bob &amp; Carroll had new carpeting installed through out their upstairs.  It
sure looks nice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, March 02, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae and I went into the Social Security office
in Ogden this morning.  We corrected my address but Mae’s address was already
at the Clinton address.  We are not sure how that happened.  We next checked
about me getting the “B” option of Medicare and was told that I had to do that
before I turned 65 or pay a penalty for late registering.  I tried to explain
that we had came in before we left for our mission to sign up and was told that
we should just wait until we got home.  I guess I should have made more of a fuss
because she was the one that helped us before.  I remember her silly hair do
and the cross around he neck.  Oh well, I think I’m signed up now.  We tried to
find the phone company but can only call a phone number and get someone
somewhere and hope for the best.  There are some things I don’t like about this
modern world.  Mae went shopping this evening.  She called me as the car
stalled on her.  I had her move the battery cables and it started up and got
her home.  She got the quilt that was shipped to Scott’s.  We put it on the
bed.  It looks good but it isn’t custom fit to our mattress.  I worked on a
letter to President and Sister Brimhall while Mae was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, March 03, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 6 AM and tried to get away by 8 but
we were a little late getting away because I had to tighten the battery cables
on the car.  We took our tax papers over to Ed Sorenson for him to figure for
us.  We then came on down to American Fork getting to Mike &amp; Becky’s about
10:30 AM.  There has been a new sub-division, a new chapel and stop sign added
above Mike’s that had us confused for a while.  On the way down Mae was able to
call Jennifer with “OWS LOGISTIC, INC.” about the shipment we had sent from the
Philippines.  She needed us to fax her, a copy of the papers we had on the
shipment.  Mike was still at his office so Becky called him and he said that I
could fax them from his office.  By the time we got back to Mike’s, Jennifer
had called Mae and said she had faxed some information back to Mike’s office.  As
Mike &amp; Becky left they took me back to Mike’s office to get the
information.  I then had to get a Cashier’s Check and fax a copy, from the
bank, of the check to “OWS LOGISTIC, INC.” and then mailed the check to them. 
I got all that done and later Jennifer called Mae and said the fax did not go
through.  David helped me and we were able to e-mail a copy to Jennifer.  I
sure hope this whole thing is worth it.  I have Mae quite upset with me because
I haven’t been very happy about the whole situation.  I thought things went
better this evening.  I tried to help Mae with dinner.  David played the piano
for a while this evening.  We played a game with the children before Mae put
them to bed.  I tried to find a show on TV but I don’t know how to work this
electronic equipment but watched a BYU talk.  I fell asleep before Mae came to
bed.  I think Mae went to bed upset with me.  I sure feel like a square peg in
a round hole lately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, March 04, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are at Mike &amp; Becky’s and tending their
children.  The children have been very easy to tend and a joy to be with.  This
evening we took them to McDonald’s for ice cream and to let the little ones
play on the toys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, March 05, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We tended the children this morning.  I prepared
a rice casserole while Mae and the children cleaned the house.  Mike &amp;
Becky got home about 2 PM.  They had to leave again for a social at the school
district this evening.  Mike &amp; Becky brought me a frozen yogurt when they
came home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, March 06, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were able to sleep in as church doesn’t start
until 1 PM.  We attended with Mike and his family.  It was cooler as we walked
home after church.  After eating some dinner Mae &amp; I left for home.  We
stopped at Jeff &amp; Gail’s and visited with them for a little while.  They
taught us a new game.  I am not sure that I caught on very well.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, March 07, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We didn’t get in any hurry to get going this
morning as the phone company was to come and install our phone service.  We
received our new cell phones so got the old ones ready to mail back.  Bob said
the phone was hooked up but it didn’t work.  Mae &amp; I went to Salt Lake and
after some running around and another $25.00 was able to get our crates.  We
came home got them unpacked.  We decided to go to a movie at Kaysville but when
we got there the show we wanted to see was not on.  We came back to the Little
Orient and got something to eat.  We came home and I watched “Rocky II” while
Mae worked around the house.  Mike called us and he has found us a new Palm
Pilot.  We will get it when we go down tomorrow evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, March 08, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bob prepared breakfast for us of biscuits &amp;
gravy.  After breakfast Bob, Carroll &amp; I went to Home Depot and bought some
tile to re-face their fireplace.  On the way back, we stopped and visited with
Sandy (Irven’s wife).  They want me to do some work on their house for them. 
Although I didn’t feel that I had time to do it right now, Sandy just insisted
that I do it.  When we got back home, Bob &amp; I loaded the empty shipping
crates, and old set of matters &amp; springs onto Bob’s pickup.  We drove to
Sherrie’s and loaded a discarded Christmas tree and went to the dumps.  When I
got home I took a nap and then Mae &amp; I drove down to American Fork to
Mike’s.  On the way down, we stopped at Best Buy in Sandy and got a receipt for
the purchase of our computer, so we can now take it in and get it repaired. 
Becky had some dinner ready that we ate, after getting to their place.  We then
went to a basket ball game that David played in.  Davit is larger by a foot
than any of the other boys on his team and plays quite well.  He made over ½ of
the points for his team.  After the game we came home.  Mae talked to Georgia
most of the way home.  We stopped at the grocery store and picked up a few
items.  We also got gas before coming home.  Mae made a salad while I entered
my journal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, March 09, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After breakfast Mae went down to Randy’s and got
a treatment.  I gathered up a few tools, went to Wal Mart and bought some wall
mud and then went over to Irven’s and repaired some spots in their walls that
was caused by water coming in before we replaced the roofing.  There was also
some settling cracks.  I went down to Randy and got a treatment this
afternoon.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>            We didn't get up
extra early but I fixed breakfast while Mae talked to Shellie on the phone. 
After breakfast Bob and I traced the phone lines until we were able to correct
our phone lines.  Mae and I went over to the State Insurance and checked on the
program and found that I don't need it.  We then went to mail the old cell
phones and Mae realized that we should mail them by UPS.  We couldn't find the
office so was unable to mail them today.  Bob prepared lunch of liver &amp;
onions for us.  It was very good.  We took our computer over to Best Buy and
left it for repairs.  They may take up to two weeks to get it repaired.  We
went up to the Hospital and visited with Kaleesee, Kim &amp; Jeanenne's
daughter.  She has some health problems that they are working on.  Bryce was up
there so we got to visit with him.  Kim also came up so we visited him also. 
We then went to David and Shauna's and ate dinner with them.  Shauna had taco
salad and burritos.  That is a first for over two years.  We enjoyed the
children and then visited with David for a while.  I am entering my journal on
David's computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>            We tended David
&amp; Shauna's children as they left about 6 AM to go to Saint George with some
friends.  This afternoon I went into Ogden and mailed a package to T-Moble.  I
stopped at Big-Lot and looked at a bedroom set.  I also stopped at a store for
a few groceries.  Mae and I watched the first part of &quot;Seven Alone&quot;
before going to bed.  The children seem to do ok and went to bed ok this
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>            After getting up I
prepared breakfast while Mae took care of the children.  They had all slept
very good last night.  The morning went by quite well.  We took the children
and went into Ogden.  We stopped at McDonald's and ate lunch and let Tyler and
Emily play on the toys.  We then went to the Dinosaur Park and spent the
afternoon.  Mae bought a Grandparent pass for $50,00 for the year, but that
will let us bring up to six grandchildren and enter free anytime we want.  It
was an enjoyable afternoon as we went through the park seeing the displays and
feeding the fish.  We left just before 5 PM and came home.  We then prepared
dinner, ate, did the dishes and got the children into bed.  I read a couple of
stories to Tyler and Emily while Mae got Connor to sleep.  Mae &amp; I stayed
up and watched a show before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, March 13, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae was up quite a bit last night with the
children.  I didn’t sleep very well in fact I slept on the couch most of the
night.  We had a relaxed morning. After preparing breakfast and eating, I
helped do up the dishes.  Mae took Tyler and Emily with her to the first half
of Stake Conference.  I stayed home with Connor and got him to take a nap.  Mae
and the kids came home after the first 1st hour and let me go.  David and
Shauna got home just as I pulled in.  We visited and had dinner.  Mae and I
started home when Mae called Jeff.  We went over to their place.  David called
and said that we had forgot our vitamins and minerals so we had Jeff and Gail
go up with us to get them.  Jeff and Gail then came home with us and we gave
them their items from the Philippines.  We enjoyed the evening with them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, March 14, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in until 7 AM.  Mae did some washing
and we packed things to go to Mike &amp; Becky’s.  Bob and Carroll got a new
stove and they wanted us to see it.  It is really a nice stove and after see
theirs we decided that e would like one.  Bob will go through Grant and see if
he can get the same deal that they did. It was noon when we got away.  We
stopped at the Stare Café in Layton and had breakfast.  Mae ordered the Sr.
breakfast and I ordered a three egg with everything omelet.  We were completely
stuffed when we finished.  We stopped at Scott’s but no one was there.  We just
left their Temple Dish and charger in the door and came on to Mike’s.  We
enjoyed the evening with Mike’s family.  We enjoyed Family Home Evening with
Taylor giving lesson on the Word of Wisdom.   After the children went to bed
Mike, Becky, Mae and I played a new version of Sorry.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, March 15, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae and I slept in until 7:30 AM before getting
up and eating breakfast.  Mike had already been to Bishopric meeting ad was
about to go to work.  After breakfast Mae and I showered and got dressed.  We
enjoyed visiting with Becky.  Mae and I went down to Home Depot looking for
materials and just enjoyed looking around.  Mike took of work at noon.  He took
Mom and I out to eat at a Chinese Restraint, Becky had already eaten with the
little girls.  I tried to use Mike computer to update my journals.  The CD gave
me problems so Mike took me to the store and we bought a 128 MB Quick Drive. 
This really works nice and I can take this drive with me.  It will work on any
computer with a USB port.  Mike also helped me get the scriptures set up on my
Palm Pilot.  I think this will be a great feature to have.  This evening we
played a marble game that is a lot like “Sorry”.  It is a fun game.  We sure
enjoy being with Mike, Becky and the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, March 16, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up in time to eat breakfast with the
family.  Becky has been up and out walking early this morning.  Mike feels a
little bad that we are going back today.  I wish we would have had more time
also.  I have been thinking of some remodeling that would increase Mike &amp;
Becky’s house.  I am concerned as to the mess and length of time it would
take.  When we got home from Mikes the new stove that we had ordered had
arrived.  Mae went to Randy’s this evening for a treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, March 17, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I went down to Randy’s this morning at 8 AM and
got a treatment.  Mae and I went into Ogden.  We looked at some furniture at
Merchandize Discount Outlet, and then we went to Home Depot and bought three
Bar Stools.  We went up to Big Lot to look at their bedroom sets.  Mae liked
the Oak set so we purchased it.  We will have to get the Dresser from the
Layton store.  We drove to Grantsville getting there between 4 &amp; 4:30 PM. 
We just enjoyed visiting and eating with dinner with Sandi and Chelci.  This
evening the four of us set in the hot tub for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, March 18, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After eating breakfast and Sandi left for work,
I went to Tooele to price fencing for Sandi’s yard to keep her dog in.  I also
looked at a “Radio Fence” unit.  I suggested to Sandi, when she came home for
lunch, that that might be the best way and the cheapest way to go.  It does
take some time to train your animal.  She agreed so this afternoon Mae, Chelci
and I went back to Tooele.  We purchased a unit and then went to Wal Mart for some
other items.  When Sandi got off work we drove to JaNae and Brad’s home as it
is Dawson’s Birthday.  JaNae and Brad showed Mae and I their building lot. 
They hope to build this year.  We attended a Utah Cattleman’s association
meeting and Banquet, as Chelci had been asked to sing four numbers at it.  She
did very well with her songs.  We went back to JaNae’s for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, March 19, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sandi and Chelci were busy with practices for
the Grantsville Old Folks Sociable.  Mae sewed the hem on a dress for Sandi. 
Mae and I walked over to see the cars at a car show that is connected with the
Sociable.  It was fun to reminisce as we looked at some of those old models
that we remembered.  I got in the hot tub for a few minutes this afternoon. 
This evening Jeff &amp; Gail came out to attend the Sociable with us.  Nick
Bradley also came to the Sociable with us.  He is dating Sandi and it may get
serious.  At this point we feel ok with it.  Sandi danced in two numbers on the
program and Chelci sang one song.  The meal was also very good.  After eating
Jeff and Gail left as Jeff had school work to do.  The rest of attended the
dance and we enjoyed it.  We danced quite a while this evening and was tired
when we came home.  Mae &amp; I got in the hot tub again to heat out the
sourness from dancing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, March 20, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 6 AM with something beeping.  I
finally had to get up to find out what it was and found that it was one of our
phones that needed charging.  I didn’t get back to sleep but lay in bed until
time to get up for church.  We got up and fixed something to eat as Sandi &amp;
Chelci attended another ward where a friend of Chelci’s was reporting on his
mission.  Sandi got home in time to attend church with us.  We saw quite a few
that we still remembered in the ward.  Sandi fixed dinner for us.  After dinner
Chelci left to go back to Cedar City to school.  Mae &amp; I left to come home
about 5 PM.  We stopped at Scott’s and got our cross stitch that Emmy finished
and sent to us.  We also got my charger for my cordless drill and saw.  Shellie
called and said they have sick children and maybe we had better rethink our
trip right now.  We stopped at Jeff and Gail’s for a few minutes to drop off a
wedding gift for Gail’s sister.  Gail gave Mae the cookies she had bought
through the school.  Bob came down to visit and bring us a package for us.  It
was our computer that Toshiba repaired for us.  They got most things repaired
and told us to order a new battery for it.  I spent the evening getting my
journal caught up to date.  Mae called Shellie and it sounds like she and Roy
are having some problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, March 21, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae went down to Randy’s and got a treatment
this morning.  She then went shopping for a few groceries.  Bob and I got my
pickup off the stands and hooked up the battery.  It seems to run ok.  Bob had
a investment salesman come and talk to him about moving some of his savings. 
Bob ask if I would listen in as he has a hard time hearing.  I don’t know how
to advise him but it sounds pretty good.  This afternoon Bob had a Brother from
the Ward come over with his pickup.  He took us into the Big Lot to get our
bedroom set.  We then had to go to the Layton store to get the dresser.  I
tried to pay him for his time and gas but he refused to accept anything.  This
evening Mae, Bob and I set the bedroom set up.  We got it set up and Mae got
most things transferred into the new drawers.  I was tired when we finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, March 22, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I went down to Randy’s for a treatment this
morning.  We have decided to go to Arizona so while I was gone Mae got things
packed.  We left about 11:30 AM and drove to Kanab.  There we stayed with Judy
and Paul Giles in Kanab.  Judy was Hendrick Brandenberg wife before he was
killed in an automobile accident.  We enjoyed visiting with them this evening. 
Judy prepared a wonderful meal of homemade chicken noodles for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, March 23, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and left by 7:30 AM and traveled to
Page Arizona where we stopped for breakfast.  A snow storm had passed through
at 3 AM and there was snow or slush on the road as we traveled.  After eating
breakfast we filled the car with gas and traveled on to Chandler Arizona.  We
got to Shellie and Roy’s about 3:30 PM.  We sure enjoyed visiting with all the
family.  The children have all grown quite a bit but Jase has changed the
most.  Garrett went with me to the store and I let him drive.  He had a few
problems but is doing fair in his driving.  Roy came home early and started
getting things ready so we can take the quads out in the desert tomorrow.  
Irven called and talked to me for a few minutes.  Garrett worked with me on my
computer and it is interesting how smart he is on the computer.  We were up
until after mid-night visiting and getting the toy-hauler loaded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, March 24, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke up about 7 AM and showered.  Shellie had
breakfast about ready.  Roy went to work for a while this morning.  He came
home about noon and we got things finished packed and left for the sand dunes. 
We went just across the California border so it took over 3 hours to get
there.  We spent quite a while trying to find others we were to camp with. 
When we found them and tried to go where they were we got stuck in the sand. 
With one of them helping with his truck we were able to get out.  We decided to
set up camp in a different area.  It was late so we set up, cooked dinner then
set up around a camp fire for a while before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, March 25, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke during the night with stomach problems
and had to sit up for a while.  We were late getting up this morning.  Most of
the day was spent ridding sand buggies, quads (four wheelers), playing games
and visiting.  The boys gave Mae and I rides and we enjoyed being with them. 
Mae and I went for a walk and as we walked we discussed the amount of money
spent on entertainment and toys compared to the little the Filipinos have.  We
are truly rich Americans as the Filipinos say.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, March 26, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 7 AM and soon everyone else was
up.  After breakfast we played games while all the rest went riding.  We spent
a couple of hours with the children hunting Easter Eggs.  Garrett was the one
that hid the eggs and the other three boys sure had fun finding them.  Shellie
and Mae made Devil Eggs with several of the eggs.  Roy and Shellie went for a
long ride into the higher sand dunes with the quads.  We packed up when Roy and
Shellie returned and left for home about 4:30 PM.  We stopped in Yuma and ate
at the Carl’s Jr.  Roy also stopped to dump the waste, clean out the tanks and
get fuel.  It was 9:30 PM when we got home and after min-night by the time we
unpacked, showered and got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, March 27, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was 7:30 AM when we woke up.  We got up and
prepared breakfast of French toast.  After breakfast Shellie had hidden Easter
Baskets for all the family.  It was fun as we all tried to find where she had
hidden them.  Shellie is very concerned that everyone receives a nice Easter
Basket.  We attended meetings with Roy and his family.  I fell asleep during
the speakers.  When we separated for Priesthood classes, I met a Brother Larsen
who had served his mission in the Angeles mission in 1987.  We visited the full
time of Priesthood classes.  We helped prepared dinner and we ate out by the
swimming pool.  It was very relaxing.  After eating Shellie, Roy, Mae &amp; I
visited for a while.  We spent time playing with the children.  At 7 PM Roy and
Shellie called the family together for Family Home Evening.  We enjoyed their
Home Evening and played a game with the children.  After the little children
went to bed we watched the show “The Passion of Christ”.  It was really
dramatic in the betrayal of the crucifixion of Christ.  I did feel that the
resurrection was skipped over very lightly.  We discussed it for a while after

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and helped prepare breakfast.  Garrett
was on the internet so Mae checked our e-mail and had several that were there. 
Most were forwarded messages so she just deleted them.  I called Wells Fargo
and found out the pass words to get into our account.  I was able to pull up a
statement but had problems printing it off on Shellie’s computer.  Garrett
finally got it off.  I worked most of the day getting the statement to
balance.  Shellie read from the scriptures each evening with the children. 
Part of the time Roy is there also.  This evening he was getting the Toy Hauler
taken back to their storage lot.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were late getting up and going.  The boys had
school today so they were gone before we got up.  We visited quite a while this
morning about the Gospel and the purposes of life with Shellie.  We took
Shellie’s red car and the Expedition to have them washed.  The Expedition will
not be finished until tomorrow.  We used the red car and went shopping at
Kohl’s and Costco.  Mae and I bought several items of clothes for each of us.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up early and left for Utah by 5 AM.  We
went by way of Page and then cut over to St. George at Zion’s.  We went to Aunt
Joy’s and had a wonderful visit with her.  We tried to call Uncle Van but
couldn’t get them.  We drove to Fillmore and stayed with Joyce and Bill
Stoddard.  We stayed up until almost mid-night visiting with them.  We enjoyed
talking about the experiences both couples have had on our missions.  </p>
