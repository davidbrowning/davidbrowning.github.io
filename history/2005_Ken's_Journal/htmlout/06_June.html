<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up in
time to have breakfast with the family.  Bob called just as we started to eat
so I visited with him while the rest ate.  After breakfast I showered and
washed the medication from my face.  I laid down on our bed and fell asleep for
a while.  Mae &amp; Shellie were playing Rummy Cube when I got up.  We went out
to eat at </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Applebee’s for lunch.  Roy
met us there.  After we finished Shellie took us to a place for ice cream.  I
could not enjoy the ice cream but Mae, Shellie and Jase did.  When we got back
home Shellie put a good movie on that we really enjoyed.  It was “The
Majestic”.  When the movie finished we enjoyed a very good soup that Shellie
had made.  We did some packing as we will leave at 4 AM for the airport.  This
evening we did some figuring on the get together on the 4<sup>th</sup> of July.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
3 AM and were at the Airport before 5 AM.  We were able to exchange our tickets
and left on the 7:55 AM flight to Salt Lake.  Bob picked us up and we went to
the mortuary.  I changed clothes there as Bob brought me my suit.  Charles
Bottom was there and I visited with him for a while.  Ronny and his wife Cindy
was there.  It was very good to see him again.  I was very excited at the
support that was there.  Rich and Lois also came down.  The funeral was not a
traditional funeral but a good by to Sara.  Blake Nuffer, an Uncle gave the
Family Prayer.  He made just a few remarks before the prayer and did a
excellent job.  Jason and the children are sure having a difficult time of it. 
Time was given for any one that wanted to speak may do so.  Jason’s father
stood and I was concerned as he looked very crude and he spoke that way but
what he said needed to be told.  Sara and Jason were married at age 16 and they
dropped out of school.  He said that when Jason told him that they were getting
married, he asked Jason if he had got her pregnant.  Jason said no and he told
him he was a liar.  He then said that they proved him wrong on that account. 
He said that a year or two later Jason and Sara sent him the best present ever
when the sent him a copy of both of their Graduation certificates.  Mae and I
road with Rich and Lois to the cemetery and to the family dinner at the church
house.  They are sure a special couple and sure support the family in all they
can.  We thought of going up to the hospital to see Irven but time was short
and Rich and Lois had to drive home tonight.  Mae and I picked up the door for
Cherrie while we were in Salt Lake.  When we got home we were beat so we lad
down and took a nap.  However we slept for almost three hours.  We got
something to eat and went grocery shopping at 11 PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
until 8 AM.  Mae got up about 6:30 AM.  Bob prepared breakfast of biscuits and
gravy for us.  Bob and I worked in the yard most of the day.  Mae helped quite
a bit but she was also getting food ready and cleaning the house.  This evening
Mae and I went to a wedding reception in the Country Creek Ward building.  We
enjoyed visiting with many from the ward while we were there.  We stopped on
the way home and got a few more groceries.  I was quite upset or discouraged
when we went to be.  It just seems that selling the house was a very big
mistake.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We
spent the morning getting ready for a family party in honor of Jeff’s
graduation.  Bob and I finished connecting a light on the west side of the
house with motion detection.  Mae and Gail went to a Wedding Shower for
Charity.  I took a short nap while she was gone.  This afternoon we had all of
our family here except for Shellie’s family, JaNae, Brad and their baby.  Sandi
brought Jaden &amp; Dawson with her.  Trent, Anna and their family also came
for a little while but left before we ate.  We really had a good time.  We
played games of Hide &amp; Seek, Horse Shoes, Frisbee, Soccer, Kick The Can, we
visited and ate, also built a Bon Fire and cooked Marsh Mellows.  To close the
day we set the projector up outside and some of us stayed and watched the movie
“Pirates”.  It became very cooled and we had to bring out blankets to keep
warm.  Other than that the weather was just perfect.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Last night
Bishop Steadman called me and asked if Mae and I could come to his office in
the morning.  I got the time wrong so we went at 8 AM and had to come back at
8:30 AM.  I was called to serve as Ward Employment Chairman.  Of course I
accepted the call although I don’t know much about it.  I was sustained in
Sacrament meeting set apart after the block meetings.  Bob and Carroll invited
us for dinner.  Both Mae and I took a nap this afternoon.  We went outside and
picked up items that had been left out from last night.  We ate a light super
before going to bed.  I had to sleep on pillows to prop me up in order to
sleep.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night so Mae let me sleep in until 6:30 AM.  I had to
hurry and didn’t get to Jeff’s until 8:30 AM.  We worked all morning running a
cable for their computer hookup from the upstairs to the basement.  As the
basement was finished that was quite difficult.  We finished at 12:30 PM and I
was late getting to Randy’s.  Randy and I left for his cabin.  We measured the
roof and figured the needs to put on new metal roofing.  We also found that there
was a water leak in the cabin and fund it to be coming from a fitting in the bathroom
wall.  It was almost 7 PM before we returned to Randy’s house.  I came home
very tired and after eating I figured on Randy’s material needs.  Jeff helped
me figure the 3<sup>rd</sup> side of a Right Triangle.   It was late when we
went to bed but we watched one show of the Cartwright’s.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae let me
sleep until almost 8 AM.  She had got up at 7 AM.  Mae went into the Doctors
for test this morning.  I worked on material list and prices for David &amp;
Randy’s jobs.  This afternoon Mae and I went to Salt Lake to see Irven.  Sandi
met us at the hospital.  Irven has been moved to another part of the hospital. 
He doesn’t look much better to me although most of the swelling has gone down. 
We stayed and visited with Sandi after going to the parking lot.  She is having
a rough time knowing what she should be doing.  I was late getting to my Stake
Employment Specialist meeting but it was worth while.  Mae has been studying
for her lesson tomorrow evening.  I visited with Bob &amp; Carroll for a while
this evening.  Life is a challenge no matter who you are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 4
AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I figured on Randy’s roof for his cabin. 
Mae went down to Randy for a treatment this morning.  She then went over to the
nursery and bought some flowers.  I took a nap before lunch.  After we ate I
went to Amco Block in Salt Lake and got some information on laying block.   I
then went to Ogden and took a set of David’s plans to get a truss bid.  Bob and
I had scheduled to go Home Teaching this evening but Bob questioned if it was
tonight or tomorrow so he called our family and they would like to have us come
tomorrow evening.  As Mae was having the R.S. Book Club this evening I stayed
upstairs and watched a show on TV.  Mae was talking to David when I came down. 
David thinks Connor may have the same health problem that I do.  I visited with
David for a while.  We started to bed but then got up and called Terry to see
if we could come up to their place.  We set a date to go to Alaska on the 21<sup>st</sup>
of July and return on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of August.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as we were so late getting to bed.  After breakfast I worked on the estimate
for David’s garage.   I got on the internet and found us some airline tickets
to Alaska.  David stopped into the hospital to visit Irven.  He called us and
said that Irven was responsive and he felt that he is doing well for what he
has gone through.  Georgia came over with a friend of hers from North
Carolina.  We visited until after 4 PM.  Bob and I went home teaching this
evening to the Johnson’s.  There was a cute show on TV this evening so we
watched it.  I called Roy and Linda to let them know how Irven is doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast, I had Bob help me haul the picnic tables back to the shed and store
them.  We had a hard time getting the camp trailer out.  We washed the roof of
it and opened it up to be sure it is still ok.  I went to Farmington and got
the trailer registered.  Mae has been getting some things out of my work
trailer.  I met Jeff at 1:45PM and we drove down to American Fork.  There we
went with Mike and David to a golf course near by and went golfing.  We played
“Best Ball”, that is where you pair up in two’s and you play from the best ball
position of your two shots.  Most of the time we used Mike position but I did
have a couple of hits and a couple of good putts.  It was really a nice day and
we really enjoyed being together.  Mae and Gail came down with Shauna and the
children a little later.  We ordered pizza, ate and played games.  It was a
wonderful afternoon and evening.  We didn’t get home until after 11 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went to the Ogden Temple.  We met Grenn and Kathleen Clark there at the
Temple.  We went through the 8 AM session, as that was our Ward Temple session
for this month.  Grenn and Kathleen were the Session Witness’s.  After the
temple session the four of us went out to eat at Denny’s in Layton.  We had a
very enjoyable visit.  Jeff came over to the house about 2 PM and I showed him
how to use my paint sprayer.  Just before he left I asked him to help me close
up the tent trailer.  He asked me if I had repaired the bed that was broken.  I
said that I didn’t know a bed was broken.  He said that while we were gone that
they had taken the trailer on a camping trip and one bed was broken.  I checked
and it was broken.  I was sure glad he had told me about it because I was able
to buy some pop rivets and repair it.  Had I taken it camping I wouldn’t have
had the tools or the parts to repair it.  Mae and I went shopping for Birthday
gifts, and then I took her out to eat at “Hello China” and then grocery
shopping.  When we got home and put things away, we watched the movie “The
Rookie”.  Mae had bought the DVD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We attended
the regular block of meetings.  I forgot that I was to be at the church early
to setup chairs.  After meetings we came home and got some lunch.  I had
changed in to a bath robe for comfort.  We decided to set out in the Sun Room
and read for a few minutes while I let my lunch settle.  Brother Smith, our
Ward High Priest Group Leader came over to visit with me about Brother Dale
Zweifel.  After visiting with him we continued to relax in the Sun Room and I
fell asleep.  I woke to hear Mae talking to Sister Smith just outside the
door.  I decided that I had better go into the bedroom and take a nap if I
wanted to be that comfortable.  I caught my journal up before we went over to
Scott and Mishelle’s for dinner and to celebrate Kylan and Ashley’s Birthdays. 
We enjoyed the evening and got home just before 19 PM.  I finished my journal
and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I started working
on David’s plans but then Bob came down and needed his rear brake pads replaced
so that took the rest of the morning.  Bob fixed lunch for us and then I
started getting things ready to go fishing tomorrow.  Mae has been working on
the items in the trailer and several times I would help her.  At 5 PM I took
the camp trailer down to Randy’s and got the truck, the boat and the camp
trailer hooked up and checked out the lights.  I went to the grocery store and
got food and water for the trip.  I also stopped and got ice and fishing
worms.  It was after 8 PM when I got home.  We ate some super and finished up
for the night.  Well, Mae still kept putting things away.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
3:15 AM and was down to Randy’s before 5 AM.  We left for Strawberry reservoir,
pulling Randy’s boat and my camp trailer.  Randy and I were talking about a
possible business venture as I came to the Coleville Evanston junction and not
thinking I took the Evanston exit.  We had to go several miles before I could
get turned around.  It was 8 AM before we got to Strawberry and another hour
before we got a camp site and the boat on the lake.  When we got ready to start
fishing I realized that we didn’t have the worms.  I bought some at the Marina
shop.  Fishing was slow but we came in at 1PM with four nice fish.  We had
turned loose 3 or 4 fish that were over 16 inches, as the fishing regulations
on Strawberry are if a fish is a cut throat it must be under 16” or over 21” to
keep.  Most of what we caught was between those measurements.  Randy had caught
a very nice 18” fish and sure hated to turn it loose.  We went to camp and
cooked up those fish for dinner.  After eating we took a nap.  I couldn’t find
the worms that I had bought so we went with what I had bought this morning.  We
went back this evening and at the suggestion from the lodge operator we tried
fishing with minnows.  I caught a beautiful fish that was just less than 21”
and it sure made me sick to turn it loose.  We finished up with three nice fish
that we ate for super.  It was after 9 PM before we got off the lake this
evening.  By the time we cooked dinner, ate and got ready for bed it was 11
PM.  I hadn’t been asleep long when I woke with a leg cramp.  I had to get up
with that.  I was woken with wind and rain.  The wind was really hard but I
finally got back to sleep but was again woken with severe lightning and thunder
and then heavy rain.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4
AM to use the bathroom.  We fixed some breakfast of fish and eggs before going
out fishing again.  It started out slow but we got in to some good action
although most had to be released because of being over 16 inches.  We quit and
left the lake about 9 AM.  With taking down the camp trailer and stopping in
Heber for a frozen yogurt, it was 12:45 before we got to Randy’s.  Randy had a
couple waiting for him to give them treatments so I had to unload and put away
everything.  When I got home I was really tired.  Bob fixed lunch for us and I
was so tired that I took a nap in the recliner after eating.  Before taking a
nap I did set up the camp trailer so it could cry out before we stored it.  Mae
had a busy afternoon and evening.  She took a Birthday gift to Kylan and then
tried to attend an Eagle Court of Honor for _______, but we had the time wrong
and she was too early.  She then attended a Relief Society summer party.  When
she came home I got up and put the camp trailer down.  I waited for Mae to get
ready for bed and again fell asleep in the recliner.  </span></p>

5 AM and after going to the bathroom I caught up my journal.  I let Mae sleep
in until 7 AM.  We didn’t get away until 10:15 AM and then we stopped at the
bank and transferred some money out of savings to our checking account.  We got
to Rich and Lois’s at 1 PM.  Lois had dinner ready for us when we got there. 
We visited, watched Rich &amp; Lois finish sewing a quilt, and watched a
“Little House the Prairie” series from a DVD.  Rex and Linda came over this
evening and we played “Mormon Bridge”.  Elise came home shortly after we
started playing and joined with us.  We vision for a while after Rex and Linda
left and then read from the Book of Mormon.  I made my journal entry and then
took a shower before going to bed.</span></p>

and was up before Mae woke up.  Rich &amp; Lois prepared breakfast.  It was
after 9:30 AM before we got away.  Rich and Lois went with us to see our
property in Stare Valley.  After spending some time at Star Valley we went to
Thayne and stopped at the cheese factory and had lunch.  We tried to fine a
Maverick station so we could buy a frozen yogurt.  We went to the RV shop in
Chubbich and got Rich’s RV.  While we were there Mae bought me a recliner for
Fathers Day.  We stopped and bought 4 frozen yogurts at a Maverick Station on
Center street.  We set in the RV and played games while we ate the yogurt. 
When we got home we ate dinner and then Mae and I showed pictures to several of
the family.  It was almost mid-night before we got to bed.  It has been a very
enjoyable day to be with Rich and Lois and several of there family.</span></p>

decided to go see Irven instead.  He really looks good and was very alert and
visited with us for 1 ½ hours.  I was sure relived to see him looking so well. 
We then stopped at Maddock’s and had dinner before coming on home.  We unpacked
and Mae went grocery shopping.  I put an exercise machine together and with
Bob’s help got the picnic tables brought up.  Mae prepared food for tomorrow.</span></p>

46<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary.  We slept in until almost 7 AM and then
had to hurry to get to the church in time as I was to help set up chairs. 
Meetings went well.  After getting home we had some lunch and I set in my new
recliner and took a nap.  Mae was busy all afternoon getting things ready for
dinner this evening.  The kids started to come about 5:30 PM.  Jeff, Gail,
Scott, Mishelle and the kids came.  They gave me a collection of John Wayne
movies on DVD’s.  David, Shauna and the kids gave me a Leatherman’s folding
tool set.  We started cooking the meat and started to eat when Sandi, Chelci,
Nix and his son Logan came.  Sandi gave me a nice wind breaker.  We had a very
enjoyable evening.  David gave Mae a ride on his motorcycle before he left. 
David and Shauna are quite worried about Connor’s health.  I wish they had more
fait in the Lord and also not so much in the medical knowledge. Jeff wants to
go up to see our property so we set a date of next Monday and Tuesday to go. 
After all the family left we set out in the lawn chair and just enjoyed to
evening.  Mark came home from having dinner with his son and wife.  We visited
with him for awhile.  It was late when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
although I hadn’t slept very well.  I fixed some breakfast and after eating
called Sandi to see if she would like me to install the mud flaps on her
truck.  I also asked her about going to Uncle June’s when Vinita has an
operation.  She isn’t sure just what is happening with that.  When I told her
that we were going up to Star Valley next Monday, she asked it she could go
with us.  I said that we would be glad to have her come.  Bob come down and
brought me a letter from Shirley Hatch and his wife.  They are serving a
mission in the Philippines and told of going to Banaue.   I did some work on
the material take off on David’s plans.  Bob prepared lunch for us of liver and
onions.  Time seems to go by fast and I became discouraged.  I went over to
Home Depot and got prices on most of David’s materials. I went over to Sam T.
Evens to look for a bed lid for my pickup but he was closed when I got there. 
I also stopped and filled the pickup with fuel.  Mae had dinner ready when I
got home.  She was also watching “Perry Mason” on TV so we watched the rest of
it.  I filled capsules with my Mannatech products as we were completely out of
pills.  It was after 11 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM and let Mae sleep in.  After loading tools I came in and prepared some
breakfast.  Bob and I worked at Cherie’s installing a patio door.  The fellow
that was going to install the steps is out of town now so we spent some time
trying to decide how Cherie would like to have the steps built.  We were able
to get the door installed and the inside trimmed before we quite.  We came home
in time to hurry and shower and then go Home Teaching to the Mitchell’s.  Mae
had dinner ready when we got back.  After dinner I figured the material for
Cherie’s patio and then Mae and I watched the first of the John Wayne movies on
the DVD that the kids gave me for Fathers Day.   It was one of the early movies
made shortly after sound was added to movies.  We enjoyed it and had a good
laugh.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 AM and Mae got up about 6:20 AM and prepared breakfast for me.  Bob and I
left at 7 AM and went over to Home Depot and picked up the material to build
the back steps at Cherie’s.  We didn’t get down to Cherie’s until almost 10
AM.  Bob fixed us some dinner but we only stopped a few minutes to eat lunch. 
We worked until almost 6:30 and then had to pack up all of the tools.  We
didn’t get home until 7:05 PM and Brother Thompson came Home Teaching and
Bishop Niederhauser came with him this time.  We met with them upstairs so they
were able to visit all three families with one visit.  Bob cooked some dinner
for us and while he did that I put all the tools away.  After eating Mark and I
stayed and visited for quite a while.  It was after 10 PM when I came
downstairs.  Mae has been busy all day cleaning storage and closets.  She is
really an organizer.  I had to take a shower before going to bed, plus eating
so late I had to stay up for a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Sandy and
Mark came over this morning and I helped them load all their Snowie equipment
and then I took it over to their place.  I took my plumbing torch and parts so
that I could repair a broken water line.  The area that was broken was easy to
repair but then I found a fitting that was leaking.  That was a pain to repair
but with persistence I succeeded.  I took my boots in to the repair shop to get
them repaired.  Mae had left to go to the hospital to have a mammogram test by
the time I got home.  I fixed something for lunch and then Bob and I took some
material back from Cherie’s job and then went into Ogden to look at a top for
my pickup.  It looks as though they will cost me about one thousand dollars. 
That is more than what I wanted to spend.  I took a nap when I got home.  Mae
woke me and I ate some dinner and then went over to Scott’s and helped him
install a new air conditioner.  We didn’t get the electrical done for it but
quite for the night.  I was 10:30 PM when I got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and went to Scott &amp; Mishelle’s.  Mae tended the children while Scott
&amp; Mishelle did a wedding video for a couple.  I finished the installation
of the air-conditioner that I started last night.  After I got that finished I
laid down on the floor and took a nap.  We took Kylan and Ashley over to
McDonalds for a ice cream and to play for a few minutes.  I went over to the
health store and got a couple of items and then went back to get Mae and the
children.  Scott and Mishelle got home so we took the children back.  We came
home and got ready to go up to Preston to the Hyer’s.  Brother and Sister
Maharry and Brother and Sister Clark came about 2 PM and we all road up to
Preston together in the Maharry’s car.  The Hyer’s have a lovely cabin or more
like a second home.  We had a very enjoyable evening eating and visiting.  The
Hyer’s took us over to see their daughters home, that is being built.  I was
not impressed but had bad feelings of such a huge house and the great expense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
early and went walking with some of the other sisters.  Grin went walking by
himself and didn’t get back before the rest of us were ready to eat breakfast. 
After eating we decided to go looking for him.  Charles took one four wheeler
and I took a second one.  We went different directions looking for him.  I
started to go around the lake, but about half way around, my four wheeler,
quite running.  I think it has a clogged fuel filter.  I tried to call Mae but
her phone wasn’t working.  As I was trying to decide what to do a man stopped
and offered to drive me back to Charles and Karen’s.  We met Charles and I went
with him.  We went back to try to get my machine running.  We couldn’t get it
to run so left it and went on around the lake.  Grin was back to the cabin when
we got there.  We had to get a trailer and go after the four wheeler.  When we
got back to the cabin this time Roland said that he had a flat tire on his
car.  We removed the tire and took it into Preston and got it repaired.  We
spent about an hour looking at the antiques of Charles’s and the morning was
gone.  We had a wonderful diner of grilled steak and halibut and all the
trimmings.  After dinner it was time to come home.  This evening Mae and I
worked on the tent trailer to get it ready to take on Monday.  Mae was able to
clean up the dirt that was on the upholstery and make it look good again.  We
also watched a show that was on the Hallmark channel and it was very good.  I
caught up my journal and then we took showers and went to bed very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 6:30 AM and then got up and went to church.  Meetings were very good. 
Bob and Carroll prepared dinner and we ate about 12:30 PM.  Bob, Carroll, Mae
and I drove up to Logan to see Irven.  When we got there Irven, Sandy and Mark
were at church.  Irven is looking very good and said he is starting to ear
light foods.  He is starting to use a wheelchair.  We visited a while and then
played three hands of “Knock”.  I am really impressed at his progress.  We came
back home and then Mae and I went over and had dinner with Jeff, Gail and
Gail’s mother.  After eating we played a game of Croquet in the back yard. 
Marcie had made cream puffs and had filled them with chocolate sugarless
putting.  They were sure good.  I let Mae off at home and then I went down to
Randy’s and got my fishing equipment.   Mae packed some things for tomorrow. 
It was after 10 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
started packing.  Bob prepared breakfast of biscuits and gravy for us.  Sandy
and Jeff came over and ate with us.  We left for Wyoming about 9 AM.  It was an
enjoyable trip and as we drove Mae read from the book “Porter Rockwell”.  We
took Sandi’s pickup as it has four doors.  She also took her dog with us.  When
we got up to Star Valley we decided not to stay in a camp ground but drove up
in the hills South of Bedford.  Sandi, Jeff and I went fishing but didn’t have
very good luck.  I caught one nice trout but that was it.  We looked for
another stream to fish in the morning but they were all too high with the
spring run off.  We had a nice evening as we played games and visited.  Sandi
lost a card and we could not find it.  That really puzzled us trying to find
what happened to it.  Somewhere Sandi had also dropped her cell phone and we
couldn’t find it.  It was cold tonight but the tent trailer made it nice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as we didn’t think it would be worth while to try fishing again.  We had Mae
read from the book while we prepared breakfast.  By the time we ate a nice
breakfast and packed up it was time to head for home.  We stopped in Coalville,
trying to find Sandi’s cell phone but didn’t find it.  Mae again read most of
the way home.  We got home at 5 PM so I had to hurry to get ready and pick up
Randy and drive to Salt Lake.  Randy and I attended a seminar put on by National
Grants Conference.  We each purchased a membership in the program that cost us
$999.00.  It was 12:30 AM before I got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I thought a
lot about the seminar during the night and called Mike this morning and ask him
if he could find anything about the companion the inter-net.  He later called
me back and was not to encouraged with what he found but could not say that the
program was a bad deal or not.  I also went over to Jeff’s, where he and I got
on the inter-net and tried to find out what we could about the program.  We
weren’t very impressed with what we found as we couldn’t find very much.  I
decided not to keep the program and so I called the company and said I wanted
to return the material.  They told me how to send them back.  I will do that
tomorrow.  I cleaned out the tent trailer and got it closed up.  I visited with
the neighbor to the west for a few minutes this evening.  We decided to watch a
John Wayne movie this evening.  We put on one that was quite short and got a
kick out of it.  These are the first movies that John Wayne made and they are
quite comical.  The second one we played lasted 3 hours and we didn’t think it
would ever end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went down
to Randy’s and got a treatment at 8:30 AM.  It was almost 10 AM when he
finished.  He really found some sore spots today.  I took the seminar books to
the UPS and mailed them back to the company.  Randy talked to his son-in-law
about the program and they decided to return their set also.  I went back down
to Randy’s and helped him get them returned.  Mae has been busy packing and
preparing for the trip to Arizona tomorrow.  I helped her some.  Roger Sylvia
sent us an e-mail asking us for money for his brother-in-law.  I e-mailed him
back and said that we couldn’t.  This evening we drove up to David &amp;
Shauna’s home and checked his boat trailer to see if the converter will work on
his trailer.  Mae gave me a hair cut before we got ready for bed.</span>  </p>
