<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
went to work this morning at Kendall’s.  I was late getting there as I cooked a
fish for breakfast.  Work went fairly well but I was sure tired when I quit at
4:30 PM.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home so I ate and then took a
shower.  I laid down on the chee machine for a little while.  Mae had picked
some grapes today so she put up four bottles of juice this evening.  I talked
to my boys and we are going to try to go fishing at the Palisade Reservoir in
Idaho on the 18<sup>th</sup> &amp; 19<sup>th</sup> of November.  Sandi called
to tell us that David gave her a check for $10,000 for her share of the sell of
their old home.  It was due now but Sandi was afraid that she would have to
take him to court in order to get her money.  I am glad it has worked out for
her.  Randy called me and said that he could give me a treatment at 9 AM
tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I called
Kendall and told him that I would b e there after my appointment.  I went to
Randy’s and he really worked me over.  It was 11:30 AM before I made it to
Kendall’s and I worked until 4:30 PM before I quit.  I got quite a lot done
although I ran short of materials and had to have Kendall go for materials
twice.  Mae was canning and still picking grapes when I got home.  I helped her
pick some grapes and helped get some grapes ready for the cooker.  Mae had
dinner ready and after eating I showered and got ready to go to my meeting.  We
met as a High Priest Group Leadership at Brother Smiths.  When I got home Mae
was still putting up grape juice.  We watched a show on TV while we continued
putting up grape juice and I also flayed the fish from Randy and my fishing
trip.  It was 11:30 PM when the show ended.  Mae has put up 21 quarts of juice
so far.  I entered my journal and we cleaned up before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 2
AM with leg cramps.  I got up and took a hot shower to relieve the pain.  I was
able to go back to sleep and woke just before the alarm went off at 6 AM.  I
let Mae sleep in while I got my breakfast.  Mae had prepared my lunch last
night.  I went to work at Kendall’s.  He added more that he wants done again. 
I quite at 4:30 PM but hope I can finish tomorrow.  Mae had been busy all day
putting up more grape juice and cleaning the house.  She is feeling much better
but I wish she would take it a little easier.  Mae had dinner ready then I
showered and cleaned up.  We then watched the show “Return From Snowy River” on
TV.  I sure enjoy being with Mae.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke again
during the night with leg cramps.  I again worked at Kendall’s and got it
finished at 2:00 PM.  I was paid for the job but not what we had agreed in the
first place.  I really felt that my integrity was questioned.  They acted like
they were pleased with the work that I have done for them but he just felt like
I was over charging them for the job.  He had evidently had another company bid
the job and I am not sure why he didn’t have them do it for them.  I therefore
told him that I would except there bid plus any extras that I had been asked to
do.  By the hour with the time I had put in the job should have paid $1,775.00
but Mr. Kendall wrote me a check for $1,425.00.  I just accepted it and am glad
to be through with the job.  I really feel that the problem was his as I ran
short of every type of material, except crown molding, that I used and had to
have him go get more material.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae went over
to Georgia’s and spent the day with Georgia as she is recovering from surgery. 
We are all grateful that the surgery went well and Georgia does not have
cancer.  Mae came home about 4 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This evening
we went to the show “The Work and The Glory” part two.  David and his family,
Scott and his family, Jeff, Gail and Marcie also went with us.  It was a great
movie and we all enjoyed it.  We went over to Scott &amp; Mishelle’s place and
visited for a few minutes.  It was a good evening..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then went over to the Star Café, where we met with all that went with us
last night, and had breakfast.  It was a good event and we enjoy being with our
children and grandchildren.  Mae and I stopped at the shoe shop and got my
belt.  We then went to Durk’s and got some supplies to put a new plug in our
bathroom sink.  We looked for some boots that Bob had told us was on sale but
couldn’t find them.  We had used Bob’s pickup this morning so we took it over
to Scott so he could take some trash to the garbage.  We drove their car back
home.  I fixed the bathroom sink and then laid down and took a nap.  I attended
the Priesthood session of our Stake Conference and then came home and ate some
dinner.  We attended the evening Adult Session of Stake Conference.  While
there my legs got to hurting and were so jumpy that I was about in tears before
the meeting ended.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
until 6:30 AM but Mae got up at 6 AM.  We went to Stake Conference in at the
Ogden Tabernacle.  This will probably be the last time we will come there for
our Stake Conferences as next time we will use the satellite system to have
General Authority’s messages.  When we got home Mae and I had some lunch and
then laid down for a nap.  We had just got to sleep when Bob and Grant came
down to visit.  Bob had invited us to eat with them but we had invited Irven
and Sandy to eat with us at 5 PM.  I called Cheryl to see if she had got the
information of all of her family’s birthdays and other important dates.  She
had not and asked me to call back in a couple more weeks.  It was good to talk
to her.  Irven and Sandy came about 20 minutes after 5.  We enjoyed the evening
playing games and visiting.  It was after midnight before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                As we were
late going to bed last night we slept in this morning.  I woke thinking about
the driveway we want to put in.  I called and found that it is true that the
concrete ready mixes are having trouble getting enough powdered concrete and so
are short on what they can produce.  I checked with the U-haul companies and
they can supply what we will need.  Bob and I went to the city about replacing
the curb and they want administration cost and a bond for us to do the job.  I
thought about the way they are making us put the approach in and decided that I
will not change the approach but will continue to drive over the curb.  Mae
went with me and we purchased some forming materials.  We also stopped and
ordered the carport covering.  It cost us an extra $300 over what we could have
bought it for a month ago.  Like everything else the cost are going up.  I hope
we are right in putting in this driveway and carport.  Mae and I went to the
grocery store and then stopped and got some halibut and onion rings for
supper.  Mae needed some information about those that were in the picture taken
after Scott was blessed.  We went to my 1974 journals and were able to find the
information. We watched the last of a Perry Mason movie and then watched a talk
from the last General Conference.  I filled in my journal entry for today
before we went to bed.  I sure enjoy being with Mae no matter what we do.  She
is sure special.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as I didn’t sleep very well last night.  Bob and I started work on the new
driveway.   We spent quite a while digging up the telephone line.  It was
buried just below the grass no more than 2 to 3 inches.  We removed the gates
and fence and then rented a backhoe which we removed the one pine tree, pulled
up the fence post and dug out several roots from the large cottonwood tree.  It
was 5 pm when we quite and was to be Home Teaching at 5:30 PM at the
Mitchell’s.  I had Mae go to Seagull Book and get me some pictures that I used
for the H. T. message for the Mitchell’s children.  It went quite well.  We
also went Home Teaching to the Johnston’s but didn’t stay long as they had a
family birthday party to go to.  Mae went over to the city building and voted
this evening.  I didn’t as I hadn’t registered.  We watched a show on TV before
going to bed.  **** Chelci called to inform us that she and Steve became
engaged and plan on getting married March 11<sup>th</sup>.  That is exciting
news and we look forward to being with them on that special occasion.  ****  I
called Roy to check with them to see if it would be ok to come to their place
December 5<sup>th</sup> through the 12<sup>th</sup>.  Roy said it looked ok to
him and they would be looking forward to us coming.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep well last night as I woke worried about the pouring of the concrete for
the driveway.  I got out early and started working on the yard.  Mae went up to
Jennies at 9 AM and I was to be there by 10 AM but it was 10:20 before I made
it.  I returned the tractor and hoped they would give me a break on the cost,
but they didn’t.  Jennie feels that I am doing a lot better but she says that I
have mould in several areas.  She gave me a foot bath to help with the mould
and several Homeopathic medications to help clear the mould out.  While I was
gone Bob cut the pine tree up.  When I got back Bob and I loaded the pine tree
into the truck and took it to the dumps.  I work on the driveway for a while
before quitting for the day.  Mae got a talk copied for me so I could give it
to our home teaching families.  Bob and I went home teaching to the Jackson’s
at 6 PM.  Mae had supper ready when I got home.  I then went to the weekly High
Priest Group Leadership meeting.  After that meeting Steve and I went visiting
to the Thompson’s and the Gram’s.  It was after 9 PM before I got home.  Mae
has been working on organizing our storage and was still doing it when I got
home.  I made my journal entry and then started taking my nightly medications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
before 6 and read my scriptures.  Mae got up and prepared breakfast for me then
I started work by going after the bob cat.  We worked less that an hour and
realized that it had a flat front tire.  I called the rental co. to have them
fix it.  Mae registered the tent trailer and ran some errorns.  She went to
Georgia’s to visit her for a while today.  Grant came over and helped Bob and
I.  That really helped and especially helped Bob so he didn’t work so hard.  I
returned the bobcat at 5:30 PM.  I was going to go to Grant’s and install some
crown molding but we decided to do it tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 PM.  Mae had a
nice dinner ready when I quite and came in.  We watched a movie on TV and
enjoyed necking for a while in front of the fireplace.  Mae is sure special. 
We now have so many pills and drops to take before we go to bed that it takes
about ½ hr just for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep as good last night but still got up and got to work about 8 AM.  Bob and
I spent most of the day getting the sprinkler system repaired and ready.  Bob
stopped and prepared dinner for us.  He went over to the Maverick just so he
could get me a frozen yogurt for desert.  At 3:30 PM Bob and I went over to
Grants where I put up crown molding in their bedroom and bathroom.  I did it to
repay Grant for helping us yesterday.  It was 8 PM when we got home.  Mae prepared
a light super for us this evening.  I am sure tired tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae let me
sleep in so I didn’t get started work until almost 9 AM.  Bob and I worked most
of the day getting the driveway leveled out and packed down.  After using the
shovels and digging down some of the high places I used Mark’s Rota tiller and
Bob pulled his home made harrows behind his rider lawnmower.  We ended up
getting it leveled and packed pretty good.  I decided that we will probably not
pour the cement this Fall but will bring in some gravel and just let it settle
through the winter.  Maybe by spring we can get cement again and save a lot of
work.  The one area that we are concerned about is the carport we have
ordered.  Do we wait to have it put up or do we move it when we put the
concrete down next spring.  I will have to visit with the company about it. 
This evening Mae had invited Brother Wayne and Sister Claudia Thompson over to
play games.  We played Dominoes and Marbles.  It was a fun evening.  Mae had
been busy all day with Relief Society but she had every thing ready for them to
come.  Mae is having some problem with her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It is good to
have Sundays that you can rest from the everyday chorus.  We attended the regular
block meetings.  After getting home Mark and I consecrated some olive oil as I
have lost my oil.  Brother Peterson and I went to Brother Smoky Barns and gave
him a blessing as he is feeling under the weather.  Sister Barns is also having
problems but she didn’t seem to feel that she wanted a blessing at this time. 
Bob and Carroll had a nice diner ready when I got back.  Mae and I took a nap
after dinner and then we went up to David and Shauna’s for dinner with them and
to celebrate Emily’s Birthday.  Shauna’s parents were also there.  We stayed
and visited for a while.  We stopped at Scott’s and gave them some vitamin C
and some grape juice.  Scott has installed a new garage door opener and he
didn’t have my help.  I think he was a little proud that he had done it by
himself.  I know that Mishelle and Kylan were proud of him.  We stayed and
visited a while there so it was after 10 PM when we got home.  I then entered
my journal and we took our medicines so that took a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
and so was late getting going.  I felt depressed this morning so that didn’t
help.  It was very cold outside today.  I ordered heavy gravel to be brought in
for the driveway.  When the truck delivered the gravel it sunk some of the
pieces so there will have to be more sidewalk replaced.  We had an insurance
agent come and explain a Medicare Advantage plan through United Health Care. 
It looks like it is a much better plan than Medicare B and it come out of the
Medicare B payment.  We signed up for it.  It was to cold to work outside so I
started balancing our bank statement.  I was until 9:30 PM working on it but
finally got it balanced.  I filed in my journal entry, took medication, played
some games on the computer and went to bed.</span></p>

this morning so I didn’t get started until after 9 AM.  Bob and I broke out the
section of sidewalk that was damaged more because of the truck that delivered
the gravel.  We then took a load of trash to the dumps. When we returned we
went to the rental and got a Bobcat to level the gravel.  We removed the broken
concrete and then returned the bobcat.  When we got home Bob and Carroll had a
nice chicken soup meal prepared for us.  I took a short nap before going back
to work.  Bob and I then hauled the concrete to the dumps.  We stopped on the
way home and bought four bails of straw to cover the new cement when we get it
laid tomorrow.  It was late and I was tired but Mae said that David had called
and would like us to tend the children while they participated in a volleyball
game.  At first I thought I would just stay home and let Mae go but I repented
and went with her.  Before going Mae gave me a hair cut.  We enjoyed tending
the children and they were very good for us.  We visited with David and Shauna
for a while after they returned.  It was almost 11 PM when we got home.  We
soon got ready and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up at 6
AM to get started on the concrete work.  Bob &amp; I formed the front sidewalk
and a ramp for the lawn mower shed.  We went to Ogden and got 1 ½ yards of
concrete at the U-Haul.  They have a mixing trailer so that the concrete does
not separate while traveling.  When we got home with it and tried to pull onto
the gravel drive I got stuck.  Bryce had come over to get the phone speaker
that we used when we were preparing for our mission.  He stayed and helped us
get the concrete unloaded and that was a real life saver.  We had just enough
concrete for the pour that we had formed.  We returned the trailer and stopped
at Home depot on the way back home and bought some visqueen to cover the
sidewalk with.  We finished with the concrete and put the tools away about 6
PM.  Mae had some dinner ready for us.  I then took a shower and went to a High
Priest Group Leadership meeting.  Mae had her book club going when I returned
so I went upstairs and watched a Hall Mark show.  I am very stiff and sore from
the work today.  I made my journal entry then Mae gave me a good rubdown. </span></p>

this morning and then went to the temple.  We really felt the spirit of the
temple there in the chapel.  Mae &amp; I were asked to be witnesses for the
session and that is always an enjoyable experience.  After the session we ate
lunch in the cafeteria.  We stopped at the grocery store for a few items before
coming on home.  I ground some wheat into flour so Bob can make bread for us. 
He offered to do this.  That sounded like a pretty good deal to us.  I started
preparing for going on our fishing trip tomorrow.  I had trouble with getting
the generator to run.  Mae helped me a lot in preparing for the trip tomorrow. 
I set up the tent trailer and Mae helped me get things packed and ready.  I
talked with Mike a couple of times on the phone, also once with Jeff, and David
also called.  They are all excited about going.  We all wish that Scott could
have gone with us.  I filled capsules with Mannatech products this evening.  It
got so late that I even had Mae help me with my journal.  She typed while I
told her what to say. </span></p>

Ogden to Coscos to buy some items for Mae and to take with us.  We left from
there and went to Idaho Falls where we stopped at Sport’s Man Warehouse and
bought our fishing licenses and Mike bought a new real.  We got something to
eat and then went to Swan Valley to the Palisade reservoir camp ground.  We set
up the tent trailer and then went fishing.  I took a fall and broke my fishing
rod but didn’t realize until later that I had also broken my reel.  David and
Jeff came later and we took them to the trailer and then we all went back
fishing.  I put my reel onto an extra poll that Mike had brought.  That reel
really didn’t work very well.  David and Mike caught the most fish but we had a
good time.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was after
1 AM before we went back to the camp.  We got ready and went to bed but I
didn’t sleep very well as I was very cold.  I finally got up and slept in my
recliner chair and slept much better.  We slept quite late this morning.  We
enjoyed the day, we watched a movie that David had brought, flayed the fish we
caught yesterday and played some games.  We had trouble with the generator and
I spent some time working on it.  We got it running better but still had
problems with it.  We again went out fishing this evening and that is when I
discovered that I had broken my reel.  I tried Mike’s extra reel but it didn’t
work so fishing wasn’t too good for me.  The boys did quite well.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was still
1 AM before we returned to the camp.  We had to clean the fish and we also had
a cup of Postum to warm us up.  It was after 2 AM before we got to bed.  With us
getting to bed so late we didn’t get up until after 9 AM.  I still slept in the
recliner with my feet near the heater.  The wind blow quite hard all night
waking most of us several times during the night.  It was still blowing when we
got up so David suggested that we quickly pack up and go to Idaho Falls and eat
breakfast at a restraint.  It was very cold with the wind blowing but we
hurried and got to Idaho Falls just after noon.  We were glad to get home but
then Mike had to drive on to Spanish Fork.  Bob had brought me some dinner down
that Mae warmed up for me.  We watched a show on TV that was fair but it sure
showed the ways of the world about premarital sex.  I filled in my journal
catching it up to date before we went to bed.  It was good to take a shower and
clean up this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up but then I flayed two fish and took them up to Bob.  He cooked
breakfast and we ate with them.  I went into Ogden where I got gas and checked
out a house for Richard Hinton.  I now need to call him and try to find out
what he wants me to do.  When I got home I installed brake pads on Cherry’s
car.  Bob and I then removed the forms from the sidewalk and cleaned up the
area.  After putting those things away Bob helped me cover our tent trailer.  I
came in the house about 5 PM and Mae was about ready for Sandi to come for
dinner.  Mae had made corn beef patties and a birthday cake.  She had also
decorated the room for Sandi’s Birthday.  Sandi didn’t get here until 5:45 PM due
to traffic.  We ate and then played games.  After that we set and visited.  It
has been a really good evening.  I was concerned for Sandi having to drive home
and it was 10:30 PM before she left.  I filled in my journal and we got ready
for bed.  We played some games on the computer before we turned it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was quite
discouraged this morning thinking of the house I looked at in Ogden.  I called
Richard Hinton and told him what I had found out or observed about the house.  It
is really a dead horse and will take quite a bit to restore it.  I am not sure
that it is worth it but he wants me to continue to pursue the project and give
him a more complete breakdown on cost.  I think that it was the thinking of
that that discouraged me the most for the decisions that we have made may lead
to us living in something like that.  Mae and I went up to the church house
where we will hold Thanksgiving dinner to check it out.  I went over to Jeff
and Gail’s to get my compressor, hoses and gun but the hoses &amp; gun were not
there.  I had called Mrs. Stone and told her I would put the trim around the
cabinet in the washroom so I had to buy a new hose.  It took me more time to
set up that it did to install the trim.  Mrs. Stone paid me $30.00 for doing
the job.  It cost me $42.00 dollars for the new hose so I didn’t come out to
well.  I came home but Mae was out shopping and preparing for Thanksgiving so I
warmed some lunch.  I got on the internet trying to find out more about the RV
shuttle program but didn’t find much.  I went out this evening contacting the
Home Teachers under my direction to have them invite there Families to the High
Priest Group Christmas party.  I didn’t catch all of them.  At 7 PM I went with
Brother Roger’s of the Bishopric visiting.  We visited Sister Dolly Southard
and Brother Erron Farr.  We had a good visit in both homes.  It was 9 PM when I
got home.  I polished my cow boy boots and then filled in my journal.  Mae has
been working on the Christmas cards and has some mailed and most ready to
mail.  She is also busy with Thanksgiving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
about 7 AM but I slept another ½ hour.  By the time we did our regular morning
routine it was 9 AM before we ate breakfast.  We met the Young Woman’s
president, Heidi Basinger, at the chapel where we are to hold Thanksgiving
dinner at 11:30 AM.  She unlocked the closet and got the volleyball standards
out for us.  I went shopping for material to repair the door of the sunroom and
looked at curio cabinets for Mae but they run $500 to $1,000 in the stores that
I checked.  This evening we got the dressing made &amp; stuffed the turkey for
tomorrow.  Bob sold us an electric cabinet top oven for $30.00.  He had bought
them for his children but they didn’t want them.  We will use it tomorrow.  We
watched the new version of the movie “Mighty Joe Young”.  We played some games
on the computer before going to bed.  We went to bed a little earlier as we
have to get up early to get the turkey on and get ready for Thanksgiving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:15 AM and got the turkey in to cook at 5 AM.  I tried to go back to sleep but
wasn’t able to.  Mae got up at 7 AM and got busy getting ready for today.  I
started peeling potatoes and cooked breakfast.  We were busy all morning and
were up to the church early.  We had all our family except Shellie’s family and
Brad there and all the other families were well represented.  Even Terry’s
family was represented as Meliah, Weston and Makayla came later in the day. 
Troy is back in Alaska so we missed him.  We had a wonderful dinner with all we
could eat and more.  After dinner we held a short meeting to discuss future
reunions.  Most of the older children became involved in a volleyball game.  I
am in quite a lot of pain today.  I guess it is due to the fall I took last
weekend while fishing.  Bryce had me lay on the floor and he gave me a massage
which helped some.  Everyone pitched in and help clean up.  We had a lot of
food to put away when we got home.  Mae has really been working hard today.  We
watched a movie on the Hall Mark channel before entering my journal and going
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up but had some things to take care of, then both Mae and I went for a
treatment at Dr. Bennett’s.  We went to the Temple.  We debated as to whether
we should go through a session or do initiatory ordnances but when we went into
the Temple we were asked if we would do sealing.  We really enjoyed the
experience in the Temple today.  We came home and decided to get the Christmas
decorations out and spent the rest of the day getting the tree up and other
Christmas decorations.  At 9 PM we turned a TV show on and gave up for the day. 
We ended up watching three good shows before we went to bed about 1 AM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30 AM to use the bathroom and I read my scriptures before going back to bed. 
We woke just before 8 AM.  Mae prepared breakfast while I got ready to go.  I
went over to a home in the ward to help a single sister and her two boys move
in.  it was almost 1 PM before we finished and I got home.  I worked on the
entrance door to the sunroom getting it installed just before Grenn and
Kathleen Clark came.  Grenn and I drove over to Ogden to look at the home owned
by Richard Hinton in Ogden.  Grenn’s opinion is the same as mine that he should
get what he can out of it and get out.  I guess I will figure a price on
replacing the windows, siding the outside, replacing the roofing and capsulation
of the asbestos ceilings.  Mae had a nice dinner ready when we got back home. 
After eating we played some games.  It was 9 PM when they left.  It was a fun
evening being together.  It snowed enough to lay on the ground this evening.  I
filled in my journal entry and we got ready for bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and had to use the bathroom.  I had a back ache so set in my recliner and slept
the rest of the night.  I had set the alarm last night but forgot to turn it
on.  I again woke and so I read my scriptures but didn’t think about the time,
relying on the alarm.  It was almost 8 AM when I woke Mae.  We had to hurry to
make it to church so didn’t have time to eat.  Meetings went well and Sacrament
meeting was especially enjoyable.  Bob invited us for dinner.  Brother Thompson
and Brother Zweifel came to our place Home Teaching as we were not at home when
they came last week.  I took a short nap and then we went over to Jeff and
Gail’s and ate with them.  After eating Jeff wanted us to see how they had
decorated their room.  I realized something was up when the lights were already
on but the door was closed until both Mae and I were together ready to go in. 
I noised that there was a picture of a baby on the shelf, baby close on the bed
and both Jeff and Gail were all smiles.  Mae just went right to the tree they
had decorated in their room and begin to admire it.  It took her a few minutes
that the decorations in the room was trying to announce something.  Gail is
pregnant and will have a baby in June.  We all got excited at that news and
enjoyed the time that it took for Mae to realize the announcement.  We played a
card game for a while.  It was almost 9 PM when we got home and started getting
ready to go to bed.  I had to make this journal entry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 3
AM and left with Bob &amp; Mark for St. George at 4 AM.  We tried to find a
station in Salt Lake where we could get natural gas but was unable.  We went on
to Fillmore where we filled with natural gas.  We also bought a frozen yogurt
from the station across the road.  We got to St. George by 9 AM and rented a
large U Haul truck.  We were until 5 PM loading the truck.  I ended up doing
most of the packing as Mark still has his cast on his one arm and Bob is not
able to work very hard.  When we left I told Bob that we would stop for gas and
natural gas.  Some how Bob lost us and we spent a lot of time waiting and
trying to find each other.  Mark and I finally left for home.  I called Mae to
let her know that we had lost Bob so that if he called she could let us know. 
By the time we got to Cedar City Mae called to let us know that Bob was still
in St. George.  I tried to call him but he let for home.  We got something to
eat in Cedar and then drove straight home with one stop in Payson to use the
restroom and stretch our legs.  We got home 11:30 PM and I was very beat.  I
showered and we went to bed.  Mae has been busy decorating, sewing, and doing
house work.  She waited up for me to get home.</span></p>

up until almost 9 AM.  Mae had visiting teachers at 9:30 but after she left she
prepared breakfast for me.  Mark found a storage shed he could rent, so we took
the truck over and unloaded it.  Again I ended up doing most of the work.  When
we got home Bob had me install a furnace thermostat.  After I got it installed
he didn’t want that type so I removed it.  I showered and cleaned up as Mae and
I had an appointment to attend tithing settlement.  When I got back Bob had a new
thermostat so I installed it.  It was after 9 Pm when I came downstairs.  I
entered my journal entry and then got ready and went to bed.  We played a
couple of games on the computer before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I decided to
work on the fireplace and found that a lot of heat is going up the chimney. 
Bob and I went looking for a better fireplace but they are quite expensive.  We
also stopped and took some measurements of Richard Hinton’s house in Ogden.  We
stopped at Home Depot and got some sheetrock, I also bought Mae a Poinsettia
for Christmas.   By the time we returned home it was getting late so Mae helped
make some phone calls for me.  We met as a High Priest Group leadership and
went over plans for the social this next Saturday.  Mae was watching a show on
TV when I returned home so I watched the ending of it with her.  I entered my
journal before we went to bed.  I am not feeling the best tonight.</span></p>
