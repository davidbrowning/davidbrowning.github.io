<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
finished packing for the trip to Arizona.  Sandi got here about 10:30 AM.  She
would have been here a little earlier but she got pulled over by a Sunset
Police officer and was given a speeding ticket for 9 miles over the speed
limit.  It will cost her almost $90.  I built her some mud flaps for her
pickup.  We went up to David and Shauna’s and got their boat.  It took me
several minutes to get the boat out of their garage as the doorway is just
largest enough for the boat to fit.  It was after 1 PM when we got to Jeff and
Gail’s.  After loading their items we drove to Cedar City where we picked up
Chelci.  We then drove over Cedar Breaks and went down highway 89 to Kanab. 
Jeff climbed in to the bed of the truck and road there.  We drove past
Flagstaff without filling up with gas, but I did not know how far it was to
Cottonwood.   We stopped at a station off to the side of the freeway and got
enough gas to take us on to Phoenix.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We arrived at
Shellie and Roy’s at 4 AM so we slept until after 10 AM.  Shellie and Roy
prepared breakfast for us.  We visited and went swimming.  Sandi and Chelci
prepared chicken enchiladas for dinner.  They were just ready to put the first
pan full in the oven when David called and said they were about 20 minutes
away.  I helped Sandi &amp; Chelci prepare a third pan and dinner was ready
when David’s family and Mike’s families arrived.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Everyone got
up and got ready for church.  Shellie and Roy prepared fruit pizzas for
breakfast.  We all attended Sacrament meeting and then Mae, Shellie, Gail,
Sandi, Chelci and I stayed for the other meetings.  The rest went back to
Shellie and Roy’s.  This evening the boys set up a screen by the pool and after
the little children were put to bed, the rest of us watched “The Work and The
Glory”.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Shellie had
the Family room decorated for the 4<sup>th</sup> of July.  She had bags of toys
for all the children.  Mae had all the little children form a parade and they
marched around the yard beating on pans.  There was games, water fights and
swimming through the day.  This evening we drove to where we could watch
Chandler’s fire work display.  After getting back to the house some of us
stayed up and played a game of marbles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David and
Shauna prepared breakfast of pan cakes, eggs, sausage, bacon and juice.  We all
got ready to go boating at Canyon Lake.  Mike really didn’t want to go but I
asked him to so he relinquished and went.  Just before getting to the lake
David informed us that Connor was sick and he felt that they needed to return
and take him into the hospital.  I decided that I had better return with them
as I know the way back and I could tend Tyler and Emily while David and Shauna
took Connor to the hospital.  The rest stayed and went boating.  Mae and Gail
were riding a long tub and fell of hitting each other.  They thought they just
hurt their heads but Mae came back with very sour ribs.  Those at the lake were
late getting home.  Tyler, Emily and I went swimming in the pool.  David and
Shauna help for Connor at the hospital as the E. R. was full of patients and
they would have had to stay for several hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Jeff and Gail
prepared breakfast of waffle and eggs.  We just visited, played games and swam
in the pool most of the day.  This evening we went to the Organ Grinders for
pizza dinner.  It is a novelty place to go, not that the food is that good. 
Mae prepared me some chicken that I ate before we left, as I can’t eat the
pizza.  When we returned some of us played the marble game.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David and
Shauna prepared breakfast of hot cakes, sausage, bacon and eggs.  Sandi,
Chelci, David, Jeff, Gail, Roy, Shellie, Garrett and I went out to the lake. 
Shauna stayed home with their children, Mae stayed home as she is still
hurting, and Mike’s family took the time to go visit some of Becky’s family
that lives here in the area.  Those of us that went to the lake had a good time
boating, water skiing and swimming. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Shellie and
Mae prepared breakfast for us.  Sandi, Chelci, Jeff, Gail, Mae and I packed and
left for home about 10 AM Arizona time.  Just before we left I was getting my
journal file caught up to date and as I closed the file I noticed an extra
file.  I really goofed as I deleted the extra file, for it deleted all my
journal entries.  That was really upsetting.   We drove straight through just
stopping for rest breaks and gas.  We again had to take Chelci back to Cedar
City and then it was 1 AM when we got to Jeff and Gail’s.  Mae and I got home
about 1:30 AM and then Sandi drove home after that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
late.  Mae went into Tanner clinic and got an x-ray because of her sour ribs. 
They couldn’t find any broken bones but they still might be cracked.  We got
things put away and we watched a show on TV.  Bob called and he and I went down
and checked out the problem with Sherrie’s A/C.  We also got the prescriptions
filled that the Dr. gave Mae for pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7 AM before getting up and getting ready for church.  Mae is still
hurting if she does much moving.  Bob invited us to eat dinner with them.  He
had prepared a nice roast and baked potato dinner.  I visited with mark for a
while.  David and Shauna came down and got their boat.  We enjoyed visiting
with them.  Connor is still sick and throwing up almost every thing he eats. 
We wish David had more faith in the Priesthood, but he doesn’t at this point. 
Scott, Mishelle, Kylan &amp; Ashley came over for dinner at 5 PM.  We spent an
enjoyable evening with them.  I started reconstruction of my journal for July
as I wiped out all that I had written while in Arizona.  At 11 PM I called
Terry in Alaska and talked to him about our trip up there.  After hanging up
and getting ready for bed, Terry called us back with more information.  It was
after mid-night when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, July 11, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 AM and got ready to meet Randy at 8 AM.  Mae woke up and prepared me some
breakfast.  Randy and I drove up to their cabin in the Uintah mountains.  We
re-measured their cabin for shingles and trim.  We got back to Randy’s about
2:30 PM.  I drove up above Hill Field to check on having fascia made, but the
business was closed.  Mae cleaned house and was at Dr. Bennett’s and got a
treatment.  She stopped at Scott’s and got a letter that Larry and Tammy had
sent to us.  We feel badly that they have allowed Satan to get such a hold on
them but what concerns us is he is getting a hold on two of our sons.  Their
letter was just another one telling us how bad the church is.  It is
interesting that when they decided to go to Hell that they want everyone else
to go with them.  We went to Bountiful to see Sister Nelson but her son had
taken her out this evening.  Mae read from the Ensign as I drove, so we got the
articles read that we needed for doing our Home Teaching and Visiting
Teaching.  We came back and bought a few things at the store.  When we came
out, there were soft ball games going on at Steed Park, so we watched one.  It
was 10 PM when we got home but I typed some more in my journal trying to
rewrite what I had lost.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, July 12, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then had to hurry so Mae could get to her appointment with Jennie Porter. 
I had several errorns to do so it was 2:30 PM before I returned home.  I had
bought a shower head with a hose for Irven and a couple of other items while at
Wal-Mart and some pictures of Christ at Deseret Book.  Bob and I went Home
Teaching this evening.  I gave the lesson and put on the children’s level so
they would enjoy having us come.  That is the reason for the pictures of
Christ.  It went over very well.  I got the computer files backed up so I can
take the computer into the shop and see if they can repair it.  It took quite a
while to back up all the files.  This evening, after getting back from H.T., I
balanced out checking account.  We were late getting to bed again but I
finished updating my journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up so had to hurry so Mae could get to her appointment with Randy.  I
got Randy’s bid re-figured so I had it with me when I went down for my
appointment with him.  I spent the rest of the day running.  I went to Irven
and Sandy’s and measured their shower so I could install handicap hand bars.  I
picked up my boots at the shoe repair, ordered the Handicap Bars at Durk’s and
went to Home Depot where I reopened my account with them and bought some
plywood and 2 X 4’s.  I took our laptop computer over to Best Buy and had them
look at it but it would not fail.  I was there for over 2 hours.  When I came
home and tried the computer I could get it to fail every time.  I don’t know
what the problem is.  This evening Mae went to R.S. Home Making.  I started
building Scaffolding Jacks to fit the roof of Randy’s cabin.  It was 10 PM
before I quit and came in.  Mae was watching M.A.S.H. so I joined her.  We were
late getting to bed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up and we thought that Scot, Mishelle and the children were going to be
here at 8 AM for breakfast.  Yesterday they had gone to a fish hatchery and let
the children catch some fish.  Mishelle called us and wanted to know if we
wanted the fish.  She didn’t know how to cook them so Mae invited them for
breakfast today and I would show her how to cook fish.  Scott called at 8:15 AM
and said they had slept in so would be late getting here, so I started
assembling the roof scaffolding jacks.  It was a relaxing breakfast and we
enjoyed having them over.  After Scott’s family left and I finished the roofing
jacks, Bob &amp; I took the computer back to Best Buy to get it repaired.  It
did hang up today so maybe they can fix it.  Bob &amp; I also picked up some fishing
equipment.  I attended an Employment Specialist District meeting in Ogden this
evening.  When I got home, I got some things packed for tomorrow.  Cindi called
and talked to Mae this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, July 15, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
am so I could take the pickup to David and exchange it for his Jeep Cherokee. 
When I got there we found that the landscaper was behind and so David wasn’t
ready to get the rock sweeper.  I, therefore, returned with my pickup and we
used it to go to Idaho.  Bob, Mark and I got away about 10 am and drove to
Teton.  We stopped at Pocatello for some lunch.  Jackie had taken Aunt Wilma
shopping so only Uncle Lee was there when we arrived.  He is looking old.  He
told me that he had been stationed in the Philippines during the war.  He
wasn’t stationed at Bataan after the liberation.  From there he was sent to
Korea.  Wilma and Jackie returned before 4 pm.  I was shocked at how old Aunt
Wilma looks.  She is almost deft and has to have help to walk.  We were glad
that we were able to visit with them, but it made me sad to see their age.  We
left shortly after 5 pm to attend the wedding reception of Carla and Craig’s
son.  It was held in Rexburg, but it was a long ways south of town.  We enjoyed
visiting with Rich and Lois especially.  After leaving the reception we drove
up to the campgrounds below the Palisades reservoir and set up the tent
trailer.  Bob heated some cabbage casserole that Carroll had made for us.  We
went up to the dam and started fishing about 11 pm.  Bob couldn’t climb down
the rocks so he didn’t fish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, July 16, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mark and I
fished until almost 2 am, but didn’t get even a strike.  We came back to the
camp and went to bed.  The wind blew hard all night and shook the trailer hard
and kept us from sleeping very much.  We got up by 7 am and Bob fixed
breakfast.  After eating we packed up and decided to go through Star Valley and
then came back into Idaho trying to find a stream that Bob and I had fished
several years ago.  We stopped by our lot in Star Valley Ranch and showed Mark
where it was.  We also stopped at the cheese factory where I bought some curd. 
We got gas and worms in Montpelier, Idaho.  We then went to Preston, Idaho, but
we did not find a fishing spot and finally decided to come on home.  We were
tired so when we got home I took a nap.  Mae and I watched two John Wayne
movies before going to sleep.  Mae hadn’t gone to Idaho with us because Jeff
and Gail had asked us over a month ago if we would like to buy tickets and go
to a play at the Hales Theater with them.  We agreed and bought tickets for
this past Friday night.  When we got the invitation to Carla’s son’s reception,
we were wondering what to do.  We talked about going fishing since we were
going up to Idaho, but we had spent $42 for the tickets.  Mae suggested that I
take Bob &amp; Mark and go and she would stay and find someone to take my
ticket and go to the play with her, Jeff and Gail.  Becky, Mike’s wife, was
able to go and Mae said they all had a wonderful time.  Gail’s mom went too, so
Mae rode with them and Becky met them at the theater since she lives the other
direction – in American Fork.  On arriving to Gail’s mom’s home, she invited
everyone to have pie and ice cream.  She had made some delicious raspberry
pies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were
tired, but got up and attended our meetings.  When we came home I tried to take
a short nap, but didn’t succeed.  I attended ward welfare meeting at 1 pm.  We
then drove to the mouth of Weber Canyon where we left our car and rode with
Jeff and Gail to Morgan where we attended church at Kim &amp; Jeanenne’s ward
to hear Joshua speak at his homecoming.  He had just returned from a mission to
Japan.  Joshua gave an excellent talk.  We went over to Kim and Jeanenne’s home
for a luncheon and visit with all their family and our extended family.  As we
returned home, Mae &amp; Gail discussed our getting together tomorrow to go to
“This is the Place” monument.  I wasn’t aware that these plans had been made. 
After getting home, Mae and I watched “The High and the Mighty” and
“Hellfighters” (John Wayne movies)  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8 am.  Mae went out and trimmed the yard.  I read my scriptures and then
caught my journal up to date.  I did get the trailer put away.  Sandi called
and invited us out for dinner and to pick apricots and use her hot tub.  We
picked up Gail about 11 am and then went to Scott and Mishelle’s.  We all drove
to Salt Lake where we went to “This is the Place” monument and “Pioneer Village”. 
We enjoyed walking through the town and seeing inside the homes and buildings. 
We ended our tour by riding the horse drawn trolley.  Jeff met us at the front
gate and we ate the lunch we brought, out by the monument as they have some
picnic tables there.  Gail then went with Jeff,  Scott and his family went back
into the pioneer village to see more, and Mae and I drove out to Sandi’s. 
JaNae and her two children were there.  Mae and I picked some apricots, while
Sandi drilled some chicken and corn on the cob.  Dawson was with his grandma by
the grill when he was attacked by a yellow jacket that stung him on his cheek. 
I used some WD40 and killed four nests of yellow jackets within the area. 
After eating Mae and I got in the hot tub.  JaNae stayed and visited, so Sandi
wasn’t able to get in the hot tub with us as she had planned.  I would have
liked to have had some time to visit with Sandi about her relationship with
Nick, but by the time JaNae and her children left, it was late so we left
also.  I was very tired, but managed to drive anyway.  It was 11:30 pm by the
time we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 7
am, but let Mae sleep until after 8 am.  Mae gave me a hair cut and after
breakfast I went to the bank and withdrew $50,000 and gave to Jaybird
Investments, a company formed by Randy Porter and his son-in-law.  They will
invest it into a home to repair and resell.  We will receive prime interest
rate for the use of our money.  We will see how this works out on this house
and may continue to invest in other homes.  Bob went with me and we stopped at
Sherrie’s and I gave him some advice on putting some aluminum fascia on her
patio roof.  When I got home, I pitted the apricots we had got from Sandi’s.  I
mainly wanted the pits, but we used most of the fruit to dry in our and
Carroll’s dryers.  Mae packed for our trip to Alaska and prepared for her
lesson which will be tomorrow night.  I went to the Layton mall to buy me some
sport shoes to take with us.  Mae went to the store for some groceries and Bob
went there also in his car.  We all returned home at the same time as Brother
Thompson came to home teach us.  Mae &amp; I ate dinner after that.  I did up
the dishes while Mae continued her studying.  Time went fast and we were late
getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 am in order to attend the Ogden Temple with Charity Porter and Brian Stephens
for their wedding.  We picked up Aunt Beth at 9 am and went there.  There was a
large crowd to attend the sealing ceremony.  After the sealing, I called Best
Buy about our computer.  They may get it repaired today.  We went to Home Depot
and I bought some 2 x 2’s to set up the sign to give directions for the wedding
reception tonight as Kim &amp; Jeanenne had to move the reception to another
building as when Jeanenne went to the stake center to start decorating last
night, she found men there refinishing the cultural hall floor.  It was not on
the calendar that they would do this, and the wedding reception was.  Jeanenne
was very upset, as anyone would be, but their church was available so they had
to change it to there.  They made many phone calls, but needed signs too.  We
attended the wedding breakfast where we enjoyed visiting with Georgia, Bryce
and other’s of Mae’s family.  We took Aunt Beth home and she invited us in to
see her condominium.  It is very nice.  I took a short nap and then Bob &amp; I
picked up balloons and signs and went up to Morgan.  Due to road construction,
the traffic was really bad getting up Weber Canyon.  We set up the signs and
came back home.  I took a quick shower and drove back to David’s.  Mae couldn’t
go to the reception as she has the “Relief Society Summer Book Club”, which she
is over as it is her calling in Relief Society.  She holds it at our home and
she made refreshments for the sisters.  Sandi and also Mike and his family met
us at David’s also.  I left my truck there for David to use while we are gone
to Alaska, and I rode with Sandi to the reception.  All of our family attended
the wedding reception, except of course, Shellie’s family and Mae.  The
reception was very nice and it was fun visiting with family and extended
family.  Riding with Sandi gave us some time to visit.  I don’t know if I
helped her or not.  This dating game is really a challenge for her.  I am very
concerned that Nick is not the one for her.  When I got home I helped Mae
finish cleaning up from her class.  We then packed a few more items for our

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up
shortly after 6 am but let Mae sleep until almost 7 am.  We prepared breakfast
and finished packing.  Bob was up and ready to take us to the airport.  We
departed Salt Lake on time, flying to San Francisco.  While waiting for the
next flight, we called and talked to Roy and Linda.  Our next flight took us to
Seattle.  During our wait there, we called Roy and Shellie.  As we left
Seattle, it was dark but the sky soon became light again.  It never got past
sunset until after we got to Anchorage and then it never got dark enough to see
the stars.  Terry was there to meet us.  Angela had wanted to come, but she had
fallen and hurt her back and it really bothered her.  She still wanted to go,
but as she tried to climb into their suburban, her back tightened up more and
the pain was so severe that Terry took her back to the house and got her in
bed.  When we got to their house, she called out as she wanted to greet us and
give us a hug.  Mae asked her if she would like Terry and I to give her a
blessing and she did – so we gave her one and she was able to sleep better she
said and felt better the next day and the following days.  She said she knew it
was due to the blessing.  It was about 3 am before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 7 am, but Mae slept in until almost 9 am.  Terry &amp; Angela slept until
after 10 am.  We ate a relaxing breakfast and visited.  About noon, Terry took
Mae and I to see some sights.  Angela didn’t feel that she could ride that far
since and take a chance of her back tightening up bad again.  Terry also
brought Jaban with us.  Jaban is a “Down Syndrome” child and he was in and out
of the hospital when he was a baby, so he only has the mentality of about a 3
or 4 year old.  He doesn’t talk, just makes sounds some times.  He has a cute
smile and when he smiles at you and looks at you, he extends his hand for you
to do a “high 5” or shake or hold it.  He is an affectionate, sweet boy.  He is
about 20 years old now.  He seemed to enjoy being with us and it was very easy
to have him.  We stopped at Wolf Country and went on a tour to see the wolfs. 
It was very enjoyable.  The owner took us through and introduced us to each of
the wolfs.  They had approximately 50 wolfs.  We took lots of pictures and was
able to take one of Jaban petting one of the cubs.  We then traveled on going
to many of the sights to the east and north of Anchorage.  It was after 6 or 7
pm before we got home, but with the sun not setting, it just didn’t seem late. 
Angela had prepared a nice salmon dinner.  She had invited Brandon and David
and their families to come over for dinner too and be with us.  David and I
talked about fishing.  Brandon decided that he would come with us also.  We
went to Wal-Mart and purchased licenses and fishing tackle.  I found out from
Terry, that David has stopped attending church.  Terry said that David told him
and Angela that he is tired of pretending that he believes in the church, so
doesn’t want to go any more.  Terry said that David has depression problems
too.  I am very concerned as to what is happening to so many of our youth!  It
was mid-night when I went to bed.  Mae &amp; Terry went sight seeing some more
so I’m not sure what time she came back.  This all-night sun is a little
deceiving as to how late it gets at night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David,
Brandon and I left at 5:45 am to go fishing.  We drove south to the Russian
River and fished where the Russian River emptied into the Kaymire river.  It
was not really good fishing, but a few Red Salmon were caught.  Most fish were
hooked elsewhere besides the mouth, so had to be released.  I caught one large
salmon by the tail and had a real fight before landing it and releasing it.  I
did have David take a picture of me with it before putting it back into the
water.  We had a sow and three grizzly bears come down the river which really
cleared the fishermen from the area they were in.  I took some pictures of
them.  About 2:30 pm we left that area and hiked up the Russian River to catch
trout.  Again the fishing was slow.  Just as we were leaving, I caught a very
nice Rainbow Trout.  After taking pictures, David had me release it.  I had
mixed feelings about that.  It was almost 10 pm when we got home.  I was very
tired.  Mae, Angela, Amy, Jenny and the children had gone shopping at the flea
market and had lunch there.  Mae said they had an enjoyable time.  Terry had an
“all-day” seminar with “Prime America” today and he said it was very
beneficial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Just before
Mae came to bed, I woke with leg cramps in both legs until I couldn’t get up. 
Mae had to pull me out of bed and rub my legs and help me move around to get
the cramps out.  We got up about 7:30 am and got ready to go to church.  As we
arrived at the parking lot, we ran into the Park family, our good neighbors
from Layton, Utah.  They lived on the east of us when we lived in the Country
Creek Ward.  They are here on vacation and are staying with Shar’s parents. 
Terry was a counselor to Shar’s father when he was bishop of their ward.  It
was so good to see them again as we haven’t seen them since before we left on
our mission.  Their children were excited to see us also, and we were excited
to see them too.  When we entered the building, we met the Jensen’s who had
also been our neighbors in that ward.  They lived in the circle across from
us.  He was a dentist and had been working with his father as he was a dentist
also.  That wasn’t working out and he had a chance to move to Anchorage, so
they were excited and moved.  They are a good family also.  It was good to see
them and their children again.  We enjoyed our attendance at the meetings. 
This afternoon, we visited with Terry &amp; Angela and did some planning of
activities which we might do during the next week.  This afternoon, we drove
out to the “Turn Again” arm to see the Boar Tide, as the newspaper indicated it
should be very high today.  The wind was blowing very hard and seemed to stop
the dramatic affect of the tide.  However, it was fascinating to see how fast
the water level changed.  This evening we played two games of Mormon Bridge. 
It was fun to get Jaren to play with us.  He seemed to enjoy it too.  It was
after midnight when we started to bed. Terry and I got on the internet trying
to find out about the migration of the humming bird.  I have heard that they
ride on the backs of Eagles.  We were not able to find anything to substantiate
this.  It was late (or I should say “early” in the morning) before we got to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
7:30 am as I am very concerned that our son’s – David and Jeff, and Terry’s
son, David, and Bryce’s son, Nolan, are all losing their testimonies and some
are going inactive in the church.  All of these boys are good boys.  All have
served missions, married wonderful girls and married them in the temple.  Their
wives are remaining active, but it is so hard on them as they love their
husbands but want them to be the strong priesthood holders they thought they
had married.  They are trying to be happy around their husbands and support
them, but it is a heartache for them, since they do have strong testimonies of
the church.  As parents, we are puzzled and very concerned, but are at a loss
to know what to do.  We will always love them and pray for them that their
hearts will be softened and they will humble themselves, repent and come back
into full activity in the church.  It is a heartache for us also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I helped
Angela in preparing French toast for breakfast.  Terry and I ran several
errorns.  We got a cord to use in down loading the camera to the computer.  We
got some screws and drill bit also.  After returning to their home, I
reinforced the railing in their entrance way.  Terry and I removed Angela’s old
washing machine this morning then this evening David picked up their new
washing machine.  Angela had invited David &amp; Brannon families over for
dinner and family home evening, but Brannon and his family couldn’t come.  Mae,
Angela, Amy and Jared played games while Terry, David &amp; I installed the new
washer.  It was again late when we had prayer and went to bed. It was cloudy
and over cast today, so it was a good day to do these things, rather than go
sight seeing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4:30 am so we could leave at 7 am for Sewart.  We checked when we arrived at
Seward with Kenai Fjords Tours and decided Mae and I would go on the 3 pm
cruse.  Angela had brought the fixings to make sandwiches, so we ate some
lunch.  Terry, Angela, Jaben, Mae and I went through the Alaskan Sea Life
Center and enjoyed that.  Afterwards, Terry &amp; Angela took us over for the 6
hour ocean cruse.  I felt bad that Terry, Angela and Jaben were not coming with
us, but they felt they couldn’t afford it since they had just spent almost a
thousand dollars to buy a washing machine that they hadn’t planned on buying –
but their old one went out on them.  The cruse cost us over a hundred dollars
each. They said they would be ok and do some fun things there in Sewart.  
Shortly after starting the cruse, we were able to see Killer Whales.  The
Captain shut off the engine and let us watch for several minutes.  There were
many whales. They were jumping in and out of the water, one jumped straight up
and it was beautiful.  Another flapped it’s tail several times out of the
water.  It was so fun watching them and being this close to them.  Captain
Chris Overback said that they hadn’t seen killer whales for over three weeks.  The
captain had us come to the bottom level and he told us all about the whales and
showed us a book we could buy for $7.50 about Killer Whales.  We bought one.  During
the cruse we also saw Puffins, Sea Lions, Mountain Goats, Common Munes
(sometimes referred to as the South Artic Penquin), Dolphins, Bald Eagles and a
Sea Otter which swan close to our ship (or large boat).  We saw several
glaciers and stopped at one which was very beautiful.  We got close to it and
the captain turned off the engine and the generator so we could listen for the
noise and see parts of the glacier fall off into the water.  There were pieces
of ice floating all over the water in this area.  We were all out on the deck
and could see and hear well.  It was exciting and fun.  We were served a
delicious salmon dinner about 6 pm.  It was 9 pm before we returned to port in
Sewart.  It was a wonderful day and Mae and I enjoyed being together.  Terry,
Angela and Jaban were there to pick us up and took pictures.  We soon left for
home and it was 12:30 am when we got to their home.  Terry and I tried to down
load our pictures before going to bed, but they are looking fuzzy and the color
is wrong.  We are not sure why, so left it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 9:30 am.  The weather was looking bad so we just had breakfast and
relaxed.  Terry and I did down load 60 pictures and cleared one memory stick. 
I am hoping they are clearer on our computer at home.  Elder Hyer called this
morning so I called him back.  They were coming to Salt Lake and so gave us a
call.  They had planned to stop and visit us, but since we were in Alaska, they
said they would do it another time.  Best Buy called to tell me they had our
computer repaired.  This afternoon we went just out of town and enjoyed eating
out along the side of the “Turn Again River” on McQ Creek.  It was beautiful
there.  They said this was the favorite place Mom Porter wanted to go, so they
went there often when either her and dad, or after dad died and she came alone
to visit them.  We could see why she loved it there.  We mainly relaxed and
visited today.  It was a nice day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 am so Jaren and I could go fishing.  We drove to Soldotna and fished there
to start, but after a couple of hours, we tried to find a better area.  We came
back to almost the same area that David, Brandon and I fished on Saturday.  We
saw a black bear on the other side of the river.  We didn’t have any luck there
and at 3:30 pm we left for home.  After getting home I took a nap before
dinner.  Terry is a temple worker and it was his day to work there, so Mae
&amp; Angela also went and did a session.  They drove in another car since
Terry would be going earlier.  Terry took them to lunch at Chilli’s afterwards. 
When they got home, Terry showed Mae the family history he had either imported
from other files that other people had worked on, or some he had worked on.  He
had found many discrepancies so hopes that Mae and other family members will
help him work on them to correct them.  Mae was impressed that on the Church
Family History website, they have Paff 2 which we can down load and it has the
pedigree charts and family history charts, then you can import other
information onto those sheets.  Terry has done that for most of the Porter
line.  He would like to do that with the Bushnell line also.  After dinner we
spent the evening visiting and playing Mormon Bridge.  We watched some of an
animated movie, but at 1 am we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t
wake up until 9 am.  It was 11:30 am before we finished breakfast.  Mike called
early but we missed getting it so I called him back later and visited with him
for a few minutes about our plans at Randy’s cabin.  Terry &amp; Angela took us
to the Alaska Native Heritage Center.  It was very interesting and we spent all
afternoon there until it closed at 6 pm.  Terry said it was patterned after the
Polynesian Cultural Center in Hawaii.  They had a lodge with a stage where they
had the native dancing, sports exhibitions, story telling, etc., at different
times.  Then you could take tours going to all the different areas where they
had the native homes and buildings, etc., and a person there would be dressed
in the native clothing and tell you about their culture and show you the things
they used to make a living or live with their families, etc.  It was very
interesting and enjoyable and we took lots of pictures.  Terry and Angela are
tending David and Amy’s children tonight, Shira and Ashur.  They are cute
children.  They paid for David &amp; Amy to be able to stay in a nice hotel and
tend their children, for David’s college graduation.  Shira is 3 and Ashur is
one year old.  We watched two shows this evening, the end of the animated show
we started last night, and “Tuck Forever.  Tuck Forever gave some thoughts on
the fountain of youth that really made me think of the purpose of life and how
Satan would have frustrated the plan had Adam and Eve partaken of the tree of
the “fruit of life”.  We were late getting to bed, and then Mae stayed up to
shower and wash her hair while she alternated taking pills and medicine to kill
the parasites she has which she got while on our mission to the Philippines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were very
late getting up.  The weather was bad and we had Shira and Ashur to tend, so we
didn’t do anything except relax most of the day.  I read 2 or 3 chapters in my
book “Porter Rockwell”.  About 2 pm, Mae, Terry and I went to the Alaskan
Museum.  It was very interesting and enjoyable.  They showed a film of the 1969
Alaskan earth quake that was very interesting.  They had many displays and life
size models of different native homes, boats, etc.  David and Amy stayed for
dinner this evening before picking up their children to go home.  Amy wanted to
stay and play Mormon Bridge with us, so David consented.  They put their
children down to sleep and we played until after midnight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Before going
to bed last night, both Mae and I took our showers.  This helped us when we got
up to be ready for church.  Angela had invited a friend to attend church with
her.  When we went to get her, Angela got confused as to the location of her
house and it took extra time getting there.  We were a little late for church. 
The theme for the talaaks today was on the Sabbath Day observance.  I visited
with Robert Park and he would like to go out fishing with me tomorrow.  He
later made the reservations for us to go on a charter tomorrow.  The rest of
the day was spent relaxing with Terry’s family who came over for dinner about 6
pm.  Terry took Mae &amp; I for a ride to where we could overlook the city of
Anchorage.  On the way he stopped so I could buy a fishing license at Wal Mart
for tomorrow.  We listened to talks about Sabbath Day observance and here I was
breaking the Sabbath.  I had asked Robert if I could get my license there in
the morning, but he said I would miss the charter if I tried to get it there,
so I felt the ox was in the mire.  Terry and Mae didn’t want to come in, so
they waited in the car.  Amy and Jenny helped Angela prepare a nice dinner of
grilled pork chops and vegetable sis kabobs.  After David and Brannon’s
families went home, I went to bed so I could get up early tomorrow.</span></p>
