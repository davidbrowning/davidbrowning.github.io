<p class=MsoNormal>            We were late getting to bed last night and
stayed up to see the New Year come in.  There was fire works going off most of
the night.  This morning I woke at 5 but went back to bed at 6 and slept in. 
Mae got on the computer and wrote to our family, so I prepared breakfast of
pancakes and eggs.  We relaxed and got some things done but it was an enjoyable
day.  With not getting our money from the bank last week and having to pay cash
for our hotel in Banaue rather than put it on the credit card, we are broke
now.  Marlin Dator came over and washed the car and we had to pay him in small
change.  I think this is the closest to being out of money that we have
experienced since we have been on our mission.  Oh well we have a full tank of
gas for tomorrow and will go to the bank Monday morning.  At 4PM we went to
Tony and Leah’s for dinner.  They had a wonderful dinner and then we put on
“Lion King” for Kenneth to watch, while Tony, Leah, Alan, Mae and I played
Mormon Bridge.  Although it was their first time to play, Alan won.  We then
watched the movie, “The Book of Mormon”.  We enjoyed it although we were late
getting home.  It was after 11 PM before we got to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were in such a hurry to leave on time that we
forgot that today was Fast Sunday until we had eaten and were on our way.  We
left for Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch at 7 AM and made very good time.  We
were there at 8:15 AM.  Some including the Missionaries were there but the
building wasn’t opened.  We waited just a few minutes for the Branch President
to arrive.  There seemed to be a good attendance at meeting, the meeting
started on time and I noticed that there was good reverence.  Also a Sister was
playing the piano for prelude music at least 15 to 20 minutes before meeting
was to start.  The Priesthood did a very good with the ordnance of the
Sacrament.  When the meeting was opened to testimony bearing several gave very
good testimonies.  Mae also bore her testimony in Tagalog and several felt her
spirit.  Both Mae and I went into Primary.  They have a little to improve as
they weren’t very well prepared.  Mae gave sharing time and I gave a lesson
during that time.  After the normal meeting time I met with the Elder and the
Branch President and scheduled some training.  I trained the Sunday school
Presidency and Mae trained the Relief Society Presidency.  We felt that those
trainings went well.  It was at 3:30 PM and was very tired, so we took a nap. 
Mae cooked some dinner.  After eating we did some work on the computer getting
our day planner updated.  I am still having some trouble with an infection in
my ears.  We are not sure just what to do or who we should see about it.  One
of our greatest concerns is the many people that are having such a struggle
financially and / or with health problems and we don’t know how to help. 
Mission rules prohibit us from giving financial aid, but the sad thing is if we
gave all we had it wouldn’t be enough.  We have often had people do work for us
or we buy something from them just to help them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            President Brimhall called this evening and told
me that he had a white report from one of the Elders in the Paniqui District in
which he had explained that one of their investigators reported that the
turning point in his decision to be baptized came after he heard Elder &amp;
Sister Browning give a Home Teaching / Visiting Teaching fireside.  He said he
then wanted to be baptized and become a home teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning at the
collage.  It was really good to get the exercise again.  After showering and
getting dressed I prepared breakfast while Mae got on the computer and wrote
some letters.  We got on the instant messaging with Jeff and David for a
while.  The rest didn’t make it today.  We went to San Jose to get money out of
the bank; before we got there we realized that we hadn’t brought the
checkbook.  We had to go back but then when we were ready to go into the bank
the zipper on my pants broke and I was wide open.  I waited in the car while
Mae went into the bank.  We had planned on stopping at a Dr. to have my ears
checked but with my pants in that condition we didn’t.  Mae had to do the
groceries shopping, get items at the drug store and mail letters while I waited
in the car.  When we got home we started dinner for this evening.  I went to
the phone company and paid the bill there.  I also stopped at Marlyn’s and gave
Arline Tobias another P100 for thread for a cross-stitch she is doing for us. 
We made pork roast for this evening but then Mae thought she should also cook a
chicken casserole.  At 6:20 PM I picked up Maria and Chiemela Anyanwu and their
children for dinner with us this evening.  Just before going to get them I was
doing some searching in the encyclopedia and found that Seventh Day doesn’t eat
meat.  I ask Chiemela about it and they do eat some chicken so Mae’s casserole
worked out perfect.  After dinner we held a family home evening with them and
sang songs.  We did teach about the purpose of having Family Home Evening and
the importance of the family.  It was a very enjoyable evening.  They brought
us a basket of mangos and some home made bread.  We got a lot of dishes dirty
but had a good time.  It was late when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 04, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were late getting up so did not have time to
walk.  The three young men that are prospective missionaries from Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
branch were here at 7:30 AM.  Eliza wasn’t here so we had to test her and
finally had to go get her.  We got to the Guimba District Hospital at 9:05 AM
and they were ready for us.  The nurses started with the youth and they had Mae
and I go relax in the administrator’s office where it had air-conditioning.  As
we looked at the needs of the hospital, such as paint, desks, repair we realized
how depressed this country is.  In the U.S. you couldn’t run a veterinarian
clinic that was in such needs.  We needed to use the C. R. and they had us use
the staff’s facilities.  The men’s room was out of order and the women’s wasn’t
in very good shape.  Anyway the staff was very good to us and took the x-rays
and did the examinations with out charge.  They had us take the youth to Dr.
Umipig.  She finished the examinations and will have the x-rays read.  We told
her we would pay for that and she refused and said she would ask for a favor so
there would be no charge.  We came home and I took a short nap and then got
ready to go to Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch to train the Branch Missionaries. 
I got there right at 3:30 AM and soon the Elders and the branch missionaries
came but no one had the key to the building.  After 2 hours we still couldn’t
get in so I rescheduled and came home.  This evening we took some brownies to
Maria and Chiemela’s.  We then went to Tony and Leah’s and took them some
items.  We gave them a set of rook cards and taught them to play Rummy.  Tony
is quite upset with the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> branch and I have to admit that I
don’t blame him.  I get upset at the slothfulness also and read from the D
&amp; C 107:99-100.  I wish I know how to preach that doctrine to the
leadership in the Guimba District both in the District and the Branches.  I get
upset and then that makes Mae upset with me because I don’t have more
patience.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 05, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We picked up Brother Julius Cabeso at the Caltex
station at 7 AM and took him to Tarlac where we met President Montemayor who
will arrange to have his needed dental work done.  We picked up our camera at
the Sony dealer.  When we got to Clark Field we stopped at the bank and cashed
a $300 check. We then went to Dr Rosales and got our teeth checked and
cleaned.  Elder &amp; Sister Hyer came and we got to talk to them for a few
minutes.  Sister Hyer’s mother is in the hospital and is not expected to live. 
they are trying to decide whether to wind things up and go home or wait for the
three weeks.  We took the car to the mission office to exchange it but no one
was there.  We went to McDonald’s and got some lunch and then went back.  We
paid our rent while we were there.  Sister Brimhall came down and talked President
Brimhall in to waiting until Saturday and just stopping by our place and
exchanging cars then.  We came home.  I got on the computer for a while.  Mae
made us a sandwich for super.  We got a test message saying that someone and
Brother Nuque was going to come over but then later they texted back and said
they would do it tomorrow instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 06, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning.  It was
good to walk again as we haven’t for several days.  The only problem is Mae got
after me three different times and that set me in a bad mood the rest of the
day.  There are days that I would just like to go home.  Mae was on the
computer for a while.  I took some papers up to the book store to get copies
for her.  I made reservations at the Holliday Inn in Manila for us for the 6<sup>th</sup>,
7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> of February.  I also texted
Brother Dela Santos as to those dates, that we would like him to guide us.   We
went out to Guimba to Jared Cabuyaban’s 1<sup>st</sup> Birthday party.  Brother
Cabuyaban wants me to speak at a employment training program he is planning for
the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of January.  I’m not sure that I want to or exactly
what he has in mind.  We only stayed a few minutes and then went to visit a
couple of others.  We drove out West of Guimba looking for the Deliens but
didn’t find them.  It was really depressing to see the poverty that these
people live in with very little hope of changing.  I couldn’t help but wonder
as to the purpose of life for so many.  The Gospel is the only hope but that is
so far away for so many.  When we got home I printed some pictures off.  Mark
sent us a e-mail that is also upsetting of 4 people that were arrested for
preaching against homosexual.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am still having some problems with my ears but
I think they are getting better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 07, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We didn’t have time to walk this morning.  We
left shortly after 7 AM for Paniqui, stopping in Guimba at the Mercury Drug to
get medication for Noemi.  We got to the District center in Paniqui for the
District Development Meeting but only four Elders were there.  we called the
Zl’s and found out that because President Brimhall is coming to hold interviews
the meeting has been changed to 11 AM  We drove over to Camiling and got our
clothes from the tailor.  We were very happy with them and ordered me two more
pair of levis.  When we got back to Paniqui we stopped at Cindy’s and got
lunch.  We then went to Moncada and took the medication to Noemi.  We stopped
to see Neida but she wasn’t home.  We came back to Paniqui and went to Roger
Tobbias’s and visited he and his wife.  He gave me some material for a Filipino
dress shirt.  He said he couldn’t afford the shirt.  We visited for a while and
after leaving we drove back to Camiling to the tailors and asked her to make me
a shirt.  We then went to Gerona and visited President and Sister Nadado.  We
enjoyed a nice visit with them.  On the way home we stopped in Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>
and visited Sister Lora and Sister Cortez.  When we got to Munoz we visited
Sister Mercado before going home.  We got home at 7 PM so have been gone almost
12 hr.  I had downloaded some pictures and we were just starting watch them
when President and Sister Neito and Brother and Sister Nuque came to visit us. 
They came to find out our departure schedule and asked if the Branch could hold
a farewell party for us on the 12<sup>th</sup> of February?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 08, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in but still went walking.  We stopped
at Maria &amp; Chiemela and gave them the words of the song we had taught them
of “We are a happy family”.  They let us borrow the VHS that we had seen at
their place.  We will try to get it copied.  We had a nice walk but were tired
when we got back to the car.  We came home and I prepared breakfast while Mae
was on the computer.  We thought we would have some time to relax today but
before long it was time for me to leave to attend the Paniqui District General
Priesthood meeting.  President Nadado gave a talk on the organization of the
Priesthood quorums and although it was in Taglish (Tagolog/English) I thought
it went pretty good.  I felt that some just wanted to find fault and did not
look at the need to learn.  President Romos was the concluding speaker and I
just wanted to tell the Brethren that they really need to listen.  His message
was on “We get the blessings by obedience”.  Along with some Filipino driving
experiences, on the way home, I wasn’t in the best mood.  We wrote an e-mail to
David but when we went to send it we had been to long compiling it and were
shut off.  We also lost the letter so after eating dinner I recompiled the
letter and got it sent.  Time goes so fast and it is already time for bed.  My
ear is still giving me some trouble but I think it is getting better.  I am
having a lot of heartburn when I eat.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 09, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was a beautiful Sunday morning.  I felt
special feelings as I read from the Book of Mormon this morning.  I am in the
book of Ester as Moroni is explaining Faith, Hope and Charity.  Oh if the world
could only feel these truths and realize the great need for repentance and the
turning of our lives to Jesus Christ.   We traveled out to Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup>
branch.  Traffic was about normal or a little worse as we traveled.  I had a
lady on a bike pull right out in front of me and I had to slam on the brakes to
stop from hitting her.  She just looked at me as if to ask what I was doing
there.  a fellow on a moter cycle was behind me and he just stopped before
hitting me in the back.  He just smiled and we went on.   As we traveled Mae
played some Primary songs on the CD player and practiced them so she could
teach them to the Primary children.  We arrived early for meeting but most of
the members arrive early for meeting.  The Branch Presidency is on the stand
and ready for meeting to start on time.  There is one Sister that is early and
playing a prelude as the members arrive.  I wish all the branches would follow
this pattern.  During Sacrament meeting, the counselor that was conducting
leaned over to me and said that one of his speakers did not come.  Well, you
can guess what he wanted.  Would I be the concluding speaker?  I nodded that I
would, but did not realize that the other three speakers would only take a
total of 10 minutes.  I had 35 minutes to talk.  It is amazing how the Spirit
of the Lord can help.  I used a song, turned to a couple of scriptures, quoted
from a article we had read from the Ensign and from an account we had read of
when President Hinckley had visited the Philippines, and my time was up.  I
really felt the guidance of the Spirit and the power of the message I had just
given.  Tears were in my eyes when I set down.  I can certainly testify of the
Lord’s love for us.  Mae and I went into Primary and the Presidency was a
little better organized than last week but not much.  Mae gave an opening
message, taught a song, lead the sharing time.  I left to go into the Aaronic
Priesthood classes but the counselor ushered me into the Elders Quorum class. 
Following the Block I trained the Elders Quorum President.  His counselors are
not active and I advised him to make it a matter of prayer and ask that they be
released and two new counselors be called.  My training with him went well but
I had the Elders with me to translate as the President is not very good with
English.  I was also at a disadvantage as there was no power so I couldn’t use
the power point presentation I was prepared with but just had to use the caulk
board.  I was also going to train the Y.M. Presidency at 2 PM but the
counselors were not at church so the President asked if I could do it tomorrow
before I train the Branch Presidency.  Mae trained the Primary Presidency after
the block and then the Y.W. Presidency at 2 PM, which will about complete the
training that Mae will give during our mission.  As we were about to leave
Paniqui a boy lost control of his basket ball and it went right in front of
me.  He started to follow the ball but then jumped back out of the way.  I
slammed on the brakes and missed the ball and boy.  That is just normal driving
in the Philippines.  We were both very tired when we got home so ate and laid
down for a short nap.  Tomorrow will be busy and I need to prepare material for
tomorrows trainings.  I am not sure if the power will be on or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 10, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking.  We met the man from
Nepal that we had referred to the Elders.  He said that he had attended our
church meeting but we were not there.  We explained that we go to other
branches to do training and that we were not in this branch very often.  We
will try to come with the Elders the next time they visit him.  After returning
to our home we showered and I prepared breakfast.  Mae was going to start a
letter to our family but was answering messages on our cell phone the hole
time.  While we were still eating Sister Christine Pilien and Arlene Topias
came to show us the cross stitch Arlene is doing for us.  They stayed and
talked to Mae, so I got on the computer and started the instant messaging with
David.  Mike soon got on, then Scott and finally Jeff.  When Arlene &amp;
Christine left then Mae came and took over the typewriter as she is much faster
than I.  After the boys got of, I took a nap.  Mae woke me for lunch just
before 12.  As we started to eat, Sister Nida Valentino and Imelda Baiola came
to visit.  I had to eat ands leave for Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> branch.  When I
got there the branch presidency and the Young Men presidency were there.  I had
a good training with the Y.M. Presidency and it was good to have the branch
presidency there also.  I excused the Y.M. after that training and then we went
through the Branch Presidency training.  Both trainings went very well.  I
called Mae as I started home.  Before we finished it cut me off because I was
out to load. Tony had tried to call so after adding some time to the phone I called
him.  We will try to meet with them next week.  Tony said that it looked good
as to starting to work with the drilling company.  We hope it works out for
him.  It was 8 PM when I got home.  Mae said that Nida ask her if she was going
to have a treatment and when she told her that she didn’t think so, Nida said
they couldn’t afford to go home then.  So Mae had a treatment.  Mae said that
Marlyn had stayed and visited for a while.  She told Mae that her branch
president told her not to tell the Browning’s, but the party on the 12<sup>th</sup>
would be a surprise party with all the District attending.  Mae said she had
trouble not laughing when she told her that.  After getting home we had some
toast and milk.  I then typed my journal entry.  We often play a game or two of
spider solitary before going to bed, if it isn’t too late.  It seems to relax
us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 11, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 4:14 this morning but woke Mae at 5:00
AM.  We went walking at CLSU and walked for almost a hour.  That mad us hurry
in order to have breakfast ready for the Elders.  We enjoyed having them with
us and enjoyed the time to correlate our activities.  After they left we got on
the computer and I wrote a letter for President Mercado with a copy to
President Brimhall.  We also updated the list of prospective missionary list
and printed them out.  I left about 12:30 for Tarlac to take our camera back in
for repairs, but when they turned it on it worked ok.  I went to Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup>
branch and held a training session with the branch missionaries and the full
time Elders.  It was 6:30 PM when I got home.  Mae stayed here and worked on
the computer and wrote her talk for the Daddy Daughter party on Saturday.  I am
sure tired this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Received an e-mail from President Brimhall which
I will attach.  He received my letter and updated list of prospective
missionaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Presidents Ramos and Montemayor and Elder and Sister
Maharry,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> <br>
Just thought that you'd like to see this comprehensive report prepared by<br>
Elder Browning. This type of effort and report could be extremely helpful<br>
in the all of our member districts. I'd like to have every District<br>
Presidency ask their branch presidents to do this type of analysis. Also<br>
our full time missionaries will be asked to assist their Branch Presidents<br>
in contacting each of the potential missionaries and invite them to meet<br>
with the Branch President and receive from him the &quot;Call To Prepare To
Serve<br>
A Mission!&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm confident that this could help generate favorable results that would<br>
help &quot;establish the Church&quot; in our five member districts and Baler.<br>
<br>
Warmest regards,<br>
<br>
Pres. Brimhall</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I didn’t feel good when we went to bed last
night and so we were late getting to sleep. When the alarm went off, I turned
it off and went back to sleep.  In fact I don’t remember turning it off but Mae
says that I did.  Mae let me sleep until I woke at 6:30 AM when the Filipino
came on his bike with his horn honking to sell his goods.  We got up and went
walking but didn’t get back until 8:30 AM.  Marlyn came before we had our
breakfast and showers.  We stopped on our way home at the Elders to give them
the report on prospective missionaries and to get our mail.  Sandi sent us a
set of 6 CD’s on Latter Day Saint music, for our Christmas gift.  We also got a
card from Leah Jones with $10 in it.  There was a letter from Roy &amp; Linda,
Georgia &amp; Rick, Uncle Van &amp; Aunt Allison and from Kathy Rueckert from
the Country View Ward.  The Elders said we got the most of all the
missionaries.  After breakfast Mae worked on the computer and I lay back down
and took a nap.  This after noon we went to San Jose grocery shopping.  We then
worked on a presentation Mae is going to give Saturday at the Paniqui District
Daddy Daughter party.  This evening we went over to Brother &amp; Sister Bostos
and visited for a couple of hours.  They seemed to enjoy having us and we
enjoyed being there.  we did have to listen hard to understand them.  We got
home at 9:30 PM and I filled in my journal entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 13, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went walking at the collage this morning.  We
worked on the computer most of the day.  I took time this afternoon to get the
car washed.  While waiting for the car to be washed I read the Book of Mormon
and completed it again.  As I complete that book, my testimony of it increases
but I often think that I do not know if there was ever a time that I did not
believe that the Book of Mormon was and is the word of God and that Joseph
Smith was a prophet of God and the translator of that sacred record.  I know
that the Church of Jesus Christ was restored through the Prophet and that it is
lead by a Prophet today.  This has always been a comfort to me.  This evening I
also went to Brother &amp; Sister Pasarden and got a drill motor so that I
might hang the Relief Society Declaration in the Guimba Chapel tomorrow.  We
worked on the presentations until 10 PM.  Mae also baked a cake for the Elders
for tomorrow.  This evening Mae made a tuna noodle casserole for dinner.  We
wanted a western dish for a change.  President Neito came by to give us the
year end donation statement.  He also told us that on the 12<sup>th</sup> of
February they will have a Guimba District combined Sweetheart and Farewell
party for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This e-male came to me from President Mercado:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Elder Browning,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know you're not a superman, all&nbsp; of us cannot do
everything we wanted to do, the same sentiments was felt by Alma during his
ministry; and that is wonderful because it left our successor's work to start
and continue with. Your accomplishment and contribution to our district is
phenomenal and beyond our ability to comprehend. The lives you've touch and the
memory that will be left in our heart is one of our sweetest association in the
service of the Master; your&nbsp;legacy is a concrete example of Christ like
love! Sure appreciate&nbsp;the miraculous work you've done. THANK YOU VERY VERY
MUCH!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had some problem getting up this morning and
could have turned off the alarm and gone back to sleep for a while, but I needed
a hair cut and we know that we would have to hurry in order for Mae to do that
and still get to meeting on time.  We got up and began our day.  Although we
got to the Guimba chapel at 9 AM the Elder’s had already started.  We enjoyed
the District Development meeting.  Mae had made a cake for the Elders that she
served after the meeting.  We then went into the market place and purchased a
masonry drill bit.  We went back to the chapel and with the use of the drill
motor I borrowed last night set a screw in the wall of the Relief Society
room.  I then hung the framed Relief Society Declaration that Mae had given to
the Relief Society Sisters.  We then took Elder Bingham and Elder Packer with
us to the Guimba General hospital where we talked with the Dentist about doing
the dental work for the prospective missionaries.  After taking the Elders back
to the house I told them that we were going to visit the Doria boys.  The
Elders told me that they had both passed away.  I informed Mae and we did feel
bad.  We went to visit their parents and found out that they had a nice
Christmas, and then on the 27<sup>th</sup> Fernando got feeling bad and leaned
over and died.  That night Anton said he wanted to go with Fernando and the
next morning he also passed away.  We were very sad for the things that had not
been done but are happy for Fernando and Anton as we know they are out of pain
and happy in the arms of our Lord.  I felt bad that the communication with
Brother and Sister Doria was so hard.  I just wished I could have shared a
strong testimony and encouragement with them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We came home and worked on changing our Home
Teaching – Visiting Teaching the rest of the evening.  Mae was just a little
upset with me but she went along with it.  I took time to return the drill
motor and fill the car up with gas.  We continued working on presentations
until after 11 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 15, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had to hurry to get to Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup>
at 8:30 AM so we would have time to set up, but when we got there know one was
there so we took a nap.  A couple came at 8:55 in their kuliklik.  He didn’t
have keys but Mae has always wanted to have her picture take in a kuliklik so
she asked him if we could take pictures with us in it.  He was very happy to
let us and other soon came and joined in the picture.  The Branch President
never got there with the key until 9:30 but he did have an excuse as his
motorcycle had a flat tire when he went to come this morning.  Our training
went well but lasted for over two hours.  We went over to Camiline and had lunch
with the Maharry’s at Jollibees.  After eating we went over to their place
while Sister Maharry copied some primary material for Mae.  We came back to
Paniqui and we stopped on the side of a road and I took a short nap while Mae
studies more on her presentation.  We went to the District Center to attend the
Daddy Daughter party.  They had a full program so Mae didn’t have to give her
talk.  It was late when we got home and to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 16, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were very tired but got up when the alarm went
off at 5 AM.  We were a little late leaving for Paniqui but still made good
time and were there at 8:30 so we had time to set up the Primary room.  The
branch president had us set on the stand.  Again, the counselor leaned over to
me and asked if I would be the concluding speaker.  I said that Sister Browning
would.  I then informed her that she would speak.  She did a marvelous job,
using some of her talk that she didn’t give last night.  We went into Primary
and it was a disaster!  There was no preparation so Mae and I almost took
over.  I used the computer and showed some of the slides from my presentation
on Christ.  We also used the computer to play the music for the Primary songs. 
I ran the computer while Mae taught the song.  I left Primary at the time the
lessons were to start and was going to the Y.M. but there wasn’t any so I went
into the Elders Quorum meeting.  I was quite impressed with the brother that
gave the lesson.  After meeting I found out that he is a visitor but wants to
find a job in the area and move here.  He presently lives in Manila and is a
teacher.  He wants to get out of Manila.  He had been married but his wife went
abroad against his feelings and she is now living with another man.  He is
trying to get the marriage annulled, but that can be hard here in the
Philippines.  I also had a chance to visit with Elder Johnson and I think I
gave him hope.  Mae stayed after the block and trained the Primary Presidency
on holding Presidency meeting weekly.  She said that the rest of the Primary
time wasn’t much better after I left.  We hurried and went to Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>
branch as Mae had a training scheduled there with the Relief Society
Presidency.  We got there on the scheduled time but the building was locked up
and no one there.  We called and the presidency was at a wedding reception. 
When they came they didn’t have a key so we went down to Sister Cortex home,
she is the District R.S. President and lives by the chapel, and Mae asked if
they could meet there.  She invited them in and Mae trained for almost two
hours there.  We got home about 4:30 PM very tired.  While Mae warmed up some
dinner I down loaded the pictures from the camera.  After eating I entered this
journal entry.  Mae lad down and took a nap.  Roger Silvia texted and ask if we
could come to their place on Monday evening, as it will be Karen’s birthday.  I
texted back and explained that we already had an appointment.  He wanted us to
come after the FHE but again I explained that it was a Farewell for Tony and I
was sure we would be late.  I texted  Roger again and said we could stop Monday
about 5 PM or come over this evening.  He asked if we could come this evening
so we went down.  The branch presidency was holding PEC and had all the
presidency, clerk and executive secretary, the full time missionaries, the
branch mission leader and the three potential missionaries as they are working
every week with the full time missionaries.  We were invited to set in with
them.  They were doing great and asked our advice in many matters.  They were
all excited with the way the work of the Lord is going and the results they are
seeing come about.  They thanked us for the trainings we had given their branch
while we were there the month of October, and felt they had helped their branch
a lot.  We were excited also to see such success.  After the meeting ended and
everyone left we stayed to visit with Roger and Heidi for a few minutes.  Heidi
brought her father in to meet us.  We had met her mother but her father was
usually drinking when ever we were there so she wouldn’t bring him over.  He is
a very good looking man and we had a very pleasant visit with him and his wife. 
We do enjoy being with Roger &amp; Heidi and are surly going to miss them when
we go home.  It was late when we got home so we just went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in this morning and it seemed very
good.  It was 6:30 AM before I got up and Mae slept until 7 AM.  We showered
and ate breakfast and then I got on the enter-net and got our bank statement. 
Jeff and Gail got on instant messaging with us but none of the other children
came on.  Jeff and I played a game of Hearts for a few minutes.  Marlin Dator
came and washed our car for us.  Marlin asked me about his new house they are
building and before we finished we got talking about insulation.  He was quite
excited about it but we had to quit as Marlyn had dinner ready for us.  I took
a nap while Mae typed the messages that were on our phone.  We went shopping in
San Jose for our groceries, ate dinner at Jollibees, took a roll of film to
have developed and bought some Tylenol.  After getting home and putting some of
the groceries away we left for Tony and Leah’s.  Mae texted the Elder’s and
they wanted to ride down with us, so we came back and got the four of them. 
President and Sister Neito, Brother and Sister Nuque, Brother Michael and his
daughter Mishelle, Brother and Sister Marlin Dator and Ronalyn Dator all came.  Leah’s
parents also came over so we had quite a large group.  Brother Nuque led us in
some games and then gave a good lesson.  Tony &amp; Leah then served us a
wonderful dinner along with the brownies Mae had brought.  During the evening
Mae was visiting with Elder Bingham and Elder Hatch and she saw a rat running
back and forth across the entertainment center and then it jumped from there to
the back of the couch and ran off.  She said it was good that she hadn’t been
setting on the couch as she would have screamed.  It was a wonderful evening
and Tony and Leah had prepared a lot of very good food.  We got the Elders back
to their place at 9:32 PM.  Tony &amp; Leah had done this in our honor.  It was
a special evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 18, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in until almost 6 AM and so didn’t have
time to go walking.  The Munoz Elders came for breakfast and then the Zl’s had
correlation with us.  After correlation meeting Mae cleaned the stove while I
worked on a letter to President Brimhall.  At noon we took two of the young men
from the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> branch to Guimba General Hospital and had their
dental work done.  The dentist only charged us P300 and the hospital didn’t
charge us anything.  We brought the boys back to their home and then came on
home.  Tony wanted to come to our place with Alyn but when we texted him to
tell him that we would be home soon, he texted back and wanted us to come down
there and to eat with them.  They again had a wonderful dinner and we enjoyed
being with them.  Alyn visited with Mae about her personal progress.  After
eating we watched the Lion King with Kenneth.  We got home just after 9 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 19, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning even
though I didn’t sleep very well last night.  Mae was on the computer most of
the day.  I was on helping her with the transitions of her presentation but
other than that I stayed off.  I went over to Maria &amp; Chiemela’s and bought
two loafs of bread.  I then went to San Jose and took a VHS to have it recorded
to a DVD.  This evening we went to Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> and attended Mid-week
activity.  They had 41 youth and leaders out, most of them were Y.W.  We had
gone prepared to be called on to do the activity but the leaders had it well
organized and had a good activity night.  Mae took brownies thinking that 24
pieces would be enough but had to cut them in half.  It was 9:30 PM when we got
home.  I entered my journal, played a game and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 20, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We woke early and went walking at the college; I
upset Mae this morning, because I spoke wrong when she was trying to get a
short message to Sandi.  She has been trying to reach Shellie for two or three
days and hasn’t been able to get through.  By the time we finished the walk she
felt better.  Mae did more preparation on her presentation for Saturday.  She
also did training for the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> branch Relief Society Presidency
this after noon.  I went down and bought some anti-inflammatory pills for Mae
in hopes that they will give her some relief from the pain in her back and
neck.  I had some information to send to the office by e-mail.  I spent a couple
of hours or more trying to get the inter-net connections before I could get the
information sent.  While on e-mail, I sent a short e-mail to Scott asking him
if he knows yet, when the date is set for us to give our missionary report. 
Mae &amp; I did spend time cleaning up some of the computer files.  Time goes
by so fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 21, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had to go to District Development meeting in
Paniqui this morning so didn’t have time to go walking.  It was a good meeting
and we enjoyed being with those Elders probably for the last time.  Mae took
out a cake for them and we took some pictures.  We went to Camiline and got our
clothes from the tailor.  I am very pleased with the Barong (Philippine
National Dress Shirt) that she made for me out of the material that Roger Tobbias
gave me.  We went over to Jollibees for lunch.  Mae had texted the Maharry’s
but they didn’t text back.  We later found out that she had sent the message to
Sugar by mistake.  When we got to Jollibees, the manager asked us if we were part
of the group of missionaries that had an area reserved.  We figured from that,
that the Zone was coming to eat as a farewell to the Maharry’s.  They did come
a few minutes later so we got to talk to them for a few minutes.  We stopped at
Brother &amp; Sister Lora’s in the Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> branch on our way
through there, as Mae wanted to give Sister Lora the Christmas tree that the
Country Creek Ward Primary sent us last year.  They gave us a “Jack Fruit” that
they picked from their tree.  We have heard about them but never had one until
now.  Next, we went to the Guimba District Hospital where Mae took in thank you
cards for the staff and the dentist for helping with the prospective
missionaries.  We tried to find Christopher but his family has moved out of the
area.  We went to President Dela Cruz and found Roda.  She was so glad to see
Mae and was pleased that we had stopped.  She told us that she wants to go on a
mission.  We encouraged her and told her that we would be glad to help with the
medical and dental expenses if she would get it done right away while we are
still here.  We were tired when we got home as it had been 10 hours since we
left this morning.  I took a nap while Mae worked on her presentation for
tomorrow.  Mae woke me for dinner, then after eating she went through her
presentation a couple more times.  I then got on the computer and checked our
e-mails.  I then filled in my journal entry.  While waiting for Mae I played a
couple of games on the computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 22, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 4:30 AM and left for Paniqui by
6:30 AM.  We got there at 7:40 AM but the building was still locked up.  It was
after 8 AM when we got into the building but no one was there, except the YW
District Secretary, who had come to decorate.  The Y.W. New Beginning’s program
was to start at 8 AM.  By 9 AM there were quite a few young women and young
women leaders but none of the District Presidency.  By 9:30 AM we told the Y.
W. president that they should start.  President Nadado had problems at home and
couldn’t make it, but his counselors came about 9:45.  The program was very
nice and Mae did a super good job with her presentation.  After the program, we
went to Cindy’s and got some lunch.  We got to Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> building
by noon so we laid back and took a nap.  We went in by 1 PM as that is the time
that Guimba district Y.W. New Beginning’s program was scheduled to start.  It
didn’t get started until 2:15 PM so I guess both programs started on Filipino
standard time.  Just before the Guimba District program started, Sister Gasmena
asked Mae if she would speak on the Y.W. Personal Progress Program, as the
sister who was asked to speak, had not come.  Mae did a wonderful job and truly
had the Spirit with her.  As the program concluded Sister Gasmena announced
that Elder Browning would be the concluding speaker.  I just had to say a short
prayer for guidance and went with the Spirit and felt that direction.  It
continues to amaze us as how often the Lord has to bless us beyond our
abilities.  We were very tired when we got home again tonight.  Mae prepared
dinner while I worked on the computer.  Mae went through some of our pictures
files and sorted them.  I then made copies on CD so that we have a backup in
case anything should happen to our computer.  We worked most of the evening on
this and were late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 23, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 5:30 AM and was ready to leave for
Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> branch at 7:30 AM but traffic was bad this morning and
we got to church about 10 to.  President Nadado was there so I didn’t have to
worry about speaking.  I suggested to the Branch President, after Sacrament
meeting, that they consider moving the Primary to a larger room.  When I came
in with Mae’s primary bag, they had made the move.  I think that will be better
for the Primary.  Mae attended Primary again and again it wasn’t very well
planned.  She stayed after the block and gave the Primary Presidency some more
training, over 2 hours worth.  I attended the youth Sunday school and that went
very well.  The Branch President’s daughter taught the lesson and she did a
very good job.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After Sunday school President Nadado wanted to
speak to me, so we visited in the hall.  After visiting for a few minutes he
asked if I thought the Paniqui District was ready to become a Stake.  I told
him that they were the closest of any of the Districts, but asked him how many
of the Elders Quorum’s were functioning.  He said four.  I then told him that
if they became a Stake they would have a High Priest group in each Ward besides
an Elders Quorum.  Would they be able to get enough Priesthood to fill 8
groups?  I talked to him about getting more Priesthood by either activating
Brothers or converting more families.  I told him that getting more
missionaries would give him more returned missionaries for Priesthood leaders. 
I talked to him about Home Teaching to activate families.  Primary and Aaronic
Priesthood programs will prepare missionaries.  I also, talked to him about the
visiting of prospective missionaries and the success we are getting in the
Guimba District.  He asked me how much longer we would be here?  When I told
him, he had three requests:  #1 that I train the new Branch President in the Gerona
Branch, #2 that I take one hour on the 5<sup>th</sup> of February, in the
District meeting, and train all the Branch Presidents and #3 that we extend our
mission call for another year.  I told him I would do the first 2 requests, but
to do the 3<sup>rd</sup> he would have to go to the Mission President, who
would have to go to the Area President, who would have to go to the First
Presidency, who would say no; so he had just as well save the time and effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we got home, I got on the computer and
printed some pictures that Mae wanted.  She prepared a Fried Chicken dinner. 
It was the best dinner that I have had since we came on our mission.  After
eating, Mae took a nap while I cleaned up the kitchen and made this entrance in
my journal.  We stayed up late working on the computer.  When we went to bed we
couldn’t sleep as the neighbors two houses down are having a party with a band
and kept it up late.  I finally went to sleep but Mae didn’t sleep well.  She
got up and did more work on the computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 24, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up about 5:45 AM but Mae didn’t sleep well
last night so I let her sleep until almost 8 AM.  The morning went fast.  At 10
AM we got on the instant messaging with Jeff and Gail, then David came on for a
while and Scott came on also.  We enjoyed visiting with them.  They are special
and we enjoyed having their wife’s and some of the children also get on. 
Marlin came and washed our car while we were on line with our family.  Marlyn
of course came and did the house work and prepared lunch.  Nadia came about
noon so we had her eat with us.  <u>As we were visiting, during lunch with Nadia
and Marlyn, they told us that many Filipino’s do not understand the Tagalog
that the manuals and Book of Mormon are written in, so they use the English
version at the some time to get a better understanding.</u>  After lunch Nadia
gave us a treatment.  We had to hurry to get to the bank and made it just in
time.  We closed out our account with the Bank of the Philippines and have
enjoyed the experience with this branch.  We especially enjoyed the two
employees there that have always helped us with our transactions.  We gave both
of them a Book of Mormon with our testimony and picture in it.  Both said they
would read it and gave us their e-mail address so we could contact them after
we go home.  We went shopping at CVC for some groceries and while there Mae
gave a Book of Mormon to the artist that has his stand there.  He has been
enjoyable to visit with as we go there.  We stopped at a computer shop and got
a CD that I had them copy for me.  Also we had them check our laptop keyboard. 
They said they couldn’t repair it there.  We got a pair of shoes repaired for
Mae and picked up some pictures that we had developed.  When we got home some
of the neighborhood children came running to receive a lollypop.  I told Mae
that when we leave to go home, the children will remember us as the Sister that
gives out lollypops and the adults will remember us as the Browning’s that
brings Brownies as treats and the Elders will remember us for serving them
breakfast.  I heated some dinner while Mae worked on the computer.  After
eating Mae got back on.  I fell asleep in the chair and woke about 8 PM.  I
showered and made this entry and it was time to go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Last week when we went to Sister Lora’s, Brother
Lora gave us a “Jack Fruit”.  It is about as large as a Utah watermelon but is
very rough.  They told us to let it ripen a few more days before cutting it. 
We decided to cut it.  After cutting it in half I found that the knife had glue
on it and was very hard to clean off.  Mae then said that she had forgotten to
tell me that I was to put oil on the knife and also on my hands.  I wasn’t
impressed with what I saw so didn’t want to try the fruit.  Mae later tried a
little but I think we will just throw it out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 25, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking although we had to
cut it short in order to get home and get breakfast ready for the Elders.  I
didn’t shower as I had showered before going to bed last night.  I did that to
wash off all the powder and oil Nadia uses on you for a treatment.  The Elder’s
came early this morning so while we were preparing food we visited.  We had a
good correlation meeting after breakfast.  There were some changes to our
schedule that they informed us of.  A question was asked which stimulated my
thought for the training that President Nadado wants me to give on the 5<sup>th</sup>. 
I made some notes for that training.  I had some errorns to run and one of them
was to see Dr. Umipig about the x-rays of the prospective missionaries.  She
informed me that she had the best radiologist that she knows read the x-rays. 
He said that the film was blurry because the film was old but he said all four
of the youth were clear with no problems.  That was good news.  She also
expressed her love and appreciation for us and the work we have given.  I took
the CD, that we had duplicated from the video, back and they will try again. 
Mae went visiting with Sister Imelda Dator, the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> R. S.
President, to sisters that are not attending regularly.  I worked on a letter
to Elder &amp; Sister Read, new couple missionaries that will be arriving just
after we leave.  I also got a hour nap.  Just as Mae returned home we got
several phone calls and a lady and a girl came to visit.  This is the aunt of a
little girl we have seen that has a club foot.  We have been trying to find her
and were finally able to.  We filled out the paper work and got pictures to
send into the Mabuhay Desert Foundation to get help for this beautiful girl. 
The girls names is Merphyll V. Corpuz.  Her mother has left the family and is
living with someone else and does not want the children.  She had three
children, the oldest daughter got married at 14, the next son has ran off and
they don’t know where he is.  This aunt is trying to raise this girl, but she
isn’t very well off financially so this would really be helpful to them.  We
have Merphyll’s picture in our picture files.  Roger Silvia called about the
interviews for the prospective missionaries.  I told him to have them come at 9
AM and will let him know if I find out different.  I worked quite a while on a
letter to the Read’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 26, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking.  We had to hurry
with showers and breakfast in order to get down to Munoz chapel for
interviews.  We were able to get in line quite early.  We enjoy our interviews
with President Brimhall.  He is so positive and always has a complement for
us.  Today he told us that before the Clarks left the office and went to the
Palayan area they were telling him that we were marathon missionaries and it
made them tired just to listen to all that we do.  We talked to him about the
prospective missionaries, also I asked him about monthly reports and wondered
how goals can be set if reports are not reviewed.  He agreed and said that
along the Wasatch Front it might work but he thinks that Elder Oaks may rethink
this area.  He asked if I would attend a special training for all Stake and
District Presidency’s on Saturday from 9 AM to 3 PM.  We seemed to be busy all
day and did take time to go to San Jose and took the bad recording back and got
a refund.  We then tried to find a PLDT office but couldn’t.  When we got home
Mae called the PLDT Co. and they told her that they didn’t have an office in
San Jose.  We are not sure because the lady that she was talking to didn’t know
that there was one in Munoz.  We did get the letter mailed requesting help for
Merphyll.  Mae cooked a nice meal while I made some more backups on the
computer.  WOW! If you want to get an e-mail tell everyone you are closing your
land line and you won’t be able to receive any more e-mails.  We got about six
this evening.  We were up late answering e-mail and getting things ready for
tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We expected to eat breakfast at the church but
when we got there the ZL’s had forgot to tell Tony that we were coming and so
we had to come home and fix us something to eat.  We went back to the church at
9 AM.  It was a very enjoyable Zone conference.  I am amazed at the information
that President Brimhall seems to have at his recall.  His theme was on the
“Atonement”, and he did a marvelous job.   Sister Brimhall is always so good
and usually gives the Elders some personal advice in a very appropriate way. 
The theme of her talk was “Don’t make light of sacred things.”  Mae and I were
given the opportunity to give our testimony as this is our last Zone
Conference.  We came home and took a nap and then I worked on the computer
cleaning up many of our files and getting things backed up for safety in
traveling.  We got some more e-mails and cleaned up those files.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning at the
collage.  Marlyn came before we had breakfast.  We spent most of the day
sorting files, working on the computer and just getting organized so we are
ready to go home.  I went over to Maria’s and got two loafs of bread this
evening.  Roger &amp; Heidi come over this evening just to visit.  Tony and
Leah also stopped for just a few minutes.  Roger helped me with a couple of
problems on the computer.  Before going to bed, Mae gave me a hair cut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up early so I would be ready to leave at
7:30 AM.  I let Mae sleep in as she was very tired.  President Mercado,
President Gasmenia and Brother Damacio rode with me to Cabanatuan where we attended
an Area Presidency Leadership training.  Elder Mains presided and gave the
major part of the training.  It was very good and exciting to see the goals
they are asking for the Districts and Stakes to work towards.  Mae stayed home
and worked all day packing.  I feel like I am letting her do most of the
packing and it makes me feel a little guilty.  I am concerned at the amount of
things we have to take home but I need to just keep my mouth shut and we will
see how it works out.  I took a short nap and then we went down to Tony and
Leah’s for a Birthday Party for Alan.  Her Birthday is February 2<sup>nd</sup>
but they are having the party this evening.  This is the 1<sup>st</sup> party
and Birthday cake she has ever had.  There was a good group of youth that came
and they all seemed to have a good time.  Tony and Leah had prepared a nice
meal.  We ate until I was stuffed.  It was 9 PM when we got home, but it was a
good evening.  I made this journal entry while Mae showered and washed her
hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended the Gorona Branch this morning.  I
had a very good day but it didn’t go that well for Mae.  I went into the youth
Sunday school and the Teachers quorum while Mae went into Primary.  Primary was
a disaster as only the 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor showed up and she wasn’t
prepared.  Mae started pulling things out of her “Mary Popins” bag and took
over.  After the block of meetings I trained the Branch Presidency.  That
training went well.  While I did that Mae visited with Bessie Nadado and they
enjoyed having that time together.  When we got home I went to the ZL’s home
and got the reports on the prospective missionaries.  I got those updated and
printed off and sent by e-mail to President Brimhall and President Mercado. 
Mae has been busy getting ready for us to leave in the morning for our first
week of touring.  We are getting close to the end of our mission and so much to
try to get done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 4 AM and got away at 5:30 AM.  We
got to the church in Mabalacot  at 7:30 AM but the AP’s and ZL’s were not
there.  The janitor was there and let us in.  He said that he had come at 5 AM
and no one had been there.  We were on the way to the mission home when they
called.  We met the office Elders at the office and they gave us directions to
the PLDT office.  We stopped at the frame company and got the Proclamation that
we had him frame for us.  We tried to find the PLTC office but couldn’t.  We
stopped and got gas in the car and I asked the attendant where it was and it
was on another street.  We were able to get it taken care of.  We drove to San
Fernando and then went west to the ocean and from there we drove up along the
western sea shore.  It was very beautiful and enjoyable.  We stopped a couple
of times and went to the sea shore so we could take pictures.  We got to Alaminos
about 6:30 Pm but were another hour finding where the motel was.  We never did
find the one Emie told us about but found a nice hotel at the 100 Islands area
and stayed there.  It cost us P850 per night.  I figured our budget; Mae typed
all the phone messages of our cell phone, and after I tried to make this entry
but was too tired.  With Mae’s help we finished t the next day.</p>
