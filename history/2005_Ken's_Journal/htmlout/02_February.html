<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke 4:30 AM and didn’t go back to bed.  I
went up to the top of the hotel where I could get some pictures.  Emie
Balthazar arrived at 7 AM.  We went back into Alaminos and ate breakfast at
McDonald’s, bought a hat for Mae &amp; me, plus some film for Emie.  We went
back to the hotel and hired a boat to take us around the 100 Islands.  As we
went down to the dock a lady came up to us to see if we wanted a souvenir sea
shell with our names carved on them.  Soon we almost had a fight with so many
ladies trying to sale us souvenirs.  Our tour guides told us not to pay for the
shells until we returned.  We had a wonderful time touring the islands.  We got
out on a couple of the islands and roomed around them.  The one island was the
“Governors Island”.   We climbed that one on a fairly good path or maybe I
should say stairs.  Emie was cute as she was afraid of heights and I often had
to hold on to her to get her to continue on.  We got up to the top and had a
wonderful view of the surrounding islands.  We took many pictures and really
enjoyed the tour.  We paid over double what the guides wanted for the trip, because
the guides were so good with us.  The tour was to take an hour but we took all
morning and they were so patience with us.  We checked out about 1 PM and went
back into town and got lunch at McDonald’s which we ate on the way.  We did run
into a bridge that was under construction on the way to Lingayen.  There was no
advance notice of the bridge being under construction and we had to back track
several miles.  At Dugupan, we got lost on one way roads and ended up in a
traffic jam of trikes.  One of the trikes scrapped the side of the car and I
about went sick over it, however, when we checked later, there was only a small
scratch on the bumper.  We were glad to get out of that town.  It was a long
drive and we finally stopped at Narvacan and found a hotel.  The hotel last
night wasn’t bad but this one was really bad.  Had we not been so tired and so
late we would have kept looking.  When we got ready for bed, I wasn’t sure we
shouldn’t have gone on.  I just had to keep telling myself that we had prayed
for the Lord to protect us, and had to trust in that prayer in order to go to
sleep.  In the morning I found that Mae said the same thing.  Emie caught a bus
and went on to Laoag as she had to be back to work in the morning.  It has been
good having her with us especially when we needed to ask directions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Emie was cute in her expressions as she would
tell us of experiences.  Instead of going into details she would say “like this
and like that”.  She could leave out additional explanations, that weren’t
necessary, that way.  She was fun to be with and we really enjoyed having her,
especially when we needed to ask questions of someone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 02, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in this morning, and then when we got
up we took a cold bucket shower and tried to feel clean.  We had to trust in
the Lord to keep us safe, as we didn’t feel this hotel was the best choice.  We
went down to the beach and enjoyed the view. It has a rocky coast line.  We
went climbing out on the big coral rocks to get some pictures.  It was
beautiful, but a little hard climbing, especially for Mae as she was nervous.  It
is a shame that the owner of this hotel doesn’t realize what the value of the
property is and keep it up.  That is the way that it seems this whole country
is.  I don’t know if there is hope for this people or not.  We ate some
breakfast of cold cereal, fruit and yogurt before leaving for Laoag.  On the
way to Laoag, we received a text from President Nadado telling us that the
Leadership Training meeting, that was scheduled for this week end, has been
changed to the 26<sup>th</sup> of February as the Area Presidency wants all the
district trainings to be on the same week.  That means that we won’t be able to
help with it.  We found Emie in St Nichols at the apartment complex where she
stays.  She went with us and we drove to the Fort Ilocandia Hotel.  It was a
beautiful place, but when we asked for a room they told us that it was reserved
for the rest of the week for some convention.  Mae would have really liked to
have been able to stay there.  It was so beautiful and so were the grounds.  It
also went down to the beach.  We stopped at the mission home, but no one was
there, so we will try to stop by again tomorrow to meet the mission president
and his wife, President and Sister Hatch.  Their grandson is in our mission and
serving in the Guimba zone in Munoz.  We took Emie back to her place as she had
to go to work.  We came back to Laoag and found the Isabel Suites, where we
checked in for two nights.  This is a nice room and it was good to take a
shower with warm water and to feel that the room was clean.  We ate dinner in
the dinning room down stairs; it was good to eat vegetables and better
nutritious food other than McDonalds and Jollibees.  We then paid a man P300 to
give us a ride around town for a hour in his horse drawn cart.  We had a very
enjoyable time.  We watched a movie on the Hallmark channel about the Elisabeth
Smart kidnapping.  It was well presented and we were very glad to have seen it
as it happened to a good LDS family who lived in Sandy Utah in 2001.  It was on
all the news and the flyers were everywhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 03, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 4 AM this morning and went to
pickup Emie shortly after 5 AM.  We went to ________ and went to the beach.  Instead
of sand, it was rock and we stepped on rocks until we got out onto the flat
rock that was just above the water level.  We had a lot of fun exploring the
sea shore.  The tide was out so we were able to see a lot of ponds of water
with sea creatures in them.  I picked one snake up with a stick and all the
water ran out of it and it looked like string, whereas before it looked fat and
furry.  Emie enjoyed picking up shells and pieces of coral to make decorations
with.  Mae helped her find some.  They had “Nipa huts” there for people to eat
lunch in, so we took advantage of it and ate our breakfast there, eating fruit,
yogurt and cereal.  From there we went to President Marcos’s palace.  It was
beautiful and so were the grounds.  It overlooked a beautiful lake.  We took
lots of pictures.  Emie was joking and said that it was her house and we were
welcome to stay.  It was time for Emie to be back at work, so we dropped her
off and then went to the store to buy cheese and more yogurt, but we ended up
being in the market and Mae &amp; I each bought a belt, she bought some pony
tail decorations for her hair and we bought more mangoes and bananas.  W hen we
got back to the hotel, we took a nap and then it was time to go with Emie
again.  This time we went to Pres. Marcos’s museum, but it was locked.  Emie
found out that it was only open in the mornings.  We took pictures of old
cathedrals and some nipa huts in the river bed which were newly built to have
picnics and keroke.  We then went to the mission home.  They were having “zone
leader’s council” so all the zone leaders were there and we visited with them. 
President Hatch was interviewing the zone leaders, so we visited with the
elders and then Sister Hatch came in and was taking us up to their apartment,
when the assistant said President Hatch was available to see us.  He ushered us
into his office and we spent about half an hour visiting with him and Sister
Hatch.  They are great people.  It was again time to get Emie back, so after
dropping her off, we watched a little TV to rest and then again ate dinner in
the dining room.  It was very good.  We started to watch some TV, but couldn’t 
find anything worth while to watch, other than tennis, so we watched that for a
few minutes before writing in my journal and going to sleep.  We went to bed
early since we got up so early and didn’t get much sleep last night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in until 7 AM and then got up and got
ready to leave.  We took all our things down to the car and then went in to eat
the breakfast that came with the room.  The drink was tea or coffee, which we
didn’t want, so we ordered orange drink and orange juice.  The breakfast was
fried rice, fried pork and one egg.  We didn’t feel bad that we missed it
yesterday.  We ate there the two evenings and it was pretty good.  This was ok
but not much choice, they charged us extra for the drinks.  We left for home
about 9 AM, stopping a couple of times for the scenery and lunch.  We stopped
in Moncada to visit Imelda Baiola and Nida Valento before coming on home.  It
was 8:30 PM when we got there.  We were tired by the time we carried everything
in and got it put away.  I made this journal entry, checked the e-mail and had
one from Kevin Porter, and played a game before going to bed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 05, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We mainly packed today.  Marlyn came and did the
washing, also washed the dishes and fix lunch.  I had A-1 come and get the
car.  They washed and serviced the car.  I took Marlyn home as we had a box of
items for her to distribute however she wants.  I went over to Marlin Dator’s
and looked at his home.  He was quite excited that I would come over to see
it.  I also took a copy of the “Proclamation to the World” that we had framed,
to President Mercado.  He also was pleased that we did that for them.  He asked
if I would give him the tie that I was wearing.  It is interesting that they
figure that they can ask for items when missionaries are leaving.  Marlyn and
others have asked Mae for clothes.  President Nieto came over and brought us an
invitation for the going away party they are having in our honor on the 12<sup>th</sup>. 
He asked if we would write up a short list of things we had accomplished while
here on our mission.  He also gave us a poam that he had written for us.  It is
very special.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also got most every thing packed for going on our trip
next week.  We went over to Maria and Chico Anyanwu’s for dinner.  Maria had
prepared a wonderful dinner.  We enjoyed being with them and visiting.  Chico
told us that the farther you got away from Manila the less business were
located.  The reason why is that the NPA (National Peoples Armey) will go to
these companies and demand a tax for their support.  If they don’t give they
may kill them, burn or destroy their properties.  If they do pay the NPA and
the PNP (Philippine National Police) finds out about it, they will arrest and
imprison them for supporting a militant organization, either way the owners
will loss.  We came home about 8:30 PM.  I started on the list that President
Nieto wants us to get to Brother Nuque, but got to sleepy and turned it over to
Mae.  I fell asleep but Mae stayed up until 11 PM getting it done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 06, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 3 AM and worked on the computer for a
while.  We left at 7:30 AM to go to Moncada 1<sup>st</sup> Branch meetings.  We
stopped by the ZL’s and left some letters for some of the Elders that Sister
Balthazar had written.  We stopped by Brother &amp; Sister Nuque’s and left the
list that President Neito wanted us to write up.  After the block of meetings
and visiting with some of the people we know at Moncada we went to President
and Sister Nadado were we visited and ate lunch.  It is hard to leave people
like the Nadado’s, they are great.  We drove to Manila and checked in at the
Holliday Inn.  We just relaxed and watched a couple of shows on TV.  Our room
number is 2112 and is located so we have a good view to the north and west.  We
can see the Manila Bay to the west and the Temple to the north.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, February 07, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up 4:30 AM and went down to eat
breakfast.  Breakfast was good and it comes with our room.  It is served buffet
style so you eat all you want.  At 7 AM the Interisland Travel &amp; Tours,
Inc. met us at the front of the hotel with a shuttle and took us to the ferry
in Manila Bay, which took us to Corregidor Island.  We there got on a tour buss
and were taken around the island and explained the things that took place
during the 2<sup>nd</sup> World War with the Japanese.  It was very interesting
as well as very educational.  We took a lot of pictures that will help us
remember some of the detail that was told to us.  Our tour guide was very
knowledgeable and very interesting.  We were served a very nice lunch.  After
the lunch I had a few minutes with the tour guide (her name was Stella).  I was
able to tell her a little about the Book of Mormon.  I didn’t have a copy with
me or I could have placed it with her.  When we got back to Manila we were
again shuttled back to the hotel.  It was a very interesting trip back as that
was during the rush hour and the driver took back streets to get through the
traffic.  Boy, was I glad I didn’t have to drive in that mess.  We ate in the mall
and bought a memory stick for our Cannon camera so we could have a back up.  We
ran out of room again today, so this should take care of that problem.  We made
arrangements for tours the next three days to other areas.  We relaxed this
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, February 08, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were able to sleep in this morning as our
tour wasn’t to start until 9 AM.  We went down for breakfast at 8 AM and again
enjoyed a nice meal.  At 9 am we were waiting in the lobby and received a phone
call telling us that the first driver had problems and they were sending out
another.  It was 9:35 before the driver got there.  He took us to Tagaytay
Ridge where we could have a magnificent view of the worlds smallest and also
lowest in elevation, Taal Volcano.  We were at an overlooking ridge of 2,250 ft
above sea level. The Taal Vocano is in the center of the Taal lake.  We then
drove down the very steep canon to the lake shore where we went by boat across
the lake to larger Volcano.  We then rented horses and road up to the rim.  This
volcano is still active although it has a lake in side of it.  You can see
areas where there small amounts of smoke rising from the sides of the crater
and you can see bubbles rising in the lake.  The lake seems to have two water
supplies, one on the south east that is hot water and one on the north west
that is cold water.  We were told that you could swim in some areas of the lake
but to the south east it was to hot.  We were glad that we road horses as I
don’t think either of us could have made the trek by foot with out being very
tired.  Mae did ware a blister on her bottom from the saddle.  We were fed a
nice lunch before we returned back to the hotel.  The trip cost us more than we
had expected for we had to rent three horses, one for our guide and tip the
horse owners who also walked up the mountain with us.  A man also took our
pictures for a souvenirs and that cost extra.  Then there was the boat driver
that we tipped and our guide.  Oh well, it is only money and we will only do
this once.   I went to the store and bought some antiseptic cream for Mae.  I
also bought some more water, Mae an ice cream Sunday and a small pizza with out
tomato sauce on it for me.  Mae worked on the computer, trying to get her home
coming talk written.  I tried to find something on TV to watch but there wasn’t
much.  Before going to bed I made this entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 09, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After a nice breakfast at the hotel, we were
picked up by Interisland Travel &amp; Tours, Inc.  We traveled with three other
couples today.  This is the first of the three trips, which we have had others
ride with us.  We also had a tour guide besides the driver.  They also had a
trainee tour guide with them.  Our guide was very pleasant and filled us in a
few items as we traveled.  Manila is made up of 16 major cities and 1
municipality.  The traffic is very congested and there is a great amount of
pollution caused mainly by the traffic.  Many of the vehicles are “Jeepnies”,
which are manufactured here and will carry as many as 20 inside.  They are all
diesel fueled which adds greatly to the pollution.   The Filipinos are very
proud of the fact that this vehicle is manufactured here in the Philippines.  There
are 17 million people that live in Manila.  The guide insinuated that the
problem is due to the fact that the Catholic Church controls the government and
does not believe in birth control.  Unemployment is high, over 7 percent.  She
said that because the Philippines are a third world country, there is not
enough money for modern freeways and subways.  Also subways can not be
installed because of the high water level.  She said that the country contained
the richest of the rich and the poorest of the poor.  We can certainly agree to
that. Laundry is done by hand as the women do not believe that a machine can
get it as white as they do by hand.  Also electricity is very expensive and
they can’t afford the machines.  Also, because of the great amount of sun shine
and heat, the clothes dry quickly.  Our guide said that we could see “Sari-Sari
Stores” every where which are variety stores.  This is one of the main
occupations.  The guide said that there are many hot springs in the Manila area
because of the volcanoes.  The railroad was built by the Americans during World
War 2, but was broken up by the earthquake in 1990.  She said the government
planned to rebuild it to help alleviate the traffic. As we were talking about
the war, she told us that both of her grandmothers were rapped many times by
the Japanese soldiers and one grandmother became mentally ill because of the
horrors of it.  They both would wake up during the night screaming, as they
were having nightmares about it over and over throughout the rest of their
lives.  That would be so horrible.  We traveled for about 3 hours to the town
of Pagsanjan, where we were fed a nice lunch. There were two men with gaiters
that serenaded us while we ate.  We were then equipped with life vests and
boarded dugout canoes for a trip up the river.  It was a breath taking ride
with the vegetation so full and green.  The gorge probably reached 200 or more
feet high.  There were a total of 13 sets of rapids that the two boat men had
to maneuver and were so skilful in doing so.  They would have to jump out and
push and pull the canoe, jumping from one rock to the next.  Both men were bare
foot and were so quick that it was amazing to see how they worked together. 
Our boat men were brothers, Neil and his younger brother.  They were very
pleasant and made the trip very enjoyable.  There was an optional ride, on a
raft going under the water falls.  Our guide yesterday had told us to bring
another set of clothes and shoes as we would get wet today.  Since we had them,
and since we thought we might regret it if we didn’t take advantage of this
opportunity, we bought the additional tickets there and went with one other
couple in our tour, the American with a Filipino girl.  She was excited that we
were coming with them.  The other two couples, who were from Hong Kong, didn’t
bring extra clothes so they couldn’t join us.  The husband of the older lady
was from Prussia.  The younger couple was her son and his wife.  Wow!!! What a
ride that was going through that huge waterfall.  It was very strong and heavy
on us, but an experience we were glad we had.  We, of course, were completely
drenched, so were wet on the ride back, but it wasn’t cold.  It was a fun day. 
When they dropped us off at our hotel, we went over to the mall and ate at
Kenny Rogers.  We noticed that there was many in the mall with a mark on their
forehead.  We couldn’t figure out what it meant until we read in the news paper
that it was Ash Wednesday and those are the marks the priest puts on their
forehead if they attend meetings.  We came back and turned on the TV and
watched the Discovery Channel and Mae quickly snuggled up to me and fell
asleep.  We were very tired, but I enjoy watching about the five architectural
wonders of the world, which were the Empire State Building, the Panama Canal,
the Golden Gate Bridge, tunnel under the English Channel and the space center. 
It was almost mid-night when I went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 10, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke early and read the scriptures and then
went back to bed.  Mae got up later and let me sleep in.  We cleaned up our
room, went down to eat and then came back and filled out my journal for
yesterday.  We packed up and checked out just after noon.  Just before we got
to Tarlac Mae took over driving and let me sleep.  We stopped in Guimba to
visit with Brother &amp; Sister Villanueva, however Linda wasn’t there.  She
had gone to her daughters in Manila.  We came home and unpacked.  Mae prepared
some supper.  I figured our budget and filled out my journal.  I’m not sure
what all we did but about 10 PM I went to sleep.  Mae didn’t make it until
after 11 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, February 11, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 4 AM and read the scriptures for a
while and then went back to bed.  The alarm went of at 6 AM.  We got up and
went walking at the collage.  We saw Chica as we were walking and visited for a
few minutes.  I prepared breakfast for us when we got home.  After lunch I went
shopping at San Jose for a few groceries, two bottles of water and a few
miscellaneous items.  We packed one box of items and I took it to the post
office and mailed it home.  It cost P4,406.00 to mail it.  I hope it is worth
it.  This evening we attended a District Youth activity at the Munoz chapel. 
It was very well organized and planed and it was well attended.  President
Nieto wants a picture of us 6.5 X 7.5 m so when we got home I tried and spent a
lot of time trying but wasn’t very successful.  It was after 10:30 PM before we
got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 12, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We didn’t get up very early but still went
walking at the collage.  Mae gave me a hair cut when we got back.  We had hot
cakes, sausage &amp; eggs for breakfast.  Most of our time was spent in
packing.  Leah &amp; Tony came at 1 PM and Leah gave me a massage.  It really helps
and I felt much better after.  She wouldn’t accept any thing for the treatment. 
At 4 PM we went to the Munoz chapel where they held a Valentine Party for the
District that was a Fare Well Party for us.  It was really special.  We were
presented with many gifts and certificates.  Brother Cabuyaban told about our
experiences as I served with him in the Branch Presidency.  He said I was the
most difficult person he had ever served with.  He said I wanted meetings to
start on time, activities to start on time, and to have this meeting and that
meeting.  He said he soon realized that what I wanted was what should be done
and I soon became the best person he had ever worked with.  Brother Nuque also
told of some of the things we had done and accomplished while we were here.  Several
Sisters, from Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch, sang “Your Leaving On A Jet Plane”
accompanied by two young men with garters.  Lorna Gajonera &amp; Christina
Mercado sang “Well Done Thou Good &amp; Faithful Servant” and was special. 
They weren’t real good but it was special and cute.  Brother Mico sang a
special number for us.  I took quite a few pictures but in no way got all who
came to wish us well.  It was really hard to express our feelings of gratitude
to so many.  We took pictures of the gifts that were given to us as
remembrances, after we got home.  It was mid-night before we got to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 13, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> branch
meetings this morning.  Mae and I were asked to speak in Sacrament meeting.  We
were both able to feel the Spirit as we gave out thoughts.  Mae attended
Primary which went very well.  I attended the Sunday school class and Priesthood
class.  Part way through the Priesthood class President Brimhall came so I
stepped out to talk to him.  We stayed and attended the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch Sacrament meeting only.  Again we were asked to speak.  Mae gave a good
talk but I had trouble deciding what to say so mainly expressed appreciation
for them and the blessings we have received since being here.  I gave Brother
Michol my old pair of cowboy boots that zip up the sides.  He was sure happy
with them.  After meeting we came home and took a nap.  We went down to Tony
&amp; Leah’s this evening.  They had a nice dinner and then we watched the
movie “The Other Side of Heaven”.  That was very enjoyable but we were late
getting home.  When we got home and I unlocked the gate, I could find the Big
Dipper.  It has been quite a wile since I have been able to locate it.  There
is something about looking at the Big Dipper and the North Star that makes me
feel good.  It has been hard to say good bye so we have mainly said “Until We
Meet Again”.  We will miss so many of these people, they have a special place
in our harts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We didn’t get up very early and Marlyn came
about 7:30 AM.  Julius and one of the other prospective missionaries also came
about 7:30 to help Marlon wash the car.  It really didn’t need that many but it
gave a way for us to help them in their preparation for their mission call. 
Bishop Grunco and a helper came about 8:30 AM and with the help of Marlon and
the other two soon had the things carried out of the house and packed.  We did
get a quick breakfast.  We finished packing but Mae had done most of the
sorting and packing during the past few weeks. Imelda, Marlon’s wife came with
him, Eve, Arlene Tobies and Marlyn’s mother also came and helped us with
cleaning.  I had the challenge to get everything in the suitcases.  We were
able, with the help we had, to get packed and out of the house by 1 PM.  We
gave quite a bit away.  We drove to Tarlac and got a hamburger at McDonald’s,
then came on to Angeles where we checked into the Oasis Motel.  Elder and
Sister Maharry soon called us to let us know that they were also here.  We
texted President and Sister Brimhall and they met us at the Motel where we ate
at the restraint.  We had a very enjoyable evening.  We came back to our room
about 8:30 PM and watched TV for a while.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 5 AM but we slept a little longer.  At
7 AM we met Elder &amp; Sister Maharry and had breakfast.  We then came back to
our room and took a short nap.  We about 10 AM and went to the wood carvers
store.  He was just ready to leave as we got there.  We had to pay him P3700
extra for the shipping.  It should arrive in Utah about the time we get there. 
We chased around trying to find a cardboard tub, to have the cross stitch that
Amy is making for us, put into it for shipping home. We went to the mission
home and weigh our luggage.  Two of the suitcases were over 75 lb. So we
rearranged them.  After several tries we were successful at getting all bags
below 75 lb.  We had our interviews with President Brimhall and sure enjoyed
that.  He interviewed us for new recommends and then before leaving he gave
each of us a blessing.  That was very special.  Elder Pacundo told us that the
weight limit was 70 lb so we had to make some more adjustments.  We went over
to McDonald’s and got some chicken for dinner.  We came back to our motel where
Mae showered and washed her hair so she could put it up.  We got a special text
from Roger and Heidi Silvia expressing their love for us and sadness that we
are leaving.  It is hard to leave so many that we have grown so close to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 16, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up by 6 AM but time went by so fast.  We
couldn’t find our scriptures and had a fear that maybe we had lost another set. 
We took out luggage to the car and then came back and checked out.  Next we ate
breakfast at the hotel dinning room and then went to the mission home.  We
found our scriptures where we had left them at the mission office.  Again we
did some minor luggage rearranging and got the luggage loaded into our car. 
President Brimhall finished his interviews with the other Elders that are also
going home today. He then invited all of us upstairs in their home where we had
a wonderful inspirational talk by Sister Brimhall and then followed by some
counsel and praise from our Mission President.  He is a wonderful and mighty
man and servant of the Lord.  He then gave each of us an opportunity to bear
our testimonies.  The Elders were taken by the assistants to the president and they
left for the M.R.C. in Manila.  President  &amp; Sister drove Mae &amp; I to
Manila.  When we got to the Mission Reception Center and unloaded our bag, it
was suggested that we reweigh them.  We found that the scales at the mission
office are not accurate and that our carry on bags could only weigh 7 lb.  Ours
weighed much more than that.  We had to really reshuffle our baggage.  Before
we could get a good start on that project we were told we had to go to get
x-rays.  The other Elders went to a session at the Temple but we came back to
the M.R.C. and spent the rest of the afternoon on luggage.  We through some
things away and gave some items to Sister Henry for the M.R.C. to do as seemed
them good, but we finally made it within the weigh limits except for the carry
on and they were over double the limit.  Elder Henry said he was sure we could
get away with it if we did all the handling of our carry on.  We tried to get
to bed early, it was around 8:30 PM when I went to sleep, but Mae stayed up a
little longer doing her hair.  I woke wondering what time it was and if the
alarm was set right.  I had to get up and go to the main hallway, where there
was light and found it to be just a few minutes after 11.  I had trouble going
back to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 17, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The alarm was set for 3:30 AM but I was up by
3.  We had to hurry but had time to eat a little breakfast before we left for
the airport at 4:30 AM.  Check-in went well except one airport official wanted
to lift our carry-on bags.  That worried me but she just gave me a funny look
and let us go.  We flew from the Philippine Airport at 8 AM on flight PR 300 to
Hon Kong, which was 1 ½ hour flight.  At Hon Kong we again had to go through
security with our carry-on, at which time they made us open the one bag as
there was scissors in it.  We found some small fingernail scissors and they
kept those.  From Hon Kong we flew on United Airline, flight #896 to Chicago
which was 14 ½ hours.  On this flight we set next to a young Chinese lady who
was going to Boston for a convention.  She spoke very good English and before
the flight ended we placed a Book of Mormon with her.  At Chicago we
transferred to flight #487 and flew 3:45 minutes back to S.L.C. arriving about
5:30 PM.  We met a Missionary that is returning from Russia at the Chicago airport,
who flew on to S.L. with us.  He is from Coolville Utah.  I figured that we had
been up for over 23 1/2 hours and we were still in 17<sup>th</sup> of February. 
We had to stop at the Restrooms before going to the baggage claim area.  It was
amazing to see such a clean restroom with hot and cold water, paper products
and toilet seats.  I just wanted to tell every one how blessed we are.  We went
towards the baggage claim area and there we were met by our family and
friends.  They had a big “Welcome Home” banner with 2 big bouquets of
balloons.  Oh the emotions were great.  All except Shellie’s family was there,
along with Bryce, Irven &amp; Sandy, Georgia &amp; Rick, Cheryl and Tom Passey
from the Country Creek Ward.   George Stewart arrived from a trip at the same
time so Sister Stewart was there, also Shellie called just as we got there so
we talked to her for a minute.  Oh what a wonderful greeting.  After hugs,
kisses and greetings, we went to the Chuck-A-Rama to eat and visit.  The family
of the Missionary from Coolville was also there and when his grandfather saw my
name tag he asked if I was related to Jonathan Browning.  I told him that I was
and he said that Jonathan Browning was the man that converted and baptized his
great grandfather into the church in Missouri.  It was hard to say goodnight to
our family.  Jeff and Gail brought us home to Bob’s.  Our children had came
last week and cleaned the apartment and David had got our car serviced and new
tires on the front, they are so special.  On the way home we stopped at Scott
and Mishelle’s for a minute.  Mishelle has it decorated so cute.  Scott came
with us to Uncle Bob’s.  They stopped at the Maverick store and bought me a
frozen yogurt.  We visited with Bob and Carroll before unpacking a few items
and going to bed at 11:30 PM.  What a great day, but the longest day we have
ever spent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke up shortly after 4 AM and couldn’t go
back to sleep.  My mind was to full of the past events and I had to take time
to express gratitude to my Father In Heaven.  I walked around (bare footed) and
just looked at things and thought of all my blessings.  I caught my journal up
to date with the events of yesterday.  I went back to bed and we didn’t get up
until almost 9 AM.  Bob came down to tell us that breakfast was about ready. 
He had prepared biscuits and gravy and they were good.  I went down to Randy’s
for a treatment.  Randy said I was in bad shape and would need a couple more
treatments.  Mae took Carroll’s car to get her hair done; she also stopped and
bought some groceries.  I am not sure where the day went but about the only
thing I got done was to get a quote on car insurance.  Bob also prepared a nice
dinner of chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy for us.  This evening I visited
with Cheryl and Cherie on the phone.  Mae has been getting things put away in
the apartment so we can find things.  It was 11 PM before we went to bed, very
tired.  I woke at 11:30 PM and Mae wasn’t in bed.  I found her in the front
room trying to sleep in the recliner as she was coughing and afraid she would
wake me, plus felt she might sleep in the recliner better than laying flat in
the bed.  She came back to be and we finally got to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 19, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke before 5 this morning.  I had set the
alarm to go off at 5:30 AM but forgot to change to USA Mountain Standard Time. 
After prayers I worked on a list of things we need to get done and a list of
those we need to visit.  I woke Mae at 6:30 AM as we need to soon leave to go
to David &amp; Shauna’s.  We went over to the grocery store to get a few items
that Mae had forgotten.  That was a shock to see such a nice store.  We then
drove up to Morgan and it took us a little while to find David’s home.   They
have a very nice home.  All the family was soon there.  David, Mike and Sandi
had prepared biscuits &amp; gravy.  After breakfast we played some table
games.  David &amp; Jeff challenged Mike &amp; I to a Pin-Pong game, of which
Mike and I won.  I took a nap on the floor.  Sometime today Mike challenged me
to an arm wrestle.  It took him quite a while but he was finally able to pin
me.  We really enjoyed the day with our family.  Shellie called and we enjoyed
visiting with her.  We left David’s about 9 in the evening and went back home. 
Mae didn’t feel the best and was very tired.  Bob came down to have us put some
medication on his back.  Mae then went into bed.  I tried to get my journal
entered but Bob stayed and visited for a while.  When he finally left I was too
tired to finish this entry so went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 20, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had an appointment with President Sanders at
8 AM so was up early to get to that.  It was snowing so the roads were slippery
which took us a little longer to drive over to the Stake Center.  Our visit
with President Sanders was very enjoyable and he extended us an honorable release
from our mission.  We went back home for a few minutes but had to hurry to get
back to the Country Creek Chapel to attend Sacrament meeting.  There were so
many friends and family, besides the Ward members that came to welcome us
home.  It was so neat to have organ music playing for the prelude and other
music.  The Hymns were sung with the familiar tunes and rhythms.  The building
was packed to capacity.  It seemed different to see so many Priesthood holders
in the congregation and so many different colors of hair.  As the Sacrament was
passed it was hard for me to concentrate on the Atonement of Christ because I
would see so many loved ones and friends that I recognized, and I had a deep
feeling of gratitude for my blessings.  After the Sacrament then time was given
for Mae to speak.  She gave a very good talk.  The men’s choir then sang and
then I had the privilege of speaking.  Time seemed to go so fast that my time
was up before I really told much.  We greeted friends and family in the foyer
and then went over to Scotts and visited with them for another 3 hours or
more.  We went up to David and Shauna’s again where our boys and their families
all enjoyed being to gather.  Conner wasn’t feeling very well so David had to
take him into the Doctor.  Later David, Mike and I went into Roy to pick up a
prescription.  On the way back David stopped at a Maverick and I got a Frozen
Yogurt.  David and Mike were surprised at how much I could put on a cup, but it
was sure good.  It was 2 AM before I went to bed.  Mae had given up on me
earlier and gone to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, February 21, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 6 AM and got up.  I caught up my
journal.  It was a relaxing day spent with my children and grandchildren.  Jeff
&amp; Gail went home about 11:30 AM.  We played games and then in the afternoon
Mike and his family went home.  David took me for a ride on his motorcycle and
then took Mae for a ride.  It is a very nice bike.  We stayed again this evening
with David &amp; Shauna.  It has been a very relaxing day and so good to be
with our family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, February 22, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had woke early and then went back to sleep. 
Mae let me sleep until 7:30 AM.  I then had to shower and shave before we fixed
breakfast.  We took Emily to preschool and then went home.  I set the washer
and dryer up and them I went to Randy’s and got a treatment.  Randy had me look
at a problem he is having with his house.  There is a leak coming from his
fireplace and I think it is coming from the chimney cap.  I will order a new
cap and build some support under it and I think it will solve the problem.  I
went to the Allstate Insurance broker and got insurance on the Buick and
renters insurance.  I then went to the Davis County Emissions and Inspections
station in Kaysville to get the car licensed.  It failed due to a head lamp out
and a leaking exhaust muffler.  I will need to repair it and bring it back. 
Mae has been putting items away and unpacking all the time while I have been
gone.  I picked up Mae and we went shopping for some chicken for dinner
tonight, and then took a blanket back to Jeff.  We came up to David &amp;
Shauna’s and fixed dinner for them.  We stayed up and visited with David but
they are all sick and we are not sure if we should stay longer or not.  We will
see in the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 23, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke up during the night with a fever and
hurting all over, guess we stayed too long and caught their flu or virus.  I
was up for a while worrying about David and Jeff.  Nether seems to have a very
strong testimony of the church and its leaders.  I am not sure just what to do
as neither is reading from the scriptures daily and I feel they are not having
daily prayer.  Mae got up at 7:30 a.m., but I stayed in bed.  David said that
Shauna was up all night with Conner.  Shauna said that even though she didn’t
get any sleep, she still felt better than she had.  Mae made a casserole for
David, Shauna &amp; their family, then packed our things and we left for home about
9:30.  We took Emily with us to meet her aunt in Layton who was then taking the
children to the zoo.  Mae drove and she stopped at Auto Zone in Layton to get
brake pads and a light for the car.  I will fix them as soon as I am well and
then we need a new muffler so the car will pass the inspection.  Mae also
stopped at Mary’s Health Store to buy “Symptoms of Flu” for me.  I hope it
helps.  We stopped at “Star Café” for breakfast about 11:00.  It was good.  We
came home and went to bed.  Mae slept about an hour and I slept about 3 hours. 
I am still running a fever, hurting all over and feeling horrible.  We watched
a good show on the Hallmark channel.  Mae has still been putting things away
and straightening the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 24, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I didn’t sleep very good last night but it sure
helped to have the recliner to lie in.  Mae let me sleep in this morning.  She
got up and went to Randy’s for a treatment.  I really haven’t done very much
except rest.  Bob said that “The Quiet Man” was on channel 38, following that
one was “High Noon” and following that one was “She Wore A Yellow Ribbon”. 
Those were all excellent movies and a terrible way to take up my evening, but I
sure enjoyed them.  I did visit with Mark about the internet connection but I
don’t think sharing with him is the answer.  Mae ordered us a cellular phone
set up through T Mobile.  Mae also got a treatment from Randy and he feels that
he can help her more than chiropractic treatments.  She is going to try it and
I am glad for that.  She keeps busy putting things away and getting this
apartment looking nice.  I hope that tomorrow I will feel much better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, February 25, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I still feel lousy and thought that this evening
I might even die.  Mae did go over to a program at Lincoln Elementary because
Gail 2<sup>nd</sup> grade class was one of the classes putting it on.  While
Mae was out she ordered check book filler and new Debit cards.  Mae keeps busy
trying to get things unpacked.  She is pretty amazing how much she does.  Bob
called Irven and he came over and replaced the brake pads on our car for us. 
Bob also took the car over and got the muffler and exhaust pipe replaced for
us.  It should be ready to take in on Monday to get it licensed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 27, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am still sick.  Mae was busy getting things
put away and making the apartment very livable and nice.  She sure tries to
take care of me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 27, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Same story, I’m still sick.  Mike called me to
wish me a Happy Birthday.  It was good to visit with him as he described my
symptoms to a “T” as what he had gone through.  Mae attended church at the
Country Creek Ward so she could help tend Kylan and Ashley.  David called me to
wish me a Happy Birthday.  We also had a good visit.  David explained to me how
the Medical Society could predict what type of flue they would be expecting and
preparing a vaccine they would need.  That has always been a puzzle to me.  The
flue virus comes from China and is developed through the close contact of
humans and chickens and in China the chickens and the people live together.  It
then takes about 9 months for the virus to reach the USA.  We also enjoyed a
good Gospel discussion.  This evening Bob came down and we visited for a
while.  I set up a tally sheet for Randy &amp; my trade time.  I also caught up
my journal entries for I haven’t felt well enough to enter them the past few
days.  I still don’t feel well but a little better and I hope that is a food
sign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, February 28, 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I slept quite a bit of the night in the chair
but I did sleep.  We both got up about the same time.  Mae fixed some breakfast
and after eating she went to Randy’s and got a treatment.  She then went to the
store before coming home.  I took the car and got it rechecked for safety and
emissions.  It passed this time and I was given the new stickers.  I then went
to the Drivers License department in Farmington and got my new drivers
license.  I got home before Mae did but I was tired.  I haven’t done much
today.  Bob did go to the store and bought an electrical meter and we checked
out the switch in the bathroom and found it to be bad.  We replaced it and got
the light in the bathroom working.  Mae and I played with our new phones and
talked to some of the children, the three red heads.  Mae sure keeps busy and
it just drives her nuts not to be going 100 miles and hour.  I worry that she
is trying to do to much.</p>
