<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
2:15 AM to go fishing.  I was ready at 3:30 AM but Robert Park didn’t show up
so at 4 AM I called his in-laws home and they said he would be here in just a
few minutes.  He came at 4:15 AM.  His mother-in-law had over slept.  We had to
hurry but made it to Steward by 6:15 AM and were able to check in at the Fish
House where we had made reservations for a charter fishing trip.  There were 12
of us on the boat.  The captain was a young girl 23 years of age.  Her deck
hand was Levi and he is 16 years old.  We had a good day and everyone limited
out with halibut and some of us including myself caught a salmon.  We got back
to Anchorage about 9 PM.  I showered and cleaned up.  Mae had everything about
ready to go.  Terry, Angela, Jaban and Jaren took us to the airport and came
into the airport with us to visit until time for our plane to leave.  We
enjoyed visiting with them and it was sad to say goodbye to each of them as we
hugged for the last time – until we meet again and we don’t know when that will
be.  They are a great family and they were surely a great host and hostess.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We boarded
the airplane at 12:30 AM and went from Anchorage to Seattle.  We changed planes
and went to San Francisco.  We had time to get some breakfast there and to take
a short nap on the benches.  We then flew to S.L.C. getting there at 2:15 PM. 
When we went to get our luggage the zipper of the one suit case was stuck in
the machinery and a worker jerked the handle and ripped the suit case.  I
complained to the “United” luggage office and the agent said they did not accept
responsibility for luggage damaged by the luggage handling equipment.  She gave
me two tickets for $50 off the fairs the next time we traveled United.  Bob and
Carroll picked us up and took us home.  David did not return my pickup after
using it.  I got Randy’s suburban and trailer and picked up the roofing
supplies for Randy’s cabin.  I had Bob dive me up to David’s to get my pickup. 
We were very tired and late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7 AM when I got up.  Mae slept in until 9 AM.  We were all morning
getting things packed and ready to go.  We left for Randy’s cabin about 2:30
PM.  We got there at about 5:30 PM.  Mae and Tayler put things away in the
cabin while David and I started on the roof.  We quit work at 8 PM for dinner. 
After eating we watched the show “She Wore A Yellow Ribbon” with John Wayne.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David and I
started work on the roof at 8 AM, stopped for lunch and then continued until
5:30 PM.  Judy and Randy came up and brought the rest of the shingles up to
us.  David is a pretty good worker.  He is so big I have to remind my self that
he is only 13 years old.  Mae and Judy prepared dinner outside on the grill. 
Randy, Mae, David, Taylor and I played a game of Mormon Bridge and then Randy
and Judy went back home.  We watched a video this evening before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM and then came back to bed and snuggled with Mae.  David and I put in a full
days work again today.  Mae made special effort to have Taylor have an
enjoyable Birthday.  She had decorated the down stairs, made a treasure hunt
for her, had Birthday gifts and made a Birthday cake.  Mae made a special
dinner of fried chicken with all the trimmings.  After eating dinner I took a
shower.  We then watched a movie before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, August 06, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were again
up early for breakfast and to start work on the roof again.  We were able to
get the hardest section to the roof completed and move the scaffolding jacks
up.  We quit early and were on our way home about 5 PM.  We stopped in Evanston
and bought some dinner so that Mae did not have to clean up after we finished work. 
I stopped at Home Depot and bought some 3 inch screws and some 2 X 4’s to use
as bracing on the scaffolding jacks.  Mae started preparing for tomorrow, did
some washing and putting things away.  David and I loaded the scaffolding parts
into Bob’s truck so he can return them Monday morning for me.  I showered and
soon went to bed.  Mae and Taylor went to the store to get some groceries for
next week.  They didn’t get home until 10 PM.  Mae then had to make a Texas
cake for tomorrow.  She didn’t get to bed until mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 3
AM worried about our boys.  The alarm went off at 6 AM and we prepared to go to
Stockton to attend Church there.  JaNae and Brad wanted to have Kennedy Grace
and Dawson blessed today.  We went to JaNae &amp; Brad’s home and left the
Texas cake there so it would not melt in the hot car.  Meeting started at 10
AM.  I had the privilege of Blessing Kennedy then after meeting the Bishop had
the family meet in the Priesthood room where Scott gave Dawson a blessing.  It
had been planed that Scott would bless Dawson while Mae and I were on our
mission, but the time that had been scheduled was the Sunday following Terry’s
death.  It was therefore postponed.  JaNae still wanted Dawson blessed so the
Bishop had it down this way as Dawson is now over two years old.  After that we
all went to JaNae and Brad’s where we had a nice lunch.  Jeff came although he
didn’t stand in on the blessings.  David’s family went to the blessing of
Shauna’s brother’s child so they couldn’t be with us.  Sandi informed us that
Shellie had been called to be the Ward Relief Society President.  We left for
home about 2:30 PM so I had time to take a nap this afternoon.  Mae had lain
down but the phone rang and she got up to answer it.  It was after 5 PM when we
left to go back up to Randy’s cabin.  Randy didn’t go with us as he had got a
serious sun burn and is not feeling good.  David came back with us to help me
but Taylor went back home with her parents.  We ate a light super and then played
a game of Harts before reading scriptures and having prayer.  I filled in my
journal before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, August 08, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David and I
worked all day on the roof.  It rained after lunch so we had to stop for about
an hour.  Randy &amp; friend John, who is a neighbor, came up and spent the
day.  Mae prepared a nice dinner as we quite work for the day.  After dinner
Randy and John left for home.  David, Mae &amp; I watched a John Wayne movie
before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David &amp; I
worked a long day today.  We worked over nine hours.  Mae typed my journal entries
that I had written during the time that our computer was being repaired.  We
had raised the scaffolding to the top and as David and I stepped onto the one
section it began to sink.  We both grabbed the roof ridge and hand walked to
the next section.  What had happened is the one brace arched up instead of down
and had no support to stop an upward arch.  We secured it and continued until
we finished the one side.  We are sure that it will take us more than tomorrow
to finish the job and David thinks he could come back to help me next Monday. 
We decided to keep the incident to our self until we find out if Mike and Becky
will let David come back.  Mae has helped us in the moving of the scaffolding
several times.  Mae prepared supper to eat out side as we roasted hot dogs for
dinner this evening.  David put on the movie North to Alaska to watch this
evening.  I took my shower then watched to show with Mae and David.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We worked a
full day and then cleaned up before eating and coming home.  We were tired and
didn’t do much except shower and go to bed when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, August 11, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We started
early to get things ready to go camping.  I wanted to leave by noon but I
called Sam T. Evans and they said that they could install the top to my pickup
at 11 AM.  I brought the tent trailer up and set it up so Mae could pack it
while I was getting the top put on.  The right rear lift cable broke as we
raised the trailer top.  The left front lift doesn’t work very well either.  I
got to Evan’s at 11 but it wasn’t until after 1:30 PM before I got out of
there.  While waiting for them to install the top, I looked at some of their
new camp trailers.  I also checked as to the cost of repairing our trailer and
it will cost me $600 just for the four new jacks.  I would then do the
installation.  When I get into the job there ma be other needs also.  The new
trailers look better all the time.  We had to finish packing when I got home. 
We left for American Fork getting there about 4:30 PM.  After letting David off
at his home, we stopped at the store for a couple of items.  It was 5:30 PM
when we left American Fork.  Mike thought that the traffic would be very bad but
it wasn’t after we got to Orem.  We were able to find the Payson Lake
Campgrounds and set up the tent trailer.  As we set up our old trailer the new
ones looked better with each problem we had with just Mae and I setting it up. 
We had to put 1 x 3 post on all four corners and I spent ½ hour fastening the
tent to the door.  We had just finished setting up the trailer when David,
Scott and their families arrived.  Mae prepared dinner for everyone.  We got
tents set up and built a nice camp fire.  Of course we had to roast marsh
mellows.  I was a nice evening.  There was one problem with the campgrounds and
that is there were range cattle within the camp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
quite well except we had forgot to bring our pillows.  David and Shauna
prepared a wonderful breakfast of pancakes, sausage and eggs.  We spent time at
the lake and enjoyed it.  I am very impressed with the campgrounds but
complained to the care takers about the cattle.  They were also upset with the
cattle and said they had complained also but hadn’t had any success with the
problem.  Mae sure enjoy being with the Grandchildren.  She goes walking and playing
game with them.  I took a nap this afternoon.  David, Shauna, Scott and I went
to Payson and bought some fishing equipment.  Mike and his family came up this
afternoon.  We helped get there camp set up.  Scott and Mishelle prepared
dinner of barbeques with the trimmings, this evening.  It was late this evening
when Jeff and Gail got there.  We again enjoyed a camp fire this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David and
Tyler went down fishing early this morning.  I started to get ready to go
fishing with my float tub but I can’t find my shoes.  Mike said he had a rubber
boat so he and I went down on that.  Mike couldn’t fish as he doesn’t have a
license so he just rowed the boat while I fished.  It didn’t take long until I
had my limit.  We went over to where David and Tayler were fishing.  They had 3
fish so I took the fish to camp and let Tayler and David go with Mike.  They
had a good time but Tayler caught all six fish with David not catching any.  We
cooked up all the fish and every one enjoyed them.  We enjoyed playing game
this afternoon.  Scott and Mishelle left first with the rest of us leaving
later.  Jeff and Gail stayed over and will come home tomorrow.  We came home
and were very tired when we got unpacked.  We took baths and called it a day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7:30 AM, and then hurried to get to church.  Meetings were good and we enjoyed
being back in our own Ward.  We were sorry that we missed the High Priest
Social last night.  Bob and Carroll invited us to dinner today.  They cooked
large chicken breast, potatoes and gravy.  It was a very good meal and we
enjoyed being with them.  I caught my journal up to date.  Mae and I took a nap
this afternoon.  I hadn’t laid down when I was awaken with acid reflex and had
to sit up in a recliner to finish my nap.  This evening David, Mae and I played
a game of Harts.  David won the game.  We tried to get to bed early as we are
going to try to leave in the morning by 5:45 AM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and left at 5:45 AM stopping at Home Depot and rented a 30’ ladder.  We
stopped in Evanston and got some groceries before going on to Randy’s cabin. 
It was 9 AM when we started on the roof.  We got a good day in and hope to be
able to finish early tomorrow.  Bob and Carroll came up this afternoon and had
dinner with us.  After eating they went back.  I showered and then we read from
the book Cassidy, after we watched a John Wayne movie before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We over slept
this morning so it was almost 9 AM before we got started.  We only stopped for
½ hour for lunch.  Mae made us sandwiches that we stopped long enough to eat
and then went right back to work.  It rained a couple of times on us but it
didn’t stop us.  It was after 5 PM by the time we got everything cleaned up and
stored away.  We went South to Heber City and then down Provo Canon.  We stopped
in Orem and got us something to eat for dinner.  It was already too late for
David to get to Mutual.  We did have some problems with the lights and the
windshield wipers on the way home.  After getting to Mike’s we visited for a
few minutes and then traveled on home getting there about 11 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, August 17, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7 AM.  Mae went right to work on the house getting it clean and
straightened up for her class this evening.  I prepared breakfast and vacuumed
the floors for her.  I returned the ladder to Home Depot.  I went over to Irven
and Sandy’s and removed the shower doors from their bathtub.  I installed a
shower hose and loaned them the tub stool that Mae’s mother used.  It seemed
like it will do what Irven needs.  He still amazes me at how well he is doing. 
When I came home I helped Bob finish mowing the lawn.  I figured Randy’s bill
on his cabin.  It was more than I thought it would be but still much lower that
the one bid I got.  Bob and I went down to the onion patch and wedded.  The
onions are in pretty good shape and are about ready for harvest.  I went over
to see Brother Jackson about drawing plans for a garage he would like to
build.  Mae had her book club meet this evening and it seem to have gone well.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and enjoyed being together.  We didn’t eat anything for breakfast until almost
10 AM.  I did make an appointment to get the window in my pickup shell
tomorrow.  I balanced our bank statement and ended up $2.00 out of balance so
wrote it off.  I think this is the first time I have written an outage off but
it just wasn’t worth it and we needed to leave.  We went over to visit Sister
Moulton for a while and show her some of our pictures.  It was good to visit
with her.  We attended the Ogden Temple this evening as it was our Ward’s
Temple Night but I think we were the only ones from our Ward there.  There was
however a large group at the Temple this evening.  We stopped at a Chinese
restraint and ate before coming home.  It was 10 PM when we got home.  I filled
in my journal entry before going to bed.  We also played a couple of games on
the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, August 19, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then ate breakfast.  I took my truck into town and had the side window
changed to what I had ordered.  The new window makes it possible to fill the
natural gas tank.  That took longer than had been anticipated for they had
estimated it would take ½ hr. to change and it took them over two hours before
I got out of the shop.  The back door lock is still not working so they will
get a new one in next week and I will have to bring the truck back to correct
that.  Bob went with me to Sherrie’s and I installed a storm door on the rear
door I had installed earlier this year.  We did run into some problems with the
door height and had to router the trim ½“ higher.  I didn’t get the door
completely finished but had to quite as Mae and I had an appointment with Irven
and Sandy for dinner.  We spent the evening with Irven and Sandy for after
eating we played games until mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up again this morning.  I rented a furniture dolly and went over to
Jeff &amp; Gail’s and got our freezer.  We also took a tree that Gail had down
to Lincoln Elementary school where Gail teaches.  Jeff also had me repair some
visual aids for Gail.  We went to Mishelle’s parent’s home and got the large
chair that matches our front room furniture.  Scott and Mishelle had stored it
there when they bought our home and got other furniture.  I took Jeff and Gail
back to their home.  Bob helped me unload the furniture at our place.  Bob and
I went back to Sherrie’s and finished the storm door project.  Sherrie paid me
$45.00 for installing it.  Mae and I went out to eat this evening with Jeff,
Gail, Marcie, Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley at Applebee’s.  After eating
Mae and I took Kylan and Ashley to the Layton park and let them play there.  We
then took them to their home and Mae played a game of “Ole Pig” with them.  We
then started to watch the movie of “Bamby”.  Scott and Mishelle and Jeff and
Gail had got together to spend the evening.  It was almost 11 PM before we got
home.  I have been in quite a bit of pain today and I am not sure just why.  </span></p>

but made it to meetings in time.  Bob invited us for dinner but I had a meeting
to attend at 1 PM.  Mae went up and ate with them and then when I got back they
fed me.  I attended the Ward Welfare meeting.  I talked with Bruce about his
roofing problem and decided that we will drive up to their place next Saturday
morning and look at it.  Mae took a nap.  I made some entries on the computer. 
We tried to get to bed early tonight as I will be getting up early to go
fishing in the morning.  It was still about 11 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:15 this morning and left at 5:40 to meet Billy Klass at 6 AM.  We hooked his
boat to my pickup.  We went to Deer Creek Reservoir getting there just after 8

our day for fishing.  It was after 3 PM when we got to Billy’s place.  We did
stop in Heber and get a frozen yogurt at Caroline’s.  After getting home I took
a nap.  Mae had dinner ready when I got up.  I called Bruce this evening and we
discussed his roof.  This evening I cut and colored Mae’s hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
until almost 8 AM.  Mae had breakfast ready shortly after I got up.  I figured
on Bruce and Micheline’s roof and then tried to call Bruce.  He returned my
call later this afternoon.  I did some drawing on Jackson’s garage.  Bob and I
tried to go home teaching to the Jackson’s but Darrin wasn’t home and their
little girl has strept throat.   Irven and Bryce came over and we washed his pickup
top.  Shellie called this evening and visited a few minutes.  We went to a
movie with Irven, Sandy, Mark, Bryce and Deanna this evening at the Kaysville
Theater.  The show was “Cinderella Man” and would have been a good movie except
the one actor used horrible language.  We didn’t get home until after
mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t get
up until almost 8 AM.  Mae was up before that and soon had breakfast ready.  I
went down to Randy’s and got paid for the roofing job.  I made a deposit and
then we left to go up to the Uinta’s.  We stopped at The Home Depot and paid my
bill.  We also picked up some material to tile the bathroom floor.  We arrived
at Randy’s cabin about noon.  We hadn’t locked the shed or shut off the water
before we left last Tuesday.  We spent the afternoon looking at different lots
for sale but didn’t find what we are looking for.  We stopped at David and
Shauna’s on the way home and I got a set of their house plans to figure some
remodeling of their garage.  After getting home I did some book work and
entered my journal entry.  It was after 11 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:45 AM but Mae was already up.  I am restarting the Book of Mormon although I
am not quite finished with reading it now.  Most people feel that with
President Hinckley’s challenge for us to read the Book of Mormon by the end of
the year, that he wants us to start and read it now.  I am not sure just how to
take it but to be sure I am obedient I will start over now.  In order to
complete it by the end of the year I will need to average 2 chapters per day. 
I read two chapters this morning.  Mae made breakfast and then I started
looking for my previous journals.  We were sure they are in a plastic container
so I went through every one.  When I couldn’t find them in the containers in
the house I went out side.  I found them in the last container I looked in.  We
were mainly interested in the 2002 journal and that journal is not there.  The
main thing we needed to know is the schedule for Thanksgiving.  It is the odd
years that we have got together with the Porter family.  I started to reply to
Roger’s letter and got a message that MSN Massager has a new update and do I
want it to update.  I told it to update and now I am not sure what I
accomplished.  I am also studding some information on Ultraform construction. 
Mae has gone Visiting Teaching, I think.  She didn’t get home until almost 1
PM.  I changed the swing of the doors on the refrigerator and then started on
the bathroom remodeling.  It took me all afternoon and into the evening to
remove the adhesive on the old flooring.  I didn’t get it completed before I
ran out of material.  Mike called Mae and is suggesting that we change our
Thanksgiving tradition and hold it with just our family, starting next year.  I
am not very pleased with that.  I am not quite sure what is happening with my
family.  We watched a couple of old John Wayne movies before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 6 AM.  I guess Mae didn’t sleep very well as she was upset with me.  She
got on me about several items.  She is upset about Thanksgiving, I have but
other jobs ahead of doing the bathroom and now I am not going to get it
finished before Sandi and Nick comes on Sunday, and there was two or three
other items that I make her feel bad over.  I really didn’t know how to answer
her and that also upset her.  I went over to Kaysville and got my air hose
repaired, bought a couple of items at Home Depot, and got home and started on
the remodeling by 10 AM.  After lunch I took a nap and then went back to work
on the house.  I didn’t stop until after 9:30 PM and was very tired.  I took a
bath and entered my journal.  After lunch Mae took Kylan &amp; Ashley to a park
and to McDonalds.  She stopped and got a treatment from Dr. Bennett.  Mae was
on the phone quite a bit, working out details about Thanksgiving.  After all
the fuss that was caused over it not being able to have dinner with the
Porters, things changed back and we will have the traditional Porter gathering
for Thanksgiving.  Mae was able to line up a church that we can reserve to hold
it in the recreation hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM but let Mae sleep in until 8 AM.  I called Bruce and had him add some
Ice &amp; Snow Shield to the order.  We worked all day laying tile in the
bathroom.  Mae helped me by doing some of the cutting of tile.  With a room
that size over 1/3 of the tiles had to be cut so that took a large amount of
the time.  We were able to finish and cleanup in time to attend the Ward Social
at 6 PM.  I was hurting quite a lot when we got home.  We watched the movie
“Apollo 13” before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We sure slept
good last night and we needed it.  I went to bed hurting but got up feeling
pretty good.  We attended regular meetings but I was still tired and had
trouble staying awake.  After church we had some lunch of the cabbage casserole
that Bob had prepared yesterday.  I set the toilet so we won’t have to run
upstairs now.  I took a nap for over an hour and then got up and helped Mae get
dinner ready.  Sandi and Nick came about 4:30 PM.  We finished up and had a
very nice dinner.  After eating we played some games.  We made some planned for
having most of our family here for the Labor Day.  We are thinking of having a
Dutch oven cook out.  Mae and I watched the news concerning the Hurricane
Katrina that is expected to hit Louisiana with in the next few hours.  We went
to bed early tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
getting up at 7:30 AM.  I had been up earlier and read my scriptures.  After
breakfast Mae went for a walk.  I started getting dressed but didn’t feel good
so I laid down and slept for another hour.  I went down to Randy’s and he gave
me a treatment.  He didn’t feel good so didn’t give me as complete treatment.  I
came back home and started with the grouting of the bathroom floor.  Mae helped
me by washing towels for me.  After finishing that floor I went to Irven and
Sandy’s and replaced two tiles that had been broken while they had moved a
piano downstairs.  It was 8 PM when I got home.  I took a shower and watched
part of a show on TV before entering my journal and going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7:30 AM but then went back to bed for an hour.  I soon got on the
computer trying to write a letter to Roger Sylvia about some money he wants us
to send to him.  We are a little concerned about doing it again.  I also tried
to get on line with The Home Depot.  I spent quite a bit of time but didn’t
succeed with that.  Sometimes I get very upset with these computers.  Mae and I
went to Jennie Porter for tests and that took all afternoon.  Bob and I went
home teaching to the Jackson’s.  Mae was on the computer when I came home so I
went in and turned the news on.  The devastation that is left by the hurricane
is terrible.  It will be a long time before recovery can be made if ever.  It
was late when we went to bed.  Mae made some changes to my letter to Roger but
I don’t think she sent it yet.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                While we were
at Jennie’s, Robin also talked to me about some property in Island Park that he
would like to buy or may have even bought, that he would like to build a cabin
on and sale.  It looks like it could be a good investment.  I am also considering
some property in the Uinta that we might purchase for a similar investment.  I
have thought of seeing if David would be interested but I am concerned about
investing with David for a couple of reasons.  I sure wish that I know how to
make these decisions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up at
4 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep thinking of the investment opportunities,
the letter to Roger and the world situation.    I worked on David’s plans for a
while and then went back to bed about 8 AM for a couple of hours.  Mae had breakfast
ready when I got up.  I got my tools put up from yesterday and reloaded tools
for roofing.  I serviced my pickup this afternoon.  Mae did some chasing for
me.  I helped Bob repair his sprinklers.  We didn’t get away until after 7 PM
so it was after 9 PM when we got to Bruce and Micheline’s.  We visited for a
while before going to bed.  Mae called me before I went to bed.  Roger had sent
us a reply explaining the reason he needs the extra money with him so I guess I
will send it to him Tuesday.</span></p>
