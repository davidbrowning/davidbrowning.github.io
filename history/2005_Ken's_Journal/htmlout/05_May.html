<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Shortly after
getting up we got a call asking for Mae to meet with the Bishop at 8:45 AM.  It
was a beautiful morning so we just walked to the church.  We really enjoyed the
cool beautiful walk.  Mae was called to be in the Relief Society as a Literacy
Specialist.  Our membership records were read in today and then Mae was
sustained in the calling.  She was set apart right after the Block.  Bob
invited us for dinner and when we went up Linda and Juliann were there.  They
came up for the Women’s Conference.  We enjoyed the meal and visiting with
Linda and Juliann.  Linda and Roy are putting in their papers for a mission
call.  It will be after July before they can go.  Mae and I came down and took
a nap.  Shortly after we lay down the Relief Society President came over to
bring Mae a book.  I slept for a while.  Bob said there was a show on but when
I turned it on it was the “Home Teacher”.  I watched it about five minutes and
turned it off.  I don’t like that kind of show.  Mae got on the inter-net while
I filled capsules.  We called and talked to Shellie for a while.  I filled in
my journal for today.  It was after 11 before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were most
of the day moving things in from the trailer.  Bob helped me quite a bit.  Mae
put thing away and then this afternoon she had a Dr. appointment.  After
empting the trailer I mowed the lawns with Bob’s rider lawn mower.  I watched a
show on TV but Mae kept working on the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Before going to
Mike &amp; Becky’s we stopped at the Star Restaurant for breakfast.  We got to
Mike’s place before 9:30 AM.  We visited with Becky’s mother before she left. 
It was good to hear about some of their mission experiences.  Mae played with
Mattie &amp; Jessie and I balanced our checking account.  I also worked on the
plans for David’s shop.  Mae called me for help as Mattie had shoved her hand
through the toe of Mae’s slipper.  She could not pull it back.  We worked a
plastic bag over her hand and through the slipper which made it smooth enough
to pull her hand out.  At 3 PM I left for S.L. to meet with Sandi and then we
met with her investment adviser concerning the money she will be getting from
the settlement of Terry’s accident.  We were there almost 2 hours.  Sandi and I
went out to eat and visit after that.  When I got back to Mike’s David, Taylor,
Mae and I played some card games.  Mae said that Mattie had a high fever this
evening.  Mae went to bed about 10:30 PM as she may be up with the children.  I
filled out my journal and played a game on the computer before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM to fixes breakfast for David and Taylor before they went to school.  Today
I worked on David’s plans and Mae and I went through some of the pictures to
show the family Friday evening.  I got a couple of short naps today.  Becky got
home about 4:30 PM.  I think the children were glad to have her home.  We
stayed for dinner and then left shortly after 7 PM.  Bob came down shortly
after we got home and told us of a show on TV.  We turned it on but then felt
that we had better things to do than watch it, so turned it off.  I entered my
journal and while doing that Charles Hyer called to visit with me about Sandi’s
investments.  The computer tried to go into stand by and locked up.  It took me
a few minutes to recover.  David also called and we visited concerning his
plans.  Before going to bed Mae and I each played a game on the computer. 
There is something relaxing about it and we play “Spider Solitary” and if it
gets to where it looks like we can’t win it we just start a new game.  Oh well,
we have fun with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until almost 7 AM.  After the morning regular routine Bob and I went up to
David and Shauna’s and measured their house for a plot plan.  We then drove up
to Porterville just to look around at property.  I didn’t get to excited about
it.  Mae had gone out to lunch with Jeff when I returned so I warmed something
up.  We visited with Jeff for a while when they came back.  Mae got on the
computer to work on pictures so I went looking for a Western Union so I could
send some money to Roger Sylvia.  After doing that I went over to the White
Elegance and bought Mae a white sweater for Mothers Day.  I stopped at Bryce’s
and looked at what he wants me to repair for them.  We visited for a while. 
Mae was still working on the computer when I returned.  We ate some dinner and
watched a show on TV.  Mae wanted to read or work on pictures so I went into
the bedroom and watched another show.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 6:30 AM.  I had slept in the recliner last night because of stomach
problems.  The pills I am taking seem to be helping but not totally.  Bob came
down and invited us to breakfast of biscuits &amp; gravy.  We set the table
down here as Carroll has things on her table right now.  I worked on the
computer most of the day working on budgets and David &amp; Shauna’s plans.  I
took a nap at 5 PM while Mae went to town to make some changes in our insurance
and to a book and other supplies.  We went to the Ogden Temple with Bob and
Mark this evening as it was Ward Temple night.  We didn’t see very many from
the Ward there.  It was a nice session and I was alert all the way though.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
had breakfast then I went over to Roy to correct the Western Union money
transfer as I had not used Roger’s given name, for Roger is a nick name.  I got
that corrected and then went to Scott’s where Scott, Mike &amp; Jeff helped
move out the rest of our storage in the basement.  We also exchanged the
refrigerator of Mae’s mother and put the one of that was downstairs.  It was
2:30 PM when I got home.  I took a nap before we went over to the Clearfield
Chapel to give a family fireside about our mission experiences.  Bryce had
arranged for us to use their chapel for the evening.  We met in the Relief
Society room.  We had quite a few that came.  Mae had put several presentations
together from the pictures we had taken while on our mission.  We showed two
sets of the presentations which took about two hours.  We asked if they would
like to see the second one after we finished the first.  We had several express
their feelings and said that they enjoyed the presentations.  On the way home
we stopped at the grocery store for a few items.  It was 11:30 PM when we got
home.  It was enjoyable but we were very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Neither Mae
nor I slept very well last night.  I got up at 7 AM.  I prepared breakfast this
morning for Mae as it is Mothers Day.  I gave Mae her Mothers Day gift Friday
evening so she could wear it to the Temple.  It was a white sweater.  Church
went well, the discussion in Priesthood meeting was very enjoyable, I got
sleepy during Sunday school class and though the Sacrament program was very
good I fell asleep during part of it.  After getting home Mae took a nap while
I entered some data onto the Palm.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner. 
Bob, Mark and I visited for a while after.  I set in the recliner and took a
nap.  Mae tried to do some typing on the computer but was having problems with
the computer trying to go into standby and locking up.  I tried several things
to find the problem but it didn’t occur with me.  We went over to Scott &amp;
Mishelle’s where David and his family, Sandi, Jeff &amp; Gail and Scott’s
family wished Mae a happy Mothers Day.  It was almost 11 PM when we returned
home.  I entered my journal and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had to
unload the pickup and then get some tools this morning.  I went up to Bryce
&amp; Deana where I did some electrical wiring of a switch, and outlet and a
doorbell.  I was until 2 PM getting it done.  Bryce paid me $100 witch included
$14 plus, worth of parts that I purchased or took from my supplies.  I then called
Jeff and he met me at Scott &amp; Mishelle’s where we loaded items to go to the
D.I.  We came and loaded a load of trash and took to the land fill.  We then
loaded a load of tools and supplies from the garage and I brought them back and
unloaded them in the shed.  Mae had dinner ready so we ate and then I went with
Bob to Sherrie’s and measured her kitchen for changing the back door and making
a pantry.  When I got home we watched the DVD “The Work and The Glory”.  We
really enjoyed the movie.  We had reservations about it as we could not
understand how they could put all 6 volumes into one movie.  They didn’t as
this one only covered the 1<sup>st</sup> volume.  Now we will be waiting for
other volumes to be made into movies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I have spent
most of the day working on the computer or on the phone.  Bob came down and
wanted more help with Sherrie’s kitchen so I spent some time trying to find the
place where I bought the doors for Terry &amp; Sandi’s remodel.  I called Sandi
to give her some advice about checking on her money and tax payout.  She told
us that JaNae is having gull bladder problems and will need to go into the
hospital.  Jeff called and we visited about finding a home for remodeling.  Mae
and I went over and looked at one house and called the realtor about it but it
doesn’t look to good.  We went over to the store and I locked my keys in the
car.  We had to have Bob come over and bring us home to get Mae’s keys for she
had left her keys in her coat pocket.  We sent over to Davis High School to listen
to a concert that Lindsey was in.  We got home shortly after 9 PM but I stayed
up to work on David’s plans until almost 11 PM.  Mae also stayed up studying on
her lesson for tomorrow night.  We seem to keep very busy but sometimes I feel
that I’m not getting very far.</span></p>

until 6:45 AM.  Jeff called me to remind me of an appointment at 9 AM to look
at a house.  I had to hurry as it was then 8:45 AM.  It snowed heavy last night
and I was unable to get my truck out of the back yard.  I had to take the car. 
It was almost 9:30 AM when I got to the house at 1204 N Nayon Dr. in Layton. 
The house has water damage and has been trashed.  We can figure the restoration
cost and put a bid on it.  We went back to Jeff and Gail’s where Jeff and I
visited a while.  He and Gail are going on a trip to Nauvoo with the
Hunsaker’s.  They will leave this evening and still have to get some things
packed.  I came home about 2 PM.  I worked on David’s shop plans and did some
figuring as to the repair needs for the house Jeff and I looked at.  Mae left
at 6:30 PM to attend R. S. Enrichment Night.  She will give her first lesson
tonight.  She has sure put a lot of time into her lesson.  Bob came down so I
went with him to see about Sherrie’s needs.  I didn’t get back home until after
9 PM.  I was just starting to get something to eat when Mae came home.  We at
some taco salad and then I worked on the house estimates.  It was after 11 PM
before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
the recliner last night so Mae let me sleep in a little longer.  Mae had an
appointment with the dentist at 9 AM.  I have worked on the computer all day
with most of the day working on David’s plans.  Bob and I went Home Teaching at
6 PM to the Bryon Johnson’s.  Mae is working on files of talks and articles she
has saved over the years.  I am trying to get her to use the scanner and file
them on the computer system.  At 8 PM Bob &amp; Mark came down and informed us
that Irven was involved in a head on collision with a semi but he is not in
critical condition.  He was transported to the LDS Hospital with damages to his
legs and hips.  They didn’t have very much detail at this time.  Bob, Carroll,
Mark, Mae and I joined in prayer and fasting in his and his family’s behalf.  I
called and informed Roy with what little facts that we have.  I visited with
Roy concerning their expected mission call, as they are planning on turning in
their papers Sunday.  I stayed and lessoned to the news for a few minutes and that
is quite negative.  I wonder how long The Lord will hold off His second coming.</span></p>

morning so I went down to Randy’s and put a new chimney cap on his front room
fireplace.  Bob went with me and was some help.  We were until 1.30 PM
finishing it up and talking with Randy about remodeling his home.  Also Randy
has a water line that runs under his sun room that probably froze and need to
be repaired.  Scott and Mishelle had a wedding to make a DVD for so they ask
Mae if she would tend Kylan and Ashley for them today.  She did and took them
to Dinosaur Land for most of the day.  After Bob and I got back from Randy’s,
Bob Mark and I went to SL to see Irven.  We stopped at Layton city for me to
check on some requirements on the house Jeff and I are looking at to buy and
repair for an investment.  We also went over to the house to make some
measurements.  We went to a door shop in SL to check on door prices for
Sherrie’s house.  I was able to find it ok.  We then went up to the hospital to
see Irven.  We were there for a couple of hours or more and didn’t get home
until after 5 PM.  Mae and the kids were back.  Scott and Mishelle soon came
back.  They visited for a few minutes and after they left we soon started to
bed.  We started to rub each others feet but we both fell asleep.</span></p>

were just cuddling when Mae asked if we had to be to the Church at 9 AM for
cleaning.  I had forgotten about the assignment and I was to be there at 7:30
AM.  It was 7:15 AM then, so I hurried and got dressed and left.  I reminded
Bob and Mark as I left.  There was a fair group and we completed the job at 9
AM.  After getting home I suggested that we go out for breakfast.  Bob, Carol,
Mae &amp; I went to the Star Café, after we stopped at Rheams and bought a few
groceries.  I helped Mae move some items into the house form the trailer and
then we moved the trailer to the back of the yard.  Bob wanted me to call on
the doors for Sherrie.  They said they could have them built before 4 PM.  Scott
wanted to use the truck to haul trash to the dumps.  I had him use Bob’s pickup
so Bob could go to SL to pickup the door.  Bob mowed the lawn and I worked out
in the yard cleaning up tree limbs and trimming the grass.  Bob went down and got
the door but when he got back the doors were not what we had ordered and
Sherrie didn’t like them so we will have to return them.  I worked until 7 PM
outside and then came in and worked on David’s plans until 9:30 PM when I had a
computer failure and lost most of my work.  I filled in my journal and went to
bed.</span></p>

6 AM and worked on our talks.  I rewrote my talk and then when we spoke I did a
major revision to it again.  They went fairly well but maybe not as good as we
wished they had.  After getting home I drew on David’s plans and got them back
to where they were last night before I lost them.  David, Shauna and the
children came for dinner and I wanted to show David the plans.  Sandi called
and visited with me about Irven’s accident.  We enjoyed dinner with David and
his family.  We also enjoyed visiting for a while after.  After they went home
we read for a while but I fell asleep.  Bob woke me by calling to tell me what
he had found out about Irven.  Mike called and visited for a while.  Mae and I
read for a while again but got ready for bed about 9:30 PM.  I filled out my
journal before we went to bed.  I started with a skin treatment that is to
clear up precancerous spots on my face.  I have to put it on twice a day and
let it stay on for a hour before washing it off.</span></p>

today.  Mae’s appointment was at 9 AM so she left early.  I fixed me something
for breakfast.  Bob and I went to Sherrie’s and loaded the doors to take back. 
After Mae returned we drove down to Salt Lake to return the doors and to visit
Irven at the hospital.  Sandy was there and we visited quite a while with her. 
Irven is in pretty bad shape but I guess he lucky to be alive.  I finished
David’s plans this afternoon.  We went over to Scott &amp; Mishelle’s for
dinner and to watch a video “Return to Me.”  I had to stay up until after
mid-night because of the medication on my face.</span></p>

came over and we visited a while.  As we looked at the prices being asked for
the houses, the Realtor cost, the repair cost and what the market is on resale,
there just isn’t enough in it for us.  We will let it go for now.  Mae got
quite a bit packed.  She rescheduled her Dr appointment until we return from
Arizona.  I was able to take David’s plans to the Engineer in Bountiful.  Bob
and I went Home Teaching this evening and finished it up.  We took food up to
Bob &amp; Carroll that we didn’t think would keep until we returned.  It will
still be after 10 PM before we get to bed.  Shellie called to be sure that we
were set to come down.  In talking with her we realized that we didn’t leave SL
until 10:30 AM.  That will let us sleep in a little longer.</span></p>

the driver and I was glad when we made it ok and I could drive back at my own
pace.  It is hard to believe the changes and the growth that this area has made
since we originally came to the Phoenix valley.  We just relaxed most of the
day.  I watched the video “The Shooter” staring John Wayne.  Later this
afternoon Mae, Jase and I went swimming.  When Garrett came home from school he
wasn’t feeling well.  He did some home work and then went to bed.  Quint and
Kevis came in swimming when they got home from school.  I helped Mae prepare
dinner.  I watched a couple of nature shows on TV while Mae played games with
the children.  I went out and played a game of dodge ball.  David called me
this evening and said he was talking to his builder about us building a garage
and he said he would be into it about $30,000 to $35,000.  If that is the cost
we won’t be building a home for a while.  David said he can’t pay that kind of
money for a garage.  We will just have to bid it out and see where we stand. 
We read scriptures with Quint and Kevis and discussed them before putting them
to bed.  Garrett woke and was hungry so got up and ate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were
awakened by someone calling Garrett.  He had over slept, as he wasn’t feeling
well last night, and some friends had come to get him for school.  I told him
that if he felt well enough to go that I would take him.  We got him to school
in time.  I worked on David’s plans making a material list.  Mae and I went
grocery shopping about noon.  After the boys got home from school we watched a
DVD on TV.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
had breakfast with the boys.  I am having some problems with enjoying the boys
as Mae seems to.  The boys did their Saturday chores and then plans were made
as to an activity for today.  It took quite a while but Garrett decided to go
with some of his friends this evening to see Star Wars.  The rest of us went to
Tempe where we saw the show “Are We There Yet”.  It was ok, I guess!  When
Garrett got home he wasn’t feeling the best, still running a fever.  I let my
self get to passionate this evening and upset Mae, so it didn’t turn out to be
a very good evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Although we
were up late trying to discuss our problem yet I am very confused with my self
this morning.  There are many things that are bothering me at this time and I
don’t know the answers to them.  Garrett and Quint stayed home sick today. 
Meetings went well and we enjoyed being there.  Mae put potatoes in to be baked
when we got home.  Mae and I lay down and took a nap while the potatoes were
cooking.  I grilled a ham steak to go with dinner.  This evening we played
games with the boys.  I have noticed that the pool pump has not been working
the past two days so I had Garrett come out and we checked it.  He knows of no
other switches that might be off.  I added some chlorine to the pool as the
test shows that it is low in chlorine.  I will try to check the electrical
circuit out in the morning and if I can’t find something there I will call the
pool service co.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early to take Garrett to school.  There is several of the parents that car pool
the High School students.  We left just after 6 AM but Garrett forgot to give
me directions and we missed the first house and had to turn around and go
back.  Then they forgot to have me turn on the right street, so we had to go
around another way.  At that house another mother drove up and we found out
that Shellie had asked her to take the youth.  I left to come back home but it
took me several minutes to find my way back as all streets come to a dead end. 
The boys upset me as to there eating habits and I just have to keep my mouth
shut.  I got a hold of the pool co. and they will come tomorrow to check out
the pool.  I went down town to the Home Depot and did some looking for
instructions on laying cement block and brick.  I felt depressed this morning
so after looking at Home Depot I took a ride out East of town.  I could hardly
believe how far the building has expanded and how many subdivisions they are
still building.  We watched a show after lunch.  I took a nap this afternoon. 
After dinner we held Family Home Evening.  We showed the boys some of our
pictures from our mission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
and prepared breakfast and got the boys off to school.  I came in time to eat
breakfast with the family.  Quint went to school this morning as he wants to be
able to go on the Science Field trip on Wednesday.  Roy called us from Alaska
to see how things were going.  I told him the problems we are having with the
pool and that I had a man coming to check it out.  He said he would call back
later today.  A service man from Caribbean Pools came out to check on the problems
we are experiencing with the circulating pump on the swimming pool.  He said
the pump was ok.  We checked the electrical circuit and found that we were
loosing power between the main panel box and the main switch at the pool area. 
He is unable to work on the electrical problem.  He gave me the phone number
for Sonaran Electric and said they were the one that had ran the electrical
lines to the pool.  I called them at 480-833-0461 and talked to the
receptionist.  She told me she would have someone call me by this afternoon to
set an appointment to give me an estimate.  She asked me how long the pool had
been in and I estimated it to be 4 to 5 years.  She said that their warranty
was only for 3 years.  I told her that it didn’t really matter as we needed it
fixed.  This afternoon Mae and I watched the movie, “The Diary Of Anne Frank”. 
It was a very good movie about the experiences of World War Two.  When Quint
and Kevis got home from school Mae started preparing the items that Quint will
need for tomorrows field trip.  I went to the store to get a couple of items
that he needs and I bought some groceries.  Mae made Corn Beef Patties and rice
for dinner this evening.  Garrett is pretty good at eating what Mae prepares
but the other three boys are so picky that it really upsets me.  I had to leave
the table or I would have said more than I should.  I drove Garrett and Quint
to the church so they could attend Mutual activities this evening.  They were
able to find a ride home.  I watched a movie on TV this evening.  Mae was busy
helping the boys with their school requirements.  I don’t know how much help I
am for her.  I am letting the boy’s attitude get to me.  I guess I am getting
to old to raise children.  My stomach bothered me to bad to lay down to sleep
so I went into the family room and slept in the recliner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 2
AM and tried to go back to bed, but I was tossing and couldn’t quite worrying
about the problems with the pool and the boys, so I got up and entered my journal
entry for yesterday.  I set in the recliner and went back to sleep about 4 AM
and was again waken by Garrett shortly after 6 AM.  Mae had the other boys up
before 7 AM so that again woke me.  After eating breakfast I went back to sleep
for about an hour but my stomach problems woke me an hour later.  I called the
electrical company and was told that a person would be out soon.  Butch came
out about 4 PM and soon found out what I had surmised yesterday.  He changed
the wiring from the water fall to the circulating pump so that the auto
chlorine would start working.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today was an
almost wasted day for I mainly watched shows.  We went swimming this evening
with Quint and Jase.  I really don’t feel the best but I don’t know what to do
about it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was wakened
at 1 AM with an alarm going off.  I searched all over and found it was coming
from the freezer in the storage room.  Garrett had got food out of the freezer
last night and hadn’t shut the door tight.  I had to wake Garrett to see if he
knew how to shut the alarm of.  He didn’t.  I found the switch at the bottom of
the freezer and got the alarm off.  My stomach bothered me to the point that I
know I couldn’t lay down so I slept the rest of the night in the recliner.  Mae
got up to get Quint off to school.  I lay down and slept until 8:45 AM.  Quint
wasn’t feeling well so didn’t go to school today.  Shellie called and wanted
Terry’s cellar phone number which we do not have so I called Bryce to see if he
had it.  He doesn’t.  We visited for several minutes about a sprinkler system
for his home.  I told him to go to Durk’s and get a yard lay and have them
figure the materials for the job.  We also talked about the selling and buying
of houses.  I told him I didn’t know enough to advise anyone for I figure I
have lost money on every house I have ever bought or sold.  I feel like I am
just wasting time with nothing to do.  I watched the movie “Red River” with
John Wayne.  Mae and I went shopping for a few groceries and took Jase with
us.  While we were gone the boys watched a movie that Shellie had given them
permission to see.  I don’t feel good about what the kids watch.  They seem to
be caught up in Star Wars, stupid movies, Harry Potter and shows like that.  I
just can’t help feeling that these types of entertainment are not good for
anyone.  Roy called and asked if the electrician had come.  He hadn’t.  Roy had
called the pool co. asking them if they could put some pressure on the electric
co to fix it right. This evening we put up a sheet and set up the projector and
watched the move “The Phantom of the Opera”.  After the boys went to bed, Mae
and I straightened up some of the mess and then went for a swim.  I tried to
get Mae to go skinny dipping but she wouldn’t.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
shortly after 6 AM and read my scriptures, put cream on my face to kill the
cancer cell.  My face is quite sore and looks like a boiled tomato but I guess
it is doing the job.  I finished my journal entrance from yesterday.  We had to
finish putting the furniture back from last night.  We got the boys to do their
assigned chores.  Mae swept the floors and I mopped most of the tile floors. 
Mae keeps getting after me because I lost the Birthday List from the Palm Pilot
so I made some calls and before the day was over I was able to build a new
Birthday list with the exception of Gail’s and Jace’s birthdates.  I also took
time to play a game with Quint and Mae.  This evening Mae and I watched a movie
on TV.  I laid my glasses down on the bed and later rolled over on them and
bent the frame.  In trying to straighten them they broke.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were
awakened by Jase playing with the games upstairs.  I prepared breakfast of
waffles and eggs.  It doesn’t seem to matter what you prepare for these boys at
least one of them doesn’t like them.  I am really struggleing with this.  We
all attended meetings and enjoyed that.  When we got home I helped Mae prepare
dinner and again we had picky children.  I took a nap.  We got a call from
Bryce telling us that Cheryl’s daughter Sarah died today.  I called Sandy and
she confirmed it that Cheryl was there visiting Irven when she received a call
telling her of the death.  Sarah evidently has been sick with a repertory illness
and choked in her sleep and suffocated.  That will be a hard one to handle.  We
held Family Home Evening with the children.  We played a couple of games with
them for an activity, Books and Chinese Drawing.  The boys enjoyed them.   Bob
called me to let me know of the death.  Patsy and Veldon called and I visited
with them about their mission calling for a few minutes.  </span></p>

went into the airport to get Roy, Shellie and their friends.  I didn’t know
what to expect with the traffic so left before 7 AM.  The traffic was very
light and only took me a ½ hour to get there.  After getting home they told us
of their trip.  We went swimming this afternoon.  Mae and I started to watch a
show but then this evening we set up the projector and Shellie and Roy showed
us their pictures and told us of their trip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
slept in but Shellie had to get up and get children off to school.  We really
spent a fairly relaxing day.  About 7 AM the electricians came and pulled new
wiring from the main electrical panel to the pool area.  I took my glasses into
a shop and got them repaired.  It cost me $55 to get them done but I guess that
is what I get for not having patients when I realized I had bent the frames. 
Mae wanted to watch the Phantom of the Opera again.  I went to sleep lying on
her lap.  We went swimming this afternoon.  We were just getting out when Roy
got home.  Roy and I visited a while about the pool repairs and then we went
back in for a swim.  This evening we ate dinner by the pool.  Roy &amp; Shellie
really have a beautiful pool and back yard.  They have really taken pride in
the home and yard and it shows it.</span></p>
