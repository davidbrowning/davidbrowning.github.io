<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
expecting to watch conference but I called on a tent trailer that Bob saw in
the paper.  The gentleman said that he could meet us at the storage area at 9
AM.  I thought that would give us enough time.  When we looked at the trailer
it was like new.  Mae really liked it but it was small and it didn’t have the
port-a-potty.  We were about to get it but I suggested that we look at the one
I had seen yesterday.  We went to South Ogden and looked at it and Mae changed
her mind and we got the larger model for $4,700.  We got home just as the first
Session was concluding.  I did call Bob and had him start the recorder for the
conference session.  Bob prepared lunch for me but Mae had eaten and went
shopping.  I started the recording of the afternoon session of conference and
also watched it.  We set the tent trailer up so that the boy’s could sleep in
it tonight when they get here.  I attended the Priesthood session of conference
with Scott this evening.  It was very good.  After conference Scott and I went
out to eat at Tonny Lomas and had beef ribs.  It was really enjoyable to be
with Scott tonight.  I waited up for Shellie and the boys to get here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
Mae prepared breakfast of waffles.  We watched the first session of General
Conference, and then many of our family came.  David and Shauna and their
families did not stay for dinner.  Mae prepared baked chicken and a potatoes
bar with all the trimmings.  It was very good.  We watched the second session
of conference and then visited and played games.  It was late when everyone
left but it has been a very good day.  This evening we had clam chowder for
super.  We read from the scriptures before we went to bed.  Sandi had brought
us a beautiful family picture that Chelci had taken of the family.  David
brought us a picture of their family that Mike took yesterday.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early but it was almost 8 AM before we got packed and on our way.  We got
natural gas in Clearfield and again in Evanston and got to the visitor center
at Martin Cove about 2 PM.  Veldon and Patsy Seymore were on duty there and
they showed us around.  Veldon took us to the cove and explained it to us. 
Patsy went on home and prepared a nice dinner for us.  We showed some of our
slide of the Philippines to the Seymore’s before going to bed.  The couple
missionaries that live north of the Seymore’s, Elder &amp; Sister Roth, let us
sleep in their spare bedroom.  They had the covers turned down and a chocolate
on our pillow.  It was a very nice room and bed.  Mae one went to bed but I
stayed up writing in my journal and then I played one game on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM but let Mae sleep until he woke at 6:45.  As she went to sleep last night I
thought she said not to wake her at 6 but he wanted me to wake her at 6.  Oh
well she got a little more sleep that way.  We went over for breakfast and then
prepared to go out for the day.  We went back to Martin’s cove and there took a
hike to Devil’s Gap.  The kids got to pull hand carts and we did some hiking.  Shellie,
Garrett, Quint and I hiked through Devils Gate.  It is very rough terrain and
only the river run through it.  It rained on us most of the day and in the
afternoon it turned to snow.  The bad weather helped us to gain a deeper
respect for those pioneers and what they went through.  After spending time at
Martin’s Cove we traveled to Independence Rock.  Although it wa raining we
walked around the area and stood on the rock o we could at least say that we
had done that.  The boys climbed to the top of the rock.  From there we went to
Muddy Gap Service Station where we bought some souvenirs.  We came back to
Elder &amp; Sister Seymore’s.  I came over to the Roth’s and took a hot shower
to warm up.  I also put on dry clothes.  I got visiting with Elder &amp; Sister
Roth before returning to the Seymore’s.  After eating dinner we got playing the
game Knock.  Sister Seymore won all three games.  We again stayed at the Roth’
this evening.  Mae read the scriptures while I made my journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept well
and didn’t get up until 7:30 AM.  It had snowed about 4 inches last night so
the boys and Shellie made a snowman.  We then had to have everyone in a picture
with it.  Elder and Sister Seymore took us to the “Sixth Crossing” where they
had served earlier.  From there we headed home getting there after 7 PM.  We
were late eating but it didn’t seem to bother me tonight.  I thought I had the
heat set for the boys in the trailer but it wasn’t.  After I went to bed they
found that the heat had stopped.  Mae didn’t wake me but thought she had it
working but the boys slept quite cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I got
up and went up to Jennie Porter’s and had her check us.  It was after 1 PM when
we got back home.  Mae spent the rest of the day preparing for a jewelry party
for JaNae.  When the party started I went upstairs and watched a show with Bob
&amp; Carroll.  I came downstairs before Sandi and JaNae left so I was able to
say good by to them.  I fell asleep in the recliner.  Shellie and Mae visited
for some time.  I woke just before mid-night and we visited until almost 2 AM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8 AM before getting up.  B ob fixed biscuits &amp; gravy for us for
breakfast.  Mae, Shellie and the kids went to the Layton Park.  The kids came
home while Mae and Shellie joined Sandi, Becky, Shauna and Gail for a evening
out with the girls.  I worked on getting the camp trailer winterized and put
away.  I cleaned out the old camp trailer and Bob found someone to give the old
trailer to.  It was late when I got finished.  I also checked to see if my
fishing boat was ready yet.  They asked me to check back on Monday.  I forgot
that I was to go to Scott’s and Scott &amp; Jeff were going to help me clean up
my computer.  I wasn’t ready and I needed to get the kids something for super. 
Jase didn’t eat and that caused some problems.  I turned on a show on TV and
about the time Mae came home there was a bad seen and she immediately
criticized the show so I shut it off.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, October 08, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:45 AM but let Mae sleep in until 7:30 AM.  Irven’s and Sandy sold a cabinet
to a couple.  Bob and I hauled it to their place.  After that I came home and
took a ½ hour nap.  Mae and the boys went to Lagoon where they met Shellie,
Sandy, Chelci and her boy friend.  They didn’t get home until after 7:30 PM.  Bob
and I worked all the rest of the day cleaning out the shed and out building so
we can get Irven’s Snowy equipment brought over here and put away.  It was
almost 7 PM when we quite.  We were therefore late eating.  We next read from
the Book of Mormon and had prayers.  The boys helped do up the dishes before
they went to bed.  Mae gave me a hair cut before we went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up until almost 7 AM.  Mae and I prepared breakfast while Shellie got the boys
going and packed up.  We got Shellie and the boys of before 10:30 AM and then
we got ready and went to church.  We only attended Sacrament meeting but I
still fell asleep and missed ½ of the program.  Bob and Carroll invited us for
dinner.  It was very good. They had made fried chicken, potatoes &amp; gravy
and hot rolls.  We visited for a few minutes and then went downstairs and
crashed.  We slept for a couple of hours and then watched the documentary on
Joseph Smith.  Mae got some super of peaches and toast.  The peaches were those
she had canned this fall and they were sure good.  I called Devin Browning and
visited with him about the Jonathan Browning Reunion.  I then called Mike to
see how they felt about David and Tayler tending the little girls so we could
attend the evening program in connection with the reunion.  It was ok with them
so I called and made reservations.  I made my journal entry and we took our
medication before going to bed.  Harold Kendal called me and wants me to do
some work for him.  I told him that I would as soon as I could get the time but
I did have other commitments at the time that had to come first.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but I thought I was an hour earlier than I was.  The alarm clock was set wrong
so I didn’t get to Stone’s until after 9 AM.  I ate my lunch while I was
driving to pickup supplies.  It was after 5 PM when I quite.  Mae had dinner
ready when I got home and cleaned up.  Mae has been busy all day cleaning the
house and doing washing.  It was badly needed after the past week.  After
dinner I tightened up some screws that were coming loose on our bar chairs. 
Bob and I measured the yard and I can draw a plot plan with our desired plans
for an additional driveway, to see if we can get city approval.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up on
time and made it to work at 8 AM.  I changed the electrical and the plumbing. 
Bob came over at 12:30 and helped me.  I burned the drain – valve box for the
washer hook ups and had Bob go to Durk’s and get a new one.  Bob helped me set
the sheetrock on the ceiling.  It was after 5 PM when I got home so I had to
hurry and shower so Bob and I could go Home Teaching.  We were able to visit
all three families this evening.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home so after
eating I made my journal entry and went to sleep.  I had to set up as it was to
soon after eating to lay down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had to stop
at Home Depot and get some materials before getting to work at 8 AM.  I left
work about 2:30 PM, came home and got Mae &amp; Bob and we went out to Boat
&amp; Truck Sales and got the boat and took it to Willard Bay and tested it
out.  I was told that I should get some gas but I didn’t and we ran out before
getting back to the dock.  I paddled a long ways and then some men that were
fishing towed us in.  I was to late getting back to return the boat so brought
it on home.  Mae went to Relief Society although she was late getting there.  I
loaded Mark’s things into the truck and we are ready to leave in the morning to
go to Mesquite Arizona in the morning to get a rotavador.  I worked on the
computer for some time getting a mileage form created to keep track of my mileage
for work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mark and I
left for Southern Utah at 6 AM.  We went first to St. George where we unloaded
some items to be put in storage.  We then went to Mesquite and loaded Mark’s
rotavator.  We then came back to St. George and loaded a chipper.  We stopped
and got something to eat and then came back home.  We got home at 9 PM.  We
unloaded the truck and hooked up the boat so I can return it in the morning.  I
called the owner of the boat company and explained why we didn’t return it last
night and that it had a bad leak.  He said he would check it and let me know
what had to be done to repair it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, October 14, 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and returned the boat.  They are to see why and how much it will cost to
repair the leaks in the boat.  I returned home where Mae had breakfast ready. 
I worked over at Stones getting there at 8:30 AM and working until 11:30 AM.  I
then went up to Kendall’s and worked there from 12:30 PM until 8:30 PM.  I hung
one door and reframed two door openings.  Mae had invited Marna &amp; Mark
McFee over to play games this evening.  They came at 7 PM but it was after 8:30
PM when I got home.  We enjoyed playing marbles and knock with them.  They left
at 10:30 PM and it took me awhile to get my journal entry and work records
finished,  It was almost mid-night when I went to bed.  Mae doesn’t feel to
well but she plans on cleaning the church house tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae woke up
at 6 AM to go to the Church house to clean it as this week is the Relief
Society’s turn to clean it.  I woke when she got up but then went back to bed
for a ½ hour.  Mae got home just after 8 AM.  They had a good group and it went
well.  Bob took us over to see another boat.  It looks pretty good and is a
little larger boat and is not just for fishing only.  We hauled most of Irven
&amp; Sandy’s Snowie equipment over to store in the shed in back.  We didn’t
have time to put things away as we were to meet Jeff &amp; Gail at 2:30 PM. 
Scott and his family came at 3 PM and we all went to Gardeners Village.  Jeff
and Gail wanted to find some furniture that they had seen there.  We then went
to Cabela’s in Lehi.  Mike and Becky met us there.  Cabala’s is a sporting
store that has several impressive displays.  The display are titled “The
Mountain”, “Africa Room”, “The Wild Life Room”, and “The Aquarium Room”, they
also had a “Shooting Gallery”.  We ate in their restraint but were not over
excited at the food.  It was a fun evening but I became excused and my feet
were in a lot of pain by the time we left.  Jeff did the driving for me because
I was so tired.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t feel
well this morning so I slept in.  Mae got up and attended Relief Society.  I
got up just before she returned.  I got ready and we attended Sacrament meeting
at the Country Creek Ward as they were having their Primary Program and Kylan
was participating in it.  We came home and took a nap.  Scott and Mishelle
invited us to come over at 5 PM for dinner with them.  We enjoyed visiting with
them.  Mishelle had made a very nice chicken dinner and hot rolls.  We just
visited after eating.  We got home about 8:30PM.  Mae had me print a family
picture of Mike’s family.  We played some games of spider solitary before
calling it a night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
feel good but she got up and got breakfast for me.  Bob, Grant and I unloaded
Irven and Sandy’s items and stored them in the shed.  Bob will get the last of
the equipment later this morning.  I went to Stone’s and put on the second coat
of mud.  I next went up to Kendall’s and hung two doors.   I started to pack up
my tools but Mr. Kendall wanted me to look at a roof vent that caught fire the
other night.  We also looked at the deck in which the Kendall’s will set a hot
tub.  I don’t think it is strong enough to hold that much weight.  I called
Grenn Clark and told him my thoughts and he will look into it.  This evening
Mae had dinner waiting for me even though she hasn’t felt very well all day. 
She is sure special.  Bob and I put the last of Irven and Sandy’s Snowie
equipment in the shed and I think we will have room for a boat to fit if we get
one.  Mae and I watched a couple of cute shows on TV this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
went to work at Stone’s.  Mae wasn’t feeling well so I had her sleep in.  I
stopped at Home Depot and picked up some materials for Stone’s.  I ran out of
sheetrock mud so I called Bob and he picked me up some.  I finished up shortly
after 2 PM.  Bob and I met Shane Hoskins at 3 PM.  We took Shane’s boat out to
Willard Bay to try it out.  When we put the boat in the water the steering went
out and we were unable to try it out.  Mae isn’t feeling well, in fact she is
worse.  She was planning to hold the R.S. Book club tomorrow night but I
convinced her that it was a bad idea so she canceled it for a week.  Home
Teachers came this evening but I had Mae stay downstairs.  The Stake Clerk
called and wants to set up an appointment with Mae and I to meet with a member
of the Stake Presidency.  We were not able to set a definite time with Mae
feeling bad.  I had hoped that I could stay home tomorrow but Steve Stone
called and they will have the painting done so I can start the tiling tomorrow.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep well so I tried to let her sleep in this morning.  She had partially
prepared my breakfast while she was up during the night.  I wanted to have Bob
go with me but he was still in bed.  I called him later and he came over and
helped me the rest of the day.  On the way to work I stopped and got natural
gas for the truck but when I went to pay for it I realized I had left my wallet
home.  I had to stop on the way home and pay for the gas.  With Bob’s help I
was able to tile the bathroom and the entrance way.  Mae isn’t feeling any
better this evening.  After eating I took a shower.  We then watched a couple
of shows on TV.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM to see where Mae was.  She was in the other bedroom sleeping as she was
concerned about keeping me awake as she tossed and turned not feeling well.  I
went back to sleep and slept until 8 AM.  I prepared breakfast and was going to
do some repairs around here that I have been putting off.  Bob came down and
showed me some ads on a couple of boats in the Salt Lake paper.  I called on
them and then went with Bob &amp; Carroll to S.L.  We left Carroll at her
sisters and went to see the one boat.  It was a much bigger boat than I am
interested in.  I finally got a hold of the owner of the second boat and they
live in Kamas.  By the time we got home it was 3 PM and most of the day was
gone.  I decided to make a patch of whole wheat home made bread.  We decided
that the yeast I used was dead and I had to throw it out.  I went shopping and
got some groceries.  When I got home we watched a show on TV.  I really didn’t
get much accomplished today.  We called Mike and Becky and let them know that
Mae is sick.  They were able to get Becky’s sister to tend the children this
weekend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
made some cooked cereal and then went down to Randy’s and got a treatment.  He
worked on me for 1 ½ hours and it really helped.  I stopped at the bank and got
a cashier’s check to Jay Bird Investment Inc. and took back to Randy’s.  Randy
and his son-in-law, Myron Bouwhuis have found another home to buy so I have
invested money into it.  Bob then went with me and we went over to Stone’s and
grouted the tile floor.  It took us two hours and we were both tired.  I came
home and fixed some lunch for Mae and I and then drove up to Francis Utah.  I
looked at a boat there but it isn’t a fishing boat.  I drove back by way of
Heber and stopped there and got me a Frozen Yogurt to eat on the way.  This evening
Mae and I watched another show on TV that was really good.  The Hallmark
channel is playing some good ones this week.  We also watched M.A.S.H. this

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
4:30 AM so read from the Book of Mormon and then went back to bed.  I then
slept until after 8 AM.  Mae prepared breakfast even though she doesn’t feel
well.  I went into the Jonathan Browning 200<sup>th</sup> Birthday Family
Reunion held at the Union Station in Ogden.  I spent the morning visiting with
family members and waiting for Bob and his family to come in and for Irven and
Sandy co arrive.  Both arrived after noon so I could have done other things. 
In the afternoon I went on the bus tour which was interesting and enjoyable.  I
wanted to go the Peterson Boat store so Irven and Sandy went with me.  It was
closed when we got there before 5 PM.  We went back to the reunion and were
there for the evening dinner and program.  It was a good reunion and the planning
was very good.  There are some that wants it to be continued every 5 years or
so but no decision was made at this time.  I sure missed having Mae with me.  She
still isn’t feeling well so it is a good thing that she didn’t go with me
today.  It was almost 10 when I got home.  Mae and I visited for a while about
the reunion and some of those I visited with.  I entered my journal before
going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up at
4 AM and read 2 chapters from the Book of Mormon before going back to bed.  I
didn’t get up then until 6:30 AM.  Mae didn’t feel good so she stayed home.  I
came home after priesthood meeting and Mae decided that she felt good enough
that she could to go to Sacrament meeting.  I lay down and took a nap and that
helped me enjoy Sacrament meeting.  Mae didn’t feel the best and was glad to
get home.  I was asked to help with the passing of the Sacrament today and I
enjoyed that privilege.  Bob told us that they would be eating about 2 PM and
that they would send some down for Mae and I.  At 2:30 I was concerned if he
had forgotten us and wondered if I should prepare something for us.  He came
down a few minutes later and said they were ready and was just a little late. 
I was glad that I hadn’t started anything.  The dinner was very good and I told
Mae that it was much better than the meal at the reunion yesterday.  We later
took a nap but I still had to nap in the chair because of stomach problems. 
This evening we read a couple of articles in the Ensign and then we lessoned to
two of the talks from the last General Conference.  I had called Terrall
Kendall to see if he was ready and wanted me to come on Tuesday.  He called
back and said he and Grenn was concerned at the time I had taken to hang the
tree doors that I have so for done.  I tried to explain to him that a lot of
that time was due to talking about other projects.  He decided to have me come
Tuesday morning.  I hope things work out ok there.  Bob came down and visited
for a while.  I filled out my journal before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae still
isn’t feeling well but she got up and prepared my breakfast and lunch and then
went back to bed.  I worked at Stone’s all day trying to finish up the job.  I
didn’t get it quite finished so will come back tomorrow.  I didn’t get home
until 4:20 PM and so I had to hurry and get ready to go to Kim and Jeannine’s. 
I went over to the Tanner Clinic in Layton to meet with Georgia and Rick and
ride up with them.  Georgia was in the Dr. Office quite late.  Bryce and Deanna
were already there when we got there.  We didn’t get to Kim’s until almost 7
PM.  After eating Georgia wanted all the Priesthood holders to give her a
blessing as she will under go surgery this Thursday.  We played a game of
“Knock” and then we played “Skunk” and that was also a fun game.  It was almost
11 PM when I got home.  I then figured the billing for Stones and filled in my
journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up to
go to work but Mae felt so bad I thought I had better stay home and take care
of her.  She asked if I would give her a blessing so I asked Bob if he would
help me.  he didn’t hear right and thought I wanted him to help me over at
Stone’s.  I decided to put up the apples that Georgia and Rick gave us last
night.  Using the apple peeler I was able to peel the box in less than an
hour.  After cooking the apples for over an hour they were still tuff and
wouldn’t go through the Victoria Juicer.  I tried the old colander but that
didn’t work either.  Bob brought down some parts to the Bosch mixer and we were
able to grind the apples up.  I had processed about ½ of the apples and thought
I was adding some Fruitos but added salt instead.  It really spoiled the apple
sauce and I had to dump it out.  Mae had bought a sack of Sea Salt at the same
time she bought the Fruitos.  I finished the rest of the apple sauce and got
eight quarts.  This evening I went over to Stones and finished their job.  It
was almost 9 PM when I got home.  Mae was watching a show on TV and I watched
the end of it with her as I was getting something to eat.  I then watched a
couple of shows of M.A.S.H. before filling out my journal and going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up to
go to work.  Mae got up and prepared my breakfast and lunch.  I was late
getting to work but it went well.  I drove the trailer around back but when I
tried to get out it was more difficult.  I don’t think I will try that again. 
We got a letter from the Buckeye’s in the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> branch in the
Philippines.  It was really good to hear from them.  I was thinking that today
was Thursday so I came home so we could make it to an appointment with the
Stake Presidency.  Mae wasn’t ready because she know it was Wednesday and that
I had told her Thursday evening.   I was tired but after dinner Mae gave me a
hair cut and then we watched a show on TV.  During the commercials I took a
shower.  We called Sandi to see how she is doing.  I filled out my journal
entry before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very good last night; most of the reason was worrying about <br>
David and Jeff.  I just don’t know what to do to get them to talk to me about
their problems with the Church.  Because I didn’t sleep well Mae turned the
alarm off and I didn’t wake up until 6:45 AM.  I really had to hurry to get to
work.  I stopped at Stone’s to try to stop the leak under the wash basin.  I
had to get some plumbers putty and a faucet wrench.  It took me two hours to
get it repaired.  I then went to Terrall Kendall’s and worked there until 4:40
PM.  Terrall is concerned that it is taking to long with the job.  I am feeling
that I wish that I had never started this job.  I stopped at Home Depot and
purchased some construction glue and a router bit.  Mae had supper ready when I
got home.  After eating I showered and we went over to the Stake Presidents
office.  President Travis, 1<sup>st</sup> Counselor in the Stake President extended
a call to me to be a counselor in our High Priest Group.  We came back home and
watched a show on TV.  I filled out my journal entry before going to bed.  Mae
is feeling some better tonight.  We will be glad when she is totally well. 
Good Night!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked at
Kendall’s today getting quite a lot done.  Terrall wasn’t very happy when I
told him that if it was a good day Monday that I was going fishing.  After
loading all my tools tonight and taking the trailer with me, I went to Scott
and Mishelle’s and borrowed their vaporizer.  I then went to the Little Orient
and bought some dinner to take out.  It was late when I got home and I was very
tired.  We watched a show on TV and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was almost
7 before I woke up this morning.  I took Mae out to eat at the Star Café and
then took a belt to the shoe shop to have it repaired.  I went to the office
supply and bought some things we needed.  I next stopped at Mary’s Health store
for some capsules and some pills for Mae.  I went into Dan’s and bought some
batteries, a beef roast, a case of Kleenex’s and a dozen Roses for Mae.  From
there I went to the Hooked shop and bought some worms for Monday’s fishing
trip.  That finished my running around except that after I got home Bob and I
ran over to Peterson Marina in Riverdale to see what they had in used fishing
boats.  They had advertised that they several used boats but they only had two
and they wanted too much for them.  Mark came down stairs and wanted me to put
a cast on his arm.  That took about an hour and it turned out fair but he kept
working one area and it didn’t set up right.  I Rota tilled a garden spot for
next spring.  After tilling the ground I had Bob use his rider lawn mower to
pull his home made harrow over the area to pack it down.  Marks Rota Tiller did
a good job but just as I finished it started to make a loud squealing sound. 
Bob called a friend of his that repairs small equipment and we took it to him. 
He will check it out Monday and let us know what the problem is.  I mounted
another tool box in my trailer this evening.  When Bob and I returned from
taking the tiller to have it checked I told Bob we needed to put the charger on
his truck battery.  The battery was very low on water and needs to be cleaned. 
We added the water and put the charger on but Bob will have to clean it Monday. 
I was going to install a new drain on our bathroom sink but when I came in I
was just too tired.  Mark came back down and we added some more to his cast.  I
hope it works for him.  I laid down on the Chee machine for a while and then
entered my journal before taking my shower and going to bed.  We ended up
playing a few games of Solitary on the computer before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It seemed
good to go off day-light-saving-time.  I really don’t like it as if I want to
get up early then I can.  Mae didn’t feel very good but went to Relief Society
anyway.  I was sustained to be put in as 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor to President
Smith in the High Priest Group.  As this is the 5<sup>th</sup> Sunday the
Priesthood and R. S. met together for our lesson.  The Bishop turned the time
to a sister from the Stake to talk to us to about the unwed parents program of
the Church.  It was very interesting and I can’t help but wonder what changes
it would have made in out lives.  I often think of the pain of that experience
and the great trial it was for that Sandi had to go through with her marriage
to David.  I guess some day we will understand.  Mae didn’t feel good so she
went home early from R.S.  I left Sunday school early to come home and check on
Mae.  She went back to Sacrament meeting with me.  After meetings we went into
the High Counsel room where Brother Kelly J Bodily was set apart as 1<sup>st</sup>
assistant and I was set apart as 2<sup>nd</sup> assistant in the High Priest
Group Leadership.  I look forward to working with President Smith and Brother Bodily. 
Bob invited us for dinner and it was very good.  This afternoon Mae and I took
a nap.  Anyway I slept and Mae rested.  We enjoyed reading after getting up and
then we discussed some ideas of this and the next life.  I then got things put
together for going fishing tomorrow with Randy.  Mae is so good to help me and
is very concerned about my needs.  We ate a light super and I popped some corn
to take with me tomorrow.  I filled out my journal entry and then headed to bed
early.  Mae is still feeling quite sick and is sure tired of this feeling.  She
is taking and doing everything she can to get better but it just hangs on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
3:15 AM and was at Randy’s at 5 AM.  We had some problems getting his pickup to
engage in reverse and were about to give up but then it took hold.  It was
about 8 AM and 24 degrees when we got to Strawberry reservoir.  We had a good
day of fishing although it was cold and the wind started blowing about 10 AM. 
We caught a lot of fish but were only able to keep 6 of them.  All the rest
were over 15 inches or under 22 inches.  That is the new regulations now.  We
quite fishing at 5 PM but it took a little while to load the boat.  Of course
we had to stop and buy a frozen yogurt.  We then stopped at Coalville and
filled up with diesel fuel.  It was after 9 PM when I got home.  I cleaned the
fish and put them away.  I entered my journal and went to bed.  I was tired but
it was a fun day.  Mae is feeling some better this evening.</span></p>
