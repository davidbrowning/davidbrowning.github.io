<p class=MsoNormal>THE FLOW, PICK, BIG, NO SEE CHICKEN, SYSTEM FOR DRIVING IN
ASIAN COUNTRY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The system for successful driving presented in
the following paragraphs is simple and functional....IT WORKS.  An experienced
driver (or passenger) may want to add corollaries to the Basic four principles,
but the four principles are BASIC.   A level of safety has not yet been
attached to the system, but there is reason to believe that if adhered to by a
normally alert and responsive driver, the safety factor is very high.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            FLOW It does not matter where the lines on the
road are painted, or how man official lanes there are...flow with the traffic. 
If there are only two painted lanes for traffic, but there are four lanes of
vehicles, don't worry about it...flow.  The writer has experienced flowing in
eight lanes of traffic all going in one direction on a four lane, two-way
street.  Other flowing tales can be heard by asking any experienced driver in
Asia.  The flow principle bothers new drivers and passengers to Asia (as well
the other three principles).  When remember, when in doubt...flow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            PICK This principle is equally as simple as the
first.  Whichever driver can pick (place) any portion of his vehicle in front
of another vehicle, the successful (first) picker has the right of way.  The
slow learner who waits in a line for a break in traffic is bound to spend much
of his traffic life in line.  All it takes is a little courage coupled with a
small portion of bumper or fender picked in front of another vehicle, and you
have the right of way.  Of course, it works both ways.  If another driver picks
his vehicle in front of yours, you have to give the right of way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Picking bothers new drivers and passengers to
Asia and frequently produces a lot of swearing when one driver gets picked by
another.  The system easily incorporates swearing in any language, especially
if it reduces tension...but it doesn't count.  Picking does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Vehicle speed is often an important ingredient
in traffic negotiations, but the Basic principle still holds.  No matter that
you may be going 45 k.p.h., if another driver picks you, he has the right of
way.  If it happens to you, stop first and swear later.  However, with only
slight practice, both acts can be conducted simultaneously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            BIG   This principle is easy to remember without
any difficulty.  The bigger vehicle the higher the priority for occupying
traffic space and for being granted the right of way.  In most cities, buses
are the biggest vehicle and have the highest priority.  However, flowing and
judiciously picking will permit drivers of smaller vehicles to compete with
larger vehicles. Nevertheless, when push comes to crunch, &quot;BIG&quot; does
have priority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            So far we have the flow, pick and big system. 
The final principle adds considerable excitement to driving or riding in Asia,
especially after the first three principles have been mastered and driving
becomes too easy.  It is very simple to tell when this level of proficiency has
been reached by paying attention to three vital indicators.  While in traffic,
if a driver does not swear out loud, can carry on a conversation without
frequent dramatic changes in voice modulation, and does not sweat, he is ready
for the NO-SEE-CHICKEN principle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            THE NO-SEE-CHICKEN   To understand this
principle, an old, not too smart, Western, teenage automobile game needs to be
recalled.....&quot;CHICKEN&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            &quot;Chicken&quot; is when two drivers going
towards one another both place their left wheels on the center line.  Both
drivers head towards one another and the first to move off the line and out of
the way of the other vehicle is a chicken.  The NO-SEE-CHICKEN principle need
not be nearly as dangerous as the game just described, but novices will find it
often does race the pulse.  It is important in the NO-SEE-CHICKEN situation not
to let on (no-see) that you see the other vehicle(s).  For example, when
entering an intersection, if there is a vehicle coming from your left or right,
you have to act like you do not see it.  The best procedures are to maintain
your speed and look straight ahead.  If speed is lowered or you turn your head
to look in the direction of the other vehicle, the driver will know you have
spotted him and the old variety of &quot;CHICKEN&quot; GOES INTO PLAY.  The
other driver will continue toward the intersection knowing he can most likely
force you into giving the right of way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            However, if you act as if you do not see the
other driver, you neither look in his direction nor slow your vehicle, you give
yourself considerable advantage, and most likely you can have the right of way. 
A little judicious courage in implementing this principle will bring instant
success and increased feelings of road power.  An appropriate understanding and
application of the principle can actually result in greater safety.  But
remember, if eye contact is made or even a slight turn of the head indicated
your acknowledgment of the other driver, you should be prepared to give the
right of way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As the reader may gather, this principle is not
for the weak of heart.  It can also be difficult for passengers in your vehicle
who may not know whether you are using the NO-SEE-CHICKEN principle or whether
you no see.  The writer's wife, for instance, has never developed an
appreciation of his use of the NO-SEE-CHICKEN principle, now allowed him to
apply this principle in silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At first glance, a new driver or passenger in
Asia may think the principles herein suggest illegal behavior.  Not at all It
is best to file, for later use, the back-home rules regulating rights of way. 
The basic fur principles outline the everyday system that operates throughout
most of Asia, and other less developed areas of the world as well.  They make
it explicit what successful drivers come to understand unconsciously.  Look out
for anything bigger than your vehicle, have a ready foot for the brake, and an
able hand for the horn...a very major and essential part of the &quot;Asian
Car.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The point is that you have to know the rules to
play the game well.  Many people spend years in Asian traffic, swearing,
wearing years off their lives, but have never understood or entered the game. 
Just remember......FLOW, PICK, BIG, and NO-SEE CHICKEN.</p>
