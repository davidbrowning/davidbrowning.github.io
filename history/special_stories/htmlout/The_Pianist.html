Pianist<br>
<br>
<br>
 Wishing to encourage her young son's progress on the piano, a mother took<br>
 the small boy to a Paderewski concert. After they were seated, the mother<br>
 spotted a friend in the audience and walked down the aisle to<br>
 greet her. Seizing the opportunity to explore the wonders of the concert<br>
 hall, the little boy rose and eventually explored his way through a door<br>
 marked &quot;NO ADMITTANCE.&quot; When the house lights dimmed and the<br>
 concert was about to begin, the mother returned to her seat and<br>
 discovered that her son was missing.<br>
<br>
 Suddenly, the curtains parted and spotlights focused on the impressive<br>
 Steinway on stage. In horror, the mother saw her little boy sitting at the<br>
 keyboard, innocently picking out &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.&quot;<br>
<br>
 At that moment, the great piano master made his entrance, quickly moved<br>
 to the piano, and whispered in he boy's ear, &quot;Don't quit. Keep
playing.&quot;<br>
 Then leaning over, Paderewski reached down with his left<br>
 hand and began filling in a bass part. Soon his right arm reached around</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> to the other
side of the child and he added a running obligato.<br>
<br>
 Together, the old master and the young novice transformed a frightening<br>
 situation into a wonderfully creative experience. The audience was<br>
 mesmerized.<br>
<br>
 That's the way it is with God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> What we can
accomplish on our own is hardly noteworthy. We try our best,<br>
 but the results aren't exactly graceful flowing music. But with the hand of<br>
 the Master, our life's work truly can be beautiful.<br>
 Next time you set out to accomplish great feats, listen carefully.<br>
<br>
 You can hear the voice of the Master, whispering in your ear, &quot;Don't<br>
 quit. Keep playing.&quot; Feel His loving arms around you. Know that His
strong<br>
 hands are playing the concerto of your life.<br>
<br>
 God doesn't call the equipped; He equips the called.</span></p>
