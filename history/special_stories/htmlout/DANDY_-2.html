<p class=MsoNormal>            DANDY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            BY PRESIDENT DAVID O. MCKAY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was very clever–sometimes too clever for his own good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had great pleasure in training a well-bred
colt.  He had a good disposition, clean, well-rounded eye, was well
proportioned, and all in all, a choice animal.  Under the saddle he was as
willing, responsive, and cooperative as a horse could be.  He and my dog,
Scotty, were real companions.  I liked the way he would go up to something of
which he was afraid.  He had confidence that if he would do as I bade him he
would not be injured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            But my horse Dandy resented restraint.  He was
ill-contented when tied and would nibble at the tie rope until he was free.  He
would not run away; he just wanted to be free.  Thinking other horses felt the
same, he would proceed to untie their ropes.  He hated to be confined in the
pasture, and if he could find a place in the fence where there was only smooth
wire, he would paw the wire carefully with his feet until he could step over to
freedom.  More than once my neighbors were kind enough to put him back in the
field.  He learned even to push open the gate.  Though he often did damage that
was provoking and sometimes expensive, I admired his ingenuity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            But his curiosity and desire to explore the
neighborhood led him and me into trouble.  Once on the highway he was hit by an
automobile, resulting in a demolished machine, injury to the horse, and slight,
thoughnot serious, injury to the driver.  Recovering from that, and still
impelled by a feeling of wanderlust, he inspected the fence throughout the
entire boundary.  He even found the gates wired.  So for a while we thought we
had Dandy secure in the pasture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One day, however, somebody left the gate
unwired.  Detecting this, Dandy unlatched it, took another horse with him, and
together they visited the neighbor'ws field.  They went to an old house used
for storage.  Dandy's curiosity prompted him to push open the door.  There was
a sack of grain.  What a findF!  Yes, and what a tragedy!  The grain was
poisoned bait for rodentsf!  In a few minutes Dandy and the other horse were in
spasmodic pain, and shortly both were dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            How like Dandy are many of you young people! 
You are not bad; you do not even intend to do wrong; but you are impulsive,
full of life, full of curiosity;, and long to do something.  You, too, are
restless under restraint, but if left to wander without direction, you all too
frequently find yourselves in the environment of temptation and too often are
entangled in the snare of evil.</p>
