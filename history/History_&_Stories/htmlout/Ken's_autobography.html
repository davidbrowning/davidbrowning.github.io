<p class=MsoNormal>            I was born February 27, 1939 in Sugar, Idaho. 
My father’s name is Charles Henry Browning, and my mother’s name is Emma
Margaret Hill Browning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The place I remember as home as a child was
Victor, Idaho.  Victor is a small farming community located in the Teton basin,
west of the Grand Teton Peaks and just over that mountain from Jackson Hole,
Wyoming.   It had a total population of 150.  Here is where I remember most of
my childhood days for we lived there until I was twelve years old.  Dad was a
butcher, and owned his own slaughter house just west of town.  I can remember
spending many days playing there at the slaughter house and helping dad with
his work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Both my father and mother had been previously
married.  So on my father’s side, I have two brothers, Cleo and Rich, and two
sisters, Geneva and Florence.  On my mother’s side, there was my sister,
Margaret, and a brother, Floyd Robert “Bob”.  There were three of us boys that
were born to Mom and Dad.  The oldest was LeRoy.  I was in the middle, then my
youngest brother, Irven.  Roy and I were constantly fighting and arguing as we
grew up.  Our mother said that I was a good natured child and could play for
hours with two cans and some dirt.  I would sit and pour the one can of dirt
into the other and keep myself amused for a long time until Roy would come and
kick them over or take them away.  Once when we were teenagers, Mom had had her
fill of our fighting.  She told us that the next time she caught us fighting
she would take us outside and roll up our pant legs.  We would fight and each
time we would stop she would swat our bare legs with a willow.  Soon Roy had
had enough so he took off running.  Mom chased him, caught him, and swatted him
all the way home.  Mom was so exhausted by the time they got home that she went
into the house and forgot about me.  This was one time that Roy got the worst
of it.  Irven was five years younger than me, and he was my tag-a-long.  He
always wanted to go with me, and I usually took him with me until I grew older
and had friends I wanted to be with.  All of dad’s children except for Rich,
who was the youngest, were married before I was old enough to remember, and
they seemed more like aunts and uncles to me than brothers and sisters.  Consequently,
I had lots of nieces and nephews older than myself.  On one occasion when I was
about 11, my seventeen year old nephew, who was almost 6 feet tall, said to his
friends “Meet my Uncle Ken.”  Rich lived with us a few years that I can
remember, but the main thing I can remember of Rich before he got married was
when he came home from the service he brought two friends with him.  It seemed
so funny because Rich is only about 5 foot 6 inches tall, and both of his
friends were so tal that they had to actually duck as they went through the
doorways in our home.  As far as Margaret and Bob, I always think of them just
as full brothers and sisters because I grew up around them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            During my boyhood, I would go to school in our
one room schoolhouse, help dad in his slaughter house, ski, and have dog sled
races with my dog, Pete.  Pete was the fastest dog in Victor.  When I was about
5, I had my tonsils removed and while recovering I ate a soda cracker and
started hemorrhaging.  My mother quickly put me in the car and took off for the
nearest hospital.  About half way there, I threw up and it was all blood.  Mom
was panicked and was close to the Indian Reservation so she drove there as she
knew I would probably not make it to the hospital.  She found a doctor, but he
didn’t want to touch me since I wasn’t native American and didn’t live on the
reservation.  Finally, when he saw me coughing up blood, he quickly took care
of me and saved my life.  Thanks mainly goes to Heavenly Father for blessing us
that we could be there in time.            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            All of us kids were encouraged to attend church
and were there taught the principles of the gospel.  Dad had been ordained a
High Priest, mainly because of his age. Dad wasn’t the most active high priest
in the ward and in his later years in Sunset would occasionally attend
Priesthood meeting, if he was asked to attend.  I guess most of my
encouragement and training in the church was given me by my mother and
grandmother, especially my grandmother as mom worked, but grandma was home with
us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            (I need to make an insertion here, not to
discredit my mother in any way, as she had many experiences in life to
challenge most.  I believe that you can get a better idea of her life by
reading her personal history.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This a letter I wrote Sunday, August 01, 2010</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Granddaughter Ashley,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandpa had hoped that we might drive home to be
with you on this special day in your life.  I am sorry that my health is
stopping Grandma and me from doing that.  When we found out that I was going to
have this operation and we were told that I could not work for a couple of
weeks, we thought that it might work out so that we could come home for this
special occasion but I guess Grandpa is getting to old for my body to heal that
fast.  I guess it is like waking up on a school day being too sick to go to
school but also to sick to get up and play.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            May I still tell you some of my feeling as to
what this special day means to me?  Of course this special day that I am
writing about is the day you are BAPTIZED.  Although it was over 63 years ago
that I was baptized, I still remember that day.  I am sorry to say that it was
not because of my mother or father’s testimony, teachings or encouragement that
I was baptized but because of the love of my primary teacher.  When she
realized that my parent’s faith was not strong enough to teach me the
importance of baptism into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, she
continued to teach me each week in our primary class and then, several months
after my 8<sup>th</sup> birthday, she arranged for me to have an interview with
my Bishop.  She then picked me up on the appointed day and took me to the Stake
Baptismal Day which was held at our Stake Center over 10 miles away from where
I lived, in the next community.  There is not much that I remember about the
meeting except that I didn’t know anyone that was there, except my primary
teacher.  I do not remember the talks or the music and I did not even know the
one that baptized me.  I do remember that after being baptized that I felt good
and I also remembered that my teacher loved me.  The next day was Fast Sunday
and my Uncle Albert, who was also serving in the bishopric, confirmed me a
member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder Day Saints.  I do not remember
if any of my family were at the meeting or not that day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When looking at how much I remembered about my
baptismal day, some people may say, “Why do we baptize a child so young?  Why
not wait until they are older, maybe 16 or 18 or even 21 when they are an adult
and can decide for themselves?”  Yes we have many wonderful and faithful
members of the Church that were not baptized until they were much older.  I
believe that for some reason; only known to Our Heavenly Father, some of us
were blessed with the privilege of coming to this earth with special parents
and circumstances wherein we are blessed to have the privilege of being
baptized as early in our life as 8 years of age.  We know from our scriptures
that, Our Heavenly Father has stopped Satan from having power over the hearts
of little children until 8 years of age.  I believe that because of the Great
Love Heavenly Father has for each of his children, as soon as circumstances are
right, that He wants us to have a very special helper, a personal guide and a
comforter, to be with us as we go through the rest of our life.  Most of the
time, we refer to this helper as the Holy Ghost.  Ashley, for you that time is
now.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            May I testify to you, as one of many who loves
you very much, that I know the Holy Ghost.  He has helped me make important
decisions in my life.  He has given me answers to my prayers, often instantly. 
He has comforted me when I was afraid and needed help when there was no one
else that could help me.  The greatest experience to me was when I needed help
and asked to know if the Book of Mormon was true and if Joseph Smith was a
Prophet of God.  That answer came to me as I left my bed room, after I had
completed reading the Book of Mormon and earnestly asked in prayer, as clear
and certain as if someone had spoken to me in a loud voice.  I bear testimony
that I know that the Book of Mormon is true and that Joseph Smith was called of
God to restore the Church of Jesus Christ.   He remained true to that calling
and sealed his testimony by giving his life rather than to deny his testimony. 
By the Spirit of the Holy Ghost you or anyone can also have that testimony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Love Grandpa Browning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While in Victor I graduated from Primary and was ordained
into the Aaronic Priesthood as a Deacon.  The only grandparent I remember is my
grandmother Hill.  Grandpa Hill died before I could remember him.  My father’s
mother died when he was still a teenager, and his father was murdered when a
bandit held up his grocery store.  Grandma Hill came to live with us a couple
of years after grandpa died, and lived with us until her death in January
1959.  I’ll always be thankful to her for the guidance she gave to all of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As I said, Dad wasn’t the most active person in
the ward and during the summers I remember many choice weekends in the hills
that were so near to us.  I guess it was from dad that I gained my great love
for camping, but my love for fishing came from my brother, Bob.  One thing dad
did teach us though was the value of work and being honest to your fellowman. 
I don’t think dad ever made an unfair deal or cheated anyone in his life, in
fact, he expected the same from almost everyone he met and because of this it
made him feel bad to remind people that they still hadn’t paid their bills. 
Because of this, he finally lost his business in 1951.  After losing his
business, he went to work for a meat packing company in Butte, Montana.  He
would drive home every weekend to be with the family, and then have to leave
Sunday afternoon in order to be back Monday morning.  On one of those trips
home, the steering column on the pickup broke causing him to wreck the truck
and almost lose his life.  (I’ll tell about this experience later**) After
getting out of the hospital and getting his strength back, it left him without
any transportation, and therefore, no way to go back to his job.  Finally in
the summer of 1952, dad came to Utah looking for work and got a job with Hill
Air Force Base as a painter.  Later that summer the rest of the family moved to
Utah.  We brought Pete with us, but we couldn’t keep him in the city as he
would stop traffic everywhere as he was used to going where ever he pleased and
we couldn’t seem to keep him tied up.  While I was away at school, dad sold
Pete.  However, Pete found his way home again.  When the man came to get him,
dad had me put Pete in the truck.  That was one of the hardest things I have
ever had to do.  Once Pete was in the truck he never looked back and we never
saw him again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Maybe I could just give a couple of choice
memories that took place in Victor before going on into our move to Ogden. 
Once experience I shall always remember is when dad gave me a small wiener
pig.  It was probably one of the few trained pigs, but I had him trained so
that he would come when I called him.  He would eat out of my hand.  The only
problem was that he grew so big that he could not raise himself up after lying
down so every time he needed to go down to the creek to drink water, dad had to
raise him up with a pole.  Finally dad felt that he had to get rid of him
because of his size so one day when we were at school, dad went ahead and
butchered him.  He had to sell all of the meat because no one in the family
would eat it.  While my pig was growing up we used to ride him all over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another one of my choice experiences as a young
boy was my dog, Pete.  Pete was a cross between an English stag hound and a
greyhound.  When full grown he weighed between 95 and 100 pounds.  He stood
about three to three and one half feet tall, and could put his paws on the top
of a full grown man’s shoulders.  There in Victor we had hard winters which
lasted at least six to seven months with the snow always covering the fences. 
I trained Pete as a sled dog, and had made a regular dog sleigh for him to
pull.  Because of his breeding he was a fast running dog, and in racing him I
was always able to win all of the other fellows in town.  I can remember one
fall as we went up onto the hills to get our winters supply of firewood. (yes,
we used to have firewood that we chopped every night and had to carry in coal
for the stove.)  We took Pete with us in the back of the truck, but when we
filled it with logs it made him nervous to ride on it so he jumped off.  My
mother was driving so dad said to see how fast he could run.  We clocked him
for a little over thirteen miles at 55 miles an hour.  Within the next mile he
slowed down and stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I met Mae Porter when our family moved to Sunset
four or five years later.  I didn’t date her for a couple of years as my
friends were dating girls from Roy, so they introduced me to girls that I
dated.  After graduating from Davis High School I joined the Air Force.  While
in Basic Training, I had a heat stroke and ended up in the hospital with a
fever of 106 degrees.  They packed me in ice and then poured rubbing alcohol
over me.  When I was well enough, they sent me home with a medical discharge. 
I decided to go to college and thought I would go into airplane mechanics. 
They had a course at the college in Pocatello so I went to stay with my Uncle Irven
and Aunt Bernice and their son, Leslie.  I got a job at a service station, but
found that the course I had hoped to enroll in, wasn’t open that semester so I
came home.  Shortly after arriving home, my best friend, Hendrick Brandenburg,
wanted me to get a date and double with him to the Stake Sweetheart Ball. 
Since it was a last minute late, I had trouble getting someone.  I had called 7
girls and all were busy, so I was about to give up when Hendrick said “What
about asking Mae Porter?”  Mae said yes, but we went alone to the dance as
Hendrick’s girlfriend got sick and so they couldn’t go.  I dated Mae for eight
months when I asked her to marry me and gave her an engagement ring.  We were
engaged for eight months and were married after she graduated from high school
on the 19<sup>th</sup> of June 1959.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have always been restless regarding my life’s
occupation.  Many times I have startled Mae when I would come home from work
and say: “Lets move to Washington, I hear they need programmers up there, or
lets go look at farms.”  I always felt I should have been born 100 years ago. 
I used to think I was born in the wrong generation for I like hard work and
think I would forgo the luxuries and comforts of this day to the slow and
simple life of the farmer 100 years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have always had a strong testimony of the
gospel and been active in church work.  In fact, in one ward we moved into, we
had lived there for over four months and still hadn’t been asked to take a
position.  We were about to change wards as I couldn’t stand to be idle in the
church.  I have always held a position since I was 14 years old.    The next
week I was sustained as Aaronic Priesthood Secretary.  Some of the positions I
have held are:  Sunday School teacher, M.I.A. President, Elders Quorum President
and counselor, Aaronic Priesthood secretary;, 1<sup>st</sup> counselor in the
Bishopric twice, and executive secretary. </p>
