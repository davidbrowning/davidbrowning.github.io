<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Chopping fire wood, the
Huckle Berry Finn style.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                In Victor we
used fire wood and coal for the main heat in the house and for the cooking.  We
did have an oil burning stove in the front room but oil was more expensive so
the kitchen range was the primary heat source.  The cooking stove also had a
water jacket in it which heated the potable water.  As you can imagine, the
kitchen range had to be used almost every day of the year.  During the cold
months, which in Idaho are most of the time, Dad would be the first one up and
start a fire in the kitchen stove to warm the house.  Before we went to bed at
night someone, again it was usually Dad, would stoke the stove so the house
would remain warm as long as possible, but the fire still went out before it
was time to get up.  During the winter months it was not unusual for Dad to get
up during the night to rebuild the fire so the water in the house wouldn’t
freeze.  From the time I can really remember, it was Roy’s and my job to keep
firewood, kindling and coal supplied in the house.  I guess that Rich and Bob had
their turns but I really don’t remember Rich at home.  My first remembrance of
him was that he was in the army.  After Bob graduated from High School he
joined the Air force, so the job fell to Roy and I.   Each summer Dad would
take us boys in the pickup to the mountains and we would bring back several
loads of logs.  Dad would then have a man bring a power saw to the house and
cut the trees into logs about 12 to 14 inches long.  I remember that Roy and I
had the job of stacking the cut logs into a shed to keep the wood dry.  Half
the shed was for wood and the other half was for coal.  Most of the time, Roy
or I would chop the kindling on Saturdays so we would have enough kindling for
the coming week.  As Roy and I seldom got along with each other, Mom would have
Roy chop wood for one week and then the next week it would be my turn. 
Chopping a week’s worth of wood could take three to four hours, so we usually
did that on Saturday.  Besides that, every evening we had to carry out the
ashes and refill the coal bucket, plus carry in the next day’s supply of wood. 
If we hadn’t chopped enough wood on Saturday, then we had to chop what was
needed that evening.  During the winter, night come early so you had to get
started as soon as you got home from school.  I remember that with chores
during the week and chopping wood every other Saturday, it didn’t seem to leave
you with much play time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                There was a
single man named Ceiler Westover and his sister that lived just west of town. I
don’t know how old Ceiler was, but mentally he was considered to be a moron or
had the mental capacity of a young boy.  His sister was just crazy and I don’t
remember any of the youth in town, that wasn’t totally afraid to go to their
house because of her.  I remember going with Barbara and Roy selling paper
Poppies to raise money for the Veterans.  I don’t remember how it was organized
or who the money was turned into.  I just remember that Barbara, Roy and I were
out going from door to door selling Poppies.  Barbara had her bike and Roy had
our bike.  That meant that I had to ride on the back fender with one of them. 
When we came to Westover’s house, Roy and Barbara decided that it was my turn
to go to the house.  I didn’t want to but they had decided.  I remember that it
was a warm sunny day and as I started up to the front door, I saw other adults
in the front yard.  I continued towards the front porch but about half way
there, someone screamed.  I didn’t know who it was but I throw the poppies into
the air and ran.  As I reached the gate I saw Barbara and Roy riding the bikes
just as hard as they could go down the road.  They weren’t waiting for me so I
just ran as hard as I could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I remember
that Ceiler was a little taller than my father, but he was very strong.  Dad
often let Ceiler work for him doing odd jobs at the slaughter house.  I
remember Dad giving him some meat for his help, but other times I think Ceiler
came to the slaughter house just to have something to do.  He liked being with
people and especially boys.  Grandma seemed especially concerned to have him be
around us and at that age I didn’t quite understand why, because Ceiler was so
strong, he could chop my share of wood in ¼ the time it would take me.  I don’t
remember Ceiler helping Roy, but he often came over on my Saturday.  He would
invite me to go to the drug store for a pop or some candy.  I would tell him
that I couldn’t do anything until I got my wood chopped.  To this he always
asked if he could chop my wood for me.  I would tell him no, that it was my
job.  Then he would beg me to let him help.  After he begged long enough, I
would reluctantly give in, only if he would buy me a milk shake or a candy bar.
