<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Dad’s Job at H. A. F. B.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                In the fall
of 1951, Dad closed up his slaughter house because of lack of funds.  He went
up to Butt Montana where he found a job in a meat packing plant.  He would
leave home on Sunday afternoon and drive to Butt.  He would sleep in the back
of the pickup and work in the day time.  On Friday after work he would drive
home getting there quite late.  I have often wondered how he did it and how he
didn't freeze at night, with only the thin shell over the pickup bed to protect
him.  I guess there was a lot my Dad did to provide for his family that mostly
went unnoticed.  I remember of times that he would go to bed without dinner,
just saying that he didn’t feel hungry tonight.  I didn’t notice that there
wasn't enough for all of us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                While Dad was
doing this, Bob who had enlisted in the Air Force came home on leave.  He went
down to the slaughter house and got looking around and found two orange crates.
One was full and the other half full of bill books of people that owed Dad money
for meat he had sold them or for an animal that he had processed for them.  (An
orange crate, at that time, was a wooden crate built 12” X 12” X 24” with a
center divider so that it consisted of two sections each equaling 1 foot
square.) Dad had written the receipt, but he had never received payment on
them.  Mom told me that one evening Dad came home from a long day at work and
saw her writing at the table.  Dad asked he what she was writing and she said
that she was just sending letters to some of the people that owed him money
asking them if they could pay some on the account.  Dad became quite upset with
her and told her that she would not do that.  These people had told him that
they would pay and she was not to remind them of their promise.  Bob took the
bills to the Attorney in Drigg's and after looking through some of them, said
that if Bob would get a power of Attorney from Dad, we could collect about half
of them, the other half were already past the date of expiration (I believe
that is 7 years).  Bob was excited for Dad to come home.  When he announced to
Dad what he had found out, Dad just went out to his pickup, drove to the
slaughter house and burned the bill books.  When Bob asked why, Dad just said,
&quot;You will hurt people doing that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Early the
next spring (May 24, 1952) as Dad was driving home, on a Friday night, the
steering went out on the pickup and Dad rolled the pickup in the Hebdon Lake
area.  He later told of how he realized he was dead because he remembered
looking at the wreck and his body was still laying in the cab.  He said he
doesn't know how or when he went back to his body, but remembered as he started
to regain consciousness, that he realized it was hard to breathe. It impressed
him for he had never realized it took effort to breath.  He tried to get the
doors to open but both were jammed.  The truck was upside down.  He kicked the
rear window out and crawled out through the back.  He crawled a little ways to
the water where he washed some of the blood off his face.  He then crawled up
the embankment to the road where he flagged a couple down, who took him to the
Hospital in St. Anthone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                <i>In later
years after Dad was gone and I looked at a map of the area of Hebdon Lake, I
wondered why Dad would have been in that area.  This would have been out of his
way.  One day while visiting to Lois, Richard’s wife, I told her of my
questions about Dad being in the area of Hebdon Lake.  If you look at the map
as one came from Butt Montana to Victor Idaho, Hebdon Lake is off the route.  A
few days later Lois suggested that Dad must have gone to West Yellowstone for
some reason.  I then remembered that Dad told of returning to the sight of the
accident and seeing the pickup almost covered with water and eggs and egg
shells floating all around.  We then concluded that Dad had bought crates of
eggs in Montana and was taking them to the restaurants in West Yellowstone, for
resale, to make a little extra money.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After Dad
recovered and was home from the hospital for a few days, he started looking for
work.  He couldn't go back to Montana for now we were without a vehicle.  He
took the bus to Idaho Falls where he got a job with Dodge, Margaret's husband,
painting.  He said there were three of them assigned to paint the outside of a
four story building from scaffolding.  The scaffolding had no safety bars or
other safety equipment.  Dad said that after they had been painting for a few
minutes that he turned to Dodge and said that he didn't feel very safe up
there.  Just then the third man slipped and fell.  Dad said he and Dodge just
watched him fall hitting scaffolding as he went down.  When he hit the ground,
Dad said he and Dodge just looked at each other and climbed down.  Help was
already at the hurt man so they just left the job site and never came back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Dad heard
that there were job openings at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, so he took the bus
down to Ogden to look into it.  He said he went in to fill out an application
and as he began answering the questions, he came to the question asking for his
date of birth, he thought that if they knew he was 65 years old, they would not
consider him.  He, therefore, changed his date of birth to 1896 instead of
1886.  He got the job and went to work as a painter on the aircrafts.  He
worked there until he retired at age 74 on a medical.  Hill Field was offering
early retirements and Dad had a heart attack two years earlier, his supervisors
convinced him that he could get his full sick pay by taking a medical
retirement, plus some incentive for retiring then.  He would also get all of
his accumulated sick leave and all of his accumulated annual leave.  (<i>I
don’t think that Dad had used but a few days of sick leave, while recovering
from his hart attack and I don’t think he ever used any of his annual leave.</i>) 
Dad decided that because he had changed his age by ten years, when he applied
for the job that he should wait until he was 75 to put in for Social Security. 
When he did apply for the Social Security, he got a letter back stating that he
should have applied at age 65 and they gave him back payment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Dad would
often tell of his experiences at the base.  One of the experiences that Dad
told about at Hill Field was about mixing paint.  After he had been at Hill
Field a few years, he got the position over the paint shop.  One day a man came
to him and said, &quot;I know that you don't have the paint that we need, but I
have to ask you anyway.&quot;  Dad ask him what he needed and the man gave him
the paint specifications and again repeated that he know they were out of that
paint.  Dad told him to come back in a little while and he would see what he
could find.  Later the man returned and Dad gave him the paint.  The man was
surprised but took the paint and painted the parts he was to paint.  Later the
inspector came to Dad asking where he had got that paint.  Dad, ask him, what
paint?  The paint for those aircraft parts!  Dad asked if the paint was the
right color and was told it was.  Dad then asked if it was the right
specifications, and was again told it was.  Dad then asked, what was the matter
with it and was told nothing except they didn't have any of that paint on the
Base.  Dad just told him that he got it off of the shelve.  The inspector just
muttered and left.  Dad said he wasn't going to tell him that all you had to do
was to know your color wheel and you could mix any color you wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Dad met Dean
Rose at Hill Field and they became good friends the rest of Dad's life,
especially after Mom and Dad move to Sunset, for Dean lived just a couple of
miles away.  Dad told of first meeting Dean when he saw this man painting a
sign.  The first thing that caught Dad's attention was that Dean was crippled
through his arms and shoulders from polio.  The second think that struck Dad is
that Dean was painting the sign from the top.  This was being done free hand. 
Dad ask him how he did that?  Dean questioned as to what he meant?  Dad said,
&quot;Writing upside down and backward?&quot;  Dean just laughed and said
letter are just pictures and once you get the picture in your mind, the picture
is the same no matter which way you look at it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Dad's first
heart attack came on a Sunday evening when he was 71 years old.  I had been to
Sacrament meeting with a date, and when I came home from taking my date home,
Mom told me that Dad was in a lot of pain.  She was sure he was having a heart
attack, but he wouldn't let her do any thing for him.  I went into his bedroom
to an expression of pain like I have never before or since seen on a person's
face.  Sweat was running of his head as though he had a garden hose running
over him.  I ask Dad if I could call the doctor and was told &quot;no&quot;.  I
then asked if I could call the Bishop, and Dad told me not to call anyone but
to leave him alone.  The pain quit before mid-night and Dad went to sleep.  The
next morning the alarm went off at its usual 4:30 AM time.  Dad got up as
always, fixed his lunch and breakfast and went to work.  He would complain each
evening as he returned from work, of the pain in his chest, but would not hear
of going to the Doctor.  Mom had called the Doctor and told him the symptoms. 
The Doctor told her that he couldn't do anything unless Dad came in for an
examination.  He also told her that he should go to the hospital, which Mom
explained that there was no way she could get him to consent to going to the
hospital.  The Doctor then told her that if she could get him into his office,
he could get him to the hospital.  When Dad came home Thursday, still
complaining about the pain, Mom again suggested that they see the Doctor.  Dad
consented and they went in to the office.  The Doctor just listened to his
heart and said he needed an ex-ray and his machine at the office wasn't large
enough.  He would need to go up to the Hospital where they had a larger
machine.  When they got to the hospital, the Doctor said he needed Dad to sign
a paper so they could take the ex-ray; however, the paper was actually an
admittance form.  When the Doctor saw the ex-ray, he said that Dad should have
died at the first sign of pain.  The heart had torn away from the lining and
scare tissue was already forming.  He put Dad to bed in the hospital with
orders that he was not to get out of bed for any reason.  I went in to visit
Dad the next Thursday evening, stopping and putting gas in my car.  When I got
to the hospital and went to Dad’s room, Dad asked if I could go get him a
hamburger, for he was hungry.  I asked him if they hadn't brought him his
dinner.  He said, &quot;Oh yes, but see the man in the next bed?”  Well, when
they brought Dad his dinner, the man said, “that sure looks good.’  Dad asked
him where his dinner was and the man said they hadn't given him any thing
except jello and water for two days.  Dad just passed his dinner to the man and
the man ate the whole dinner.  As I looked at the man he was sound a sleep or I
wondered if he might be dead.  I told Dad that I had just put my last dollar
into gas in order to come into town.  He said he had some money, so he called
for the nurse.  He asked her where his pants were, to which she told him he
wasn't getting his pants, she couldn't keep him in bed without his pants and
she wasn't letting him have his pants.  She said that if he gave her
permission, she would get the money from his pants for him. He told her to, so
she got the money out of his wallet for him.  I went over to the Drug store
across the street and got him something to eat.  When I got back Dad told me
that the nurse kept filling up his water glass and then would check the urinal
bottle.  He said she kept him so full of water that every time she would leave
the room, he had to get up and run to the restroom.  The Doctor had given
orders that Dad was not to get out of bed for any reason.  On Saturday the
Doctor released Dad to go home, telling him that he would not obey the nurse’s
orders, to stay in bed, so he had just as well be at home. Dad went back to
work at Hill Field just a few days after getting home.</span></p>
