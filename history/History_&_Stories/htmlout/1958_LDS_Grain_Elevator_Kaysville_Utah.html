<p class=MsoNormal>1959 LDS Grain Elevator Kaysville Utah</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The LDS Church had established a
grain elevator in Kaysville as part of the Church Welfare program.  At that
time there was the main office area, and a covered dumping pit, which was
graded so that a dump truck could drive over it and dump the grain.  The grain
could then be carried by the elevators to the storage bins.   There was also an
area for the elevator controls so that the grain could either be taken to
storage or retrieved.  The grain storage bins, were  located to the east. 
However there was a vacant space a little larger in area than the storage bin. 
 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I will try to give a visual
description of the building layout from a bird’s eye view.  Each cylinder is
circular with two cylinders connecting side to side then continuing for three
sets</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>  It had been determined (or it may
had been planned for) that there was room for another set of six bins.  From
the understanding that I got, was that the Church Headquarters had contacted a
construction company to erect the bins.  They were told that local Stakes would
supply the manual labor using volunteers from the Clearfield, Layton and
Kaysville’s Stakes.  The construction company said that that would be
impossibly as that type of construction required trained engineers and
professional labors that had been trained in that field of construction.  They
explained that special forms had to be constructed.  These forms were floating
forms that would be raised by hydraulic jacks as the concrete was poured into
them.  Although the construction company objected, Church authorities felt that
volunteers from the Clearfield and Kaysville Stakes could do the main manual
labor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Bob Acker, a young man that had
came from Canada, with Roy when Roy returned from his mission, and I
volunteered to work a day shift at the mill.  Bob was also staying with us
while he was here visiting.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The forms were about 10 to 12 feet
high.  The Rebar steel had to be continually tied as the forms moved up.  Also
as the rebar were placed, vertical rods that hydraulic jacks moved up, lifting
the forms, was placed every few feet.   There was a control office in center of
the forms where all the hydraulic jacks were regulated.  In that control room a
professional operator had to continually monitor the movement of the forms.  As
the forms moved up cement was continually poured into the top of the forms.  The
forms lifted slow enough that the cement was set enough to hold by the time the
forms had lifted and the fresh concrete was exposed.  The concrete now had to
be smoothed by hand floats.  Those assigned to work the outside of the had a
pretty easy job as they set on a bench attached to the moving form and just had
a area in front of them to smooth, however those selected to work the inside
had very little air ventilation.  The humidity and heat also made it quite
uncomfortable.  Those inside were to be rotated every hour.</p>
