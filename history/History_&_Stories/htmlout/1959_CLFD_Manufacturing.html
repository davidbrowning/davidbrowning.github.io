.5in'>Mae and I were married on June 19, 1959 in the Salt Lake Temple.  I had
just started to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>work for the
IRS, located on the Army Depot, 12<sup>th</sup> St. Ogden, Utah that spring, as
a data processing operator.  On the 15<sup>th</sup> of June I was required to
take a two week training class in IBM Board Wiring.  I visited with my
supervisor about my scheduled Wedding and he was able to arrange for me to have
the 19<sup>th</sup> off but I would have to be back in class on the 22<sup>nd</sup>. 
I could then have the following week off for Mae and I to take a Honeymoon
trip.  As I had completed a class at Weber State Collage that spring I was
already ahead of most of my co-workers so it didn’t create any problem to miss
one day of the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                A
story I will add here in connection with the Board Wiring class I took. 
Because of the class I had taken at Weber Collage I was already familiar with
the wiring and operations of seven I.B.M. Data Processing machines.  In fact I
believe that it was because of that training is what gave me the edge on many
others that applied for the same job with the I.R.S.  Anyway it was still a
requirement that every new employee had to take the Board Wiring class.  About
the first day of the class the instructor showed us how to wire the Collator so
that it would merge a white set of blank IBM cards with a blue set of blank IBM
cards so that the merged deck alternated colors.  He then started onto another
subject.  I stopped him and asked him if he could wire the collator so that it
would again separate the two colors.  He said that unless one of the decks of
cards has a distinguishing punch in it, it could not be done.  Inasmuch as I
had played around with wiring the collator and had found a way to do that very
thing, I challenged him.  Even though I tried to do it in a respectful way it
offended him.  He repudiated me by saying that I could not do it.  I asked him
if I could draw out on the blackboard my idea and he had me come up to the
front and draw it out.  When I was able to draw out the wiring scamatic it
visibly upset him but he admitted that I was right.</p>

.5in'>In the summer of 1961, Mae and I decided that we would like to get our
own home.  We had been living in Mae’s parent’s duplex apartment.  The problem
was that we didn’t have a down payment.  We discussed this with Mae’s Uncle
Dale Porter, who owned Clearfield Manufacturing Co. in Clearfield.  I agreed to
work part time for a loan of $1,000 that he would pay me in advance when we
found a home we could afford.  I started working for him part time at minimum
wage, at that time it was $1.10 per hour.  I worked most Saturdays and most
evenings.  Then I was changed to the evening shift at I.R.S. so I would work
about 6 hour a day for Uncle Dale.  We started looking at homes in any spare time
we had.  Mae also became pregnant with our first child, so that increased our
desire to find a home.  Uncle Dale was developing a motor scooter that would be
used in the mountains mainly for deer hunting.  Being able to work Days for Uncle
Dale worked out very well and Dale assigned me to work on that development. 
After some time working with the scooters, Dale hired another man, Mr. Dean
Sessions to work with me.  Dale asked me to train him on what we were doing.  Dean
seemed very cocky as though he was my boss and that didn’t set very well with
me.  After a few weeks, without any prior notice to me, I was informed by Dean that
he was the boss for he had bought scooter manufacturing from Uncle Dale.  He
also rented a shop from Dale on Main Street and we moved the operation to that
shop.  I asked Uncle Dale how this was going to work out with me working for Dean. 
He said that I would just sign my check over to him.  By this time we had found
and bought a small home at 324 13<sup>th</sup> Street in Ogden.  This meant
that I would drive out to Clearfield in the morning and then back to Ogden in
the afternoon, getting there in time to go to work at I.R.S. in the evening.  I
didn’t like working for Dean so one day I went looking for another part time
job.  I went to Stop &amp; Shop grocery store on 12<sup>th</sup> St. and
Washington Blvd. in Ogden, just two blocks from our home.  When I entered the
store I saw two men working on a display so I approached them and asked where I
could find the manager.  They replied that they were the manager and the
assistant manager and asked if they could help me.  I told them that I worked
evenings at I.R.S. and was looking for part-time day work.  The manager said
that they could use more help.   He then added that it would require working
Sundays, to which I thanked him for his time and excused myself.  As I started
walking away he called after me and asked why I wasn’t interested in the job. 
I told him that I wouldn’t work Sundays.  He said that that was the only
position they had open, so I again thanked him and started for the door.  I was
just about to the door when he called after me and said that he could use me
from 8AM to 2PM Monday thru Friday.  I told him that I would have to give my
present employer notification and he said that would be fine and I left.  The
next day I informed Dean that I had found another job much closer to home that
would work out better for me.  I never thought about talking to Uncle Dale
about the matter as I wasn’t working for him any longer and he hadn’t discussed
with me my trade to Dean Sessions.  I just didn’t think it mattered; however,
the next time the Porter family got together Uncle Dale expressed his
disappointment in me for not asking his permission to quit working for Mr.
Sessions.  I apologized but never felt very comfortable being with Uncle Dale
after that. </p>

.5in'>On November 20<sup>th</sup> of that same year Mae went into Labor.  I
debated whether or not I should go to work at the store but Mae said she was ok
and she would call me if the pains increased, so I went to the store.  I had
never noticed that you could hear the phone ring in the office; from down in
the store, but that day I heard the phone every time it rang.  When I finally
went home Mae was still only having pains occasionally.  I, therefore, went to
work at I.R.S.  Again every time the phone would ring in the office I would
hear it.  I would call Mae every hour and unknowingly to me Mom Porter would
call Mae every hour, so every half hour she was up answering the phone. 
Finally, by lunch time, Mae asked me to quit calling her because all she was
doing was answering the phone.  I couldn’t stand it any longer so I asked for
the rest of the night off and went home.  Before mid-night I took Mae to the
hospital and they put her in a prep room.  There was a girl in the next bed
with only a curtain between them, who was having a miscarriage and she was
screaming to the top of her lungs.  Mae just gave up and decided that it wasn’t
for her and her pains went away.  The Doctor at the hospital finally gave Mae a
shot and told us to go home and get some sleep.  The shot would ether settle
the pains down or if they were real, increase them.  We went home and I went to
sleep.  A couple of hours later Mae woke me and we went back to the hospital. 
This time it had snowed and I was actually pushing snow with the front bumper
of the car.  I just kept praying that the Oldsmobile would keep going up the 21<sup>st</sup>
St. hill and it did.  When we got to the hospital, I took Mae in and then
parked the car.   As I entered the hospital the nurse told me to admit her. 
They had called Dr. Byron Naisbit and told him that he had better hurry for the
baby was on its way.  Within a half hour I was told over the speaker in the
Father’s waiting room that I was the father of a baby girl.</p>

.5in'>By the following spring IRS changed, from using Electronic Accounting
Machines to process the income taxes, to using an I.B.M. 1401 computer.  This
necessitated reducing the number of operators from at peak operations from over
500 operators to less than 30.  All temporary employees were let go and they
absorbed many into other departments along with finding others job
opportunities with other companies.  I was offered a position in another
department.  I guess I will never know if it was a mistake or not but I turned
the offer down and transferred to Hill Air force base.  It didn’t take me long
to realize that I didn’t like working at the Base.  The problem I had with Hill
Air Force Base was that they didn’t have enough work to keep us busy and we
were often told that there wasn’t anything for us to do – but look busy.  This
really went against my grain and teachings of how one should work and produce
for their employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in'> I continued working part time for Stop &amp; Shop.  One day, Grant
Roberts, a fellow employee at IRS came into the store.  He told me that he was
working for Commercial Security Bank as an E.A.M. operator.  He said that they
were looking for another operator and they would be interested in visiting with
me.  I went in and interviewed with John Howard, the Data Processing Manager,
but he told me that I would have to give up my part time work.  After
considering the position I turned it down because we still were making payments
to Uncle Dale and I didn’t see how we could make those payments without the
part time job.  A couple of weeks later Grant came back into the store and told
me about an option that I may not have been aware of.  It was that with only
three years service with the government, that if I quit I could elect to
receive all my retirement investment back into a lump sum payment.  I checked
into this and he was right.  This would be more than enough to repay Uncle
Dale, so I reconsidered and accepted the offer with the bank.  It was really a
good feeling when we were able to paid Uncle Dale off.</p>
