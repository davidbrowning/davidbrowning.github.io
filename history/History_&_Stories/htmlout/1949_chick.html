<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Dad had built
a chicken coop at the slaughter house that was large enough to contain about
300 chickens.  He also had two heavy wire carrying cages for transporting
chickens.  The cages were divided in two sections, each section of a cage would
hold about 25 chickens.  The cages had cost him quite a bit.   I believe that
there had been times that Dad had felt that someone had chick-a-reed him by
steeling a few chickens at night.  This didn’t seem to really upset him to
much.  However one night someone or a group went in to the coop and filled both
cages with chickens, so they had stole about 200 chickens.  When Dad realized
what had happened, he was sick at losing the chickens, but even more upset at
losing the cages.  He went to the sheriff about it, but nothing was ever found
out.  A few days later he was in the store and he heard two ladies on the other
side of the isle talking about a chick-a-ere they had had and was planning on
another one.  Dad's ears perked up but he could not recognize the voice, but
thought they were talking about doing it again that night.  Dad tried to slip
around the end of the isle to see who it was but they were gone and he didn’t
see who they were.  That night Dad drove down by the slaughter house every hour
with his pickup lights off and a loaded rifle.  It was just a good thing no one
tried anything that night, because I don’t think Dad would have hesitated to
shot someone.</span></p>
