<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I just want to put into words, if I can my
testimony of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and how I gained that testimony
of The Church of Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I do not remember when I began to believe in
Jesus Christ as the Creator and Savior of the World, to believe that Joseph
Smith was a prophet and that the Church of Jesus Christ is the true and only
true church on earth.  I always enjoyed hearing the stories of Jesus although I
do not remember being told them at home.  As I look back on my early home life
I realize that my mother and father did not attend church very often.  I know
that both of them drank coffee and Dad occasionally drank a beer.  I do not
remember attending Jr. Sunday School or even if it was held in the small church
house in Victor.  I remember attending Primary prior to turning 8 years of age,
as that is where I realized that I hadn’t been baptized at the time I turned
8.  I remember my primary teacher talking to us about being baptized and I
seemed to be the only one in the class that had not been baptized soon after
their 8<sup>th</sup> Birthday.  I asked my mother about it and she said they
had just forgotten to have it done.  That summer arrangements were made, I
think by my Primary Teacher, for she took me to Driggs. That is where the Stake
House was located, and I was baptized, I did not know the man that baptized me.
In fact the only person that I know there was my Primary Teacher.  The
following day Uncle Albert confirmed me a member of the Church during Fast
meeting.  There wasn’t any of my family that attended the meeting.  Primary was
something that almost every one of age in our community attended.  It never
occurred to me that some of the youth that attended was not members of the LDS
Church.  Everyone just went, as school was released early on Tuesdays so we
could attend Primary.  Those that didn’t go had to stay at the school house doing
home work or whatever until the buses were ready to take the students home.  I
don’t recall much of those classes.  One teacher taught us how to cut wood with
a hand saw.  She told us that we should always measure the board iven if we
were cutting several boards the same length.  She said that if we used the
board to measure the next board the boards would keep getting shorter.  I
remember disagreeing with her because I figured they would if anything the
boards would get longer.  In reality it depends on how accurate you cut on the
line.   Another teacher taught us how to make hand cream so that we could give it
to our Mothers for Mothers Day.  Mom and Grandma really liked the cream and
wanted to get the recipe.  The last year before I turn 12 years old, was my
hardest.  We were told that we had to memorize the 12 Articles of Faith before
we could graduate from Primary.  We would have an interview with the Bishop
before we could graduate.  I remember fearing that interview as we were told
that the Bishop would ask us to recite at least one of the Articles of Faith. 
I struggled to memorize them but did not feel very confident of being able to
remember them if I was called on.  I don’t remember how I made it through the
interview but I remember that the Bishop held the interview in his car, as
there was no Bishops office in the church.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At 12 years old I was ordained to the Aaronic
Priesthood to the office of Deacon.  Again, Uncle Albert was the one to ordain
me and again I don’t remember any of my family being there.  I was proud to be
able to pass the Sacrament in church.  I also remember my first time at being
assigned to collect Fast Offerings.  My cousin Nate and I were given routs that
were South West of town.  We took our bikes and road out across the railroad
tracks and through unpaved roads.  We were out of town so far that the one
house we went to still did not have electricity.  We were most of the afternoon
before we returned to turn our Fast Offering packs back to the Ward Clerk.  Later
we were called back to the church and were asked if we had taken the money out
of an envelope.  I remember of being very frightened and telling them that we
hadn’t.  The clerk then examined the envelopes and saw that the envelope that
was in question had a corner torn through.  The coins must have slid through
the tear as we bumped along the roads.  From them on we were careful to have a
small cardboard box in our bicycle basket so coins couldn’t slip out again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Some of my memories make me think that I may
have been somewhat of a challenge to some of my teachers.  I liked the lessons
and stories but I also played around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember that I had a great love for attending
missionary’s reports and farewells.  If I know that a missionary was reporting
I would attend meeting even if I went by myself.  I always had a desire to be a
missionary.  I never remember not wanting to go on a mission.  Any time I would
write my goals down it would be go on a mission, get married in the Temple.</p>

style='font-size:18.0pt'>A </span><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Testimony
of Brother Hamblin</span></b>    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember of an experience that happened while
I was a young boy still living in Victor.  I may have been 11 or 12 years old,
but this incident left a lasting impression on me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            A member of our Ward bore his testimony in the
regular Fast and Testimony meeting.  His name was Brother Hamblin.  Brother
Hamblin was a farmer who lived on the west side of the valley just as the road
that went over Piney Pass started up the hill.  I never remembered him as any
one that was particularly outstanding in the ward.  He was a quiet man and
stayed in the back ground.  I remember him as our Ward Clerk.  On this
particular Fast Sunday he stood and bore a testimony that I have never forgot. 
He told how he had raised peas for California Packing Corporation.  This was
not unusual for at this time Cal. Pack would come into the valley in the Spring
and contract with the farmers to raise peas or carrots for them.  California
Pack would provide the seed and also the fertilizer.  The farmer would plant,
cultivate and irrigate the crop during the short spring and summer months and
then at harvest time Cal. Pack would bring in Mexican farm workers to harvest
the crop.  Just prior to harvest time a supervisor would come around to each of
the farmers; which had entered into this arrangement; and schedule the day that
the pickers would come to harvest the crop.  When the supervisor came to Brother
Hamblin’s farm and gave a harvest date Brother Hamblin said that he couldn’t
have them do it on the date scheduled.  The supervisor asked why not.  Brother
Hamblin explained that that date was Sunday and he didn’t work on his farm on
the Sabbath day.  To this the supervisor said, “When we start harvesting, we
work every day and that is the time we will be at your farm.”  Brother Hamblin
remained firm and said that that would not be acceptable to him.  The
superintendent then told Brother Hamblin, that if they did not harvest his crop
on the scheduled date then they would put his field to the end of the season. 
He reminded Brother Hamblin that frost comes early in the Teton Valley and any
crops not yet harvested would be lost to the frost.  Also, the last of the peas
to be harvested are past their prime and go for a lesser price.  Still Brother
Hamblin remained firm in his decision of not working on the Sabbath.  Time
passed and Brother Hamblin knew that the loss of this year’s crop of peas would
be very devastating to his family’s income for the year.  Finally, at the end
of the season, the pickers returned to Brother Hamblin’s farm.  He bore
testimony that the Lord had watched over his crop.  Not only had the crop been
free from frost but when the peas were taken into the packing house his peas
were of the highest quality grade and also were the greatest yield per acre of
any farm in the valley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was thirteen or fourteen we lived in the
Ogden 13<sup>th</sup> Ward.  The home that we lived in was on Monroe Ave. and
just south of 23<sup>rd</sup> St.   Our family did not own a car at that time
so we walked (or sometimes took the city bus) where ever we went.  It was
normal for us to walk down town Ogden as well as to school and church.  One
summer Sunday morning Mom told me that she and I were going to attend Stake
Conference.  At that time Stake Conferences were held in the Old Ogden
Tabernacle located on the North West corner of Washington Boulevard and 23<sup>rd</sup>
Street.  That meant that we just had four blocks to walk, it was a hot summer
day, but we went anyway.  I was ok with the morning session although none of my
friends were there.  The old Tabernacle was built shortly after the town of
Ogden had been settled.  It was domed, some what like the Salt Lake Tabernacle
but the ends were not domed and it looked much like the potato cellars in
Idaho.  The main doors were on the East end of the building and there were very
few windows in the building.  The benches were hard wood and it seemed to me
that we were quite crowded.  There was a balcony but the heat was worse up
there.  Also, at that time it was normal for Stake Conference to have a two
hour morning session and a two hour afternoon session.  I endured the morning
session and was sure that I would be able to enjoy staying home in the
afternoon and relaxing with friends.  We came home and enjoyed dinner and I was
going to change clothes to go outside.  Mom stopped me and said that she
thought I should attend the afternoon session.  I asked her if she or anyone
else was going, sure that would give me a way out.  “No, no one else is going
but I think you should”, was her reply.  I didn’t think that was fair and I
didn’t want to go by myself.  The more I resisted the more my mother insisted
that I go.  Reluctantly, I left the house.  I remember thinking, on the way
down 23<sup>rd</sup> street that I could just find something else to do for a
couple of hours and then return home.  as I walked passed the park on 23<sup>rd</sup>
and Madison the temptation was great.  However, I knew that that would be wrong
and I didn’t want to be disobedient to my mother.  I attended the Conference,
it was very hot and uncomfortable, but as the General Authority got up to
address the Conference, the Spirit touched me and I knew that this was a man
called of God as an Apostle of The Lord.  I don’t remember his name and I don’t
remember what he talked about, but I have always remembered the Spirit and
Testimony that I felt in that meeting.  I remember still, the walk back up 23<sup>rd</sup>
Street &amp; going home with the most greatful feeling that I had attended that
meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we moved to Sunset I was a Priest in the
Aaronic Priesthood.  That summer our Priest Advisor took our quorum to the mountains
by Vernal Utah. We had gone by vehicle up the mountain, parked and hiked almost
10 miles.  The trail left the parking lot, went south for a short ways and then
turned east.  It continued east not far from the edge of a canyon to the south
of the trail for almost the complete ten miles to where we camped and fished.
That trip was not very successful and very few caught fish.  We were also
infested with mosquito’s until you had difficulty standing still.  We had some
of the Fathers also come on the trip.  No one had remembered to bring any
mosquito repellent.  About the second day one of the boys, that I had begun to
make friends with, talked to me when we were alone.  He asked me if I would
like to have some mosquito repellant. I asked him if he had some.  He said that
both he and his father had each brought a bottle but they didn’t want anyone
else to know about it or it would get used up.  I told him that if everyone
else had to suffer, then so would I.  Our friendship didn’t go much further
after that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             The following year our Advisor and his wife took
the Priest to the same area.  However this time instead of going all the way
back in, we only hiked about half way and then turned to the right and dropped
down the canyon to the river below.  It was a very successful fishing trip this
year, but the event that made a great impression on me was, when we left to
return home.  As we left camp we had to climb up the canyon walls.  I guess I
started up first but before long I realized that there was no one coming up
behind me.  I waited for a while but still no one came nor could I hear any
talking or shouting as I thought I would be able to.  I went back down part way
and still found no one.  I wasn’t worried as I figured that I could continue to
climb and when I got out of the canyon I would find the trail.  I knew that
when I reached the trail I would  turn west and follow the trail back to the
trucks.  I knew my directions and was sure that I was traveling north.  After
reaching the ridge I went some distance futher north but did not find the
trail.  I begin to wonder if somehow I had crossed the trail with out
recognizing it.  I turned around and went back to the ridge of the canyon but
did not find where I had missed the trail.  I decided that I just hadn’t gone
far enough North to find the trail as I knew that the trail went in an East and
West direction as did the canyon.  Still I could not find the trail.  I
backtracked to the canyon rim again and this time went in a North West
direction.  By this time I knew that I was in trouble so I took time to kneel
and ask for help.  As I continued searching for the trail I seemed to be getting
in rougher terrain but continued to zig zag back and forth from north to south
at the same time going in a westward direction.  Several times I stopped to
pray.  I knew where the river was and I had been taught that if you were lost
to follow the river down stream.  After some time, I got to a point that I
could look down the river and in the distance could see a town.  I don’t
remember of ever feeling fearful but several times I knelt and asked Heavenly
Father which direction I should go.  Having not felt an answer to my prayer, I
had come to the decision that I would go to the river and follow it to the town
in the distance.  I knelt and asked the Lord for confirmation to my decision. 
When I arose from my knees I felt no different, so I concluded that I should
turn south and start to walk in the direction of the river.  Just then I felt a
voice telling me to stop and walk north.  Though I had walked that direction before,
I followed the feeling, and within a few feet of the spot where I had knelt, I
came to the trail.  At that point the trail made a 90 degree turn north and led
to where the trucks were parked.  If I had gone any further west I would have
never found the trail.  Within a few minutes of finding the trail I was at the
trucks where everyone else had returned and was getting quite worried as to
what had happened to me.  That experience has always remained with me as a time
when I recognized the answer to prayer.  </p>

style='font-size:16.0pt'>Seminary Challenge to Gain My Own Testimony</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>Brother Butcher</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I started my junior year of High School at Davis
High School in Kaysville Utah.  I had a bad experience with LDS Seminary at
Ogden High School my sophomore year and debated whether or not to take Seminary
again my junior year, but it was an easy class and so again signed up.  Our
teacher was an older Brother and very mild tempered and so the class rather
took advantage of him.  I am sure that I was also one of those that gave him
problems.  When school returned from the Christmas break we were informed that
this Brother had resigned.  He had left because of the student’s lack of
respect.  However he did donate a beautiful large painting of Christ to be hung
in our class room.  I have always felt a feeling of remorse to think that I was
one of those that caused this to happen.  Brother Butcher, a young man was to
be our new teacher for the rest of the year.  I really liked him but still I
guess I was one of his problem students.  One day as we had been studding the
Book of Mormon, he challenged us to gain our own testimony of that book.  He
had us read the Moroni 9 verses 4 and 5, and then asked us if we had received
that knowledge of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.  He told us that we
had the right to receive our own testimony, just as much as anyone else.  His
challenge seems to enter into my hart and I wanted that Testimony of my own.  I
read the Book of Mormon for my first time, because of yet I had never read but
parts of the book.  When I completed reading it, skipping some 2 Nephi, I knelt
and ask it the Book of Mormon was truly the word of God.  I received no witness
or any particular feeling at all.  After giving this experience some thought I
decided that maybe I might try again, giving more prayer and thought as to what
I was reading. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:16.0pt'>Archaeological Evidence of the Book of Mormon</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            A little over a year after Mae and I were first
married we bought a home in Ogden on 13<sup>th</sup> Street.  We lived in the
Mound Fort Ward in the Farr West Stake.  While living in that Ward I served as
the General Secretary of the Aaronic Priesthood, then as Elders Quorum President
and then in 1966 I was called to be First Counselor in the Bishopric with
Bishop Delmar Moulton.  Larry Braithwaite was called as the Second Counselor. 
I remember attending a Stake High Priest meeting in which an Archeologist was
the guest speaker.  His subject was “Archaeological Evidence of the Book of
Mormon”.  He had brought with him several pictures and items that he had found
in his archaeological findings in South America.  I remember him showing us a
picture of a rock used in one of the Temples he had found.  The rock was
several feet square and weighed an unbelievable amount.  It contained marking
in the rock that matched up with a rock query on the opposite side of the
valley.  You could easily see where the marking matched up.  I remember him
telling that due to the weight of the rock that we did not have any machinery
that could move the queried rock across that valley today.  He showed pictures
of an area that they believe was a Baptismal Font.  He had several displays of
pottery and wheat grinding rocks.  The one that most interested me was a knife
blade.  The handle was decade but the blade was in perfect condition and had
the appearance of copper.  It was as clean as I new copper penny.  At the
conclusion of his talk he showed us a new file that he had just purchased from
a Hardware store.  He said that he had tried to sharpen or mark the blade with
the file.  He offered us the opportunity to be able to come up after the
meeting ended and examine his artifacts.  He said that we could use the file
that he had just purchased or we could get any other file and try to mark the
copper blade.  I took him up on the challenge and had someone hold the blade
over the edge of a table and I took the file, turned it to the files corner and
with all the pressure I could apply drew the corner of the file across the
blade.  I then examined the blade and I had not even made a polish mark on the
blade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:16.0pt'>Tanner Construction Company</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>When we left the farm in Erda, we moved
back down to Mesa and I went to work for Larry.  He had me purchase more
equipment to do finish work and with the use of his license I did
sub-contracting work for several general contractors.  This did well for a while
but then building took a slump down there.  I talked to Ron Shumway, who was my
manager when we first moved to Arizona and worked for Hughes Air West Airline. 
Ron left Air West the same time I did and we both went to work for Hughes “Air
Research”.  After I had left Hugh’s Air Research, Ron went to work for Tanner
Construction Company as the Programming Manager.  When I told him that work was
in a slump he told me to bring him a resume.  A short time later he called me
and said that he had a job for me.  I was so excited, as the construction work
wasn’t meeting our needs.  After talking to him and telling him that I would
let him know for sure in the morning, I went to my room and knelt in prayer.  I
got a definite answer that I shouldn’t take the job.  I begged the Lord for
another answer but finally arose and called Ron back.  I told him thanks but I
couldn’t accept the job offer with Tanner’s.  Ron exclaimed. “What? Do you know
that I laid my job on the line to hire you.”  He explained that when the personal
manager saw my resume he said “No way”.  When Ron insisted that he wanted to
hire me, the personal manager said that he wanted it on the record that he was
against hiring me and that it was completely Ron’s decision.  I told Ron that I
was sorry but I just couldn’t take the offer.  When I hung up I went back to my
knees in tears wondering what I had just done.  I didn’t sleep very well that
night but at 5AM the next morning the phone rang.  It was Vern Pankratz calling
and he asked me if I would be interested in managing the Grantsville Stake
Farm.  If I had accepted that job from Tanner, I wouldn’t have been able to
accept this job of managing the Grantsville Stake Farm.  Our family had wanted
to return to Utah and be closer to family since it didn’t work out in
construction down here.  I was thankful I had listened to the Lord and heeded. 
If I had accepted the job with Tanner, I found out later that it wouldn’t have
lasted long.  Ron was let go as it was a family business and other members of
that family were coming on board and they didn’t need Ron.  He ended up going
to work for Larry and going into the construction business with him.</p>
