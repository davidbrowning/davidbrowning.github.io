style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            To give you a little
background to this story I will proceed with the following.  This incident took
place approximately in the summer of my 10<sup>th</sup> year of age.  My
parents had rented a two unit home on the main street of Victor Idaho.  The
house floor plan was a rectangle shape building laying east to west.    The
outside dimentions were probably 22 feet wide and 40 feet long with the back 12
feet of the south wall expanded south another 8 feet. The east or front unit
was the part that my parents rented.  The inside floor plan of that east unit,
not including wall dimensions, was divided east and west down the middle, the
area was then divided south to north from the east end extending west approximately
about 12 feet, the next division left the rooms about 8 feet wide with the last
area about 10 wide.  The center wall in the east rooms were arched with the
entire wall taken out except for two feet on each end and two feet from the
ceiling.  The ceilings of that unit were ten feet high.  The two east rooms
made a large front room and when guests came for thanksgiving dinner and such,
it was transformed to a large dining room. The center south room was the
kitchen and dining room, the center north room was the bathroom, leaving the
two west rooms as bedrooms.  The home was heated with an oil stove in the front
room and a wood / coal burning stove in the kitchen.  A 2’ x 2’ flue was
centered on the wall, up from the floor about 6’ and extended up through the
roof.  The stove pipes from each stove entered into the flue, one on the west
side and the other on the east side.  If you would take the time to draw these
dimensions out you would quickly understand how small this home really was.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            This incident took
place on a summer day that Mom had gone to Teton where she and Aunt Wilma went
shopping and spent most of the day.  Dad was at work so that left Irven and I
alone.  Sometime after Mom had left, I guess that we were looking for something
in a drawer, when I found a shot gun shell.  We proceeded to carefully open the
folded end of the shell.  First we found the shot and emptied those out.  Second
we used a long screw and pulled out the plug pads which exposed the gun powder
which we dumped out into a container.  As I remember we took small portions of
the powder outside and carefully spread it out and lit the powder with a match
watching with excitement as is quickly ignited and burned out.  It didn’t take
long until we had ignited all the powder and was left with the buck shot, which
we just threw away, the pads and a hollow shell.  Thinking that I should get
rid of those evidences I opened the kitchen stove and throw them in.  I didn’t
think there was much left that wouldn’t burn but when the firing ignited the
cap it made quit an explosion.  The top of the stove was all made of removable
iron parts assembled similar to a jig saw puzzle.  The explosion had the force
to lift the entire top of the stove several inches up and also blow the front
doors of the stove open.  As the top of the stove settled it was all in
disarray.  </span></p>
