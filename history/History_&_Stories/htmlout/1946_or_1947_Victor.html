<p class=MsoNormal>1946 or 1947</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Dad built a Slaughter House just outside the
North West City Limits of Victor, for the purpose of killing his own animals to
supply meat for the Butcher shop.  He also built a large chicken coop North of
the Slaughter House.  There he kept approximately 300 laying hens.  Mr
Burnsides set up Dog Kennels, to house his Sled Dogs, just across the road from
Dad’s slaughter house.  The dogs often got loose and almost each time would go
for Dad’s chickens, one time killing almost 200.  I  remember cleaning all
those chickens and saving what we could.  Dad then took the chicken up to Mr
Burnsides and told him he had just purchased them.  Mr Burnsides had to buy a
freezer to keep them in.  It was just a few days later that Dad and I went to
the Slaughter House, and as we got out of the pickup, we could hear chickens
squawking.  Dad jumped the fence and ran for the coop door.  Just as he
arrived, a dog came out the chicken run.  Dad caught the dog by the collar, lifting
it into the air, swung it around his head two or three times before bring it to
the ground with all his might.  The dog was killed instantly by the force.   I
had just arrived at the fence to see the whole thing take place.  I was
impressed with the strength Dad had.  Mr Burnsides had to buy a few more
chickens.  He also tried to keep his kennels in better repair after that.</p>
