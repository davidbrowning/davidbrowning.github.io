<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After the
slaughter house was built, dad took me with him to paint the outside.  I was
probably 8 to 10 years old at the time.  Shortly before this time, mother had
me help her do some painting at home.  She had taught me that you always paint
in the same direction so that the paint would blend together into an even
coat.  The slaughter house was built of cinder blocks and concrete mortar, both
of which were very porous.  Dad gave me a paint brush and a can of paint and I
started painting.  Remembering the teachings of my mother, I started painting
moving the paint brush back and forth in the same direction.  Dad returned a
few minutes later to see how I was doing and took the brush from me and said,
“Let me show you how to paint.”  He then proceeded to show me that you use the
brush to stuff the paint into the porous block and that you painted in all
directions to get the paint into the holes.  That seemed contrary to what
mother had taught me so I soon went back to painting with even strokes all in
the same direction.  When Dad came back and saw me painting he stopped me and
said, “I told you to stuff the paint into the holes and brush in every
direction.”  I replied “that’s not the way mom taught me.”  Dad told me in no
uncertain words, “I don’t give a “blankity, blank, blank” what your mother
said, I told you to paint this way and you had better do it.”  I don’t think I
ever again told dad that mom had told me how to do something.  I still think of
that experience every time I do some painting, even to this day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Another
experience I remember was when we were killing pigs.  The pig would be put in
the kill shoot, and for larger animals dad would shoot the animal with a 22
rifle.  The animal would then be rolled into a door on the side of the shoot into
the slaughter house.  However, for pigs Dad would carefully open the door and
place a chain around the hind leg, then with a hoist raise the pig, kicking and
squealing into the air and cut its throat.  When the pig was dead it would be
lowered into the hot water which would loosen the hair.  It was then put on a
table and with the use of scrappers the hair was removed.  Then with sharp
knifes we would shave the pig clean of all hair.  Dad would sharpen the <span
style='color:black'>knives</span> for us when they became dull.  I had helped
in this process many times.  When my knife needed sharpening I handed it to
Dad.  When he returned it to me he said, “That knife is sharp so don’t cut
yourself with it.”  I don’t ever remember him saying that to me like that
before.  The first slice across the pig’s skin I came across my left hand
thumb.  I quickly put my fore finger across the cut and applied pressure and
continued to shave the pig.  When we finished I went outside and uncovered the
cut.  I started to wrap the cut with a handkerchief when Irven came around the
building.  Seeing the blood and my hand he said, “You cut your hand”.  I told
him that if he said anything about it to anyone I would beat him.  No one ever
said anything about it and it healed and as far as I know no one every knew
about it until years later when we were talking about scars and I showed the
one on my left hand thumb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Mom and Dad Started a Home</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                </span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>About a years before we moved from Victor, Mom and Dad
decided to build a home.  They purchased a piece of property just west of Uncle
Albert and Aunt Vida’s home but on the north side of the road.  Mom spent a lot
of time drawing the house plans.  I remember of her showing the plans to Uncle
Irven and he commented that he had never seen anyone draw a more detailed set of
plans.  In the spring Dad had someone come in and dig the basement.  We were so
excited to see the hole dug.  I remember of Irven and I going to the property
several times just to see the progress.  I remember of one day taking a
neighbor friend, Blair Holms, with us.  An irrigation ditch ran across the
front of the property.  Irven and I walked across a board that Dad had placed
across the ditch.  Blair looked at the ditch and said that he could jump the
ditch.  He tried and landed on his hind end in the middle of the ditch.  We
sure teased him about that.  I didn’t know why, but shortly after that
incident, the work on the house stopped.  That was the year Dad closed his
slaughter house and went looking for work.  Several years after Dad’s death I
was visiting with Mom and I asked her what had happened to the home they were
going to build.  She said that someone had told Dad that he was foolish to
build his young wife a nice home like that for he would die long before her and
some younger man would come along and marry his widow and get the home.  Dad
just let the property go for taxes like he did the slaughter house</span></p>
