<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>CHARLES BROWNING – SLANG
PHASES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad frequently used slang phrases in describing
things.  When we lived in Victor, Idaho, we rented a home on Main Street that
was owned by an older couple, the West's that resided in California.  There was
a rear apartment on the home that was rented to a single lady, which as I
remembered was much younger than my parents.  Dad ran a butcher shop in the
store that was owned by Delos Larson.  One day the younger lady came into his
butcher shop and ordered some meat.  When Dad packaged it up, the lady asked
how much it would be.  Dad replied, &quot;Just one smacker.&quot;  The lady
looked at him and said, &quot;Mr. Browning, I would rather pay you &quot;.  To
which Dad said, &quot;Oh! One dollar&quot;.  He was careful to whom he referred
to a dollar as a smacker, after that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another time after Mom and Dad had moved to
Sunset, the summer of 1955.  Dad went down to the little grocery store on the
corner, he asked the owner if he had any &quot;Cackle Berries&quot;, to which
the owner replied, That at the time they were out of them.  Dad then asked if
he had any &quot;Hen's Fruit?&quot;  To which the owner replied, No, we will
have to order some of those.  Dad then asked, &quot;If he had any eggs, (of
which both Cackle Berries and Hens Fruit are the same as eggs), to which the
owned replied, &quot;Oh yes, we have plenty of those.&quot;  Dad got quite a
chuckle out of that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Dad &amp; the butcher
knife</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Dad telling the following story, but
I don't have any other details.  He was working in a butcher shop, now whether
or not this was the one in Victor, I do not know.  Anyway, one day a man came
into the store that had too much to drink and was drunk. He was also upset over
something and started using quite abusive language.  After a few minutes Dad
told him there were woman and children in the store and if he was going to talk
that way he could leave. The man got even more abusive and challenged Dad as to
what he was going to do about it.  Dad lost his temper and came out from behind
the counter and began to chase the man.  The man ran out the store and down the
street with Dad chasing after him.  Dad said that he was glad that the man
could run faster than he, for when Dad got tired and stopped, he realized he
still had his large butcher knife in his hand.  You can realize why the man was
running so fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad and Tree Trimming</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After Dad retired from Hill Field he wanted
something to do with his time.  One spring he saw an add in the paper, inviting
anyone that would like to learn how to trim fruit trees, to attend a training
class taught by county extension service, free of charge.  Dad took the class,
bought some tools, which included a trimmer on a long handle that he could
reach up into the trees to cut the branches.  Dad first started to trim his own
trees.  It wasn't long until he started doing the neighbors and before long was
getting calls from others that heard about his work.  His trimmer was probably
twelve feet or more in length.  He purchased a moped from Sears, which is a
small motorcycle that you can peddle if you need extra power for hills.  He
added side baskets to it and then he could put his tree trimming tool and lunch
in the baskets and tie the trimming pole across the seat and handle bars and he
would travel all over Davis and Weber County trimming trees.  One day he came
over to our place in Ogden.  I was outside doing some yard work.  Dad was
chuckling to himself as he drove up.  When I asked him what was so funny, he
asked if I know the lady around the corner and two houses down.  I told him I
did. He said he had been over to her place trimming her trees, and she came out
to watch him.  He said that after watching him for a few minutes, she commented
that she wished that she could do work like that, but when you got to be her
age you just didn't do things like that.  He asked if I know how old she was
and I told him that I did as I had just been working on ward records.  Dad was
better than 10 to 15 years her senior.  Dad died the next spring, 1967 at 82
years old, of a second heart attach.  At his viewing several people commented
that the paper had his age wrong for they had his age as 82 years old.  They
were surprised when we told him that it was correct.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After we moved to Ogden and spring time would
come, I would be excited to be out of school.  Dad got Irven and I a lawnmower
to mow our lawn but he also told us we could look for lawns around town that we
might mow.  This was the way we could earn our spending money.  From then on I
earned almost all my spending money and most of my school money for books and
most of my clothes.  Irven and I would push the lawnmower up and down the
streets looking for a lawn that needed cutting and then offer to cut it for 25
cents.  Some lawns we even mowed for 15 to 20 cents. When we moved to Monroe Avenue
and 13<sup>th</sup> Street, I was thirteen years old.  That summer, Dad worked
the swing shift at Hill Field.  Many mornings he would take me out to work in
the farms and orchards.  We would be down to the Employment Center before 7 AM
and the farmers would come by and take as many workers as they needed.  It
seemed to me that often Dad and I would be one to many, so Dad would always
have me go to work and he would go back home.  I could never figure out how
that happened so often.  Of course I wanted to go home and let him work.  In
reality, Dad was with me most of the time. Dad taught me to work at an early
age. I never really thought about how old Dad was, except I remember some of
the farm hands would call him Pops, and I didn't feel that was very
respectful.  Besides being disrespectful I was sure that Dad could work harder
than most of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Run-A-Way Horse</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>A story I remember Dad telling me. 
Sometime during Dad’s first marriage, Dad went out to buy a mare from another
farmer.  After looking at the horse and agreeing on a price the man told Dad
that there was one more thing that Dad should know about the horse.  He told
Dad that the horse would run a way with him.  Dad questioned, you mean while I
am ridding on her back?  The farmer replied, yes.  Dad then told the farmer
that he didn’t think there was a horse that could run a way with him while he
was on its back.  The farmer then told Dad that this horse would.  Dad bought
the horse anyway, put his saddle and bridle on the horse and got on to ride the
mare home.  It was a winter day but the road was well packed for travel.  As he
started for home he put the mare into a slow trot.  He hadn’t gone far when he
realized that the mare was gaining speed.  He let her run that way for a few
minutes and then pulled back on the reigns.  When he did the mare bit down on
the bit and jerked her head forward.  She then broke into a full run.  Dad let
her have her way for a minute and then slid his left hand down the reign to the
bit, grabbed both reigns together, removed his right foot from the stirrup and
then with his left hand, jerked the mare’s head completely around to his left
hip.  This, of course, threw the mare off balance, and as the horse went down Dad
jumped free from the fall, and the mare flipped completely over several times. 
Dad then went over to the horse and got her up.  Remounted the mare and again
started for home.  Again he hadn’t rode but a few minutes when the mare again
started to gain speed.  Dad again tried to reign the mare in but she again took
the bit in her teeth and broke into a full run.  Dad again took the reigns as
before and again the horse went down end over end.  Dad said that the fall
knocked the wind out of the mare and it took her a little while before she got
up.  He again remounted and said that the mare never again tried to run a way
with him as long as he owned her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Dad and the Fire Wagon</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This is a story that my Father told to me when I
was a young boy.  I hope I have the story right with correct details and
facts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>My Grandfather, Stephen Abiel Browning,
owned a grocery store in Ogden when my father, Charles, was a boy.  He tried a
new marketing technique when the telephone started becoming available to more
people.  A person could call into the store and order the groceries over the
phone and he would fill the order and have it delivered to the home.  Charles
often would be the one to deliver the order.  He used his horse and a one horse
buggy for deliveries.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At that time in Ogden, the fire wagons were
pulled by three teams of horses.  The fire house was located on 27<sup>th</sup>
street between Washington Blvd. and Grant Ave.  The teams of horses that pulled
the wagon were stalled on both sides of the area where the fire wagon was
kept.  The harnesses were already connected to the wagons tongues and single
trees and hung from ropes and pulleys in the air.  When the fire alarm sounded,
the gates to the stalls would open.  The horses were trained to quickly move
from the stall to the awaiting harness.  Men would drop the harness onto the
horses and quickly buckle them onto the teams.  By the time the horses were
ready to go, the fire men had came down the fire pole and would be on the fire
wagon.  Dad said that every day at noon a drill was held to see how fast the
team could be out of the fire station and on the way to a fire.  The normal route
for the run would be to go west on 27<sup>th</sup> to Grant Ave. and then south
for several blocks before returning to the fire house.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad said that this was always an exciting event
for him.  He said that the teams of horses were always excited to participate
in the trial run.  As they left the station bells would be ringing for people
to clear out of the way and everyone felt the great excitement.  Dad tried to
time his delivery runs so that he could be on Grant Avenue with his horse going
north at noon. When his horse heard the fire bells sounding it would become
excited and start to prance.  Dad would have to hold tight to the reigns in
order to hold his horse facing north.  As the wagon would pass, Dad would give
his horse the reigns and the horse would spin around, bolting to a full run and
try to catch up to the fire wagon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad said that though his horse never could catch
up with the fire wagon, he never got over the fun of the chase.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Auctions With Dad</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While Dad owned his butcher shop in victor, he
would often go to Idaho Falls to the live stock auctions.  Later there was an auction
ring set up in Rexburg that he would also go to, Rexburg being closer than
Idaho Falls.  During the summer, I enjoyed going to the live stock auctions
with Dad.  I enjoyed listening to the auctioneer as he would call out the
bidding so fast.  You had to sit very still and not move your hands, because it
took very little movement and the Auctioneer would take it that you were
bidding on an animal.  One day there were two men visiting only a short
distance from where Dad and I were sitting.  The one got waving his hand with
jesters as he talked.  Before long the Auctioneer called out, Sold to (and he
called the mans name).  The man called back to the auctioneer and asked him
what he had bought.  The auctioneer replied that he had bought the cow that
just went through.  The man then asked if the auctioneer would at least run the
critter back through so he could at least see what he had bought.  The crowd
got quite a laugh at that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On the way home Dad would stop at a store and
buy some crackers and cheese that we would eat for our lunch as we returned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad would often take livestock to the sale for
other people.  They knew that he went often and if they had an animal they
wanted to sell, they would have Dad take it for them.  One day we went out to a
farmer that lived south and west of town to get a bull.  When we got there the
man told us that the bull had got out and he would have to spend a day rounding
it back up with a horse.  He explained that the bull was frightened of a man on
foot, and would run away.  It could jump most fences.  The next week we again
went out to get the bull.  This time the farmer had the bull securely tied and
penned.  The bull was large, but its neck was larger than its head.  Dad's
trailer had stanchions for the head, but because of the large neck the
stanchion wouldn't hold.  The bull had a ring and a chain in it's nose, so
after putting its head in the stanchion, Dad tied the chain to the trailer
tongue.  Dad also had his lariat on the bull and tied it to the tongue of the
trailer.  We went over the Pass to Swan Valley and had just reached the dry
farms on the west side of the pass when I looked back and saw that the bull had
jerked the ring through its nose, tearing it open and had blood all over.  I
told Dad and he started to stop the pickup.  Then the bull jerked again and
snapped the lariat as if it was a string, that let the bull free in the
trailer.  As the pickup stopped the bull whirled and jumped the sides of the
trailer.  Dad, Roy and I tried to corner the bull between the truck and trailer
and the fence, but the bull just jumped the fence and ran off.  Dad had Roy and
I follow the bull and he went back to get the truck.  We would chase the bull
until he would come to a fence.  He would then turn and look at us and paw the
ground as though he was going to charge us, but then would turn and jump the
fence and we again were on the chase.  Finally the bull jumped into a lane that
led to a large equipment shed.  There were fences on each side of the lane.  We
were able to keep the bull between the two fences, until he went into the
shed.  Roy and I quickly shut the doors and had him locked inside.  Dad soon
came with the pickup and trailer.  He backed the trailer to the door.  When Dad
was ready, he slid the door open just far enough that the trailer gate could be
opened.  As dad went into the shed, a breeze pushed a man door on the other
side of the building open.  When the bull saw the opening he ran through it,
tearing the door and frame apart, and was free again.  Dad said there was no
way we were going to catch that bull with out a horse, so we went on to the
sale.  The next day Dad and the farmer that owned the bull took horses and went
back to Swan Valley to catch the bull.  When they got there, they found a
sheriffs posse that had formed to catch the mean bull that had everyone scared
to come out of their houses.  With several men on horses they started after the
bull.  At one point they got it surrounded with men on horses and a hay stack. 
Dad got of his horse to rope the bull but when the bull saw dad on foot, it
whirled and drove through the hay stack.  The next time they got it cornered,
Dad just shoot it with his rifle, they then drug it into the trailer and took
it back to the slaughterhouse and made hamburger out of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>My Dogs</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first dog that I remember having was given
to me by Mr. Burnside’s.  We lived in Victor but I don’t remember how old I
was.  Mr. Burnside’s had set up a dog kennel across the road from where the
slaughterhouse was located.  When he first moved to Victor he had the kennel
just west of where we lived.  He had many people complain about the dogs and so
had moved the kennel to its new location just outside the city limits. Irven
and I were down to the slaughterhouse when Mr. Burnside’s came in and told me
that he had a bitch (a bitch is a female dog) that was snowed into her hut. 
She had a litter of pups and during the recent snow storms had stayed in the
hut with her litter.  She had continually pawed the snow down with her paws to
keep an air opening.  The snow was now solid ice and the dog and her pups were
locked in without a way to get food or water.  He said that if I would dig her
out he would give me one of her pups.  I knew the bitch he was talking about
and had been very careful not to get very close to her for she had a reputation
of being quite mean.  However, I couldn’t resist the opportunity to get a pup.  I
agreed and went over with a shovel and a pick.  With caution I dug the opening
larger.  I guess the bitch realized her perilous circumstance and didn’t even
growl at me as I worked.  A short time later when I went to the slaughterhouse
Dad had the pup for me.  The pup was dark brown, almost black, and as it grew I
am sure it was a normal mischievous pup.  However, Mrs. East had moved from
California, after the death of her husband, to the apartment at the rear of our
home.  She was the owner of the house and we were only renting the front unit. 
My dog wasn’t very old when Mrs. East began to complain that my dog was digging
up her flowers.  She said that we had to get rid of the dog.  We, therefore,
took the dog out to Kilgore to my sister, Floss, and her husband, Keith.  Keith
had a ranch out there and had lots of room for a dog to run and grow.  Floss
was teaching school in the area.  Winters were hard in that area and the snow
made it hard for Floss to get to school.  She trained the dog to pull a slay
and so the next winter she would bundle their daughter Judy up, put her in the
chair of the slay, then the dog would pull the two of them the two miles to the
school house.  Anyway, after we had taken the dog out to Floss, Mrs. East’s
flowers continued to be dug up.  We found that it was her son’s dog that was
digging up her flowers.  Her son was Harold Homes who lived next door.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I guess I was 10 years old when one day Dad had
me come down to the slaughter house.  He had a new dog for me.  The dog was 1 ½
years old, and was a cross between a greyhound and a staghound.  He was built a
lot like a greyhound but was bigger.  He also had the speed like a greyhound. 
His name was Pete and I immediately fell in love with him.  He was with me
wherever I would go.  We would play tag with him.  All the kids in the
neighborhood would form a line in the center of the yard, and then Pete would
start to run, trying to get to the other end of the yard without letting anyone
touch him.  No matter how hard we tried, no one ever was able to touch him in
this game.  He would play this game as long as we had the energy to play with
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Irven and I often would take the 22 and go
hunting in the sage brush field to the west of Dad’s slaughter house.  Pete always
wanted to go with us but that created a problem. When Pete saw a rabbit he
would start chasing it long before we could get a shot at it.  One day Pete
took chase of what we thought was a rabbit.  We tried to keep up with him and
when we caught up, Pete had cornered it under a pile of logs.  We tried to see
what it was under those logs but couldn’t.  Pete started digging under the logs
when suddenly we got a very bad odor.  It wasn’t a rabbit but a skunk that Pete
has chased.  Its spray missed Irven and I but got Pete in the face.  I think
that we threw rocks at Pete for the next week, trying to keep him away from us.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The next time we decided to go hunting we
decided to leave Pete at the Slaughter House.  We put Pete in the killing pen
but he soon caught up with us.  We figured that he had somehow got under the
fence.  We brought him back and put him in the kill shoot.  The kill shoot was
three foot wide and eight feet long and the sides were rough sawn 2” x 6”
spaced 3” apart to the height of over seven foot high.  The gate was also
almost solid so that we were sure that there was no way for Pete to get out. 
We hadn’t gone very far when again Pete came along side of us.  We took him
back and asked Dad if he had let Pete out of the killing shoot.  He said that
he hadn’t.  We put Pete back in the shoot and then went around the corner.  We
peeked back and saw Pete climbing the side of the shoot as you would a ladder
and when he reached the top jumped over and landing on the ground.  After that
if we didn’t want him with us we would lock him in the back room of the Slaughter
house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I trained Pete as a sled dog.  I built my dog
sleigh by using an old chair, cutting the legs off and screwed the chair to my snow
sleigh.  I left enough room, on the back of the sleigh, to stand on and then I
could hold onto the back of the chair for balance.  I fasten a 1” X 3” board to
the underneath front center of the sled’s frame with a hinge and extended it past
the back of the sleigh about a foot.  I drove several nails through the end of
the board so they extended out about an inch.  I fastened a spring from the top
back of the chair to the board so that the board was held up off the snow.  To
slow down or stop I could step down on the board, causing the nails to dig into
the snow.  Dad had a harness sewn to fit my dog that I could easily slip onto
him and then fasten it to the sleigh.  Pete soon learned to be obedient and
follow my verbal instructions.  One day as I was running Pete we came to the
street corner where, if we turned left we would go to my Aunt Vida and Uncles
Albert’s place.  I gave the command to go right but Pete turned left.  I
stopped him and again gave the command to turn right but again he turned left. 
I again stopped the sled, turned him and the sleigh around and went back the
way we had come.  We only went a little ways when I stopped Pete and turned 
back around.  When we came to the corner I again gave the command to turn right
but again Pete tried turning left.  I stopped the sleigh and again gave the
command to turn right.  Pete again tried to turn left.  This time I lost my
temper, stopped the sleigh and went to Pete and gave him a beating.  I never
had problems again with the left and right commands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Running Pete on the streets of town, I soon
found that Pete had one characteristic that I could not overcome.  He would not
work on Main Street.  Where he got that characteristic or training from I do
not know.  In those years there were very few cars on the roads in Victor, also
the winters are quite hard there in Idaho and the snow is not plowed down to
the pavement but mainly just leveled out and packed down.  On all other streets
and even on the main highway outside of town Pete worked just great.  I guess
this characteristic dealing with Main Street, was first recognized by Grandma. 
Mom worked at the school lunch and cleaned up the kitchen after the students
would eat and go back to classes.  Grandma would get Irven ready and let him go
to the school.  He could play in the gym until mom was finished and then come
home with her.  Grandma would watch Irven walk towards the school.  Pete would
stay between Irven and the road until they got to the intersection where Irven
had to cross the road.  Pete would stop Irven from crossing until the traffic
was clear and then would change sides so that he was again positioned so that
Irven could not walk on to the street.  When Irven got to the school and went
inside, Pete would come back home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Often after school and on Saturdays I would have
Mom dress Irven up warm and he would sit on the seat of the sleigh.  After we
got outside the main street, Pete would pull us for a mile or two out of town
and back again.  Pete seemed to be able to pull us without trouble although he
usually would run with his head down.    One day as we were returning to town,
a car with California license plates stopped us.  The man driving asked if we
would wait until they could get up a head of us a little ways.  We waited and
when the car was a little ways ahead the lady got out with a movie camera and
waved for us to come on.  Pete’s head came up and he almost danced down the
road.  As we got close to the car the woman set back down on the seat and as
they slowly drove forward she continued taking pictures with the camera. 
Finally they waved and drove on.  As soon as they drove off, Pete’s head again
dropped and he went back to his usual droopy, over worked look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sometimes I would just hook a rope to the
harness and Pete would pull me on skies.  With Pete’s size and build he became
very fast. I often had races with my friends.  Ted Blanchard was the only
friend that ever beat us in a race and he only did it once.  We were going for
a two block race and as Pete started to pass Ted’s dog, the dog turned and bit
Pete.  Pete immediately slowed down and would not try to pass again.  Ted won
that race so I challenged him to race again.  This time Pete got just behind
Ted’s dog and again would not pass no matter how I cocked him.  Then a dog,
that was in a yard to the side of us, barked and Ted’s dog turned to see where
the dog was.  As the dogs attention was distracted for a minute, Pete burst
with energy to quickly pass and win the race.  This is the way that I won Ted from
then on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mr. Burnsides often entered his dog team into
winter competition.  On day he came to me and said that he was one dog short in
his team.  He asked if he could use Pete as a replacement for that day.  I let
him use Pete, but when he returned Pete I couldn’t get Pete to work for me.  I
had to almost totally retrain Pete.  This happened a second time but I saw that
race and saw how Mr. Burnside handled his team with a whip.  Pete refused to
respond to the whip and I never let Mr. Burnside use Pete again.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Victor held a winter carnival with cutter sleigh
races, bob sleigh races, cross country ski races, dog races and a team pulling
race.  Main Street would be blocked off to all traffic and most of the
activities were held there.  I figured that with all the dogs that would be
racing in the single dog slay race that Pete would work on Main Street this
time.  There must have been over a dozen dogs that lined up on the starting
line and when the starter gun was fired Pete refused to run.  I almost
retracted my decision not to let Mr. Burnside’s use him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In 1952 my family moved to Ogden Utah.  Dad had
got a job with Hill Air force Base.  Mom and Roy went down to Ogden so that
they might find a place for our family to live.  Grandma Hill, Irven and I went
to Pocatello and stayed. Grandma stayed at Uncle Irven’s.  Irven and I stayed part
of the time with Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice and part of the time with Rich
and Lois.  It had been decided that Pete could not go to Utah with us.  Before
leaving Victor I sold my rabbits to a farmer that lived west of town and I also
gave Pete to him.  Most of the summer went by before Mom was able to find a
house that we could afford to rent.  Mother thought she had found a place so Dad,
Mom and Roy returned to Idaho to take our furniture to Utah.  They picked Irven
and I up and we went to victor with them.  I believe that it was Uncle Irven
that took us from Pocatello to Victor.  When we got to Uncle Albert and Aunt
Vida’s Pete was there.  As soon as I got out of the car Pete ran over to me.  I
gave him a love and a pet and he then ran over to some food that was out for
him and began to eat.  Uncle Albert was surprised as Pete hadn’t eaten much
since we had left him.  Uncle Albert said that within a couple of days, after
we had left Victor, that Pete had came to their place.  Uncle Albert said that
the man ,I had given him to, had tied him up and he had broken the rope.  He
had came and got him and this time locked him inside a garage.  Pete then dug
his way under the garage wall.  Again he came back and got him, this time
besides putting him in the garage, he fastened him with a chain.  When Pete
wouldn’t eat, the man had decided to take him for a walk.  He had no sooner got
outside the garage with Pete, when Pete bolted and drug the man until he had to
let loose of the chain.  Pete then remained at the old house or at Uncle
Albert’s but ate or drank very little.  Uncle Albert had decided to have Pete
put away rather than to have him starve.  Irven and I pleaded with Mom and Dad
to let us take him to Utah.  They finally gave in and when the truck, a cattle
truck, was loaded they tied Pete on top of the load.  Roy rode most of the way
to Utah on top with Pete.  Irven and I went back to Rich’s; to wait for Mom and
Dad to get things settled in Utah.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was almost time for school to start when Dad
asked Rich and Lois if they would bring Irven and me to Ogden.  I don’t
remember why but the house Mother had found fell through.  The day before
Grandma, Irven and I got there, Mother rented a two bedroom apartment located
at 30<sup>th</sup> Street and Wall Avenue.  It was small but we were back
together again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>**************************</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Insert of another story written later:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                                                1952  move
to Ogden</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My family moved to Ogden Utah as Dad Was able to
get a job at Hill Air Force Base as a painter.  Dad had gone to Ogden early in
the spring.  He had found a small apartment on Wall Avenue and 17<sup>th</sup>
street but it was not adequate for a family.  When Dad was sure that his job
was permanent, Mom and Roy went down on the bus to try to find some place for
us to live.  Grandma Hill, Irven and I went to Uncle Lee and Aunt Wilma’s on a
bus to Teton.  That was the first time that Irven or I had ridden on a bus.  Two
weeks later Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice drove to Teton and got us and took us
to their home in Pocatello.  We stayed there with them most of the summer, but
a couple of times,  Irven and I went out to stay a night or two at Rich and
Lois’s home.  Rich and Lois were still living in an 8’ x 10’ trailer house on
five acres of land they had bought up Mink Creek.  We stayed in Pocatello until
just before school started in the fall, when Mom called and said that they were
able to find a place large enough for all of us.  Rich said that he and Lois
would drive us to Ogden.  The following day after Mom had called to let us
know, she found out that the home they thought they were to rent was rented to
someone else.  She and Roy had looked for weeks to find that place and now we
would be coming down the next day.  She and Roy had looked at an apartment on
30<sup>th</sup> and Wall Avenue but felt that it was too small.  In desperation
they went back and it was still available so they rented it.  It was a two
story building with two apartments on the ground level and two unfinished
apartments on the second level.  Our apartment consisted of two small bed
rooms, a very small kitchen, a bathroom and a small front room.  Mom and Dad
slept in the one bedroom and grandma, Roy, Irven and I slept in the other
bedroom.  We had a bed for Grandma and they had bought a set of bunk beds.   Roy
slept in the bottom bed and Irven and I slept in the top bed.  The two beds
took all the floor space and we had to crawl over the end of Grandma’s bed to
get to the bunk bed.  When Rich and Lois brought us down, there wasn’t room for
them to stay over so they returned home the same day.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I still remember that with just moving from Idaho,
the July heat of Utah seemed almost unbearable, especially at night.  The bunk
bed was next to the window so Irven and I slept with our heads as close to what
cool air we could get.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended the Ogden 20<sup>th</sup> Ward which
was on the South West corner of Wall and 30<sup>th</sup> street.  With our
apartment being on the North East corner it wasn’t far to attend church
activities.  The only problem is that Wall is a very busy street and there was
no traffic light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            During one of the first Sunday School meetings we
attended, the Sunday School Superintendent announced that they were going to
have a special ward talent night.  They were selling tickets for the event with
all the money going towards the purchase of new Hymn Books.  The ward really
needed new books as the ones they had were really out dated and completely worn
out.  The Superintendent asked the youth of the Ward to canvas the area and
sell tickets.  They offered the youth an incentive by giving the one that sold the
most tickets their own new hymn book.  Well, the book really should have been
awarded to my Grandmother as she was the one who kept me going out selling
tickets.  Every day after school and every Saturday she would send me out
canvassing our ward area.  I did sell the most tickets and was awarded the new
hymn book.  Another thing that happened, because of my knocking on every door,
was that just a half block north of our place lived an older gentleman in a
basement apartment.  I don’t remember if he bought a ticket or not, but he asked
me where I lived.  He then asked if I would like to be paid a dollar a week to
help him do some house work.  He had me come on Saturday mornings and help him
do the dishes; sweep and mop the kitchen floor and clean up the front room. 
His wife had previously passed away and he took care of his daughter.   She was
crippled from polio and had no use of her hands, arms and legs.  She couldn’t
talk, but she could hold a paint brush in her mouth and paint pictures.  I worked
for him until that fall when my mother was able to find a home to rent on 28<sup>th</sup>
and Lincoln and I started school.  Even after 62 years, when I have occasions
to drive in that area of Ogden, I still think of those two and wonder what
happened to them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*******************************<i> </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There was a fenced yard so we could have Pete
there also.  That became a problem, however, because as big as Pete was he
could easily jump the fence and wander wherever he wanted.  Roy had got a lease
and we would tie Pete to the clothes lines when we were all gone.  With Grandma
living with us, she was usually there so Pete got so he stayed at home.  However,
Pete found it enjoyable to wait until the evening traffic got heavy on Wall
Avenue and then he would jump the fence and walk out into the street and stop
traffic.  He would wait until the traffic stopped and then walk into the other
lane and stop traffic there.  This became almost a daily ritual with him if we
weren’t there to stop him.  As the days became shorter in daylight, one evening
Pete walked out to stop the traffic.  As he stepped into the second lane the
driver didn’t see him in time and hit him.  I heard the brakes screech and the
thud as the car hit Pete but we couldn’t find Pete.  As large as Pete was, when
the car hit him he went over the car instead of under it, which probably saved
he life.  Pete was sore for a while, and after getting better, he was more
cautious to be sure that the drivers saw him before stepping out to stop them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One day a friend and I climbed into the attic of
the apartment building and found some pigeon nests.  We brought a chick down
with us.  I fed the chick with a eye dropper and tweezers and raised it to become
a pet.  We named the pigeon Peep.  Often Peep would ride on my shoulder when I
would go down town.  When we got close to the movie theater Peep would fly from
my shoulder and join the other pigeons that were feeding on popcorn and candy
dropped by the movie patrons.  I would walk on past and when I got almost to
the end of the block I would whistle and Peep would leave the flock and fly to
my shoulder.  People would stare in amazement at us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Peep also found that he could ride on Pete’s
back.  He did this quite regularly until Pete would become irritated with it. 
Pete would then jump over the fence and Peep would fall off.  However, Peep
soon learned that when Pete came back into the yard he could again jump onto
his back.  Pete then would jump over the fence and then jump right back and
pick up Peep by the head and carry him over to a corner and drop him.  That
seemed to be enough for Peep to leave Pete alone for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            A short time later Mom found a larger house on
Lincoln Avenue and 28<sup>th</sup> Street so we moved there.  Peep wouldn’t
move, so in order to keep him at the new house I clipped his wings.  I guess  because
Peep couldn’t fly, he got to riding Pete more.  I guess Pete got tired of it
because one day when I came home from school all I found of Peep was a pile of
feathers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Pete was a very gentle dog, but people who
didn’t know him, didn’t want to test him.  One day when all of the family was
gone to work or school except Grandma, a poorly dressed man came to the front
door.  Grandma answered the door but did not open the screen.  The man wanted
her to buy some old magazines he had.  When she said that she wasn’t interested,
the man reached for the door handle.  Pete immediately walked between the man
and the door and just stood there.  The man backed off and left.  Grandma said
that Pete didn’t show anger but she was sure that he would not have let the man
go any further.  There were a couple of other times that people would call our
house, from across the street, and have someone come outside to let them come
in.  Pete was just too big for them to take a chance on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One day when I came home from school, I found a
rabbit that Pete had carried home from some where.  Having experience with dogs
that kill rabbits, I knew that the best way to break them from doing that was
to shoot the dog.  Not wanting to shoot Pete, I decided to try breaking him by
tying the rabbit tight around Pete’s neck, so that he could not get it off. 
Pete carried that rabbit in that position for almost two weeks.  When I took it
off and threw it in the trash Pete wanted nothing to do with it.  Later, when we
had moved to Monroe and 13<sup>th</sup> Street, I again raised rabbits. I could
put a rabbit loose on the ground and Pete would stay completely away from it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One afternoon, after Irven and I got out of
school, we went to a movie downtown.  It was getting late as we walked home.  We
were just about a block form home when a car load of boys stopped their car and
shouted, “lets pants them”, and came running towards Irven and I.  I whistled
and Pete came running down the side walk at full speed.  When the boys saw
Pete, they turned and jumped into their car and were off.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another interesting story, dealing with Pete,
was the time I came home from school and found a large steer head in the front
yard.  Now the nearest slaughter house and meat packing plant was located in
West Ogden.  It would have been over two miles away from our house.  Whether or
not that is where it came from, we did not know, but if it was, Pete had to
drag that head over the railroad tracks right through the center of downtown
Ogden, and up the hill from Washington Blvd. and five more blocks to our home. 
The steer head was so heavy that it took both Irven and I to lift it into the
trash can.  We estimated that it was possibly close to the noon hour that Pete
would have gone through the center of town.  I often wondered what people
thought when they saw Pete with that head.  I doubt if anyone was going to try
taking it away from him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After school was over that year Irven and I went
up to Idaho for a couple of weeks.  We had started doing this for the previous
couple of years.  Leslie, Doreen, Lanny, Irven and I would spend a week
together at Uncle Lee and Aunt Wilma’s and then a week at Uncle Irven and Aunt
Bernice’s and then a week at our place.  When we got back to our place, Pete
was gone.  Mother said that Dad had given him away to someone that lived in
Preston Idaho.  Dad could see no use keeping an animal that didn’t do or
provide something.  We were sure that we had seen the last of Pete.  However,
almost two weeks later Pete returned.  When I went outside Pete was at the
door.  He was dirty, starved and looked almost dead but when he saw me his tail
began to wag.  During this year we moved to Monroe Avenue and 13<sup>th</sup>
Street.  When school was out again for the summer, Irven and I again went to
Idaho for the two weeks with cousins.  As before, when we returned home, Pete
was again missing.  This time Dad had sold him to a man that lived in West
Ogden.  It was only a few days until Pete returned.  However, the next day the
man came back to get him.  Dad had sold Pete to him and he wanted the dog
back.  I called for Pete and he came.  The man told me that he collected
garbage from the restaurants and said that he would pick out the leftover
steaks so that Pete would get all the meat he could eat.  He then asked if I
would put Pete in his truck for him.  I led Pete to the door.  Pete stopped and
looked up at me with a look I will never forget.  I gave him a nudge with his
collar and he jumped into the truck and went to the opposite side of the truck
and stayed looking out the opposite side as the man drove away.  I guess Pete
felt that if I was going to give him away, then he would go, for I never saw
Pete again.  That was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do for I
loved Pete dearly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ogden 20<sup>th</sup> Ward</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>When we first moved to Ogden in 1953 we
moved into an apartment on Wall Ave. and 30<sup>th</sup> St.  We were in the
Ward boundaries of the Ogden 20<sup>th</sup> Ward. The Chapel was located a ½
block below Wall on 30<sup>th</sup> street so we didn’t have very far to walk
to the meetings.  I was a Deacon at that time.  Some of my early memories there
started with Mom and I attending Sacrament meeting.  Irven may have been with
us but Dad seldom attended and Roy had become inactive by then.  The thing that
I was impressed with is the special musical number.  A man sang the “Lord’s
Prayer” and it was so impressive.  Later when I started school at Lewis Jr.
High, I found that Mr. Blackburn was my chorus instructor.  I soon lost all
respect for him as his life did not reflect my first impression when he had
sang in our Sacrament meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I attended Mutual (M.I.A.), as it was
called then, I found that we had Scout meeting in the basement of the church. 
The boys were about as unruly as they were in Victor.  Our Scout Master taught
us how to make rope from bailing twine.  Before leaving Victor we had been
taught how to do this.  He had a different way of doing it that I had been
taught in Victor and the rope was very bristly and rough.  In Victor we used a
torch and burned rough fray off, making it a smooth rope that could be used for
a lariat.  I asked the Scout Master about doing that and he said that if you
did it the rope would not hold together.  I told him that I know how to make a
rope that you could do that and he challenged me that I couldn’t do it.  I seem
to have a problem with being challenged like that and I told him that I could. 
He said that if I was so smart to show him.  I told him that I would have to
make the machine to do it.  He said that was a assignment as a patrol to
demonstrate it next week.  That week we held our patrol meeting at our place
and we did make a rope twisting machine and we burned the roughness of with out
any problem.  When we demonstrated it the next week he never seems to like me
after that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Hymn books in our Chapel were showing age
and so the Sunday School Presidency purposed a plan in which to raise the funds
to purchase new Hymn Books.  They would put on a special musical program and
sell tickets to attend it.  The tickets were for any donation made towards the
new Hymn books and the youth of the Ward were asked to canvas the Ward selling
the tickets.  I wasn’t to keen on doing that but I remember Grandma would
remind me that I needed to do it.  Reluctantly I went out every afternoon and
when the night of the program came I was awarded my own Hymn book as I had
turned the most money in.  Years later when Sandi was a young girl in the Erda
Ward, she was called to be the Sunday School Pianist.  At that time we had a 15
minute music practice during the opening of Sunday School.  On one occasion the
Chorister was trying to teach the congregation a new Hymn and the Music she was
leading and what Sandi was playing just didn’t match.  After a few minutes of frustrating
and embarrassing tries, for her and Sandi, she changed to a different song. 
After she got with Sandi to find out the trouble and they found that the music
had been rewritten and Sandi was using an old book.  We bought Sandi a new hymn
book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Telephones when I was
young.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was a boy we had telephones with the
rotary dial and party lines.  A party line was where more that one house hold
had the same phone line, usually three to four homes per line.  This meant that
if you wanted to use the telephone you had to lift the receiver and listen to
see if anyone else was talking on the phone before you could use your phone. 
If the line was in use, you were to hang up the receiver and wait until the
others were through.  Often some people would listen in on the conversation of
others which was considered improper and impolite.  We also found that by
dialing a certain series of numbers you could call more than one household at
the same time.  I remember of doing that one time and when the other two
parties answered we would just remain silent and listen to their reaction.  The
one time I did that and two men answered, one said Hello and the other also
said Hello.  The first man then asked what he wanted and the other man said
that he didn’t want any thing but what do you want.  To this the first man said
that the second man had called him and the second man said no I didn’t, you
called me.  Before the two men hung up the phone they were so mad at the other
that I think they would have had a fist fight if they had known who the other
man was.  I remember of holding my hand over the speaker end of the receiver so
that the men could not hear me laughing at their conversation.  I am sure that
if my mother had caught me pulling that gag that I would have remembered the
outcome of that phone call with a different ending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>          </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Shortly after we moved to Ogden I got a job
delivering news papers.  My route was from the railroad tracks on the west, to
Washington Boulevard on the east and from 26<sup>th</sup> street on the north
to 33<sup>rd</sup> street on the south.  This was considered the low income
area of Ogden.  Although it was a poor area I seldom had anyone that didn’t pay
when I would go collecting.  When we moved to 23<sup>rd</sup> street and Monroe
Boulevard I changed routes.  My new area went from 25<sup>th</sup> street on
the south to 21<sup>st</sup> street on the north and from Adams Avenue on the
west to Monroe Avenue on the east.  This area was considered a middle class
income.  However, I continually had customers that would make me return 2 or 3
times and some that wouldn’t pay for 2 to 3 months.  After several months of
collecting this way I stopped delivery when a customer wouldn’t pay.  Even
though I talked to my supervisor about the problem, if I didn’t deliver a paper
and the customer called in and complained I would get a 25 cent charge. 
Finally one month I had to take money of my own to pay my paper bill.  When my
supervisor wouldn’t help me I resigned my route.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In the spring of 1954 I went up to Rich’s and
worked for him that summer.  Rich borrowed a bailer from some one that he know
and had agreed to bail Mr. Fraizer’s hay.  Rich also hired Dale Higgins to help
us.  Dale was a year or two younger than I.  The first morning that we started
the job, Rich, Dale and I tried to get the motor started on the bailer.  It was
a V 4 gas engine.  We cranked it and did every thing we could think of to get
it started but it would not start.  We changed the spark plugs, checked the
timing and every thing else we could think of but it just wouldn’t start.  By
noon all three of was completely exhausted from turning the crank.  We went
back to the house for lunch and as we ate I told Rich that I had an idea that
might start the motor.  We went back to the field, disconnected the tractor
from the bailer.  We then lined the tractor wheel up with the pulley on the motor. 
We took the belt off the large fly wheel of the bailer and put it around the
wheel of the tractor.  We jacked the wheel of the tractor up so it was off the
ground and started the tractor.  With that set up the tractor turned the motor
until it started.  After we once got the motor running from then on it would
restart quite easily.  Each morning we had to use that routine to get the motor
started for the first time but after it was once started it would restart with
just one or two cranks.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another experience we had with that bailer was
on one morning as we started the day, there was a area in which water had ran
down through the field.  The bailer was a hand tie bailer so Dale and I set
across from each other just at the end of the plunger stroke.  We would insert
threading needles into the chamber and then thread wire through the bails and
tie the wires.  The seats were positioned so that our feet extended under the
frame of the bailer.  When the tractor drove over the wet area it held up ok
but when the bailer wheel hit the wet area it instantly dropped in until the
bailer frame rested on the ground.  Amazingly both Dale and I had jerked our
legs out from under it as it sank.  Other wise we would have been pinned under
it.  We could not pull the bailer out with the tractor but had to get a
neighbor to pull it out with a large dump truck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we mowed hay we used a mower sickle that
mounted on the back and to the side of the tractor.  When you opened a field
you would cut the first swath with the sickle to the outside of the field.  
Then you would turn around and drive on the first swath of hay, cutting the
second swath.  One day I was opening a hay field at Mr. Fraizer’s.  I had made
the first swath and was cutting the second swath.  Weeds had grown up and hid
the creek bank drop off several feet in from the creek bed.  Cutting the first
swath did not revile the drop off and as I cut the second swath the tractor
suddenly dropped off the creek bank. The tractor almost tipped over but stayed
balanced on its side.  I was able to shut off the tractor and jump to safty. 
The tractor remained balanced but I did not dare try to move it for fear that
it would tip over.  I had to get the same neighbor, which had pulled the bailer
out, to come down and pull the tractor out.  Mr. Fraizer was looking at the
tractor when we got back and said he did not understand how the tractor did not
continue to roll over and crush me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Rich would often take bailed hay in trade for
the work that we performed for Mr. Fraizer.  Rich had to go into his job at the
store one day so had asked if I could go to Mr. Fraizer’s and haul hay from the
field and stack it at Rich’s barn.  I took the tractor and the trailer and
worked most of the morning loading hay.  I had just finished stacking the first
load at Rich’s barn when Rich came home.  When he saw the stack of hay he asked
why I had made the trips with such a few bails on the trailer.  I questioned
what he meant.  He said that for two trips I didn’t have very many bails.  I
told him that I had only made one trip.  He asked how many layers of bails I
had put on the trailer.  I told him that I had put 8 layers on.  He would not
believe me for he said that I could not pull that large of a load up the hill
from Mr. Fraizer’s with out it tipping over.  I had to go in the house and have
Lois come out and verify that I had only made one trip.  He said that he had
tried to pull 7 layers of bails up the hill and had tipped the trailer over
backwards.  I just told him that he hadn’t told me that so I just came up the
hill slow with out any problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The next summer, 1955, I went back to Rich’s and
again worked with him.  Work was slower that year and there were many days that
I didn’t work.  Rich was still working full time at the butcher shop and did
custom farming for others part time.  Melvin Anderson came to Rich and asked if
he could hire me to work for him.  Rich agreed and I worked the rest of the
summer for Melvin.  This was quite a raise for me as Rich paid me $2.00 per
hour and Mr. Anderson offered me $5.00 per hour.  My first job was to drive a
caterpillar pulling a weeder on the dry farm.  A weeder is a 1” square steel
rod 20’ long that turns backward to the line of travel and pulls the weeds out
of the ground.  The bar should run about 1 inch under the surface. 
Occasionally the weeds will wrap around the rod and you have to stop and cut
the weeds off.  One day the dust was heavy and blowing the same direction as I
was traveling.  I did not see the weeds gathering on the bar and before I
realized it I was plowing a large amount of dirt.  I felt the caterpillar twist
to the side and instantly I stopped.  When the dust cleared I had pulled the
hitch apart.  I had to disconnect the hitch and load it onto the caterpillar to
carry it down to Rich’s where I could use a torch and welder and rebuild the
hitch.  Melvin came by and seeing what had happened, gave me a hand and we
finished putting the weeder back together.      </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One day as I was weeding I could see smoke
coming from down below the hills.  I stopped the equipment and ran to where I
could view below.  At first the smoke had looked like it was coming from the
area of Rich &amp; Lois’s home but when I got to where I could see the house I
could tell it was across the road.  I ran on down to the house and went over to
help putt out the fire.  The fire had been started by some one burning trash. 
It was burning a field of weeds that was between a mink farm on the north and Mr.
Fraizer’s chicken farm to the south.  That was quite a job trying to control it
and save both of the farms.  There were several that came to help and we were
able to get it out.  I remember how hot the ground got so that it burned my
feet clear through my work boots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My next assignment with Mr. Anderson was harvesting
wheat.  Self propelled combines were new at this time and couldn’t be used on
steep sloped fields.  Therefore, on Melvin’s farm he used a pull behind combine,
pulling it with the caterpillar.  I would get to the field by 4 AM, grease the
combine and the caterpillar by feeling for the grease fittings in the dark.  I
would have the equipment ready to start cutting by daylight.  By noon I would
have the grain truck filled with grain, re-greased the equipment and would then
drive the truck of grain into Pocatello and dump it at the grain elevator.  By
the time I returned to the field Melvin would have got there and would be
cutting grain.  I would leave the truck for Melvin to fill and I would go home
for the day.  Melvin would cut until he had the truck full and then he would
turn off the equipment and drive the load of grain to the grain elevator.  He
would return the truck to Rich’s for me to drive to the field the next morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first time that Melvin took me to the grain
field we drove up in the grain truck.  This truck had dull-wheels on the rear. 
We bounced up a narrow dirt road along side of a deep draw.  As we got to the
top of the draw the road looked as though it would end but then turned 90
degree to the right and went across the top of the draw.  At that point the
road didn’t look wide enough for the truck.  The left side of the road went
almost straight up and the right side of the road dropped into the draw.  The
first few times I had to cross this cut by my self I would stop the truck, walk
across the cut and visually sight the truck and wheels to see if they were in
line with the road.  I don’t think that there was any more room than six inches
to spear on either side of the wheels.  After a few times of driving across the
cut I got so that I could maneuver the cut with out stopping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            To pay Rich and Lois for my board and room I
would do some of the chores around the house.  One thing is I would do was to milk
the cow in the evening. Rich would milk the cow in the mornings before he would
go to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Sunset 1955</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I returned home in the fall Mom and Dad had
bought a home in Sunset which is South West of Ogden and had moved there.  In
reality my Grandmother Hill and Mother had bought the home.  Grandma used some
of the insurance money she had received from the settlement of the death of her
two sons, Myron and Grant, their wife’s Lila and Marge and her granddaughter
and her husband.  (<i>I will write about in another section</i>.)  Anyway
Grandma had agreed with Mother to put a down payment on a home if she could
continue to live with us as long as she lived. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Do to this move I changed schools and went my
Junior Year at Davis High School in Kaysville.  The first day at school there
was an announcement made that there was some part time job openings at Clover
Club Foods.  I recognized the name from the Clover Club Potato Chips.  There
was also announced that at 2:30 PM there would be a Pep Assembly held on the
football field.  By asking some of the other students I found that the Clover
Club plant was located on the north side of Kaysville, just a few blocks away
from the school.  I figured that if I skipped the pep-assembly I could walk
over to the plant and beat other also trying to find work.  It took me longer
to get to the Clover Club plant than I had planned and other had cars to get
there.  Anyway when I got there a line of students was already formed that went
from the door to the plant clear across the parking lot.  My hart sunk and I
almost walked back to the school.  I then figured that I had an hour to get
back to the school before the school buses would be loading to take us home.  I
waited and the line moved slowly.  I decided that I would just have to hitch
hike home.  Before I got to the door someone brought application forms out to
us to fill out while waiting in line.  I was sure that with that many in front
of me that this was useless but I filled out the application and waited for my
turn to go in.  I went into the office of Francis Robinson, gave him my
application and was told that if I was selected they would call me.  I left and
was sure that was all there was to that.  I caught a couple of rides by hitch
hiking to Sunset and then walked on to home.  When I walked into the house
Mother said that a Mr. Robinson had called and wanted me to report to work the
next day as soon as school was over.  I worked for Clover Club Foods from that
time until the spring of 1957 when I graduated from high school and enlisted
into the U.S.A.F.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In July of 1957 I enlisted into the United States
Air Force.  When I had graduated from High School this spring I don’t think I
had every given any thought to what I wanted to do after graduating?  I had
never felt encouraged to get good grades in school and my grades indicated
that.  I had never thought of going to school as I know that there was no
financial aid for me.  I don’t think that anyone had ever mentioned working
towards scholarships.  Also I had never thought of collage being something to
do.  I didn’t like school and I didn’t want to be a Doctor or Lawyer.  I guess
I had never even thought of a profession.  As I thought about it after
graduation I considered automobile mechanic, as I liked working on cars but the
remembrance of Margaret’s first husband Dean and the dirt and grime that were
in his hands, totally turned me off.  I then thought of some of the experiences
Dad had mentioned about the aircraft repairs at Hill Air Force Base and
remembered of how clean things were kept.  As I thought about this, the thought
came to me that I could apply for Aircraft Mechanics Schooling with the Air
Force and find out if I would be excepted before I was enlisted.  I had enjoyed
R. O. T. C. while I had attended Ogden High School.  I visited with Bob about
my thoughts and he encouraged me.  Bob even went with me to see the enlistment
officer.  I took some test and was approved for the training that I wanted. 
Another thought that encouraged me was that I ether had to enlist in a Reserve
Unit, join a military Unit or be drafted into the Army.  I made the decision to
go for the Air Force.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I filled out the enlistment papers the
question was asked about having any heat problems.  When I indicated that I had
had a sun stroke in Idaho the enlistment officer about chocked.  He asked he asked
about the sun stroke.  I told him that when I was 12 years old some of the
family went out on a picnic and fishing trip.  I had set on a bridge for a
couple of hours trying to catch a fish.  When I finally did catch the fish I
went back to where we had eaten lunch and lay down on a blanket.  That was the
last I remembered for the next three days.  When I again opened my eyes I was
home in a bed and it was three days later.  A couple of days later when the
Doctor came to the valley, Mom took me to see him.  He said that I looked fine
now but he thought that I might have had a sun stroke.  The enlistment officer
ask if he had made a note of his assumptions in my medical record and I told
him that I didn’t think so as he was not sure just what had happened.  The
officer told me not to mention it in my enlistment paper and to forget about
it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I did pass the test to attend aircraft mechanic
school and so I joined the Air Force.  I went into active duty on the 22 of
July, 1957.  I was stationed at Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I flew from Salt Lake to Denver and then on to
San Antonio.  That was the first time I had flown in an airplane.  As we left
Salt Lake on Western Airlines “The Champaign Flight”, the stewardess served a
light snack and drinks.  I was offered some Champaign, which I had no idea what
it was.  I took a cup and tasted it.  It was horrible and tasted like bad salt
water.  That was the first lacquer I had ever tasted, except a taste of beer at
the slaughter house in Victor and I can also say it was the last I every
tasted.          At San Antonio we were met by Airman that took us to the base
in a bus.  When we got to Lackland the temperature was over 100 degrees by
7AM.  We know that because when ever the temperature reached 100 degrees a red
flag would be hoisted to let the drill sergeants know that the men could not be
drilled in that heat.  We were taken off the bus and immediately assigned to a
drill officer.  We were marched to the barber shop and received an airman’s
basic haircut, which is, all hair cut of as close to the scalp as the clippers
can cut.  We then picked up clothing and a mattress and went to the barracks
and assigned our bunk.  We were told how to make our bed and had 15 minutes to
practice and have it tight enough that a coin could be bounded off the bed and
caught in the air.  Our bunks were double heights and I got the lower bunk and
a Robert Frantum got the upper bunk.  We were next shown how to store our
personal items; soap, razor, shaving cream, after shave lotion, tooth brush and
past, shorts, tee-shirts, socks, handkerchiefs, bath towels, wash clothes and
any other personal items we might have, in a 3’ X 18” X 18” foot locker.  All
items had to be; on a white bath towel folded neatly with out any wrinkles or
creases showing, underneath the items; in perfect order and each item located
in a specified passion and place.  We were told that we could expect to have a
locker inspection at any time.  You therefore had to keep your footlocker in
perfect shape all the time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            A interesting thought I would like to enter here
is that the only time anyone was allow to smoke a cigarette was when the Drill
Sergeant said that the “Smoke Light was lit”.  That first day this command was
not given until late in the afternoon.  Many of the recruits were really having
trouble with going that long.  When it was finally given they were really
relieved.  Robert Frantom offered me a cigarette and when I told him no thanks,
he asked me why I didn’t smoke.  I briefly explained that my religion beliefs
did not allow us to smoke.  I never had to turn down another offer for Robert
would immediately tell the person that was offering me the cigarette that I
didn’t smoke.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was late afternoon, that first day, before we
were marched to the mess hall for something to eat.  There you had to walk
through the mess line at attention stepping sideways with your tray held out in
front of you.  You could pull your tray back towards you if you didn’t want
what they were going to serve you but we found that you had better be quick at
it or a spoon full of food would be thrown at you and if your tray wasn’t there
you had to clean it up.  You were able to relax a little while eating but as
soon as you were through eating you went out side.  We found that if you were
fast eating you could go outside and sit in the shade until most of the flight
came out.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first time we were lined up in flight
formation, the Drill Sergeant asked if any of us had been in R.O.T.C.  I had
taken R.O.T.C. while at Ogden High School so I raised my hand along with one
other recruit.  Big mistake! We were assigned to be road guards.  When the
flight was marching and came to a road to cross the road guards had to run out
and stop the traffic until the flight crossed and then had to run back into
their flight position.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One thing we quickly realized is that the D.I.
deliberately tried to break you.  Everything that you loved and enjoyed was
taken from you, including your dignity if you would let them.  I saw guys that
thought they were real tough guys be humbled until they were crying like a
baby.  A D.I. would look you in the eyes with his nose almost touching your
nose and call you every foul name he could think of and you just had to say Yes
Sir.  After a couple of days I was wondering what had ever possessed me to join
the military.  One day our Drill Sergeant had left our flight in charge of some
airman that had gone through Basic Training but were still waiting transfers. 
They were to drill us on our memorization of our name, rank, serial number and
chain of command.  They used the Drill Sergeant’s room and as recruits we lined
up out side the door.  We were to walk up to the door, knock and ask for
permission to enter.  Most of the time, the reply came back that “I can’t hear
you.”  As you entered the door was shut behind you and then you were
interrogated.  While waiting our turn to go in we would hear scuffling sounds
from in side the room.  Several recruits came out showing signs of having been
hit or slapped.  I remember of being apprehensive when it was my turn.  I
knocked hard and shouted loud as I waited to enter.  Upon entering I gave my
name rank and serial number.  The interviewing airman asked if I was related to
the Browning Arms Family and I replied “Yes Sir!”  I don’t know what his
background knowledge was to the Browning Arms was but what ever it was he just
said “Very good, you are excused.”  That was ok with me and I quickly did an
exit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            About the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> week as we
came out of breakfast and lined up in flight formation our Drill Sergeant told
us that we were going to spend the day in K.P.  He was then called over to talk
to another officer and when he came back and asked for 4 volunteers.  I figured
that there couldn’t be much worse than spending a day in mess detail so I
raised my hand.  When there four of us we were told to fall out and follow the
officer.  We were told to get in the back of a pickup truck and we were driven
out to a golf course.  When we were told to get out we were told to remove our
shirts.  We were informed that on the golf course there was no rank and we were
assigned to be caddies for four officers.  They also wore no rank
identification so we got to caddie for them.  They visited with us, bought us
sodas and candy bars and really treated us good.  At the conclusion of the golf
game they gave each of us a tip and thanked us.  We were returned to our
company area and taken to the mess hall for something to eat.  After finishing
we joined our company recruits and finished up the last of the KP assignment
which was less than an hour.  You should have heard the rest of the company
complain when they found out what we had been doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            About the end of the third week of training I
had decided that I had been the one to enlist, and had four years to serve so I
had better make the best of it.  Most mornings we would be up about 3AM and out
side in flight formation by 4AM.  One morning as we lined up in flight
formation we noticed that the red flag was already flying.  That meant that the
temperature was over 100 degrees and we could not be drilled in that heat.  We
were marched over to the mess hall for breakfast.  This day it was different
when we came out of the mess hall.  Normally we could have a few minutes to sit
in the shade while the rest of the flight came out.  This day we were met by
the Drill Sergeant as we came out the door and told to file in flight formation
in the drill field at parade rest.  We were standing in the direct sun light
and just stood there sweating.  When the last of our flight came out of the
mess hall and got into flight formation we were brought to attention.  We were
then brought back in to parade rest and stood there for what seemed like
forever while the Drill Sergeant went over and talked to other Drill Officers. 
When our Drill Sergeant did come back he brought us to attention and then let
us stand there for several minutes more.  We were then marched across the road
and of course the road guards (that was me) had to run out and stop traffic. 
We then marched to our barracks and were told to fall out and fall in flight
formation in the upper barracks.  At that point I passed out and fell down the
back of the man in front of me.  I was not completely unconscious as I know
what was happening to me.  They leaned me against a tree and poured water over
me.  I was then put in an automobile and driven to the hospital.  At the
hospital I was stripped and laid on a bed with sides, draped with a rubber
sheet.  Buckets of ice were then poured over me and then gallons of wood alcohol
were poured over that.  The ice was at the temperature of 32 degrees and the
alcohol brought it to -5 degrees.  I remember how cold it was and I started to
shake.  A nurse told me to quite shaking as I would cause my temperature to go
up.  A doctor asked me if I had every any thing like this happen to me before. 
I told him I had passed out from the heat when I was twelve years old.  I
remember it was so good to have them take me out of that bed and put pajamas on
me and put me in a bed with sheets.  The following morning someone tell me that
I would be going home.  I told them “No Way, they have me for four years and I
didn’t think they would let me go that easy.”  They told me to ask the Caption
when he came around.  When he did and I asked him he said that first off they
were going to court marshal me for falsifying my enlistment papers.  When I ask
him why?  He told me that I did not have it on my enlistment papers that I had
passed out when I was twelve.  I told him that the recruiting officer had told
me not to put it on my enlistment papers for it was not on my medical records. 
He then told me that they would not keep me in the service because the only
basic training base was Lackland and that if they put me back out I would come
right back in and the next time I would have no chance of living through it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remained in the hospital waiting for discharge
papers to be possessed.  While I was there Robert Frantom came into the
hospital.  Before Robert joined the Air Force he had been involved in a truck
motorcycle accident.  The truck had made an illegal turn and ran over Robert on
his motorcycle.  Robert was hospitalized and spent some time recovering.  He
was ok except that one mussel had been destroyed and removed, witch left some
deformities to the looks of his leg.  Robert told me that he had received a
large settlement from the trucking company’s insurance co. and with that
settlement he was able to put a large down payment on a farm.  He had got
married and then decided to join the Air Force.  After enlisting he found out
that his wife was pregnant.  He was sorry that he had enlisted but it was too
late to back out by then.  As we would drill Robert would begin to limp. 
Before long his limp would make him fall out of formation.  The drill sergeant
would scream at him to get back into line but in just a few minutes he would be
laging behind again.  When the sergeant would question him he would complain
that his leg was hurting.  Finally the sergeant sent him to the infirmary to
have it checked.  They could see the damage to his leg and give him some
exercises to do and sent him back.  That would last about a day and he was
again limping.  After the third or fourth time they sent him up to the hospital
and started processing papers to discharge him.  He was sent to our ward as
there were three of us that were being sent home due to heat strokes and two
others that were receiving dishonorable discharges for wetting the bed.  About
three days before Robert and my discharges came through we were sent back to
our company.  The company had already completed basic training and shipped out
for more training, so we just stayed in the barracks.  When we checked in with
the company clerk and I told him my name he said that was not my name for I had
already been sent to Shanock Illinois for aircraft mechanics training but then
he found by file in another drawer to be discharged.  We didn’t have much to do
and when we would go to the mess hall for meals the food would disuse us and we
just dumped it out and left.  We had got use to good food in the hospital and
this just wasn’t worth eating.  We walked two or three blocks to a drive in
café and would buy us something there.  One time as we were walking back Robert
said “Oh! I had better start limping as we were back in our company area.”  I
ask him if his leg really hurt him and he said it didn’t.  It was just an
excuse to get discharged and go back home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I enlisted I owned a 1952 Chevrolet. 
Expecting to be in the military for four years, I couldn’t see it just sitting
so I put it up for sell.  Each letter I received from Mom she would say that
she hadn’t sold my car yet.  When I found out that I was going to be discharged
I wanted to call Mom to tell her not to sell my car, but the Doctor wouldn’t
let me out of bed for three days.  As soon as he would let me, I ran to a phone
and call.  When Mom answered I said don’t sell my car.  She answered that it
sold last night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was told that I would be discharged and
paid travel pay, along with my back pay, I thought about hitch hiking home to
save money.  In a letter I sent to Mom, I mentioned that I might hitch hike
home but that I was not sure yet.  As the time came close to leaving I decided
to fly.  That also presented an interesting situation.  On the day I flew home
and got to the S.L. airport I called home.  No one answered so I took a bus to
Sunset.  I walked home and the house was locked up.  I went to a back bedroom
window and crawled in.  I decided to walk up to Bob and Carroll’s who at that
time were living in an apartment on Main Street.  I locked the door as I left
and waked up to their place but they were not home there.  I came back home and
crawled through the window again.  I decided to walk to Hendrick’s but when I
got there, no one was there.  So when I walked back home I again had to crawl
through the window to get in.  I decided that I wouldn’t lock the doors the
next time I left.  Just as I got in the house, the phone rang.  It was my
sister Margaret.  She just gasped when I answered the phone.  She said that Mom
and Dad had come up to Idaho Falls to visit and when they left she had walked
out to see them off.  She picked up the news paper as she returned to the house
and when she opened it up; on the front page was an article that said Three
Youth Died in an Automobile Accident in Southern Utah.  Kenneth Browning was
the driver of the car, a friend of Kenneth and a hitch hiker that wasn’t
identified yet.  Margaret had thought that maybe I was the hitch hiker and
names were just mixed up.  I told her that I didn’t think I was dead and that I
had flown home.  I told her that I would call Uncle Irven’s and let them know
so they could tell Mom and Dad when they stopped their.  When Uncle Irven
answered the phone he was so glad to hear my voice, for they had just came in
for seeing Mom and Dad off and had picked up the paper on the way back to the
house and saw the article.  As it was Mom and Dad know nothing of the article
until they got home and I told them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thanksgiving 1955</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Death of Myron, Lila and Grant, Margery, and Joyce (Myron
and Lila’s daughter) and Joyce’s husband Donnie Lee Parrott   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In 1954 my Uncle Myron Hill and Uncle Grant Hill
were working together as contractors in Buhl Idaho.  They were framing a house
when Uncle Myron reached above his head to pull a nail out of a board.  When
the nail released, the hammer fell breaking Myron’s glasses and pushing the
glass into his right eye.  This blinded Uncle Myron as ten years earlier almost
the same type of accident had blinded him in the left eye.  After several
months the Doctors felt like they could operate on the left eye and with newer
technology restored the sight to that eye.  As Uncle Myron was a veteran he
came to the Veterans Hospital in Salt Lake for the surgery.  The operations
went well and sight was restored to the left eye.  On Thanksgiving Day, 1955 Grant,
Margery, Joyce, Donnie and Lila came to spend Thanksgiving with Myron.  (Joyce
was Myron and Lila’s only daughter, she and Donnie had been married for just
six months.)  The doctor had told Myron that he was progressing very well and
could possibly be released about Thanksgiving, so they had counted on that and
all came to get him.  After one more examination the doctor said that he could
go home.  The Doctor cautioned them that they must be very careful in their
traveling as a jar could damage the eye and permanently blind Myron.  Mom and
Grandmother had been informed about Myron’s possible release so the told them
that if they could stop at our place in Ogden that Mom and Grandma would have
Thanksgiving Dinner ready for them.  When they arrived at our place, Uncle
Grant who was driving, stopped the car before driving into the driveway and
Uncle Myron was helped out and carefully assisted to the house as, as Uncle
Grant was fearful of the bump coming into the driveway.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was a wonderful and exciting Thanksgiving Day
to have family to share our meal with.  Roy had asked Mom if he might invite a
girl friend to also eat with us.  Of course Mom said it was fine.  As we all
set down to dinner and a prayer of Thanksgiving was offered, joyful talking continued. 
The girl that Roy had invited looked like she had missed too many meals and was
so thin.  In the seating arrangement the girl set next to Grandma.  As food was
passed and each of us took our portion this girl would either pass the food by
or only take a very small portion.  Grandma passed a dish of food to the girl
asking her if she would like some.  The girl replied that she wouldn’t.  To
every one’s surprise and astonishment Grandma replied, “Then why did you get
your plate dirty?”  Everything went dead silent.  Everyone was shocked for
Grandma to say something like that.  When the silence was realized everyone
begin to talk to cover the silence up.  It was very unlike Grandma but very
funny at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After eating a wonderful meal with all the
trimmings and deserts, Uncle Myron commented that if he never ate another meal
he was surely full now.  The afternoon had quickly gone by and Uncle Grant commented
that they should be going on as it would be late before they could get home. 
Again Uncle Grant drove the car out of the driveway and then Uncle Myron was
helped into the car.  Goodbyes were expressed and they drove off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            About 2 AM we were all awaken with a phone
call.  I remember Mom answering the phone and then gasping.  Grandma was soon
by her side as Mom explained that the call was from my Uncle Irven and he
reported that all six, Myron, Lila, Grant, Margery, Joyce and Donnie had been
killed in an automobile accident.  At this news Grandma screamed and fell to
the bed.  Heart medication had to be given her and a sedative was given to calm
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left early the next morning for Buhl.  By the
time we got there, Margie’s family had already arrived and was in Grant and
Margie’s home with the three children, (Floyd, Ginny Lee and Carol Lynn) of
Grant and Margie’s.  We stayed in Uncle Myron’s home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Details of the accident as we received them were
as follows.  As close as could be remembered Grant was driving.  As they drove
from Ogden to Buhl and shortly after passing Mountain Home there arose a wind
and sand storm.  A semi-truck driver testified that a car was following him as
he tried to drive through the storm.  He said that the car was following him as
their guide.  He said that visibility became worse and he used a flash light
and was following the center road marking in order to proceed.  After a short
time the storm increased until he could no longer see the center line and he
stopped.  He walked to the car behind him and told them that they would have to
wait for the storm to lift before they could proceed.  He walked back to his
cab and as he stepped up to open his door, the truck jumped forward.  He looked
to the back of the truck and all he could see was a large ball of fire.  He
pulled his truck forward a little way and then went back to the car behind
him.  He said the car had exploded into a ball of flames that were so hot that
he couldn’t get near it.  Behind that car was a large black Cadillac that had
the front grill smashed up but was at enough distant from the car, that was on
fire, that it didn’t catch on fire.  One girl had been thrown through the
windshield and was still lying on the hood of the Cadillac.  Within the car
still remained the driver and four other youth.  The driver was 21 years old
and the others were ages 19 to 21 years old.  All the youth were intoxicated. 
A doctor and his wife testified that they were traveling in the opposite
direction and saw the semi and car.  They said that just as they passed through
the sand storm, they saw a car approaching at a high speed and estimated it to
be close to 100 MPH.  The Doctor testified that he flashed his head light and
honked his horn to try to warn the oncoming car of the approaching danger.  He
said that he saw no recognition or signs of slowing as the black car entered
into the blowing sand storm.  I believe that the Doctor turned around and went
back to the accident and he treated the girl that was thrown through the windshield. 
None of the other youth suffered any serious injuries.  He said there was
nothing he could do for the victims in the other car for the fire was too hot
to approach the vehicle.  As it was, everyone in Uncle Grant’s car was burned
beyond recognition.  Mom’s testimony as to where each person was setting in the
car when they left our home, along with dental, medical and autopsy records
identified which remains were put in which casket.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We remained in Idaho until after the funerals
were held, before we came back home.  Legal and Court procedures went on for
several months but the driver of the Cadillac never spent as much as one hour
in jail for the six deaths that his intoxication caused.  Uncle Irven, brother
to Uncle Myron and Uncle Floyd was told that the Judge that was hearing the
case was a personal friend of the driver’s family.  On the final day of the
trial, Mom overheard the Mother tell another woman that they were glad to have
the trial over with and in celebration they were throwing a party that
evening.  The youth that was driving was given a 6 month sentence in prison but
was suspended under the supervision of his father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Although this was such a tragedy in our family’s
life there was also some blessings that resulted directly from it.  When this
took place Bob, my brother, was serving in the Air Force and was stationed in
England.  Mom contacted Bob and with the help of the Red Cross, Bob was sent
home for the funerals.  However, he did not get home until the day after the
funerals.  His enlistment in the Air Force would by completed with in three
months from his arrival home for the funerals, so the decision was made to just
transfer his remaining assignment to Hill Air Force Base.  As a result of Bob
being home, he had a great influence on my brother Roy.  Roy had dropped out of
school in his junior year of High School and had become inactive in the
Church.  I remember the first Saturday that Bob was home, he and Roy was in the
front yard wrestling when a pack of cigarettes fell out of Roy’s shirt pocket. 
The two of them just quite wrestling and look at the cigarettes.  Nothing was
said but Bob just walked to the house.  Roy grabbed the pack and jumped in his
car and was gone for the rest of the day.  He returned home in the early morning
hours drunk and went to bed.  Bob came in about 7AM and gently shook Roy and
asked him if he was going to attend Priesthood Meeting with him.  Roy opened
his eyes and questioned what!  Bob repeated his question and Roy sleepily
replied, I guess so.  Roy did get up and attended Priesthood meeting with Bob
and me.  Bob introduced Roy to several in the Ward and with some other
experiences Roy returned to full activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When things were financially settled with the
death of Grandma Children, Grandma received some insurance money.  With part of
the money Grandma, a couple of years later, put a down payment on a home in
Sunset for my mother, on condition that Grandma’s name be put on the title and
it would be her home also as long as she lived.  Grandma lived with us until
December 31, 1958, when she died of cancer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom also received Uncle Myron’s 1952 Green
Plymouth.  We had not had a car since Dad had wrecked his pickup when coming
home from Montana.  That wreck was the cause of our family moving to Utah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember graduating from Davis High School in
Kaysville Utah, 1957.  Not for any achievement that I had earned, but mainly
the following day.  I had finally Graduated and did not have to go to school
any more.  What an exciting thought.  My next thought was, now what am I going
to do?  I don't know that I had ever thought about that.  While in school I
only remember knowing that I had to remain in school until I had completed 12th
grade.  I never remember Mom or Dad talking to me about the importance of
schooling.  Dad only graduated from the 6th grade and that was pretty good for
his day.  My mother had quit High School in the 10th grade because of a teacher
she had feelings with.  I think Rich graduated but he said they did that just
to get rid of him.  Margaret quit school in the 10th grade.  Bob graduated,
then went into the Air Force and made it a career as a baker.  Roy dropped out
of school in the 10th grade.  Having completed 12 years of required schooling,
I felt pretty good.  But now what?  I had a good part time job at Clover Club
Foods in Kaysville, but I couldn't think of doing that the rest of my life.  My
scholastic grades and goals hadn't leaned towards collage, plus what would I go
into.  I don't think I had ever thought about &quot;Now What&quot;?  In school
you never wanted to go into the Counselors Office that meant you were in for
trouble.  In fact I remember when our oldest Daughter came home to tell us that
we and she had an appointment to talk to the School Counselor; I wanted to know
what she had done to be in trouble.  I had never heard that counselors were
there to give you guidance and advice as to your educational goals.   I had
always been good in mechanical abilities.  My aptitude test had indicated that
I was mechanical abilities and I had enjoyed Auto Mechanic Classes, but I
remembered Dean, Margaret's 1st husband.  He was a mechanic and when he would
come for dinner with our family, his hands were so greased stained, and I
didn't want my hands looking like that.  I then thought of Dad's work on
airplanes and how clean they kept them.  I decided that I might like working on
them.  I visited with Bob about that and he felt the military was a good place
to get an education for a career.  He went with me to see the Recruiting
Officer, who really thought I should make that choice.  I decided if I really
had good chances to get in to Aviation Mechanics.  The recruiting officer said
that I could take a aptitude test and if passed I had a 90% chance of getting
what I wanted.  I passed the test, so filled out the recruiting papers.  There
arose a concern when the recruiting officer read my answer to the question
about ever having trouble with heat or being in the sun.  I had answered yes. 
He looked at that answer and questioned me.  I told him that when I was 11
years old, I had been out fishing and set in the sun for a long time.  I came
back to where the car was parked and laid down on a blanket.  That was the last
thing I remembered for three days.  The following Thursday, for that is when
the Doctor came to the Valley, my Mother took me to see the Doctor.  He could
only guess that I may have had a sun stroke, but could not tell by then.  The
Recruiting Officer ask if he had indicated anything on my medical records and
when I told him that I didn't think so, he changed my answer and said not to
worry about it.  I was inducted into the United States Of America Air Force on
July 19th 1997, and went to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonia, Texas.  I
made my first mistake the first day we arrived at the base.  Our Training
Officer ask if any one had been in the R. O. T. C.?  Two of us, mistakenly,
raised our hands and from then on were assigned as Road Guards.   The Road
Guards have the responsibility of going out and stopping traffic any time the
Flight was to cross a road.  The temperature was over 100 degrees most mornings
by 7 AM.  We could not be drilled in that heat, but after being there three
weeks, one morning as we came out from breakfast, they had us form in Flight
Formation on the parade field.  We stayed at Parade Rest until everyone had
came out from breakfast.  We were then brought to attention, then back to
Parade Rest, where we stood for over an hour.  We then were brought back to
Attention and marched across the road to the barracks and of course the Road
Guards had to run out and back to stop the traffic.  As I came back to
formation, the command was given to Fall Out and Fall In formation in the
barracks.  Well, I fell out ok, right down the back of the airman in front of
me and they picked me up and took me to the hospital.  I was later told that
when I came into the hospital I had a tempter of 106 degrees.  They stripped me
of my clothing and put me on a bed with sides.  The bed had been covered with a
rubber sheet, making it a large tub.  They then covered me with buckets of
crushed ice, then adding gallons of alcohol. I was later told that this
solution would drop the tempter below freezing.  I remember that I was cold and
began to shake.  A nurse told me not to shake as that would cause my tempter to
rise.  It sure felt good when they removed me from that tub, dried me off, put
some warm pajamas on me and put me into a bed.  The next morning as I woke up two
other airman came over to my bed and asked how I was feeling.  In talking to
them they told me that I would be going home.  I told them that I didn’t believe
that as I had joined for four years.  The one said no I would be given a
medical discharge and released.  When I still questioned him he told me to ask
the Caption when he came around to check me.  A short time later the Doctor (a
Caption) came by to see how I was doing.  I told him what the other airman has
said and he agreed.  He told me what my tempter was when I came in. He said
that I was very close to the Pearly Gates and that they weren’t sure if they
could save my life or not.  He told me that if I were to return to training
that within 24 hours I would be back in the hospital and there was little if
any chance that they could save me again.  He added that the Air Force didn’t
want to pay for my funeral.  I then asked him if I could get out of bed to make
a telephone call.  He told me that I was to stay completely down in bed for
three days and then he would decide if I could get up.  He told me that I had
suffered a heat stroke and it was not unusual for a person to contact pneumonia
after a heat stroke.  Well, for three days I stayed in bed.  On the fourth day
the Captain said I could get up.  I immediately dressed and went to the
telephone off and called my Mother.  When she answered I said, “Mom, don’t sell
my car”.  She said, “We sold it last night.”  It was about another three weeks
when I was sent home.  I debated who I would travel home.  The Air Force would
pay me the air fare to flight home and I could use that money however I
wanted.  If I hitch hiked I could keep most of the money, bus would be cheaper
than fighting, but fighting would be the fastest.  I had written Mom and told
her my thinking.  When I was finally released I wanted to get home as quickly
as I could so I flew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I got into Salt Lake I found a bus going to
Ogden so road it to Sunset.  I walked down to the house but found no one at
home.  I went to the rear bedroom window and as normal it was up a little for
ventilation.  That made easy access.  After a few minutes I decided to walk up
to Bob and Carroll’s so when I left the house I locked the door after me.  When
I got to their place they were not home, so I returned and again entered the
house by the bedroom window.  I then decided to go over to my friends, Hendrick
Brandenberg, but no one was at their house either.  I returned home and again
had to enter through the bedroom window.  The next time I left the house I
didn’t lock the door.  Just as I got in from Hendrick’s the phone rang.  I
answered it and it was Margaret.  She was almost in a panic.  She said that Mom
and Dad had just left her house in Idaho Falls.  She had gone outside to see
them off and as she returned to her house she picked up the news paper.  When
she opened the paper, on the front page it read “Kenneth Browning Killed in an
Automobile Accident in Southern Utah”.  “There were three local youth and a
unnamed hitch hiker in the car when the car rolled over.  The two local youth
and the hitch hiker were ok but the driver, Kenneth was killed.”  Because know
one know just how I was coming home and I had suggested that I might hitch
hike, Margaret thought that names might have gotten mixed up.  I assured her
that it was not me.  Margaret said that Mom and Dad planned on stopping at
Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice’s in Pocatello, so I told her that I would call there
to let them know that I was ok.  When I called Aunt Bernice answered and when I
told her who I was she said “Thanks goodness!”  She said that Mom and Dad had
just drove away and as they came back to the house they picked up their paper. 
As they read the article they debated as to what to do for they had came to the
same conclusion as Margaret.  However Uncle Irven had just said that the news
cannot release the name of a victim until next of kin has been notified.  Mom
and Dad had not seen the paper nor did they lesson to the news so they had no
knowledge of what Margaret, Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice had been concerned
about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I returned home from the Air Force I had no
car, no job, and no plans for the future and very little money.  I used what cash
I had got out of the sale of my car, which was very little and bought a 1949
Desoto.  That was hard for me to except for I had a 1952 Chevrolet that was my
pride and joy in my senior year at High School.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had been going with a girl from Roy (Sharon)
before I went into the Air Force.  When I got back home we started dating
again.  I had bought her a crystal necklace and ear ring set before leaving
Texas. I gave that set to her on our first date after returning home.  I looked
for any kind of a job but just couldn’t find anything. I felt that I still
wanted to pursue a career as a aircraft mechanic and I found out that Idaho
State offered a course in Aircraft Mechanics. I made the decision and in the fall
of 1957 I moved to Pocatello.  I went up to Idaho State University to register
in the course, however, I was told that I was too late to register and would
have to wait until mid-term.  I thought about working for Rich but he was
having a slow period and did not need help.  I talked to Uncle Irven and Aunt
Bernice and they said I would be welcome to live with them if I could find
work.  After several days of looking I walked into a Service Station and talked
to the owner Merlin G-----.  He said that he did need help but I would have to
work on Sunday.  My schedule would be Sunday through Thursday.   That didn’t
set very well with me but I felt desperate and told him that I needed the job. 
I went to work for him the next day.  I worked the first Sunday, business was
slow and I had my scriptures with me that I could read but I felt terrible.  By
the end of my shift I determined that I couldn’t do that.  Monday morning when
I came into work I went into the office and told Merlin that I would have to
quite.  I apologized that I had accepted the position but I just couldn’t do
it.  I told him I would continue to work until he could find a replacement. 
Merlin wasn’t pleased with me. A couple of hours later he called me back into
his office and said that he had a man that worked nights that wanted more hours
and he would work the Sunday shift so I could work Monday through Friday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had a couple of interesting experiences while
working there that I want to include.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My work duties would start when I first arrived
at work.  I would first clean the rest rooms and then start servicing the
customers that came in.  At that time there was no self service but the
attendant filled the gas tank, checked the oil, checked the tires and washed
the windows along with anything else the customer would like you to do for them. 
We also did mechanical work on the cars.  One morning when I arrived at the
service station, the boss was already working on a motel T Ford replacing the
spark plugs and the points in the distributer.  In order to get to the
distributer you had to remove part of the grill and the radiator.  What a job
that turned out to be.  Both the boss and I worked on it along with taking care
of the drive in customers.  We worked the whole day taking the thing apart,
reassembling it, replacing the radiator and refilling the radiator, then trying
to start it.  No luck!  At one point when the boss was cussing he looked at me
and said “Ken it is just as bad to think it as to say it.”  I am not sure that
is true but I did think bad thoughts.  That evening the boss continued to work
on the car and sometime late in the evening when they got it put together it
ran just fine.  They were not sure what they did correct this time over all the
other times but it worked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another morning I came in and picked up my
cleaning supplies, then starting toward the restrooms. Merlin stopped me and
asked me if I would clean the inside windows of the truck that set outside of
the garage.  He had serviced it but hadn’t washed the inside windows.  I
grabbed the glass supplies and went out.  When I opened the driver’s door, on
the oppose side set a bobcat.  It just looked at me so I reached in and washed
the left half of the inside window.  The bobcat just watched me so I then went
to the right side and did the same to the left side.  After finishing I went
back into the station and got my restroom supplies and start to that.  Merlin
stopped me and asked if I had washed the windows.  I said that I had and he
said the inside windows?  I said yes and he asked how I had done it.  When he
had tried to wash the windows the bobcat wouldn’t let in the cab at all.  He
just wanted to see what my reaction would be.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A short time later the same man
came in to get gas.  I went out to service the truck.  The fellow got out of
the cab and went in to talk to Merlin, leaving his wife and the bobcat inside
the truck.  It was a warm day so the windows were rolled down.  The bobcat
climbed out the window and onto the hood.  He was being restrained by a pet
leash.  A salesman, that we didn’t really like, asked the wife if he could hold
the leash.  She let him and as the bobcat got more freedom it jumped down and
started to look around.  The salesman just followed letting the bobcat go where
he wanted.  By this time several by passers gathered out of curiosity to watch
the bobcat.  The bobcat came into the office and finding a cabinet door open
went inside the cabinet and lay down.  The salesman didn’t want it to do that
so he pulled on the leash.  The bobcat instantly struck out with front claws,
leaving large gashes in the cabinet door.  Instantly the salesman dropped the
leash and backed off.  The bobcat stayed in there until the owner was ready to
leave.  He just grabbed the leash, drug the bobcat out scratching and hissing,
through it into the truck and they left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had a recently widowed lady that
would come in for service on her car.  Her husband had always wanted to own a
Cadillac and had bought a beautiful white one shortly before he died.  It was
her baby and she took such good care that it was hard to service for fear that
your hands weren’t clean enough to touch it.  When I would service it and had
it raised on the rack, she would get under it with a clean white towel and wipe
off the chases.  One morning she had came in for gas.  Shortly after she left
the station it started to rain.  She returned because she hadn’t had enough
time to get home to park it in the garage so wanted to pay me to service it
just to get it inside.  We weren’t busy so I let her park in side and didn’t
charge her.  Whenever I serviced it or even checked the oil for her I would
always drape the car with a clean blanket.  In talking to other employs they
had the same concerns and took extra care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>One winter morning I had a customer
come in with a flat front tire on a fairly new Buick.  I went out to remove the
tire and as I lifted the tire of the rim my right foot slipped on some ice.  I
was thrown backwards with the tire on top of me.  As I tried to get up but my
leg wouldn’t straighten out.  In fact the muscles and tendons were so tied up that
the knot in the back of the knee was stretching my Levis tight around my leg.  
I hopped into the office and when Merrill called and got me an appointment with
a Doctor he know.  I went to the address and found that it was a chiropractor. 
I went in and he was expecting me so had me go right into his adjustment room. 
He was looking at my leg, holding it by my heel and feeling the bulge when he
suddenly jerked my leg straight out.  Who did that hurt but then he wrapped my
knee area with an elastic bandage and had me wrap it for a few days and all was
well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Another cold day with the weather
being very bad, Merrill and I just sat around without anyone coming in for
anything.  About 10AM Merrill decided that he had paper work at his house that
he needed to work on.  He told me that if things picked up I should call him
and he would come back to the station.  Things continued to be the same for
some time.  Finally a semi-truck and trailer pulled in.  When I went out to
help him the driver asked if we gave a cash discount.  I told him that we gave
S&amp;H Green Stamps but he said he didn’t want those, so call Merrill to see. 
Merrill said that we could give him .015 cents per dollar instead of the
stamps.  He had four 100 gallon settle tanks plus the main fuel tank on the
truck with all being quite low on fuel.  I started filling them.  The pumps
only registered 99 gallon and then started over at 0.  I thought I was keeping
track each time the pump reset.  About that time customers started coming in
one after another.  I was trying to help all of them and keep track of the
semi’s gas.  When I had him full I had to calculate his discount.  I questioned
one of the pumps reset but the driver assured me that it had only rolled over 4
times.  I had customers in the office while I was figuring the discount and the
phone also ringing.  The driver paid me in cash and wanted a receipt without
the discount on it.  I wrote it up and he left.  Within a few minutes the
office cleared out, customers quite coming in and it went as dead as it had
been earlier.  I set at the desk looking over the copy of the receipt that I
had given the truck driver and realized that I had moved the decimal point
wrong and had given the driver a .15 cents per discount.  When Merrill came
back later in the afternoon I told him of my mistake and told him that I would
have to pay for the error.  The next morning when I came to work Merrill
informed me that when he took the final fuel reading that we were short 100
gallons.  The pump had rolled over one more times than I had counted.  Merrill
told me he would have to charge me for the lost gas but that he would let me
have it at his cost.  That still hurt but it was my fault.  Merrill also called
his attorney and told him what had happened.  With the receipt copy having the
trucks ID number on it, by after noon the attorney had the name and address of
the trucking company.  That night I wrote a letter to the company explaining
what had happened.  I told them that I had made the mistakes but asked the
driver if he would help me out with the cost.   A few days later, when I came
to work, Merrill hand me a letter from the trucking company.  They said that
the driver denied the amount of gas and that he denied that I had given him any
discount at all.  I figured that I was just out.  That evening when I returned
home, to Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice Hill’s home, there was a letter addressed
to Ken Browning, no return address on the envelope, with the cash money and a
note which just read “Shut your dammed mouth about this.”  We never did figure
out how the driver found my address at Uncle Irven’s home but I was happy to
have got the money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I worked at the station until the middle of
December when I went back to Idaho State to see about registering.  I was
informed that the Aircraft Mechanic class I was interested in taking was a full
year class and could only be register for in the fall.  I decided that I didn’t
want to stay in Pocatello that long so I quit my job and went home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got home just before Christmas.  The night
that I got home from Idaho a girl called me.  She did not tell me who it was
but she said she thought that I should know that Sharon was going steady with
another boy.  That didn’t surprise me as she had quite answering my letters
shortly after I had gone to Idaho.  My only regret was that she kept the set of
jewelry I had given her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                </span> From
as close as I can figure, Larry Braithwaite &amp; I were sustained as
counselors, in the Mound Fort 1<sup>st</sup> Ward Bishopric, to Delmar M.
Moulton, on October 29<sup>th</sup>, 1966.  I was sustained as 1<sup>st</sup>
counselor and Larry as 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor.  We were not set apart at that
time, as we were having a Stake Conference in two weeks and President Wimmer
thought it would be nice to have an Apostle set us apart.  Apostle Sterling W
Seal would be our visiting authority.  However when President Wimmer asked him
about doing it, he said that was his responsibility.  For many years I had unkind
feelings towards Elder Seal because in between the morning session and the
afternoon sessions was held meeting for the Stake Presidency, High Counsel, and
Bishoprics.  Elder Seal really laid it on us, bawling us out for our low
percentages.  He said that if we were to be paid a million dollars a year, we
would all work untold hours for it.  He emphasized “that the Lord agreed to
give us all that he has”, and we were not working hard enough for our pay. 
Although, all in attendance was discouraged after that meeting, in reality he
was right, and we needed to work harder.  I believe I have grown enough to
forgive him and realize that he was only trying to encourage our Stake.  But
the discouragement seems to hang on to our stake and I think our percentages
continued on the down slop.  The program at that time is that a General
Authority only came to a stakes conference every other time or every six
months.  However, on the next Stake Conference, Elder Paul Dunn of the
assistances to the Twelve came.  He was not expected by the Stake President
until that Sunday morning.  We enjoyed the morning session and then at the in
between meeting Elder Dunn really lifted us up.  I remember that the afternoon
session was great and we all looked forward to it.  As it concluded and
President Wimmer had announced the closing hymn that Elder Dunn leaned over and
whispered something to him.  As the Brother was coming to the stand to give the
closing prayer, President Wimmer stood and announced that Elder Dunn would like
all Stake Presidency, High Counsel and Bishoprics to please go to the cry room
after the prayer.  We were there only for a few minutes as Elder Dunn expressed
his love for each of us and that he just wanted to shake hands once more with
each of us before we left.  It was surly the cry room because there wasn’t a
dry eye in the group.  We left that conference ready to take on the world.  I
think I will always remember that experience.  I gained a love for Elder Dunn
that I will always cherish. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After Larry and I had been called and sustained
and the meeting ended, we went to the office with Bishop Moulton.  There Bishop
Moulton gave us our assignments and told us that the biggest problem the Ward
faced was financial.  He showed us bills that were past due for over thirteen
years, a letter from the power company stating that they had never had to shut
the power off to a L.D.S. building before but that if we didn’t get some
payments in they would have to shut our power off.  After counseling, prayer
and fasting we determined that we needed to be up front with the members of the
Ward.  We composed a letter indicating the financial condition of the ward.  We
then divided the ward membership up into four groups, those families that could
afford to pay $500 and had the faith to do so, those that we felt that asking
for that much would be a great hardship on them and so ask if they could pay
$250, those that occasionally contributed to the budget and we asked them to
pay $100, and the rest we asked them to please pray and try to help with the
Ward Budget in whatever amount they could.  The first group we asked them to
attend a special budget meeting, in which we made the request.  The rest of the
families we sent letters to with our request for help with the budget.  On Sunday
morning we had tow widows approach us as they came to church and said they felt
hurt that they had not been invited to the $500 meeting.  The one did donate
the $500, but the other always wanted to but she couldn’t drive because of age
and health and just didn’t remember to go to the bank to get it.  I think she
died always wanting to pay the $500.  Donations began to come in.  Then we
received a notice that we had a savings account at Commercial Security Bank. 
Bishop Moulton came to me with the letter as I worked for the bank.  He asked
me to check it out for it was against the direction of the First Presidency for
a Ward to have a savings account.  I found that the account had been opened
over 13 years earlier while the Ward was trying to get the funds to start a new
building.  Evidently the Bishopric was reorganized and when things were turned
over no one remembered the money in savings.  It was a sizable amount of money
that had been deposited and it had accumulated a sizable amount of interest. 
Bishop Moulton wrote the Presiding Bishopric, informing them of the savings
account and was told that we could us the money to help with our Ward
indebtedness.  A short time later we received a letter from the Presiding
Bishopric stating that the church would like to get rid of any excess property
that was not being used for facilities.  We had a lot across the road from the
chapel that had a small home on it that we were renting out and it provided a
little income that went towards the Ward Budget.  We had Even Green, who was a
Realtor, put the lot and house on the marked and he soon had it sold.  That
money also went into our budget fund.  We were feeling pretty good at the
progress that we were making, when we received the announcement of the Temple
to be built in Ogden.  When we got our assessment we again used the lists that
we had made up in the first budget request and ask for donations to the Temple
fund.  We were the first ward in our Stake to pay the Temple Assessment in
full.  We had many wonderful experiences as we served in the Bishopric.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In the fall of 1968 Larry and Tammy purchased a
lot in Ogden Valley and started building a home there.  We also found a 10 acre
lot in Eden that we began to negotiate with a realtor on.  We came to an
agreement on a trade of our house for a clear title to one acre and the balance
to be paid in payments.  After setting the price on our home and the price per
acre for the lot, the realitor came back and cut our price by $1,000.  After
considering it, we agreed to the reduced.  We knew that Mae’s Uncle Dale and
Aunt Ester had just moved into a new home, so we asked if we might rent there
old home in Clearfield until we got a home built on our new lot.  They agreed
and in early February 1969 we began to move to Clearfield.  We had taken the
first load of furniture to Clearfield and were loading a seconded and final
load when the realtor came and said they couldn’t give us what we wanted for
our home.  I asked him what he was suggesting and he cut our price in half.  I
told him I wouldn’t do it as we had agreed on a price.  He said we hadn’t
signed and agreement yet and besides we were already almost moved out.  I told
him I would let the bank repossess the house before I would let him steel it
from me.  He then demanded that I pay him for his expenses and I told him to
forget it.  We went a head and moved to Clearfield and decided to rent our
house for now.  (That became a different story.)</p>

shortly before she died.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As mom’s Alzheimer’s disease continued to get
worse, we finally had to put her into a rest home.  She really resented it and
would not settle down.  I seemed to be the one that had the most influence with
her so the nurses at the home would call me when they couldn’t handle her. 
That was often, sometimes two or three times a night.  Night was the worse. 
One night about 2 am they called me and said that she had a wet towel and was
flipping people.  When I got there she had them at a stand off.  As soon as she
saw me she said, “get me out of this <i>blank ed e blank </i>place.  I said we
should go to her room to talk about it.  She immediately recoiled and said that
I was in it with all the rest of them and if I came close to her she would pop
my eyes out with the towel.  I kept my distance but continued to talk to her. 
I finally told her I was tired of standing.  She said she was tired also so I
suggested that we find some place to sit.  I suggested that in the front
entrance were some couches we could set on.  When we got there she set on one
side of the hall and I on the other.  As we visited she said “I can’t hear you.” 
Soon she repeated it again and I told her it was because she was on one side of
the hall and I was on the other.  She said “Well come over here.”  I replied
that I didn’t dare because she said she would flip me.  She said “Oh I won’t,
so come on over.”  It was interesting that Mom was 92 years old at this time
and the nursing staff couldn’t handle her.  After a few more minutes of
visiting with her she said that she needed to go to the bathroom.  When I
suggested that we got to her room she said that she didn’t think she could wait
that lone.  A nurse was close by and I asked her if there was a bathroom near. 
She took us into an exercise room near and there was a bathroom there.  Mom
went in and she locked the door behind her.  When she tried to come out she couldn’t
open the door.  She immediately went out of control and said that we had locked
her in.  the nurse ran for the keys but couldn’t find them.  Mom started
banging on the door with a crutch and said she would break the door down.  I
kept telling her that she had locked the door and she would have to unlock it. 
She finally realized what I was saying and asked how to unlock it.  I told her
there was a small knob on the center of the door knob that she had to turn, I
was hoping that it was right.  She turned the knob and opened the door.  By
then she was tired and I got her to got to her room and got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stories of John / the 5 points mall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One day I was coming into the Main Court area of
the Mall and I saw the mall manager trying to stop a boy that was riding his
bike through the mall.  Riding bikes or any other wheeled item, except wheel
chairs, is of course forbidden in the mall.  The boy turned and saw Russ trying
to catch him, he just took off faster for the South Exit.  He had just passed
the center of the mall as I came out.  I took off after him and as he reached
the South doors I grabbed him by the neck and the seat of his bike.  It
surprised him so bad that he just about hyper ventilated.  I don’t think he had
even seen me but only Russ, so when I grabbed him it was a total shock to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another evening I had stayed late with some work
and as I walked towards the North Doors of the mall about 10 teenagers came in
the mall, some with bicycles.  I stopped them and told them to take the bikes
back out.  They just laughed at me and said lets see you make us.  I know that
I had no chance of physically handling the situation so I just grabbed my radio
off my belt and spoke into it saying, “Call 911 and get the police to the mall
as fast as they can get here.”  At that all the youth turned and ran to the
doors and was gone.  They had no idea that the mall office was already closed
and know one even received my radio call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Shortly after starting work for the mall I had a
project that I needed extra help with.  I called a temporary employment service
and had them send out a couple of temporary helpers.  One of the fellows really
impressed me with his work.  He would always follow instructions and if he
finished a task while I was away he would look for something else that he could
accomplish.  Therefore each time that I had a project that I needed extra help
with I would call the temporary service and ask for John Conrade.  Later it was
decided that I needed a full-time worker and I asked management if I could
hirer John?  Russ was not in favor because John wore long hair.  After
interviewing several I again asked to hirer John.  Russ finally consented, so I
called the temporary service and got their permission for us to hire John.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            A couple of weeks after I hired John he came to
work with his hair cut.  I didn’t say anything so he asked if I had noticed
that he had cut his hair.  I told him that I had, but felt that it was his
business.  He told me that his father was a Swede and his mother was an
American Indian.  His mother had died just one year ago and it was the custom
of her tribe that the men of the family not cut their hair for one year, so out
of respect for his mother he had followed that tradition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            John and I grew a great friendship as we
associated together.  One thing that I quickly realized was that John was a
master of Marshall Arts.  One day as we were walking through the Mall, suddenly
John turned and kicked a fellow I the mid section.  As the fell tried to grasp
for air he asked John why he did that.  John explained that he just
instinctively reacted when out of his eye he saw someone reaching for him from
the rear.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Experiences while serving in the Bishopric in Erda.</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While we lived in Erda I was called to serve in
the Bishopric with LaDell Brown and Cordal Gull.  Once when it was my turn to
conduct Sacrament meetings for the month, I called Dave Larson, who we know
while living in Taylorville, and had asked if he and his daughter Jullie could
be guest speakers in our ward in Erda.  They accepted the assignment and came
on the assigned date.  At that time we still held each meeting separate and so
it had been a long day.  We had been in extra meetings that day and we had held
several interviews.  It was a hot summer day so as the meeting progressed I
became very sleepy.  I managed to stay awake while Jullie gave her talk but
while Dave was speaking I went out.  Bishop Brown also fell asleep and Dave
made some comment of an activity he and I had worked on together and as he did
he turned to look at me.  Mae said that when he saw me and the Bishop asleep
his mouth dropped.  Dave had trouble getting his composure back to continue his
talk.  Dave and I had become good friends before that but I don’t believe we
have ever spoken to each other since.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One Sunday afternoon Bishop Brown felt that we
should go as a Bishopric to visit a couple that lived in our Ward.  When we
came to visit only the wife was at home.  Both of these two had been
excommunicated for living together before they were legally married.  The women
had been married previously in the Temple and her husband started stepping out
on her.  But the worst thing is that he forced sexual relation on their teenage
daughter.  For this the woman was granted a civil divorce.  After her husband
was found guilty of his sex crimes he was excommunicated from the Church. 
However the woman, before the civil divorce was granted became involved with
another man, the one she was currently married to, and they began to live
together.  For this reason they were both excommunicated.  Bishop Brown talked
to the Sister about coming back into activity and preparing their lives to
receive the eternal blessings.  She told him that she was ok with the decision
that she and her husband were excommunicated but that she could not understand
why she could not get a Temple Divorce from her first husband.  I asked her
what she meant.  She said that she wanted nothing to do with the Church so long
as she was still sealed for eternity to her first husband.  I told her that if
she remembered the day that she and her first husband were married they were
sealed together for eternity, so long as the two of them were true to the
covenants they made that day.  When her husband committed the sins, she said he
had, that automatically broke that covenant with the Lord.  I explained that the
Church does not give Temple Divorces.  But that if she and her husband repented
and became worthy to go to the Temple to have their marriage sealed for time
and all eternity, then the paper work could be sent into the First Presidency
and He through revelation could grant a Temple Clearance, allowing them to
again enter the Temple so that they could be sealed together.  Whether or not
they ever made that effort I do not know as we moved from the area shortly
there after.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Commercial Security Bank</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In 1962 I accepted employment with Commercial
Security Bank in Ogden.  When I started there were two of us that operated data
processing equipment.  At that time we used I.B.M. Electronic Accounting
Machines.  The two of us rotated shifts each week.  The morning shift started
at 5AM and finished when all the Real Estate and Bank Loans transaction were
posted, balanced, statements and all reports and notifications were printed and
delivered to the various departments.  The evening shift started at 5PM Monday
thru Thursday and 6PM on Fridays and finished when you had all the Demand
Deposit (Checking Accounts and in reality about 1/3 of the total accounts)
balanced posted, reports delivered to all departments and all scheduled
statements printed.  At first it was not unusual for us to work 50 to 60 hours
a week and we were paid for 40 hours, plus any thing over 40 hours we got paid
at a decreasing pay scale.  Your total hours was divided into your weekly
salary and then divided by 2 and that was your hourly pay for all hours over
40, until your total hours divided into your hourly wage reached minimum wage
and then you received 1 ½ of minimum for your overtime hours.  Because of the
requirement to have all work completed and to be totally in balance before
quitting, I often reached that wage on my pay.  However after a few months I
became so furmilure with the operation that I would run two or three steps
simultaneously and reduce the total time until I was getting through in 6 to 7
hours per day.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            About 1 ½ years after I started working for the
bank, we converted the prosing from the E.A.M. equipment to an IBM 1401
Computer.  This was the first 1401 computer that came west of the Mississippi. 
We thought it was great!  It had 13k of memory, required a room about 30’ X 30’
that had a removable flooring in it so that the cables that connected each of
the components  to the other to hidden for looks and also to eliminate a
tripping hazard, had to be air-conditioned, humidity controlled and dust free. 
Only the operator, had to ware special shoes, was allowed to come into the area
while the computer was in operation, as a static electrical jump would cause a
loss in memory.</p>
