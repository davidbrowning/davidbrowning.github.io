<p class=MsoNormal>            I didn’t sleep very well again last night.  I
will be glad to get a new bed, but am concerned as to the bed being the problem
or not.  Mae got up and made “Oh Henry Bars” for the Elder’s at District
meeting this morning.  I took the computer over to the Elder’s home and hooked
it up to their land line and it worked ok, so it has to be something with our
line.  I called the phone repair before we left, but they called Marlyn while
we were gone and she didn’t understand that the problem is in the inter-net
service, so they thought they had the problem resolved.  We attended the
District meeting and as always enjoyed being with the Elders.  After the
meeting, we were talking to Elder Hayman and he said there are 132 known
dialects here in the Philippines.  Each dialect is a complete different
language, much as the Indian tribes in the Americas.  We got letters in the
mail from Marge and Gary and from Lois (Porter) Falck.  We stopped on the way
home at the computer shop and pulled off e-mails from Jeff, Deanna and
Georgia.  There is one from Roy &amp; Linda, but we couldn’t get it off.  Marlyn
told us that the phone co. had called and the phone was working, but as soon as
I tried to use the inter-net, it quite again.  I had to call Sister Clark, on
our cell phone and ask her to call in to the phone repair again for me.  Sister
Clark called back and talked to Mae about speaking in Auxiliary meeting next
Saturday.  We also went over to President Parardan and ask Sister Parardan if
she could arrange for a special musical number for the Auxiliary meeting.  On
the way back, we got gas in the car and another P300 of time for our cell
phone.  President Nieto stopped by to be sure that we got an invitation to the
Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch Social.  He said that they, as a Branch Presidency,
had visited over 20 less active families, last night and invited them to the
social.  We took a nap before going to the social.  The social was well planned
and well attended.  At the beginning President Michol dedicated a special song,
that he sang, to Mae &amp; I, he has a beautiful voice.  They also had music,
games, talent entertainment, relays and box lunches.  We participated in the
relays.  President Nieto had bought special dinners for the Elder’s, Mae and I,
but it was still food that was not packaged or in a bottle, therefore we could
not eat it according to the Mission Rules.  We left at that point not knowing
how to handle the food situation.  We came home feeling very confused as to
right and wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I’m not sleeping very well and waking early. 
Marlyn Dator came to wash our car.  We decided to go to Tarlac to look for a
bed.  We went to Saver’s Mart on the main highway in Tarlac.  They carry a Sealy
Posturepedic mattress with a pillow top.  We worked out a price with them for
the mattress, a box spring and a rocking chair for P19, 000.  Elder Clark
approved it so we put P4,000 down on it and asked them to deliver it on
Tuesday, Aug. 5<sup>th</sup>.  On the way home we realized that I was going to
be late for my Saturday meeting with the District Presidency, so we text
President Mercado.  I arrived at the church about 2:15 PM, but no one else
showed up.  It is possible that they had tried to call me during the week, but
couldn’t reach me due to the phone problems.  I met with Brother Roger Silvia
at 6:30 PM and we tried to get on a inter-net line, but couldn’t, having the
same problem we are having at home.  Roger did some checking and we think my modem
is out, but Roger will have to take the computer to work to test it out.  If it
is, we might be able to get an exterior modem for the computer.  I decided to
adjust the head lights on the car, but I can’t find any adjustment.  After
dinner, I washed the dishes, and then entered my journal entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Today is Fast Sunday and I didn’t sleep very
well last night, so when I got back to sleep, Mae let me sleep in until 7 AM. 
We attended the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch block meetings, then came home and
took a nap.  We attended Sacrament meeting at Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch. 
They were 20 minutes late starting, but went over ½ hour before closing.  We
met Brother Silvia and Brother Aglibia and accompanied them Home Teaching.  We
were able to visit four families.  In the first home was 3 sisters, their
mother was not there at the time.  We had a nice visit with them and found that
they have a sister who is serving a mission and will be home in November. 
Their father is not a member and stays on their farm all the time.  The mother
goes out most nights and stays with him, but it doesn’t sound like he sees the
rest of the family much.  Brother Silvia asked one of the girls if she would
show us where other members lived, so two of them accompanied us.  We then went
across the street to see a lady, but she wasn’t home.  Her mother was there, but
she was not listed as a member.  She told us that she was baptized in 1997.  We
had a nice visit with her.   We next went to a home and as we entered, a boy
probably in his 20s and the tatay (Father) got up from watching TV and went in
the other room.  They did not come back in.  The nanay (mother) reminded us
that Mae and I had met her before and then we remembered her from when we first
came here, as we had visited this family with Elder Kendall and Elder Irorita. 
The nanay had a little boy there that was 2 or 3 years old, that she told us
was her grandson.  She is raising him because his father, her son, had been
murdered.  The boy’s mother had remarried and they didn’t want the baby of her
former husband.  The child does not know his mother.  Another young man came in
and the mother introduced him as her son, who is a member.  He invited us to
come to his home to visit him and his wife.  After visiting a while with his
mother, we went to the home just to the front of his parent’s home.  I think
this has been built since our original visit.  It has only one room that might
be seven feet square with just room enough for a small bed.  There was an open
area that was covered by the roof being extended an extra three feet, which was
used for a kitchen and porch area.  The bed was built of bamboo logs with a
blanket on the logs for a mattress.    This young couple has just been married
for two months and she is a cute blushing bride.  She is not a member, but he
told us that she was going to take the lessons starting next week.  I bore my
testimony to her that if she would study and pray she could find out for
herself the truth of what the missionaries were going to teach them.  I then
told them a little about the Temple and how they could be sealed as husband and
wife for eternity.  It was a very enjoyable evening.  After getting home I
called the Elders and told them that we had met their new investigator.  They
said her husband introduced her to them at church this morning and they didn’t
know much else about her.  I told them I thought they had a Golden Contact.  We
made soup and sandwiches for dinner.  We then worked on the computer and I made
my journal entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went to Angeles today where Mae got her new
teeth (four crowns).  She is really pleased with them.  I had my teeth cleaned
and I talked to Dr. Rosales about my teeth.  She feels that I should either get
removable false teeth or permanent bridges put in as my upper teeth are
starting to come down.  She x-rayed my teeth to see if permanent bridges could
be put in and she feels they can.   Permanent Bridges would cost P32,000;
Flexite removable would cost P20,000 and medal one piece would cost P15,000. 
We will think about it.  When we got back to the mission office, we visited
with President Brimhall for a few minutes before he had to leave.  Sister
Brimhall, Sister Clark and Mae then visited about the auxiliary training they
will do next Saturday.  Elder Clark and I visited a while.  Elder and Sister
Clark then went out to eat with us.  After eating they let me off at the
Indulgence Spa where I got a massage.  Elder Clark picked me back up at 5:30
PM.  Mae and I soon headed home, stopping to get a few groceries and a couple
of sandwich coolers to carry our lunch in when we have to be gone during lunch. 
It was 9:30 PM when we got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Although my back felt so much better last night,
I still woke at 3:30AM with a back ache.  I had to set up the rest of the
evening.  We were busy on the computer all morning trying to be ready have it
ready for Brother Roger Silvia to check out as to the modem problem.  He came
by at noon and took the computer to his work, but soon brought it back, unable
to do much with it.  I went down to the computer calf and sent our family
letter and got an e-mail from Shellie.   I also took some master copies, of
hand outs, over to have them duplicated, then paid our telephone bill.  This
afternoon, our new bed and chair was delivered, we are excited about that.  We
worked the rest of the evening on the transcript for the presentation we are to
put on tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, August 06, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept much better last night although I did
wake with a back ache about 4AM and lay in the lounge chair the rest of the
night.  My back wasn’t near as bad as it has been and the new chair was so nice
to set in.  We got every thing in the car and picked up Elders Barrett and Clam
at 6:45AM.  We got to Tarlac shortly after 8AM, so we went to McDonald’s and
had breakfast.  The District, Zone Leaders meeting started at 10AM.  We tried
to get the DVD, “Finding Faith in Christ” to play in our computer, but it
wouldn’t recognize the disk.  We think that the disk is in bad shape, for we
got it to play another disk.  As we got started into the meeting, I asked Mae
where our scripts were and she only had hers.  We couldn’t find mine script or
the pamphlet “To the Home Teachers of the Church”.  I pulled another script up
that had the last two paragraphs of the talk, which are the only part of the
pamphlet I read and copied that down.  We made out with one script and it went
well.  We later found where Mae had laid the folder down with the other
information in it.  Oh well, it went ok.  The meeting was very good with some
good instructions given.  We had 2 or 3 Elders ask about scheduling us for more
presentations to the leaders in their areas.  We stopped at a 7/11 store in
Tarlac for a snack to eat on the way home.  After getting home we fixed us
something light for super and then watched the movie “Brigham” before going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Elder Barrett called to see if they could come
over and use our computer.  We invited them for breakfast.  After breakfast
they gave us a Tagalog lesson, we then let them use the computer.  They were
all morning working on a booklet about the requirements for convert bartizans. 
Mae studied in preparation for her talks she is to give on Saturday.  I did the
dishes and then prepared lunch for all of us.  After we ate, Mae went back to
studding.  The Elders went back to work on the computer.  I did up those dishes
and talked to President Clark.  He wanted me to check as to the location of the
meeting on Saturday.  I called President Nuque to check on the location, and
then called President Clark back.  He was out of the office, so I left word
with the Office Elders.  When the Elders finished I took them to a copy store,
and then I went to San Jose and bought some supplies and groceries.  I went to
a computer calf and pulled some e-mails.  JaNae sent us five pictures of Dawson
along with a letter.  There was a nice letter from Scott, a note from Mike and
a note from Kim.  Sister Clark sent some information to Mae.  This evening I warmed
up dinner and did up the dishes.  Mae worked until 9:45PM on the computer
getting her talks.  I set down and read some, but fell asleep.  It has rained
all day again today, as it did yesterday.  When they call this the rainy season
they are right, although we are told that this is less rain than normal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended District meeting this morning.  We
enjoy these meeting and as always were very impressed with the Elders and the
work they are doing.  We are loosing Elder Park as he will be going home this
next week.  Elder Barrett will be the next to go home in about another 10 days,
but he is still working hard as Zone Leader.  We felt bad for Elder Hayman, as
he just got a Dear John letter from his girl friend.  I spent some time
visiting with Elder Summerhaze about the problems he is having with the
leadership in Rezal.  We really get attached to these Young Men and feel for
their problems and miss them when they are transferred or go home.  Marlyn had
dinner ready for us when we got home.  I then went over to San Jose and bought some
bed legs and put them on one of the Elders beds over there.  One store had told
me a week ago that she would sell me bed legs for P30 a set, but now that I
didn’t buy our bed from her, she can’t sell them to me.  I had to pay P280 for
1 set at another store.  That still isn’t bad as it is about $5.00 per set.  I
got some copies made for Mae for her presentation tomorrow.  I also went to the
computer café and sent a short reply to Mike about extended warranty on our
camera, one to Scott about the carpeting replacement in our house, and one to
JaNae thanking her for the pictures of Dawson she sent us.  We got a cute letter
from Jeff, and I tried to send an e-mail to President Brimhall, but had trouble
getting the computer to read the file.  Mae has studied all afternoon and
evening for tomorrow.  It has rained on and off through the day today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, August 09, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was raining quite hard when we got up and
continued most of the morning.  We left for Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch by
7:15 AM.  We were the first to get to the church house, getting there just
after 8 AM.  We waited until 8:30 before the Branch President came.  I helped
Mae get set up, and then I found a room where I could work on the computer
writing a letter to our family and to my Uncles and Aunts.  Mae had a part to
give on the District Relief Society program this morning.  She also had a part
to give on the District Leadership given this afternoon.  The Priesthood also
met this afternoon under the direction of the Mission Presidency.  We followed
after that with a District Presidency.  When we got home we were tired and
hungry.  We fixed toast and tuna fish grave to eat, then this evening we
watched the movie “Brigham” again.  It was late before we got to bed but we
enjoyed the chance to relax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, August 10, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in, and then went to Sacrament meeting
at Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  President and Sister Clark were also there. 
After meeting, we put some chairs under the trees outside and ate our lunches. 
We enjoy being with the Clarks.  We attended the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch
Conference.  The District was to have someone give a workshop, but no one was
there when it was time for meetings to start, so the Branch President started
anyway.  I felt he was right.  We had had an opening song, prayer and then the
Branch President started a workshop of sort.  He had the Sisters relate what
they had gotten out of the training yesterday.  About that time, the District
leaders got there.  President Cabuyaban turned the time over to President
Nuque, who presented a lesson.  We had a two hour Sacrament meeting which went
well.  When the Branch President had been concerned earlier, he had asked if
President and Sister Clark, also Mae and I would plan on speaking as he wasn’t
sure what the District was planning.   When the District Presidency did show
up, I relaxed thinking we were off the hook.  That wasn’t the case for he still
had us speak.  We made our talks short so as to leave time for the District
Presidency.  President Clark said that he counted and there were twelve
speakers.  It was a very interesting day.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After the meeting, President
Cabuyaban asked to see President Clark and me.  He told us of a family who have
gone less-active, but have children with a very rare disease called Muscular
Aprathy (? On spelling).  Two children have already died from this disease and
two children still have it.  He does not know what can be done for them. 
President Clark asked if Sister Browning and I would go with President
Cabuyaban and the missionaries to visit this family and report back to him.  I
said we would and we went immediately with them to visit the family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We found first that the family had
moved to another location.  The father was working so was not home.  From what
we could find out, the couple had 8 children; a daughter and a son that is
married; two sons that at ages 14 and 9 died from the disease; two sons ages 13
and 11, who both still have the disease; and two younger boys whom the Doctors
have checked and said that they do not have it.  We assessed the situation and
found that their house is adequate as to the standards here in the Philippines. 
They seem to have the basic needs of food and clothing.  All of the children
have been taken to Specialists in Manila, where they diagnosed this disease and
only the four boys have it.  These are the only known cases in the
Philippines.  The only treatment, as recommended by the Doctors, is to take
them off all dairy products and to give them special vitamins.  There is no
known cure.  We were shocked when we first saw the two children because they
looked as if they were starving, they are so thin, just skin and bone.  We were
also surprised at their ages, for they look much younger.  They have to have
constant care, for they can not move around on their own as they are too weak. 
This also stops them from attending public school and the parents can not
afford a private tutor.  Both seem to be mentally alert and bright.  The mother
showed us some of the one son’s art work and he does very well.  We took pictures
with the boys and family and they were excited to be in them.  The Catholic
school has invited the parents to bring the two boys over to their school, on
occasion, which they have done but, of course, they can’t participate in
regular classroom activities because they have to be carried and helped with
everything.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>There is no immediate need for
financial help, that we observed, but that could change suddenly if either were
to catch even a cold, as they have no immune system and it could turn into a life
threatening situation.  I recommended to President Cabuyaban that he assign a
good faithful Home Teacher and a good Visiting Teacher to check each week on
the family, that he may be kept apprised of the situation.  They could
alternate weeks, but he should emphasize the importance of this special
assignment.  I also recommended that the Full Time Missionaries check regularly
on this family when they are in the area.  If there are any needs, President
Cabuyaban should be immediately notified.  He could appraise the needs and if
he feels they warrant it, can call President Clark.  I asked President
Cabuyaban about schooling and he said there are two professional teachers, in
the branch, which he would contact to see if they could volunteer some time to
this effort.  Sister Browning and I are going to take the Children Book of
Mormon to the family this next week.  We will also check on the family as we
get the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When we go home we noticed that our
grass had been cut very short.  Marlyn told us that they do this, as if the
grass gets long it will attract snakes.  Elder Barrett says that they have a
several types of snakes here in the Philippines, one is a small Cobra but it is
very aggressive and will chase a person and is very poisonous.  That has Mae
worried now, as she hadn’t thought of snakes before this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning.  It was
a pretty morning and the sky was fairly clear.  It has been so long since we
have walked on a nice morning that I got a little sunburned.  Mae didn’t feel
the best this morning.  We came back and ate breakfast.  Marlin Dator came over
and washed the car.  Mae and I read the scriptures and both of us were so tired
that we lay down to take a 15 minute nap and ended up sleeping for an hour.  We
then worked on a report for President Clark about the Family with the two boys
with Muscular Aprathy.  That took us most of the morning.  Time went by fast
and the next thing we know is Marlyn was calling us for dinner.  Marlyn moped
the bedroom floors with “Permethrin” and so we moved the computer out into the
kitchen to be away from the odder.  As I was working on the computer, I saw
Marlyn run to get the clothes in.  We went out to help her and as we got them
in it started to rain and really came down.  We were amazed that she could
sense the storm coming in.  I called the Toshiba repair service in Manila and
found out that we would have to take our computer to them.  They could check it
out, and then order the parts from Singapore, which could take up to 3 months. 
We would then have to return the computer to them and it could take 3 to 4 day
before we could go back to get it.  I am not sure what we will do but that
doesn’t sound acceptable to me.  We worked on family letters and this evening
we went to an inter-net café and got them off.  We got a nice letter from Roy
and Linda.  Mae gave me a haircut this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, August 12, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning.  We
were busy trying to get organized a good part of the day.  I upset Mae as we
tried to find things and I say things wrong so often.  Just as we were getting
ready to eat lunch, two ladies and several children came to the house bagging. 
Mae gave them some crackers, but this really broke Mae up, wanting to help them
but mission rules says we can’t.  This afternoon we went grocery shopping.  We
did some visiting this evening.  When we got home Mae got on the computer,
while I got some super.  Time seems to go so fast or else we are getting
slower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, August 13, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went to Cabanatuan to a special missionary
conference at which President Neuenswaner of the First Quorum of Seventies
presided as he and his wife are touring the mission.  We picked up the four
Elders from Guimba at the town where the flags are, which is on the way to
Cabanatuan.  The four of them rode in the back seat, but said it was still
better than the jeepnies.  The conference was great and we sure enjoyed meeting
President and sister Neuenswaner as well as being with President &amp; Sister
Brimhall and the Elders and Sisters.  After the meeting, Mae and I found Bass
Edwards computer shop to see if we could get an external modem for our
computer.  They didn’t have one that was compatible with our computer.  We came
home to find the power off.  We found out later that the secondary power
company had not been able to pay their monthly payment so the main power
company cut off the power to five towns and we were one of them.  We heard that
the power would be off for 3 days.  We used candles tonight and since we
couldn’t read by candlestick very well, we decided to play “Rummy” and Mae beat
me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, August 14, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went walking this morning.  As we went out
the front gate we spoke to out neighbors across the street and he told us that
the power had been shut off by the main supplier as our local company hadn’t
paid the bill they owe.  He pointed out that we have a lot of other things to
be thankful for, so we will just have to except this.  We had to admit that he
is right.  Some have told us that we could be with out electricity for weeks. 
Elder Barrett, Clam and Hayman came over for breakfast and to teach Tagalog. 
We found out that they have a hand pump that they can get water from, so I took
several containers over to their place and filled them with water.  We worked
on some scheduling for a while, and then this afternoon we went to Risal where
I worked with the Ward Clerk and the Elders there, to teach him how to do the
Clerks job.  On the way home we took some pictures of a man riding a caribou
and leading two others.  We also stopped in San Jose and bought some ice to put
in the refrigerator, to help keep it cool, but when we got home we found that
the power was back on.  We were glad for that but did find out what we could do
if the power goes out again.  It is sure good to have power back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was up early with my back hurting.  It took me
a while to get back to sleep in the big chair.  I had just got to sleep when
Mae got up and that woke me again.  We attended District leadership with the
Elders and as always enjoyed that meeting.  This is Elder Barrett’s last
meeting with us as he will be going home on Wednesday.  We stopped at the
inter-net café and got an e-mail from Kin and some pictures from JaNae.  We
couldn’t bring up the pictures on those computers, so will have to wait to see
them when we get our computer repaired.  After getting home, we ate and then I
tried to call the computer store in Cabanatuan.  When I finally got through to
the store they put me on hold and forgot me.  I tried to take a nap, but
between being upset and a fly bothering me, I couldn’t.  I worked on a budget
table to try so we can see how we are doing on our budget a little better.  We
did some planning to what we needed to do for leadership training this
evening.  I read quite a bit, from the Church Handbook of Instructions, as to
the responsibilities of a Stake President.  First, I was amazed at the great
responsibility a Stake President has and 2<sup>nd</sup> I can not see how
President Mercado can possibility have the time to do his calling with his job
in Manila.  Mae got most of a letter written to our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I don’t know why I continue to have back pain
after sleeping for 3 to 5 hours.  The bed is very comfortable and seems to be
great, but again this morning about 3AM I had to get up and set in the
recliner.  I was still tired so we didn’t go walking.  Brother and Sister Dator
came over about 7AM and washed our car.  After breakfast we did some planning
on what we could do for training.  I called President Nuque to see if we were
having District Presidency meeting today, and he said we were not.  President
Mercado has decided that we will hold meetings only twice a month.  I was
really surprised and concerned so after thinking about it, I called and talked
to President Clark about it.  He feels that I need to give President Mercado
some training.  I told him that I thought either he or President Brimhall
should talk to him first.  We decided that we should get together Monday and
talk things over.  I tried to call President Apoa about getting a copy of the
World Wide Broadcast for Priesthood Leadership, but he did not have his phone
on.  I called Blas Edward’s in Cabanatuan and they said that they had a modem
that would work on our computer.  We drove there and bought it.  We had to find
an ATM at The Bank of the Philippines and draw some money out.  We then went to
the mall on the west end of Cabanatuan where we purchased some file boxes.  We
were tired when we got home, but I got the modem installed and working.  After
dinner, I cut Mae’s hair, and then we took our showers so Mae’s hair would dry
after she put it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, August 17, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke with my back really hurting this morning. 
It took some time to get it limbered up and then Mae had to massage it with the
viborator for several minutes.  We attended Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch
Sacrament meeting.  Brother and Sister Silvia’s daughter, Karen, wanted to sit
next to Mae during Sacrament meeting.  I think we have an adopted granddaughter
here.  After Sacrament meeting Mae and I went over to San Jose Stake where we
met with President Opoa, his counselors and a clerk and talked with them about
doing some training.  That went very well and they would like us back next
Saturday to help with some auditing training.  We were very surprised at that
request, for we have never done auditing before.  Oh well, I guess we will
learn.  We came home and took a short nap before going to the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch’s block of meetings.  President and Sister Clark were there and we
enjoyed visiting with them for a few minutes before meetings.  President Nuque
told me that after I had called him yesterday and he had told me that we were
not having a meeting, that President Mercado called him and said we needed to
meet, but they couldn’t reach me.  There is a special Training meeting, in
Tarlac, next Saturday morning that is scheduled by President Brimhall for all
District Presidencies in the mission.  President Clark also confirmed that
meeting.  President and Sister Clark left to go back home after Priesthood and
Relief Society.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After the block meetings, Mae and I
met with Brother Romeo Tabalno and Brother Alvin Pilien and planned to go with
them to visit their Home Teaching families.  As we prepared to go, it started
raining very hard.  We were not sure just what to do as Brother Tabalno and
Brother Pilien were planning on Brother Tabalno’s motor scooter as
transportation.  We know that they would be socked riding the scooter but the
mission rules does not let us give anyone except missionaries rides in our
car.  We had a prayer and they decided they would ride the scooter anyway.   As
we left the church, the rain let up and completely quite while visiting the
first family.  Things worked out just fine.  These are four families that
President Gajonera wants us to visit and see if we can activate them.  We had a
nice visit with each of the families.  It was 9PM when we got home.  We got
some dinner, and then I made my journal entry.  We were late getting to bed
again tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left early for Angeles that we might meet
with President and Sister Clark, because of my concerns about the District
Presidency no holding meeting very regular.  As we drove we were quite relaxed
and enjoyed several traffic problems.  We stopped in Tarlac, at McDonalds for
some breakfast.  As we left, traffic began to backup.  Because the oncoming
lanes were empty, the traffic going our way soon took up the whole road.  Only
in the Philippines!  It was a circus, but we were lucky for we were at the
front of the mess as it narrowed down to one lane to get around a wreck.  As we
passed the traffic on the other side was already taking up just about the whole
road and was backed up for almost a mile.  I am sure it will take hours to
clear that problem, mainly because of every one crowding the roads so bad. 
When we got to the mission home, we met with the Clarks and President and
Sister Brimhall.  It was amazing to me but President Brimhall already had a
solution to the problems I am concerned with.  I think he is amazing.  We next
went to the bank to draw out some money, and then went down to a shop that
makes Christmas decorations and bought some ornaments.  We went out to dinner
with the Clark and a always really enjoyed it.  We were late getting home but
sure enjoyed the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke early with back pains and so slept in the
chair.  We had Elder Barrett, Elder Clam and Elder Hayman over for breakfast
and a Tagalog lesson.  Elder Barrett leaves to go home today.  We have sure
enjoyed him and will miss him.  Mae worked all afternoon on the computer, while
I ran some errorns.  We watched the video The Other Side of Heaven” this
evening, and then got some e-mails off.  We had one from Becky, Shellie and
Sandy Peterson.  I did get a letter written to Keith and Kathleen Nelson this
afternoon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, August 20, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I slept most of the night in bed but did get up
about 4:30 AM.  Mae let me sleep until 6:30 AM, when I got up.  We didn’t go
walking this morning.  I got a letter off to my family and worked on some
pictures.  I met with President Nuque this afternoon and we updated the
District organization record.  Mae worked on Tagalog quite a while.  We went
out this evening to visit the Galletes family, but couldn’t find their place in
the dark and with it raining hard, so gave up.  We will look for them tomorrow
while it is light.  We decided to visit the Sylvia family and take them the
Book of Mormon stories for children.  Roger has been home with back problems
this week.  It sounds like he needs a good chiropractor, but I don’t know if
there is one here.  He also asked for my advice on looking for a new job.  I
could only advise him to pray about it.  It sounds like someone advised him not
to pay or look at it as borrowing three months of tithing to hold him over.  I
advised him to pay his tithing and fast offerings and trust in the Lord.  As we
drove around through these homes I wondered if the shanty towns in the U. S.
were as bad off as these, and these homes are the average people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were late going walking as we massaged each
others backs and feet first.  I worked on filling capsules all morning.  While
I was doing that we went over our schedule and did some companion planning on
the families we are working with.  I called President Apoa to check on our
change in days with the auditors.   He said to plan on Friday at 6PM.  He also
said that they were just waiting on Area Presidency approval to combine the two
Rizal Wards, but would like us to do all we can to get the Home Teaching and Visiting
Teaching going.  We went downtown this afternoon to get some LP gas, get copies
of our driver’s licenses and drove around to find where the families live that
we are trying to fellowship. This evening we visited the Galletes family and
showed the video “Man’s Search for Happiness”.  It went very well.  We tried to
order some ink cartridges on the inter-net but it wouldn’t let me use the
Philippines zip code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, August 22, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were late getting to bed last night so slept
in this morning.  We attended District meeting and became acquainted with our
new zone leader Elder Ragasa.  President Mercado was at the chapel and as we
visited with him for a few minutes, Mae mentioned that we got word that we
could have members ride in our car when they are helping with missionary work. 
He immediately picked up on it and wondered about tomorrow.  I told him I would
call and check.  I called President Clark and he felt as I do, that we would be
out the direction, to take members to a meeting.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We received a Wedding Invitation, from Brother
and Sister Craig Howe, for their daughter, Jocelyn’s, wedding to James C. Scott
on Sept. 6<sup>th</sup>, 2003.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went to San Jose after lunch and mailed some
cards to our children and letters to Mae’s Aunts and Uncles.  We also did some
grocery shopping, while there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This evening, just as we were getting ready to
leave for an appointment, President Brimhall called me, just to thank me for
the idea of how to follow up on assignments that are made in the various
council meetings.  I thought that was very special of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We met President Apoa at the San Jose Stake
Center at 6PM, who took us to the other chapel in San Jose, to introduce us to
his Auditing Committee.  It is three sisters that have been given this
responsibility.  President Apoa told them that we were here to train them,
however, as he introduced them to us, he said they were accountants by profession. 
We thought, Wow! How are we to train them?  Mae told him we hadn’t had much
experience with auditing, but we said, well, I have confidence in you that you
can do it.  With the Lord’s help, all things are possible, so we’ll do what we
are asked to do and pray for guidance.  He went on to praise us to them and
told them he would be using us to train many of their various leaders.  He said
he hoped President Mercado wouldn’t be mad at him for using us so much, but he
was planning to do so.  President Apoa excused himself and said he had business
at the stake center so he would leave us to do our training.  We visited with
them a few minutes and decided we need some information from the Stake, so we
took them over to the Stake Center.  President Apoa had left by then, but we
were able to visit with the clerk and get the forms, codes and some of the
other information that will be needed.  We also made plans on where the
committee should start and called it good for tonight.  They will call us to
help with the auditing when they get it scheduled with the bishops, ward
clerks, stake president and stake financial clerk.  After getting home, I
prepared some materials for tomorrow, and then we played some games on the
computer before going to bed.  I also popped some pop corn.  It as rained quite
a bit today and this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, August 23, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up and let Mae sleep in.  I had to go to a
District Presidency Training in Tarlac.  We had all four District Presidency
and Executive Secretaries, except I am an assistant executive, there.  The
training went well.  Before coming home I stopped at Saver Mart where we bought
our bed and talked to them about getting 8 sets of bed legs for the Elders. 
Mae was working on the family letter when I got home.  She read it to me before
I took a nap, and then we went out visiting this evening.  We visited the
Santo’s and had a very nice visit and could feel the Spirit as we did.  We were
very excited for we had especially involved Brother Santo’s in asking us questions. 
We then went to the Dela Cruz family and even though the father wasn’t home we
had a nice visit, although communication was more difficult as Sister Dela Cruz
doesn’t speak much English.  We showed the video “Mans Search for Happiness”
and had a prayer.  We set return appointments with both families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, August 24, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae let me sleep in longer for I had been up
with my back hurting.  I don’t know just what to do about it, as there is one
spot between my shoulders that I can tell is out, and when I lay still for 3 to
4 hours it gets really tight.  I get up and do a little stretching and
twisting, and then if I set in the recliner, I can get some more sleep.  The
trouble is that it will have me up for an hour or more before I get back to
sleep.  We attended the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> branch as we hopped that we would
have some families there, which there were.  The Santo’s family came for part
of the meetings and the Dela Cruz children and cousins came.  We had hoped that
hopped that the Galletes family would have come but their daughter and her
husband are visiting.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Both Mae and I were quite upset at the lack of
reverence there was during Sacrament meeting.  It is a real problem in this
Branch as there is one little girl, who is an adopted daughter of a single
sister, who start right from the start to running around, she soon has other
children running around and playing with her.  The parents pay little or no
attention to them.  There are also a lot of adults and youth that move around
and talks to each other.  Sunday school class went fairly well, although we
only get parts of the lesson, because of the language.  After the Sunday school
class let out, Brother Santo’s got up and left.   I went looking for him, but
he had gone home.  Eva Gajonera asked me some questions and I spent the
Priesthood time visiting with her.  Along with not understanding Tagalog and
the reverence problem, we were not sure if we had got much out of meetings.  We
came home and got some lunch and prepared some things for dinner this evening. 
I got a short nap, and then we attended the Sacrament meeting at Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch.  I was impressed for the meeting started on time with all the Branch
Presidency on the stand ready to start.  The reverence was much better in this
meeting.  We left with a much better Spirit.  We stayed after to attend a
planning meeting for the upcoming Medical Mission.  Elder Ragasa and Elder Clam
came home with us for dinner.  We enjoyed visiting with them and they seemed to
really enjoy dinner.  We drove them over to an 8PM appointment, and then we
came back and got on the inter-net, sending letters to our family and friends. 
It was late when we finished and got to bed.  Mae is sure special and I can’t
even imagine not having that girl for all eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, August 25, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I again woke at 3AM and couldn’t get back to
sleep for some time.  Mae let me sleep in the chair until 7AM, and then I laid
down on the bed and fell asleep for another 20 minutes.  Both Mae and I fasted
this morning for Jeff and Gail, as they are trying to make some tough decisions
about going back to school, selling their home and moving into Gail’s mother’s
basement.  Jeff is really feeling stressed out.  Mike is also having a lot of
stress with his work, Shellie is having back pain that she is dealing with (we
don’t know how she hurt it), we are not sure how Sandi is doing with her new
job at the school, and Scott is starting his last semester of school before
graduating.  It sounds like David is the only one that we haven’t heard is under
stress right now.  We spent most of the day in companion study and planning. 
We do have a big week ahead of us.  I visited with President Clark about some
reports that the A. P.’s were going to send me, also some thoughts about
executive secretaries.  This evening we went to the Santo’s so that we could
change our appointment that we have on Saturday with them, to Sunday, as we
have a conflict.  We were there longer than we had planned but it worked out
ok.  We visited the Lozano family and had an enjoyable Family Home Evening with
them.  We stopped by the Corpus’s and set up an appointment to see them
Wednesday morning at 9AM.  We were up late tonight on the computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, August 26, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was up early as usual, but I did sleep
longer.  We went for a walk just around this area.  We visited with some of the
people in the area.  We found out that there will be a brown out today as the
power co. is working on the power lines.  We had Elder Ragasa and Clam over for
breakfast and they gave us a Tagalog lesson.  I just don’t know?  The power did
go off at 10AM.  Although it was over cast and cooler than many days, it was
still very uncomfortable.  The power did come back on shortly after 5PM, and we
were sure grateful for that.  We did some planning and studding, mostly on the
front porch where it was a little cooler.  This evening we had an appointment
with the Galletes family but the father had to be at a meeting and his wife
didn’t know when he would be home, so asked us if we could come back next week. 
We thought of visiting the Sariano family, but it was raining and the yards
were all closed up.  We called it a day and came home.  We spent a little while
on the computer before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, August 27, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went walking this morning before breakfast. 
After breakfast we visited the Corpus’s and talked to them about preparing to
go to the Temple.  It was a good visit and we hope we helped them to set some
goals.  We worked the rest of the day on preparing presentations for Friday and
Saturday.  We had Marlyn call our landlord to see if they could run our phone
line from the kitchen into our bedroom.  They did, but you will have to read
the write up of it in “Ken’s Stories”.   We quite about 7:30PM this evening and
decided to watch “The Other Side of Heaven” again.  We sure enjoy that film.  Elder
Stokes from Sanga Ignacia Zone called to see if we were still planning on being
there on Friday.  We got to bed about 11PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, August 28, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking.  It was a beautiful
morning and we walked for over 45 minutes.  We went to the bank in San Jose to
transfer our money for October and got our money for September.  We tried to
get Mae’s prescriptions refilled but they don’t carry those medications here. 
We did some grocery shopping.  The rest of the day was spent on the computer
preparing for our presentations for Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, August 29, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left at 6AM for Padapada where we are to give
a presentation to the Elders in the Sanga Ignacia Zone.  We stopped at
McDonald’s in Tarlac and got some breakfast.  It is interesting that when we
were in the U.S. we didn’t like McDonalds, but now we stop there quite often. 
We found the Chapel in Padapada with out much trouble.  We really enjoyed the
Elders there and our presentation went quite well.  We came home by going North
through Camalin and then East across the Tarlac River to Panaki back South to
the Total Station and East to Guimba and on to Munoz.  It was a very beautiful
drive and we really almost became jealous of the Maharry’s when we saw the
beautiful area they are to be assigned to.  We got back to Munoz at 1:15 PM so
went straight to the Chapel to help with the setup for the Medical Mission for
tomorrow.  Only Brother Michol and Brother Espiritu were there, when we got
there.  Brother Michol told me that there was no water in the restrooms because
a pipe had broken in the Ladies room, so he had shut off the water.  I told him
we had to have water on for tomorrow and Sunday, so let me look at it.  The
supply line to the one sink was broke so I worked the supply valve for a minute
and was able to shut that one off.  All the rest of the lines are ok.  We went
home and changed our clothes, got some lunch and then went back.  By then,
others were there and things were almost done.  I told President Nuque about
the water problem so he could get someone to repair it.  When I told him how I was
able to shut off the water to the one sink so the rest rooms could be used
tomorrow, he was really excited and thankful for me.  I used the copy machine
and made handouts for Saturday.  After diner, we spent the evening on the
computer working on Saturday’s presentation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, August 30, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up a little before 5AM, ate and went to
the chapel to help with the Medical Mission.  Brother and Sister Marlin Dator
washed our car for us this morning.  We gave Elder Clam and Elder Ragasa a ride
there, although I about forgot them and had to suddenly stop and back up to get
them.  Mae was reading from the Book of Mormon and I was so interested in what
she was reading that I forgot we were going to pick them up.  We had a very
successful Medical Mission with over 215 registered for the doctors and over 80
that wanted to see the dentist.  Although the Dentist worked just as hard as
she could go, she only saw about 40.  We came home after 12PM when they quit
for lunch, but the Doctors came back after lunch and saw more that wanted in. 
We had 6 or 8 Elders from San Jose there with Elder Clam and Ragasa.  They were
very successful with visiting non-members, inactive and active members.  We
showed the videos, “Mans Search For Happiness, and Finding Faith In Christ”, to
those that were waiting to see the Doctors.  When we got home we got some
lunch, prepared some meat for dinner tomorrow, worked on our presentation for
this afternoon and got a short nap.  We left for Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch
Chapel.  We got there just a few minutes early and had time to set up.  They
asked us to give our Home Teaching/Visiting Teaching workshop first, it went
well.  We had a large group that was in attendance.  President Nuque was just a
few minutes late but gave an excellent talk on the statistics of the District. 
President Desalas gave a good talk on the payments of Fast Offerings and
Tithing.  They then opened it up for questions for about 45 minutes.  I sure
felt lost not being able to speak Tagalog.  They then held a dance that started
about 6:30 PM.  We enjoyed joining in with them in games and dancing until
almost 9M.   We had fun dancing.  It’s been a long time since we have been able
to dance.  The music was wonderful.  They were all sitting around the outside
of the cultural hall and many times, there was only us and 1 or 2 other couples
on the dance floor.  They liked how we danced and clapped for us.  We were a
little embarrassed, but had so much fun, we didn’t stop.  The District YW
president asked if we would come on the 19<sup>th</sup> and teach them how to
dance.   We then came home.  Before we left they passed out hamburgers and soft
drinks.  They had purchased them so we decided to eat them and they were
delicious.   It was a very enjoyable evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, August 31, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We thought we would sleep in a little later, but
I woke before 5AM anyway.  We went to Guimba this morning and attended the 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch.  We really enjoyed the meetings.  We had a question about the primary
putting on a program during Sacrament meeting, so we researched it as we
drove.  We still were not sure about the interpretation of the handbook by the
time we got there.  President Clark and Sister Clark came out to meetings with
Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> also; in fact, we had to change our schedule in order to
be there with them.  After the meetings we had them come home and have dinner
with us.  We visited with President Clark about the Primary giving the program
and he had to agree with me that it is up to the Branch President.  Mae made a
nice dinner and we sure enjoyed visiting with the Clarks.  It is amazing that
we had to come half way around the world to meet them and become friends.  They
left to attend the Guimba 1st Branch Sacrament meeting, which was to start at
2:40 so they left about 2:00.   We took a nap before going to the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch Sacrament meeting.  As we came in and sat down, we had several children
come and sit by us.  They especially love Sister Browning, as does everyone. 
It was all around that we had been to the dance and “were the bell of the ball”. 
After the meeting, we stopped by the Corpus’s, to see why they hadn’t attended
Church.  Sister Corpus had gone to Cabanatuan with their son, but we took a
picture of Brother Corpus and Joy anyway.  We visited the Santos family and
showed the film “Mans Search for Happiness”, then had a good discussion about
the Plan of Salvation.  Brother Santos has a really cute personality and asks
good questions and gives good comments.  We enjoy being with this special
family.  Their youngest daughter, who is 5, had a bad cold and so the parents
tried to keep her away from us, but she insisted on sitting next to Sister Browning
and kept rubbing her arm, looking at her, etc.  Mae enjoys the children and
showed her pictures from the small Children’s Song Book we brought with us.  Mae
is a lola (grandmother) and the children love lolas.  We next visited the Dela
Cruz family and though the father wasn’t there, we showed the film “Building
Faith in Christ”.  When I put the DVD on our laptop to play, I could not get it
to come up.  I could not figure a way to get it to work and felt that I should
just give up.  I said a silent prayer; later found that Mae had also offered a
silent prayer.   Just then a young man came to the door, made some comments
about the computer.  Mae asked him what his name was and he introduced himself
as Dennis.  He handed me a DVD of “Harry Potter” and suggested that I try that
one.  I almost said no, as I do not feel good about Harry Potter, but then out
of politeness, put it on.  As it loaded it, it asked for licensing and I
decided to cancel it.  The feeling came to just close it, which I did.  A
player came up, and I used it to read the “Faith in Christ” DVD and it worked
perfectly.  We were able to show the film and all felt the spirit.  Dennis
watched a little bit of the film, but then left.  We visited with the mother
and children and Mae bore her testimony in Tagalog.  We have difficulty
communicating with them because the nanay (mother) doesn’t speak much English,
and the children are too shy to speak.  But the film and Mae’s testimony left a
spirit that could be felt. I think they even understood my closing remarks.  When
we were to leave and I shut the computer down I thought of trying to save the
program, but didn’t want to take the time to do so, and possibly spoil the
spirit.  When we got home I brought the computer up to make my journal entry
and saw that the icon for the DVD reader was still there.  I used it and can
immediately bring the DVD’s up.  I am continually amazed at the Lord’s hand in
our lives over little and almost insignificant things.  He gives us small
miracles all the time.  We got an e-mail from Shellie and she did a pretty good
job of balling me out.  If I can come up with words to answer her, I will
insert part of her letter and my reply here.</p>
