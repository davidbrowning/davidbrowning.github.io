<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking at the collage.  We
were there about 6:15AM so it was still quite peaceful as we walked.  I
continued my fast trying to get a better feeling about the language problem I
am having, but broke my fast at dinner time.  I worked on the computer most of
the day.  Part of the time was on our bills, part of the time was in backing up
files and defragmenting the “C” drive but the rest of the time was on mission
related items.  We forgot that we were going to go out to Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup>
and help with their CMIS.  We paid our phone bill and got a e-mail off to President
Clark.  This evening we visited the Lozano family and gave them a lesson on the
Blessings of the Gospel in our lives.  We then went to President Gajorena’s
home and worked with them on the CMIS.  After visiting with him I feel that I
need to work with his Branch Clerk and see why they are having trouble getting
their records updated.  When we got home Mae remembered that we had forgotten
our appointment with the Guimba Elders, so I called and apologized to them.  I
called and visited with President Clark about my decision to work with the
branch clerk and he agreed with me.  He also told me about some schedules for
leadership training to be held on the 25<sup>th</sup> &amp; 26<sup>th</sup> of
this month.  President Brimhall wants all couple missionaries to meet on the 8<sup>th</sup>
of October at the mission home to plan this training.  We will also plan a
Temple Day for the couple missionaries.  Mae isn’t feeling very well this
evening.  I rubbed her feet and had her go to bed without me, while I wrote in
my journal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae didn’t feel very well today so we slept in. 
I got up about 6AM and worked on the computer getting some Microsoft Excel
files corrected.  I also worked on the Program for the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch Conference, preparing it for printing.  I had to go to San Jose to mail
some letters and buy a new card for the cell phone.  We still do not have our
land line working, so are using our cell phone quite a lot.  We also are having
trouble getting a signal on the cell hone when inside the house, so miss some
calls.  I found out this evening that the problem with the land line is that
someone stole some of the phone company’s line equipment, leaving quite a large
area with out phone service.  I understand that this has happened several times
before.  This evening I took the CMIS and the Branch Conference program back to
President Gajonera.  He wants another change on the program and we decided to
input the CMIS into our computer, so I brought it back home with me.  I made up
a report for President Brimhall on the Branch Activity Survey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke this morning with a thought that I wanted
to get entered into my journal, but we had to hurry to eat and get to District
Development meeting.  We enjoyed the meeting and getting acquainted with the
new Elders that were transferred here yesterday.  We stayed after to get
reports from the Elders from the Guimba branches.  We lack the Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>
Branch, but should get it by Sunday.  We still do not have phone service.  When
we got home, Marlyn had dinner prepared.  After dinner I took a nap while Mae
worked on the computer.  We got all the Branch organization charts updated with
the exception of Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>.  We did some planning on what we would
present this evening as we kept an appointment to meet with Sister Trabalno’s
friend.  We stopped at the Lozano’s and rescheduled our meeting for next
Wednesday to Friday, as we will be in Angeles on Wednesday.  When we got to the
Trabalno’s, Sister Tabalno wasn’t there and we rescheduled that for tomorrow. 
We came home and popped some pope corn and watched some Church videos.  I don’t
remember what it was that I wanted to put in my journal this morning.  We were
reflecting on a year ago and remembering that it was a year ago that we were
going through the experience with putting Mom in the nursing home.  It seems so
long ago, yet like it was yesterday.  How time flies.  Mae still hasn’t felt
very good today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae felt some better this morning so we went
walking at the collage.  Besides getting there about 6AM, it is also Saturday
morning so quite peaceful.  Mae stayed home and typed the family letter while I
met with President Nieto and others at the church, and with the help of
President Nuque we went through the CMIS and marked each family unit as to
their activity level.  President Nuque is very knowledgeable as to the membership
in the area.  It took us a little over an hour to go through the report.  While
we were there President Nuque said that he had got the job he has been
interviewed for, and he was quite excited about it.  I asked President Nieto,
if he would like Mae and I to put the information on our computer, which he
said he would like us to.  Brother Dator came over and washed our car for us. 
We also tried to find a strange noise that sounds like it is coming from the
right front wheel, but we could not find a problem.  I took a short nap, and
then we ate lunch.  As we were eating Brother and Sister Silvia stopped by to
visit.  They had heard that Mae was sick so wanted to come and visit her.  We
had just got a special e-mail from them.  I couldn’t visit very long as I had a
District Presidency Meeting at 2PM.  That was the best District Presidency
meeting I have attended.  We got a lot of items discussed and either decided or
assigned for some one to follow up on.  After I visited with President Nuque
about the palay chaff and what could be done with it.  After getting back home,
I visited with President Clark about General Conference.  I had asked the
District Presidency about it and they did not know of a schedule.  We also
called President Apoa concerning General Conference.  He gave us a schedule of
times that conference will be received on the satellite system here.  We
visited the Santos family and gave them some thoughts on the Family
Proclamation.  That went quite well.  We next went to the Tabalno’s and went
with them to visit a friend of theirs.  The friend’s son was having his friends
over to celebrate his 21<sup>st</sup> Birthday, but we had a nice visit with
the mother.  We came home and I finished a survey report, and then worked on my
journal.  I had to make some calls to elders to schedule tomorrow and to find
out where the Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch report is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up about 4AM so went back to bed in the
chair.  Mae woke me before 7AM.  I went over to San Jose and watched the
Saturday evening session of the General Priesthood meeting.  It was really good
but I felt bad that I was about the only one that watched it.  Mae wasn’t ready
to go to Guimba when I got home.  I helped her finish up but we were still late
leaving.  She tries to do too much.  We got almost to Guimba when we realized
that we had left the report forms at home, so we turned around and came back
home.  We are getting water on the inside of the car, but I cannot find where
it is coming from.  There is also a strange noise coming from the car.  We
missed the Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch meetings so attended the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch Priesthood and Relief Society meetings.  We then went into Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch correlation meeting, then did splits with the Elders and the leaders and
went out researching the I.O.S.  We took Brother Roberto Sagun Jr. and Elder Sant
with us and went out in the bukid (farms) to locate members that live quite a
way from the chapel, so are inactive.  The cars air conditioner, quite working
while we were out there.  We never got home until after 9:30 PM.  I had to get
some reports e-mailed to President Brimhall after we got home, then empty Mae’s
camera.  It was 12:45 AM before I got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, October 06, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left at 7AM for Tarlac, where we met the
Maharrys at McDonald for breakfast.  We noted a Honda dealership and garage as
we came into town.  After visiting with the Maharrys we deciding to have them
follow us back to the Honda dealership to see if they could repair our car.  I
called President Clark and got his approval to have the car repaired.  As we
left the parking lot Mae saw someone trying to flag us down.  It was the Hyers,
and they were on the way to their office.  We stopped there and visited for
just a few minutes and then followed them to the Tarlac Stake Center where they
have an office.  We enjoyed getting to know then and plan to meet them on
Wednesday morning at 8AM, and then go together to the mission office.  We took
the car to the dealership and they thought they could have it fixed this
afternoon.  We took the Maharrys to the mall in Tarlac and did some shopping. 
We were able to find most of the things they needed and both of us bought some
groceries.  We went back to the Honda Dealership to check on the car and they
said they would have it finished about 6PM.  We went to McDonalds and bought
some drinks and visited about what we have been doing with the H.T. &amp; V.T.
programs and the Branch Organization reports we had developed, while waiting
for the car to be repaired.  At 5:45PM we went back to the dealership but they
still didn’t have it done.  We waited for about another hour when he mechanic
came out to tell us that they couldn’t get it finished tonight.  We decided to
go to the Maharrys, and then use their car to come home.  We will then go back
to their place tomorrow where we can talk more about the programs we have
developed.  Then we can get our car tomorrow.  As we visited at their place it
came to me that we didn’t have the keys to our house but had left them in the
car.  Mae remembered that she had picked them up before we left the car.  Boy
was I glad.  It took us 1 ½ hours to drive home.  We went through an area 
between Paniqui and the junction to go to Guimba that had shops along both
sides of the road that were all lit up with Christmas Decorations for sell.  It
was very pretty and reminded us that Christmas is on its way.  We got us
something to eat and then went to bed, very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, October 07, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up about 6AM, still tired.  I also wanted
to send an e-mail to President Brimhall, but our phone line was dead.  We hadn’t
been up very long when we heard a large bang and I recognized it as an
electrical transformer that blow.  Your right, we lost all power.  I told Mae
to hurry and shower so we could use it while there was still some pressure in
the tank.  The shower was cold, as the water heater is an on demand electric,
but we at least had water.  I called Elder Clam on our cell phone to let them
know that we had to go back to Tarlac to get the car.  I apologized for not
having them over for breakfast but told him of our problems.  He responded
with, “Welcome again to the Philippines.”  As we left to go back to Camiline we
decided to stop at the Silvia’s home to apologize to them for not stopping at
there home Sunday evening to show them a video.  Sister Heidi Silvia told us
that Sunday she and Sister Mercado were visiting in English when President
Mercado asked them why they were talking in English.  They responded that they
were practicing English so that they could visit better with Sister Browning. 
We thought that was so cute and special.  It took us over two hours to get to
the Maharry’s, because of traffic and palay being dried on the roads.  We spent
some time showing the Maharrys some of our files and transferred many of them
over to their computer.  We had taken some of the food, which Marlyn had cooked
for us yesterday, for lunch today.  The Maharrys then took us to get our car.  
The car was already for us.  The A/C really seems to work fine and they had
really done a nice job on cleaning up the car.  We are really pleased with
their work and the price was only P1800 ($33.50).  We commented on how we just
happened to see the Honda Dealership as we came into Tarlac yesterday.  We have
come past it many times, but have never noticed it. We feel the Lord showed it
to us as we needed to have our car repaired.  We had thought maybe President
Clark had a place in Angeles where we would need to take it, but when we
finally were able to reach him, he told us that he didn’t know of a place to
take it, so to take it to that dealership.  We had tried the night before and
several times this morning to reach him by phone (both at their home and at the
office) and it would just ring forever and no one picked up so we figured their
phones were out of order.  In talking with him later, he said they had been
home and didn’t hear the phone ring.  Maybe the Lord needed to show us the
Honda Dealership first – so we would know where to take it.  Wow, the Lord is
so good to us.  When we arrived home, the power was back on, but the phone still
is not working.  We took a short nap and  then prepared our materials and went
to the Galletes to give them a presentation, but Brother Galletes hadn’t got
home from a work meeting, so Sister Galletes asked if we could come on Thursday
evening, which we rescheduled.  We stopped at an internet café, as our phone is
still dead, and got 6 e-mails.  President Mercado asked about changing the
meeting time on the 25<sup>th</sup> of this month.  Julianna sent a cute note
and it sounds like her mission is really going well.  Becky responded to my
asking for help on the Young Women program.  Shellie had a special letter and
added information on the Young Women program.  Scott sent a special letter, and
Betty Spencer, Mae’s friend, sent Mae a cute note.  We really enjoy these
e-mails.  As we left the inter-net café, I about turned in front of a motor
cycle, as he didn’t have the light on.  I heard the sound of the motor cycle
and just caught a glimpse of it coming in time to stop. It was a bullet bike
coming quite fast.  I don’t know why there are not many accidents, as so many
people drive at night with no lights on.  We feel that the Lord is often
protecting us.  It was after 10PM before we got to bed.  Busy Day!  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up early this morning and left for Tarlac
about 6AM.  We got to the Stake center in Tarlac by 7:30AM and had to wait for
the others.  Elder and Sister Hire arrived there in a few minutes and Elder and
Sister Maharry got there at 8AM.  We all rode in the Hire’s car as it is the largest. 
We stopped at McDonalds for breakfast before going on to the mission home.  President
and Sister Brimhall met with all of us in his office and gave us a short power
point presentation on some of our challenges in the mission.  We then went
upstairs to the Brimhall’s living room and discussed the training meeting we
will present on the 25<sup>th</sup> &amp; 26<sup>th</sup> of October to the
Camiling and Tarlac Stakes.  They served us a very nice dinner and we really
enjoyed the opportunity to visit.  While at the mission office we had Elder
Karen try to down load the Microsoft files onto Elder Maharry’s computer to see
if we could get the merge to work on that computer, but it still doesn’t work. 
President Brimhall wanted to take some pictures while we were all together.  We
left the mission office at 4PM, but stopped at the Holiday Inn trying to find a
quilt display.  When we got to the Mabalocat gate, there was a detour around
the bridge, so that took us a while to get around that.  It was 6PM when were
got back to the Stake Center at Tarlac.  We were another two hours getting
home, so were very tired.  I went right in to bed but Mae stayed up.  I woke at
midnight and the lights were still on.  Mae was writing some letters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, October 09, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We worked all day on our computer trying to get
organized, send reports in, write and send e-mails and prepare a lesson plan
for this evening.  We visited the Galletes this evening but the only ones there
was Brother Galletes and their son Vince.  Sister Galletes was visiting their
house helper who had just been beaten by her husband.  The couple has been
separated for about two years.  From what we could get out of it, he returned
this afternoon, drunk and beat his wife quite badly.  Brother Galletes also
explained that he wasn’t home last Tuesday evening for our appointment because
of a work meeting, then after the meeting they had some beers.  He only had
three.  The others had several more, but he didn’t want to get a headache. 
Before we left he said that his family is trying to convince him to return to
the Catholic Church because it is too hard to be a Mormon and it doesn’t take
much time.   He said that you can go to the Catholic Mass just 10 minutes
before the mass is over and that is fine, but it isn’t appropriate to do that
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  He said he doesn’t want to,
he wants to stay a Mormon.  We have given this family several presentations on
the scriptures, the blessings we have received from being a member, we’re born
our testimonies of tithing, the Priesthood, temple blessings, etc. and we felt
the spirit and thought they did.  We know Brother Galletes did because of how
he reacted and what he said – so guess we’ll keep trying and see what happens. 
 Yesterday we were also told that they have positively identified the Elders
Quorum President of Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch as one of the thieves that has
been breaking into the missionaries apartments and robbing them.  We are just
sick at that news as that is Marlyn’s brother, Alvin.  I really feel
overwhelmed with the problems that are here.  I sent President Clark a report
that shows that there is only 10% or less that are active at all and 80% and
above are not even know by the Branch leadership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We didn’t get up in time to go walking this
morning.  I got on the computer and added yesterday’s journal entry.  We
attended District Development meeting.  Mae had made a pan full of a rice
crispy treat for the Elders.  The water has been off at the Church House for almost
three week, so I called President Clark and got permission to have it
repaired.  I called Ronald Dator and told him to repair it.  Marlyn had dinner
ready when we got home.  Sister Swenson who was in the Sr. M.T.C. with us
called.  They were assigned as Humanitarian Missionaries and are traveling five
missions here in the Philippines.  She called, having heard of the Doria boys
in Guimba and wanted to know if they could use wheelchairs.  We told them we
would check and let them know.  We decided to go to Tarlac to get our camera
and to visit with them.  We called the Elders in Guimba and they said they were
sure the wheelchairs would be a great help.  We got our camera from the Sony
dealer and they repaired it without charge.  We enjoyed visiting with Elder
&amp; Sister Swenson for a few minutes.  It sounds like they travel a lot with
their assignment.  We also had a chance to visit with the Hyer’s before leaving
for home.  We got to Munoz at 5:30PM and were to be at the Lozano’s at 6PM. 
Rather than go home, we filled the car with gas and picked up Marlyn.  She went
with us to visit the Lozano.  Brother Lozano wasn’t there so we set a date for
next Friday to return.  Sister Lozano said their boss was there and invited us
to meet him and his wife.  They are very nice people and we enjoyed talking to
them.  I got talking farming with him.  I mentioned that we saw a lot of palay
on the roads drying.  He said he had a dryer, and asked if I would like to see
it.  I have been wondering why they didn’t build a tumbler dryer and thought
that was what he was referring to.  I commented about his dryer and he invited
me to see it.  He took us to the shed and then opened the back door and showed
me a slag of concrete about the size of a basketball court.  Mae was as surprised
as I, for she also thought it would be a piece of machinery.  Oh well, at least
it isn’t out on the highway driving.  We got home about 8PM and got something
to eat before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, October 11, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke during the night and couldn’t go back to
sleep so set up in the recliner, finally going to sleep there.  We spent all
morning working on the presentation I have to give in the Leadership Training
that will be held this afternoon.  I made some overhead slides by taking
picture with my camera and printing them out on the transparency.  Mae would
work on the CMIS for Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch when ever I got of the
computer.  The training went well although it was an hour late getting
started.  No one showed up for the Health Fair meeting so it is planned for
next week.  We did visit the Santo’s this evening and gave them a message on Sacrificing
for the Church,  After we went over to the Silvia’s and bought 43K of rice from
him.  He got it by trading time working on a computer for a family in Guimba.  Roger
told us that Alvin Pilien was questioned about the robberies that have been
taking place with the Elders apartments.  The last robbery took place last
Sunday between 3PM and 5PM.  Roger said that Alvin could not have been involved
with that one because he and Roger were together doing Home Teaching at that
time.  Again this evening we were informed that thief’s had broke into the
Guimba Chapel, last night and stole a lot of equipment.  This is really
becoming a real problem and worry.  We are tired tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, October 12, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended the rebroadcast of the Sunday
Sessions of General Conference at the San Jose Stake center.  We really enjoyed
the conferences messages.  When we got home this afternoon, we lay down and
took a nap.  We had Elder Ragasa and Elder Clam come over this evening for
dinner.  They went with us over to Brother and Sister Gasmenia but they were
not there as they had taken their baby into the hospital due to asthma.  Sister
Gajonera was there tending the Children, she is Sister Gasmenia’s mother.  I
wrote our family letter today and this evening.  Everyone is very concerned
with all the robbery’s that is taking place with the missionary’s apartments
and the chapels.  I fell asleep in the recliner so Mae stayed up until after
midnight typing letters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, October 13, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke before 6AM but let Mae sleep in.  Time
sure went by fast today and we wondered just what we got done.  We made some
calls about the Doria boys and the possibility of getting wheelchairs for them,
but the family doesn’t think they want them.  I entered some bills into the
budget.  That always takes time.  Mae did get a little done on the CMIS for the
Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  We called Mike and Becky, just mainly to see how
they are doing.  It is their 13<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary as the time
difference made it Sunday evening there.  We visited with Mike for about an
hour, but sure enjoyed it.  I went down to the Munoz Chapel and visited with
Brother Mico about the work he and Ronald Dator is doing and asked them to
check out the speaker system and give me a written report about it.  We went
over to the San Jose Stake Center and tried the projector there onto our
computer, it works great.  We also talked with President Apoa about doing some
training in his Stake.  We did some shopping while in San Jose, also ate at
Jollibees.  I got a e-mail off written to Elder and Sister Clarks son, but
don’t have his address, so will have to call them for that.  Mae sent a short
e-mail to our children asking if they could help us find school books for Doria
boys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, October 14, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning.  We
came back and read scriptures.  I fixed breakfast while Mae started working on
enter data from the CMIS for Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  She worked most of
the day on it.  Brother Silvia came by to return a video he had borrowed.  He
stayed and we visited.  I fixed lunch then Brother Silvia and I went out
delivering reminders of the Health Fair meeting on Saturday.  The last one was
to (I believe) Brother Eze Ganzagban, who lives way out in the bukas (farms). 
He is the assistant PTA President of a school out there.  He wanted me to see
the class rooms and told me that two of them get flooded when it rains.  President
Garcia has put in for the C.R. to be improved, but they want to raise the
floors with the money instead.  I have to agree with them, but I don’t have
much to say about it.  I really felt the pressure of being a minority.  The
children crowded around to see a white person.  It was very interesting.  I
wish that I would have had the camera with me.  This evening Mae and I visited
the Galletes family and gave a presentation of making decisions.  We wrote down
the differences between the Catholic Church and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints to help them see the need to decide.  It went quite well although we
took to long.  I hope we did some good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Last night I slept part of the night in the
chair.  This morning Mae couldn’t get me to wake up so she let me sleep in for
a while.  President Clark called me and told me that President Brimhall has
decided that we will pickup the assignment of the Paniqui District.  That will
put a lot more travel and time on us, but I think it is a right choice.  Mae spent
most of the morning cleaning and getting ready for the Maharry’s and
Montemayor’s who are coming.  They called a couple of times, not finding the
way, but thanks for cell phones, they got here ok.  The three men discussed the
training for the 25<sup>th</sup> of this month for the Tarlac Stake and the
Paniqui District.  The three women visited and discussed some training they are
to do.  Marlyn prepared a nice dinner for us and we enjoyed the visit as we
ate.  It was good to meet Sister Lea or Laya (not sure which) Montemayor.  They
left shortly after dinner with plans of us getting back together next Tuesday
at the Maharry’s.  Mae worked every spare minute on entering the CMIS data into
the computer and was able to finish the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> branch by evening.
We had a young man come by this afternoon.  He was selling safety devises for
the LP gas tanks.  I was very interested in the devises and think we will get
two of them for the tanks we have on our stoves.  The thing that was
interesting is that he was surprised that we were missionaries as he is a R.M.
himself.  He showed us a couple of things we should do for the safety of the
tanks and the types of tanks that that are the safest.  I sent off a couple of
e-mails concerning mission work.  Mae had me prepare some pictures and send
them to Elder Jex, Elder Ragasa and Eva Gajonera this evening.  It was
after11PM before I finished my journal and we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in this morning, with Mae getting up at
6AM but I didn’t get up until almost 7AM.  It seems that getting up that late
really puts you behind the schedule.  Prayers, Scripture study, exercise,
companion planning and if we can get all that in, it takes a couple of hours or
longer.  Add showers, getting dressed and ready, and preparing breakfast and
before you know it, it is time for lunch.  We worked on the computer most of
the day.  Mae entered CMIS data into the Munoz 2nd data file, plus she worked
on some of the training information for the 25<sup>th</sup>.  Brother Mico and
Ronald Dator came over to show me the bill for the repairs on the electrical
problems at the Church in connection with the water pump.  They also told me of
the things they found wrong with the speaker system.  I wrote up a report to go
to President Apao as to the suggested problems and solutions, also added a bid
to repair those problems.  After writing it down, I typed it up on the computer
and printed it out so Ronald could have a copy and a copy to go to President
Apao.  This evening I also created the records for the Branch Organization
Reports for the Paniqui District.  Before we know it time had gone by and it
was after 10PM before I got my journal entry and to bed.  It really rained hard
this afternoon.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went walking at the collage this morning. 
Rain was threatening, so we walked inside the covered basketball court.  There
was a young lady that was also walking there that we said hi to, and she came
over and walked with us.  We found out some about her, but should have found
out more.  Her husband is in Canada working, I thought she said she was a
member of the church, but Mae thinks it is her sister that is the member and
she has three children.  We think she lives in Munoz, but she and Mae were
talking and I don’t hear too well, so didn’t follow the conversation very
well.  We attended District meeting this morning.  We got two new Elders in
this week.  Elder Stewart from Utah County was one of them, but we don’t think
he is related to Becky’s family.  I was really impressed with him.  We talked
to Elder Sant about some of the problems he is having out in Guimba.  I sure
left in a confused state that has remained with me the rest of the day.  Mae
worked on the CMIS for Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch, getting another 100 records
added.  Brother Mico and Ronald Dator came over with a revision to the bid on
the speaker repair.  We later went to San Jose and took the bid to President
Apao.  We went to visit the Lozano family and gave them a lesson on the
Proclamation to the Family.   I’m sure tired tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke about 3AM concerned about this assignment
to train leaders.  I was up for a while, and then fell asleep in the chair. 
Just before the alarm went of at 5AM I got back in bed.  We didn’t get up until
5:30AM.  We went walking at the collage where we talked over ideas as we
walked.  After getting home we did our regular exercises, showered and got
ready.  I cooked breakfast and after eating, did up the dishes.  We started
planning on the things we need to do, when Brother Silvia came over.  He and
Heidi are having marriage problems and she went home to her parents yesterday. 
We talked to him for quite a while. We had him stay and eat lunch with us.  I
gave him some advise, but later today I got thinking about it and don’t know
just what to do.  I told him he needed to get council from his Branch
President, but didn’t think about the fact that Sister Gajonera, the Branch
President’s wife, and he were once sweethearts.  There is so many problems over
here that I don’t know how to fix, that my head feels like I am swimming, and I
not sure I know how to swim.  I text President Mercado to find out if we were
holding District Presidency meeting and got a text back just saying “No.”   We
attended a meeting for the planning of the Health Fair and only ½ of those that
should have been there showed up.  We stopped to visit the Santos but they
weren’t home.  We chased around trying to get some copies made.  By the time we
got home, I was fit to be tied.  Mae kept busy working on the computer most of
the evening.  I read two articles out of the Ensign.  This mission calling is
the hardest challenge I think I have ever had.  There is so much to do and I
don’t know where to even begin.  We have dogs that have barked and howled all evening
and no one even cares.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended the meetings at Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch this morning and then attended them at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch this
afternoon.  We did it as they were both having the Primary programs today.  We
are concerned as neither Branch’s are holding Y. M. or Y. W. programs.  They
are not holding the primary program very well either.  After Church we stayed
for a meeting on the Health Fair.  Following that President Mercado had me meet
with him and President Nuque, plus Brother Damacio to discuss disciplinary
action on a couple.  We brought Elder Clam and Elder Ragasa home with us and
cooked muffins, potatoes and eggs and brownies for dinner.  Today was busy and
full.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a great day today!  It’s “P” day and we
went with the Elders on the Zone Activity.  We met out in Lupoa at 7:00 a.m. 
At least the Elders did and they played basketball till about 9:00.  We got
there about 8:00 a.m.    It is 6:00 p.m. and we are back from the zone
activity.  We had a great time.  We watched the Elders play basketball for
awhile and I also talked with several young boys and girls who were on their
way to school, but saw us and were curious so came over.  They were really cute
and I took some pictures of them.  I love the people over here, and especially
the children.  They are so cute.  From the church, we walked to the palanki
(outdoor market) where we got in trikes and rode almost to the dam, but had to
walk the last half mile as it was too steep for the trikes.  The area and water
at the dam was beautiful.  There was also a shady place where we could sit and
visit and eat.  Several of us went hiking.  Dad and I walked partway around the
dam and took pictures as we went.  When we returned, several of the Elders had
been cooking the chickens.  They marinated the whole chickens in a bucket, put
a pole through them, secured them on the bamboo pole with wire, made a fire
with charcoal and barbecued the chickens.  They had already cooked a big pot of
rice so when the chickens were ready, they served us the rice and chicken.  Dad
and I had a whole chicken between us.  We ate the food like the Filipinos do –
with our fingers.  It was the best chicken I have ever eaten.  The rice was
delicious also.  It was fun being with the Elders, they are great.  It was a
fun day.  We hiked down the hill and the trikes were there waiting for us. 
When they brought us, they were told what time to come and get us.  From there
we put four Elders in our car and went to the Lapao Elder’s home and dad put
legs on their beds.  They just had their springs and mattresses on the floor
before.  We then went to the Elder’s apartment in San Icredo and did the same
to their beds.  The Elder’s from Guimba were there so we took them with us.  We
stopped in San Jose at the book store and were able to buy some school books
for the boys in Guimba.  I didn’t know they would have school books, but was
told to look there, and sure enough they had some – so, guess we’re fine for
now with these books.  We are sunburned and tired, but had a wonderful time. 
Mae me a haircut before we showered, and then we went over to the Silvia family
and did a Family Home Evening for them, plus we talked with them about the
marriage covenant and gave them some papers on marriage that Mae had on the
computer to give to the Elders when they are finished with their missions.  Mae
stayed up longer than I did to finish the family letter and get it set off.  We
were very tired when we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We left at 7:15 a.m. to go to Camiling to the Maharry’s home
to meet with Brother &amp; Sister Montemayors as Elder Maharry, Brother
Montemayor and I spent most of the day putting our Power Point Presentations
together for the Priesthood Leadership Training on Saturday.  Sister Maharry
worked with us and Mae and Sister Montemayor enjoyed visiting.  On the way this
morning, we stopped at the Elder’s home in Guimba to put legs on their beds. 
We then drove them to the Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Chapel where they were to meet
with the new Branch President.  We stopped on the way home, just South of
Paniqui at some roadside stands where they were selling Christmas decorations. 
Their were over 2 blocks of these stands on both sides of the road and when it
gets dark, they turn many of the decoration lights on and it is just simply
beautiful.  These decorations are different from the ones in the United States
as they are large colorful flowers made out of colored plastics, etc.  We
bought 4 large flowers and a large star.  Mae was on the computer until about
10:00 p.m., but I went to sleep about 9:00 p.m..  We were sure tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I got up about 2:00 a.m. and wrote down some thoughts I had
about some job opportunities, then I also did some planning on part of the
presentation which I have to make on Saturday.  I woke Mae shortly after 5:00
a.m. and we went walking at the college.  Most of the day I spent on the
computer working on my power point presentation for Saturday.  Mae feels we
need another computer as she needs to get on the computer also.  We sent a
letter to President Clark concerning some problems that we see, asking him to
comment on it.  Mae worked on her talks which she will give at the training on
Saturday.  She drove to the copy shop to get copies made.  Mae also entered
some data from Munoz 2’s CMIS while I went to get the copies later and was
planning to go to the Church to get another picture taken of the Branch
Presidency for my presentation, but President Gajonera text me saying he had to
go to San Jose so would call me when he returned.  Elder Hyer called us today
as he had tried to call us several times yesterday on both our land line and
our cell phone since they had planned to come to visit us.  We were at the
Maharry’s so couldn’t answer the landline and they had the wrong phone number
for our cell phone.  We will get together with them soon.  Mae talked with
Elder Hyer about Brother Silvia and if he had any job opportunities for him. 
He said he did and could get the list to us on Saturday when we meet together
for the training for Paniqui and Camiling District Conferences.  He told Mae
about the Employment training they were doing tonight and said it would be good
for Brother Silvia to come to it, but didn’t know if that would be possible
since it is so far away for us and it would be late when we returned home.  I
talked to President Clark about taking Brother Silvia in our car, and he agreed
that we should do it as the Silvia’s are desperate.  I called Brother Silvia,
but he was out working in Guimba.  I called and talked with him out there, but
he felt he couldn’t go tonight.  We would have liked to help them, but we were
a little relieved as we have so much to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking at the collage this
morning.  It was very nice as the weather was perfect and collage is out for
some kind of a break and will be out until the 1<sup>st</sup> of November.  It
is much quieter with school out.  We have worked all day on the computer, Mae
did odd jobs she wanted to do when ever I would get off for a break.  I worked
all day on my presentation, using power point, for Saturdays Leadership
Training.  We had the salesman that came last week and showed us a safety
devise for the LP Gas tanks.  I bought 2 of them for our tanks and had them
installed with a special hose that has asbestos in it so it is not subject to
heat, also a chemical that rats and mice won’t eat, so they won’t chew on the
hose.  It was 10 PM before I got my presentation completed.  I need to make
just a few minor changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We didn’t go walking this morning because I woke
early thinking about ways to help the members here in the Philippines.  We
wrote up a letter for President Brimhall with some solutions on it as to a way
to increase employment, which is in my opinion, the #1 problem here.  We
attended Zone Meeting.  During the meeting the power went off.  We later found
out that it will be off the complete day, coming back on this evening.  After
meeting we went over to the Corpus’s and left a note that we would come by this
evening.  Marlyn had dinner ready when we got home.  We took a nap, then went
to San Jose and drew out some money from the bank.  We stopped at the copy
store to give them some more items to have copied.  Because the power is out
they don’t have the other sheets finished.  We went grocery shopping.  We
stopped long enough to put the groceries in the house, then picked up Marlyn at
her home and went to visit the Lozano family.  Brother Lozano wasn’t there so
we only stayed for a few minutes.  We took Marlyn back to her house, and then
went to the copy shop.  They worked until 7:30 PM getting our copies ready for
us.  We visited the Corpus family for a few minutes, and then came home and ate
supper.  We tried to watch a DVD that Mike sent us, but we couldn’t get it to
play.  I worked on my presentation until 11Pm before getting it finished and
ready for tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up early and left for Tarlac by 5AM.  We
didn’t have much traffic this morning so made good time.  We were in Tarlac by
6AM but couldn’t find any thing open for breakfast except 7-11 so ate there. 
No one came to the Stake Center until after 7:30AM so we just had time to set
up for our training.  Training went fairly well and I think we gave them some
help and hopefully the Branches will call us or the Maharry’s for individual
help.  We took time to get something for lunch, and then went to Paniqui and
gave another training there.  Sister Brimhall, Sister Clark and Mae gave a training
presentation also at Paniqui that was well attended.  Mae and I went to Cindy’s
and got something to eat before returning home.  I was completely excused when
we got home, and so went to bed.  Mae stayed up writing the family letter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went to the Panique District Conference this
morning.  We got there at 8:05AM and there were many youth waiting to greet us,
as ushers.  They welcomed us and pinned an orchid corsage on Mae and put a
ribbon with orchids &amp; other flowers, over my head.  You would think we were
Royalty.  We shook hands with most there, which were many.  The 18 Elders, from
the Paniqui Zone, were there in line to shake everyone’s hand also.  By 10
minutes to 9AM, most of the seating in the Chapel, the chairs in cultural hall,
and stage area were filled.  A prelude was being played starting at 8:40, or
earlier, then the choir started singing a prelude number at 8:50AM.  I was very
impressed to tears.  Every thing was so well organized and the choir numbers
were so special and appropriate.  The District Presidency are all great men and
they gave excellent talks.  Sister Brimhall and President Brimhall were the
main speakers and, of course, they were excellent.  We really enjoyed the
complete conference and a short meeting after for all new converts, recently
activated members and investigators.  The attendance was very impressive.   We
enjoyed shaking hands and meeting them.  What a difference in the two
Districts.  One on the bottom and the other on the top.  We will just have to
work harder with the Guimba District, but, hopefully, it will improve.  It was
refreshing to see the Church doing so great in Paniqui and it lifted our
spirits.   We came home and got some lunch and took a nap.  We attended a
meeting for the Health Fair, that was quite disappointing because there was few
there to report how their committees are coming.   I am afraid that we will not
have the help that is needed when it comes time for the fair.  We invited Elder
Clam and Ragasa to come home with us for dinner.  They then went with us over
to visit Roger and Heidi Silvia.  It was after 9PM when we got them home.  By
the time I got to my journal it was late and I couldn’t stay awake, so I quite
and we went to bed.  I finished my journal Monday morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had several people come this morning, Ronald
Dator came to hook up the Christmas lights, the landlord came to have us sign
some papers, while he was here I showed him a couple of problems, and Sister
Mercado came to alter my white shirts.  Elder and Sister Hyer stopped in to
visit as they were going through our area.  We had them stay and eat dinner
with us.  It gave Elder Hyer and I a chance to visit about my ideas to form a
coop, but that doesn’t look like it would be posible for the Church to get
involved in any way with it.  We went over to San Jose this afternoon to go to
the bank, but they were closed by the time we got there.  We bought Mae some
slippers, bought her a fan and got her some new frames for her glasses.  The
frames are the more expensive ones and they cost us P600 or about $11.00, they
would have cost over $150 dollars at home.  We worked on the computer for a
while, then Roger Silvia came over and tried to find out why the DVD’s Mike
sent us won’t play on our computer.  I couldn’t stay up longer as I was falling
asleep as I tried to type my journal entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I worked on preparing a presentation for Lupoa
Ward.  The landlord’s son came with two other fellows and repaired the gate,
but I don’t think they did it right.  They also replaced a light in the front
room.  I went to the bank this afternoon and did a little shopping.  We worked
on presentations or on entering data from the CMIS all day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, October 29, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went walking this morning.  The temperature
is perfect and nice.  The nights are cooling off so that we can open the
windows and get some cool air.  It is sure nice from the heat that we have
had.  The landlord came and adjusted the toilet; Sister Mercado came with my
shirts that she had altered for me.  We worked on preparing presentations all
day.  We went out to the Lupoa Ward at 2PM and met with the Elders and the
Bishop.  We went over some training with them and showed them how to correct
the Church Membership records.  Roger Silvia was at our place when we got
home.  His interview for the job was canceled, so he still does not know about
a job.  He downloaded a different DVD player onto our computer and we were able
to see the pictures Mike had sent to us.  This evening we again worked on
presentations until late.  It was after 11 PM before we got to bed and I didn’t
get my journal entered before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended Zone Conference this morning and
really enjoyed being taught by President And Sister Brimhall.  Brother Mico was
at the chapel and was looking very sad.  I visit with him a while but do not
know if I helped him or not.  He has many problems, mainly is lonely with his
wife leaving him and not being able to get a divorce from her because of the
laws here in the Philippines.  He wants the church to solve his problems and I
told him that the church couldn’t solve his problems but that he had to look
for answers him self and then seek for guidance from the Lord.  We came home
this afternoon and worked the rest of the day on our presentation for tomorrow
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, October 31, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I worked some on our presentation
this morning, and then we attended District meeting.  Mae cooked chocolate chip
cookies for the Elders.  They sure enjoy a treat.  This may be the last time we
will meet with some of, because of the next transfer will make a lot of
changes.  We came home and worked on our presentation until time to leave at
3:30PM.   We got to Tarlac shortly after 5PM.  We had plenty of time to get set
up for the Fireside.  With the use of the Stake’s projector, we were able to
use the power point presentation.  Our timing went well and the Stake President
summarized the evening with an appropriate message.   Brother &amp; Sister
Montemayor, Elder &amp; Sister Maharry and Elder &amp; Sister Hyer were all in
attendance.  I visited with the Stake President and offered our help where ever
he needed it.  After the Fireside, Elder Hyer invited us to stay the evening
with them rather than drive home this late.  Not only is it late but being that
it is Halloween; there may be several drunks on the road.  We appreciated the
offer and follow them to their place.  Elder &amp; Sister Maharry also followed
us to the Hyer’s home and we all visited for a while.  The Hyer’s have a nice
home that is very comfortable for them.  They have three bedrooms and two
bathrooms.  They had ordered a extra bed so that they could have guests come. 
We really enjoyed the evening and their hospitality.</p>
