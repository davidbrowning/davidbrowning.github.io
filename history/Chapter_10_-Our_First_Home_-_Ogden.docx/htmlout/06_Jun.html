<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
got up at 6:20 AM in order to drive to Guimba to meet with the Branch
Presidency of the 3rd Branch.  I let Mae sleep in until I left.  It was raining
and heavy traffic, so I was until 8:10AM getting there.  The Branch President
didn't get there for another few minutes.  We had a good meeting and I turned
the Home Teaching over to them, with the offer to help.  I came back home and
got Mae, and then went back to Munoz 1st Branch.  We only attended their
Priesthood and Relief Society meetings.  We then attended the Baptism of April
Sarianto.  From there we came home and started dinner, before returning and
attending Sacrament meeting at the Munoz 2nd Branch.  After that meeting we
took a video over to Brother Silvia, and also took him a copy of the plans we
have for Home Teaching.  He was excited about it, and would like to be the
Branch Executive Secretary over Home Teaching.  We came home and ate dinner,
and then went out visiting a family, with the Elders, which just live 2 houses west
of us.  I was a while on the computer catching up my journal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
woke early, but let Mae sleep in a little longer.  We seem to have been busy
all day trying to get caught up on recording of bills, which we spent too much
last month.  Trying to get organized and e-mailing our family, etc.   This
evening I called Home Depot and found that I still owed them over $400.00, so I
just had her write a draw on my checking account for the balance.  I am fairly
sure that when I was doing Nolan's home that I paid a payment of about that
much in cash and I don't think it was ever credited.  But I couldn't find my
receipt so I guess that is water under the bridge.  We were late getting to
bed.</p>

got up and prepared breakfast for the Elders.  They helped us with Tagalog
after eating.  We worked on the Home Teaching program most of the afternoon.  I
felt very discouraged over the language, finances and just things in general. 
We had an appointment with Brother and Sister Umipig's this evening.  We gave
them a presentation on &quot;Jacob's Dream&quot;.  It went very well although a
little long.  I had trouble getting the TV and video working together, but
finally realized I had one wire wrong.  They are special and are trying.  They
felt the presentation was just what they needed.  We ate a late dinner before
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up and went walking this morning.  We could tell that it has been a while
since we have done that.  We have spent most of the day working on instructions
for the Home Teaching program.  We did go to San Jose for some groceries and
bought Mae an ice cream cone.  We went to visit Sister Agliba who we have heard
has been sick.  She is down with an infected thyroid.  We suggested that she
have a blessing and we will see if the Elders can come with me tomorrow.  We
went to the Corpus's and showed them the CD, &quot;Finding Faith in
Christ&quot;.  They really enjoyed it and felt the Spirit of the show.  We
really enjoyed being with them and set an appointment to return next Wednesday
evening.  Mae called the Medical Missionaries when we got home to find out more
about Sister Agliba's condition.  We ate dinner and the evening was about gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in, getting up and preparing breakfast for Elder Jex and Elder Barrett. 
After breakfast they helped us with the Tagalog language.  They then went with
us to Sister Leonarda Oamil Flores Agliba and gave her a Priesthood blessing. 
She was feeling much better than she did yesterday when we visited her.  While
there we visited another family with the Elders.  We took the Elders back to
their home and we went to San Jose, where we got some money from the bank.  We
paid our phone bill and then came home.  We took a nap, and then spent the rest
of the day working on the computer.  Time sore goes by fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Before
breakfast, I checked the e-mail to see if Elder Persson had replied to our
e-mail.  He hadn't but there was an e-mail from David.  That made me a little
home sick.  We had District meeting which we always enjoy although we don't
report much.  We just enjoy being with the Elders and seeing how they are
doing.  We had Elder DeAlday and Elder Villanueva come home with us.  They are
assigned to work in the Rezal area, which is quite a ways South East of San
Jose.  Elder Villanueva is a new missionary, getting here a month after we
did.  President Brimhall asked us if we could give him a little TLC as he is
homesick and needs some encouragement.  We had Marlyn prepare a nice dinner
which we enjoyed, then had them help us translate some of our Home Teaching
presentations into Tagalog.  We also watched the DVD of &quot;Finding Faith in
Christ&quot; before we drove them to their home.  I am constantly amazed at how
at ease Mae can make people feel and the way she can handle each situation. 
She is sure a special person and to think that she is mine, tops it all.  We
enjoyed the drive to take them home as it is really out in the country; they
are assigned to the Rezal area.  When we got back to San Jose, we stopped at
CVC and got some groceries.  We prepared and ate dinner, and then I transferred
some pictures from our camera to the computer and of course Mae wanted to see
them, so did I, so that took the rest of the evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt;punctuation-wrap:simple;
text-autospace:none'>            We did get up in time to go walking this
morning.  We walked down to where they have a herd of caribou cows that they
are using for dairy milk.  It seems strange to me as they don't look like a
dairy animal, as they don't have much of a bag.  Elder Jex says he has tried
the milk and it is very good.  I don't know what the production is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt;punctuation-wrap:simple;
text-autospace:none'>            This morning we had a Medical Mission to
attend.  We weren’t sure what it consisted of or what to expect, but was very
excited when we got there.  There is a group from the United States that has
formed a foundation here that helps provides financing for Chapters here to
give medical and dental assistants to those that couldn’t otherwise afford it. 
The 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor in the District Presidency is the Chairman of this
Chapter, so has the Branches rotates putting this program on, I think, every 6
Months.  They have volunteer Doctors and Dentists come and they also provide
prescribed medication.  I didn’t get in to see the dentist, but they had 3 or 4
Doctors that work just as fast as they could, but showing great patients and
care for each person, for over 4 hours.  There could have been 200 to 300
people that went through during that time.  The only thing that I wish is that
we would have had a separate area and shown some Church videos while people
were waiting and given out some pamphlets.  There was many less active and
non-members there.  Oh well, next time we will know what to expect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt;punctuation-wrap:simple;
text-autospace:none'>            This afternoon, I joined a Priesthood
activity.  We went bowling and that was a new experience.  The alley is about
the same as ours, 50 to 60 years ago, with pin boys to set up the pins, but the
ball is about the size of a softball or just a little larger.  There are no
finger holes.  You throw three balls per frame.  I am not sure how spars and
strikes are scored as I didn’t see many of those, although I got a spare once. 
You just bowled in your street shoes, so I bowled in cowboy boots.  We also
played some pool.  It was interesting and we had fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt;punctuation-wrap:simple;
text-autospace:none'>            We also had Elder Jex and Elder Barrett over
for dinner this evening as it is Elder Barrett's 21st Birthday.  Elder Jex
isn't feeling the best so asked if Elder Barrett and I could administer to him,
which we did.  These Elders sure keep going, and are doing a great job.</p>

to meet with the Branch President and go over the Home Teaching program with
him.  We stayed for their meeting block and enjoyed the spirit there.  The
Branch President is a young R.M. and is running most of the branch by himself. 
He had 4 speakers for Sacrament Meeting but ask if we would set on the stand
and if there was time, he wanted us to speak.  President Mercado was also there
to visit, so we told him not to worry about us speaking.  He did have us speak
for 5 minutes each.  We came home and got something to eat.  The Elders stopped
by and went with us to visit a neighbor two houses down.  We shared the DVD of
&quot;Building Faith in Christ&quot; with them.  We were tired and ready for
bed tonight.</p>

text-autospace:none'>            We got up early and left for Angeles.  We
stopped at McDonald's in Tarlac, for breakfast and then we stopped at the Sony
Dealer to have them check out our camera.  They had us leave it as they had to
have time to check it out.  We went on to the Mission Home and with the Elders
help, we soon found out our problem on the Home Teaching program.  We went over
to the dentist and she says Mae's tooth is doing better, so she worked on it
more and wants her to come back in about another three weeks.  While Mae was in
the dentist office, I had the car washed.  When we got back to the mission
home, Mae and Sister Clark went shopping while Brother Clark and I went looking
for computer supplies.  The four of us then went out to eat.  It was sure good
to be with them and just visit.  President and Sister Brimhall came home just
as we were ready to leave for home, so we stayed a few more minutes and visited
with them.  They are sure great people.  It was 8PM before we got home, and
then brought things in and put them away.  Mae wanted to check the e-mails and
we had a couple.  One from Jeff that was really cute.  Mike sent us a picture
of Taylor. Mae then called Sandi and visited a few minutes.  She is worried
that Sandi is going too fast and just wanted to check on her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt;punctuation-wrap:simple;
text-autospace:none'>            While with the Clark's we were told that in
the one area there is a group that is trying to get the Philippine government
changed to communism.  They are hid up in the hills and call them self
&quot;The Gadianton Robbers&quot;.  They are trying to find some Americans that
they might kidnap and hold for ransom to get money from the United States. 
President Brimhall, therefore, had to transfer all American missionaries out of
the area.  Also, last week while President and Sister Brimhall were in one of
the areas, they were stopped at a check point and with guns pointed at them
were questioned as to their business in the area.</p>

We rested and relaxed as we were worn out from the trip yesterday.  Mae studied
on Tagalog. We worked on the computer and did some preparation for next
Saturday.  I wrote a letter that we will send to Mike for Jack Persil about the
house.  Mae sent some personal e-mails to family and friends this evening.</p>

breakfast.  I spent a long time on the internet trying to renew our
subscription with Norton Anti Virus, and ended up just frustrated.  I was so
upset, that I took a nap.  Mae woke me for lunch.  We worked all afternoon on
our presentation for Saturday.  This evening we went to the Corpus's and showed
the video, &quot;Mans Search for Happiness&quot;.  It went well and we felt a
good spirit with them.  I still feel the need to learn the Tagalog language, in
order to do a good job.  We came home and Mae wanted to get on the computer to
correct some of her Tagalog studies, but the computer asks us to update some of
the system, so we did.  While it was doing that the Norton Anti Virus renewal came
up so we tried that again and we think this time it worked.  We got e-mails
from Shellie, Jeff, Mark and Georgia, plus a short one from Mike.  We sure
enjoy the e-mails.  It is like Mae said, &quot;It doesn't seem that we are
quite so far away with the e-mails.&quot;</p>

the Philippines have and became quite depressed with the great amount of work
that is needed here.  It is also depressing as to the amount of Tagalog that I
know or that I don't know.  We went walking at the collage, but found that it
is much more crowded now that school has restarted.  After breakfast and the
Elders didn't come over we call them and found that Elder Jex's is still quite
sick.  We took them some soup and crackers, along with some vitamins.  Before
lunch, we took a nap.  This afternoon we studied for a Home Teaching
presentation we are to make tomorrow at Gapan.  We figured our monthly bills
and are tight.  I visited with Elder Clark and ordered some Home Teaching
pamphlet.  I wrote Mark an e-mail and sent it.  Mae cooked a casserole and we
took part of it over to the Elders.  We worked on our Home Teaching
presentation for Saturday to be given in San Jose, St. Lsidro Branch.  We were
late getting to bed.</p>

leader there had asked us to talk to his district about Home Teaching.  We went
through Cabanatuan and that trip through there is usually 45 minutes or more,
but this time it only took us 10 minutes.  The reason why is the road is still
under construction, but this time they had the one lane closed due to having
trenches dug 1/2 way across the road.  The thing is that it was closed the
direction we were going.  I didn't know any other roads to take us through
Cabanatuan, so I went around the signs and took the main road anyway.  Well the
traffic was light and I only had to slow down when I came to a road closed
sign, just long enough to get through the traffic.  Maybe I was lucky, but I
didn't get stopped.  We got to Gapan early, so got to visit with some of the
missionaries before meeting started.  Our presentation went well.  After the
zone conference we decided to drive to Tarlac and get our camera.  We got there
just a noon and the shop was closed.  We went back to the mall and walked
around it, and then ate lunch at Jolly Bee's.  We went back to the shop and
waited another hour.  We finally decided that it was a Holliday and they were
closed.  I was upset that we had wasted three hours.  We studied for our
presentation tomorrow the rest of the evening.</p>

text-autospace:none'>            I was quite anxious about today, concerned
with how our presentation would go with us not speaking Tagalog.  We picked up
Elder Jex and Elder Barrett at 8 AM, and then went to the San Jose Stake
center, where we borrowed an overhead projector and copied some sheets.  I was
really glad that the Elders went with us because I sure had the directions wrong
to get to the St. Lsidro branch.  With there help we went right to it.  It is
North East from San Jose, maybe 10 miles.  That was really a humble Church
House.  It is old converted building, very small, but there was a good turn
out.  I was especially impressed when I found that the Branch only had 230
members and had about 30% activity.  That is the highest we have seen in the
Philippines.  Our presentation went well and the Spirit was there and felt.  We
came home and had some lunch.  I then went to District Presidency and Branch
Presidency in Guimba.  Again I was very anxious about that meeting.  It went
well and it turned out to be three meetings.  First the Branch Presidents and
District Presidency meeting went well, although most of it was in Tagalog.  We
then held a High Council meeting, which went well.  We then held a District
Presidency meeting and some decisions were made concerning the reorganization
of Munoz 2nd Branch, as President Maico's wife has left him.  The entire
Presidency including myself was included in the discussion and decision, and
then we took it before the Lord.  Also I brought up that the Branch Presidents
carried a heave load with out many of them having much help.  President Dasalla
said that they had clerks and Executive Secretaries, but none of them was
functioning.  He asked if I could train them next District and Branch
Presidency meeting.  I jumped at that as that is what I have been wondering how
to approach the District Presidency on Leadership Training.  While at Guimba, I
got the CMIS report, for Guimba 1st Branch, from the Elders assigned there. 
All together it was a pretty successful day.  After I got home, Mae and I went
to San Jose where we paid our drinking water bill, tried to get some money out
of the bank, but the ATM machine didn't work, so we only bought what we needed
at the groceries store.  We came home and got some dinner.  Mae wanted me to
check the inter-net for e-mail.  We got a cute letter from Kim.  Mae fell
asleep so I made my journal entries.  Then I did up the evening dishes.  Mae
woke up, so we played a game of Rummy.  That is the first game of Rummy we have
played since before Mom died and we would cheat so Mom could win.</p>

about Elder Jex's being sick.  We had some lunch and took a nap.  We picked the
Elders up for Sacrament meeting in the 2nd Branch, as Elder Barrett had to
speak this afternoon.  We enjoyed his talk although it was in Tagalog, and we

everything was ok.  We found out that Elder Jex and Elder Barker needs to go to

them to see the Doctors in Angeles.  Elder Jex has either an upper repertory
infection or T. B.  Elder Barker has a hernia that will need to be operated
on.  We stopped on the way in Tarlac and picked up our camera.  There was no
charge as they said it is just that our battery's need charging.  It took us
all day taking the Elders back and forth to the Doctors.  We did take time to
cash a check for two hundred dollars, also went out to eat with the Clarks.  We
did see President and Sister Brimhall for a minute, but they had to go to get
their drivers licenses renewed.  It was 9:30 PM before we got home, and then
had to get things in, so it was late getting to bed.</p>

Munoz Chapel, but no one was there.  As we debated as to why, Elder Clark and
the Elders from the office came.  They too thought it was there.  We went to
the San Jose Stake Center and found the meeting just starting.  The conference
was attended by President and Sister Brimhall, President Apoa from the San Jose
Stake, President Nuque from the Guimba District and all the Elders.  It was a
great conference and went well.  We got home at 4:30 PM, and then laid down for
a short nap.  We did some preparation for a presentation and went to the
Corpus's.  They were waiting for us to come.  They had a sign on the wall that
read, &quot;Welcome Elder and Sister Browning&quot;, they are special.  We had
a very enjoyable evening with them, encouraging them to be and remain active,
and to work towards receiving their Temple Blessings.  They had prepared bread,
chicken, bananas, water for me and a Sprite for Mae.  We had to explain that
mission rules wouldn't allow us to eat the chicken, but thanked them for the
rest.  It rained hard while we were there and the water started coming in the
doorway.  Brother Corpus put on boots and went out to our car and got our boots
for us.  As we walked to the car, Mae stepped in the ditch and went over her
boots.  We laughed most of the way home over that.  I am not feeling the best
tonight.</p>

Mae asks Marlyn to go to town to buy some for me.  I felt a little better a

The Elders came by and changed our back tire on the car, for it is low.  Mae
has worked most of the past two days entering data for the Guimba 1st Branch. 
The Elders came by again to check on me.  They stayed and watched the DVD

the data for the Guimba 1st Branch from their CMIS.  She is quite an amazing
girl.  Roy e-mailed us and we realized that they are not receiving our
e-mails.  I think I have his address with one extra character in it.  I
corrected it and sent him several letters and a picture.  I printed a picture
for one of the girls our Branch that wanted us to write in her journal.  I seem
to get feeling better for a little while, then it will turn around and I will
start hurting again.  I was in a lot of pain so Mae asked Elder Jex and Elder
Barrett if they could come over and administer to me at 9:30 PM, which they
did.  I am feeling some better so decided to write in my journal before going
to bed.  I think I will try sleeping in the big chair with my feet on the
couch.  That is the closest I can come to a recliner.</p>

home.  Part of the time I will get some better but then it will come back in
different forms.  Most of the times my hand feel raw and itches but if I scratch
them they become worse.  This is also happening to my feet, put not as much as
my hands.  Some times my scalp will hurt and even the moving of my hair hurts. 
This is very strange and we feel confused as to what to do.              President
Maico heard from the Elders that I wasn't feeling well, so came by to see me. 
While here he asked if we knew he was being released as branch President.  He
said that he understood why and then told us of his problems.  His wife left to
work abroad when their daughter was 14 months.  She went to California.  She
came home once after about two years for a vacation.  She hadn't seemed to hold
a job for long because she would get upset with those who she was working for
and leave.  This, of course, made each new job harder to get.  After returning,
she has never written or contacted any of her family.  Their daughter is now 6
years old.  He and his daughter live with her parents and they will not talk
about their daughter.  He feels they have become inactive because they are embarrassed
about their daughter.  He tried, through a person he knows that works in
immigration, to find her, and it was reported that they think they located her,
except she does not admit to being married, having a child or being a member of
the Church.  He thinks she is five or six months pregnant now.  He was told
that for $50,000 he could try to have his marriage annulled, however only 10%
of those that try that are successful and those are ones that spend that much
or more under the table.  The other choice would be for him to go to the United
States and there get a divorce and then move back.  Of course both options are
ridiculous for he is very poor.  In fact, he has been working for the Church as
a janitor, but they are letting him go and that will leave him out of
employment.  I am really concerned over his problem for I just don't see a
solution.  I called Elder Clark and visited with him about my concerns.  After
we visited a while he said he would visit with President Brimhall about it.  </p>

resident doctor, on call, at the government hospital and so she could leave to

until tomorrow to have her look at me.  She did suggest that we go to her
friend, a classmate of hers, Dr. Arnel Domingo, who has his practice here in
Munoz and he could look at me today.    We told her we would rather wait for
her.           Mae had e-mailed Jennie Porter and she e-mailed back this

dressed.  We did some work on the Home Teaching files for the Guimba 1st
Branch.  We received a very nice e-mail from Shellie.  We also received 5
pictures from Mike and a short note about a camping trip they took with Jeff,
Gail and Scott's family.  We didn't hear from Dr Marcel, so Mae tried to
contact her.  When this didn't work, we decided to see if we could find the
Doctor, here in Munoz, that she had recommended.  Mae had me stop at Umipig's
to see if they were home.  They were and took us down to find the Dr.  He was
closed for the day, so they want us to come back in the morning at 8:15 AM and
they will again accompany us to visit him.  We went shopping at CVC, any way; I
drove Mae over and waited in the car while she did the shopping.  It took her
longer because she enjoys visiting with the children.  As we came home,
President Maico and his daughter, Mishelle, were just leaving our place.  We
had them come back and visit.  Dr. Marcel had tried to call us and couldn't
reach us, so she called her parents (probably at the time they were with us)
and when she didn't reach them, called President Maico and asked him to contact
us and get me into Dr. Domingo.  We thanked him, and then visited a while with
him.  Mae enjoyed entertaining his daughter.  I still feel deeply concerned
about his job situation.  After they left, we had some dinner, and then Mae
started working on a letter to her family.  I put in a conference tape and
watched about an hour of that.  I called Scott to see if he was able to ship
the acidophilus for us.  He was able to get one bottle, but thought he could
get the other two this evening and get them sent off.  It was good to visit for
a minute with him and hear of their camping trip with Mike's family and Jeff
and Gail.  I became very tired and uncomfortable so we went to bed, although
Mae soon got back up and continued to work on a letter for her family.  I woke
later very uncomfortable, so went into the front room to sleep sitting up.   
Mae woke up since she heard me in pain and we were up a while.  I sure miss my
recliner.</p>

Executive Secretaries, Branch Clerks, and Branch Finance Clerks.  I made up a
few notes.  Brother and Sister Umipig took us down to Dr. Domingo's and
remained with us the full time.  They are great people.  We were very impressed
with Dr. Domingo.  He is not pleased that I started the amoxicillin and feels that
I should change.  He checked me quite thoroughly and feels that I have an upper
respiratory infection.  He gave me a new drug, zithromax, and wants me to take
it for 5 days and come back next Tuesday.  I took a short nap after returning
home.  I just relaxed and rested as the Dr. told me to.  President Maico talked
to Mae and asks if we could give him $100.00 witch she told him I would have to
talk to him when I woke up.  I visited with President Nuque about him and was
advised not to.  I later called President Maico and told him that I couldn't. 
I tried to give him some counsel, but I think he just wanted the money. 
President Brimhall called this evening and was just concerned about me.  He is
so special.  We watched the Sunday Morning session of General Conference,
October 2002, it was really wonderful.  We have invented a new sandwich of
toast with peanut butter, honey and sliced bananas on it.  It is great!</p>
