<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
woke early, and so not to wake Mae, got up and wrote in my history.  We went to
the Doctors at 7:30 AM and had some blood drawn for tests.  We came back about
9:30AM for the results and an EKG test.  The Dr is concerned that my cholorstal
and uric acid levels being too high.  He asked about our diet and wants us to
check as to the way our food is prepared.  I really felt depressed with the
Doctors findings.  I paid the rent this morning and had a note with it as to
some lights that needed repair.  They came just as we were leaving to go to the
doctors.  They came back and did the repairs when we got back.  Elder Jex and
Elder Barrett came over and worked on our computer.  Then they made up
invitations for the Fireside on Saturday.  They also are interpreting the
pamphlet &quot;To the Home Teachers of the Church&quot;, a talk given by
President Ezra Taft Benson in 1987.  We made copies of the invitations and took
them to President Gajonera and President Neito.  President Neito said they were
going to come to see us as soon as his wife got home from school, as he had
heard that I was sick.  President Nuque also stopped and visited while we were
there.  We came home then worked on the Home Teaching Fireside for Saturday
until 9:30 PM, and then I entered my journal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
woke earlier than Mae again.  We spent much of the morning working on the
outline for our Fireside this Saturday.  President Nieto came by and we gave
him another sheet of announcements for the Fireside, plus we showed him the
Home Teaching program.  After lunch we laid down for a nap, Mae really didn't
go to sleep and soon got up to study Tagalog.  I slept 2 1/2 hours and got up
upset that I had slept so long.  We worked the rest of the afternoon and all evening
on the outline for the Fireside.  It was late when we got to bed.</p>

got up at 5:30 AM and had to hurry to get ready to go to Angeles.  It was 7:30
AM before we left.  Mae got on the inter-net to e-mail David our son and Nancy
Litchford about what the Doctor said asking both for advice.  I think we just
need to retake the tests.  We went directly to the dentist office.  I let Mae
off and then I went to an office supply and got a few items we needed.  The
dentist is concerned that she is going to have to pull Mae's tooth because all
the infection will not come out.  We will know that in a couple of weeks, or
the next time we come back in.  We went to the Mission Home, and then went out
to eat with the Clark's.  There was a vegetable market at the restaurant we ate
at, so we purchased some vegetables.  It was really enjoyable being with them
and just visiting.  We looked at some wood carved furniture and saw two corner
tables we would really like to buy and have shipped home.  Elder Clark stopped
at the post office on the way back to the Mission Home and our package from Bob
had arrived.  That was good timing.  We got home after 7 PM and washed the
vegetables and put them away.  Mae then made cakes for the Elders, for
tomorrow.  I helped her, and then entered my journal entry.  Elder Jex and
Elder Barrett came over this morning after we left.  We left the house open for
them.  They finished translating the Address given by President Ezra Taft
Benson, into Tagalog, for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
are enjoying our mission, but as we thought about the 4th of July, we really
have to be grateful for our Home Country.  With all its problems it's still the
greatest land we have known.   I called Elder Clark and ask him to buy the
overhead projector I had checked on yesterday and we would pay for it when they
come out Sunday.   We got ready and attended District meeting with all the
Elders.  We enjoy being with these young Elders and get a Spiritual lift just
being with them.  We took the cakes; Mae had made last night for the Elders to
eat after the meeting.  We took the Elders that are assigned to San Isidro
Branch out to their home as we wanted a couple of pictures they had.  We took
pictures of their pictures, but sadly when we tried to use them, they were to
blurry and wouldn't work.  We went from there to Guimba where we met the Elders
assigned to Guimba 3rd Branch and browed an overhead projector for tomorrow
evening.  It was after 3PM when we got home.  We ate some lunch, and then took
a short nap.  We went to San Jose to do some shopping and had some papers
copied for tomorrow evenings fireside.  We worked on our presentation until
after 11PM this evening, before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in, and then got up and showered.  President Mercado came over and
visited for a while.  He mainly came to let me know that we would hold our
meeting at 3PM today.  We enjoyed visiting with him.  I sure have empathy for
him and his employment in Manila.  He is gone all week and then has to take
care of his Church callings on the week ends.  We worked most of the day on our
presentation for this evening.  I attended District Presidency from 3 to 4:30
PM, and then came home and took a few minutes nap before returning to give the Fireside. 
It went well and we had about 1/4th as many there as should have been there,
but it turned out ok.  President Mercado said that we needed to make the one
overhead slide larger as people couldn't read it.  The Elders presentation
seems to go over well, although I couldn't understand it, it being in Tagalog. 
We were tired when we went got home, but stayed up and got something to eat. 
We made toast with peanut butter and honey, then sliced bananas and put on it. 
We have really started to like that sandwich.</p>

got up at 5AM and left for Guimba by 7AM.  We had to stop at the Elders in
Guimba and leave packages for Guimba 1 &amp;2.  We then picked up the Elders
assigned to Guimba 3 and took them out with us.  The Clark's were already there
when we got there.  We visited with the Branch President about the Home
Teaching computer program.  We attended their meetings.  We came back home and
had a few minutes to visit with the Clark's while Mae and Sister Clark started
dinner.  We attended meetings with Munoz @ branch.  Fast and Testimony meeting
went 1/2 hr over.  I had left Sunday school early and ran home to put the
vegetables in with the roast.  We sure enjoyed having the Clarks come over
after meetings to eat with us and visit after.  It was after 8:30 PM before
they left to return to Angeles.  It's been a busy day but enjoyable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt;punctuation-wrap:simple;
text-autospace:none'>            Today was “P” day and we were with most of the
Elders in our District for an activity day. We passed out mail that had come,
that is both a good time and a sad time.  For those that got mail, they were
excited, but some of these Elders may be the only member in their family and
the family doesn’t support them.  One Elder commented that he thinks his family
has forgotten him, for he hasn’t heard from his family for over three months. 
We fill badly when we see this for these young men are great.  They are
dedicated to serve the Lord and are really working hard.  We were talking to
the Mission President and he commented that we didn’t have a bad Elder in the
mission, and we had to agree with that as to all the Elders we work with.   We
met to watch a video that our Mission President approved, “The Other Side of
Heaven”.  However, we just got started when we had a brown out, which happens
often here, so we went bowling.  The bowling alley has a generator, so was
open.  Bowling here is a little different that at home, although there some
American traditional alleys in other cities, but for our area, the alley is
about standard, the pins are smaller and the balls are about the size of a shot
foot ball but lighter.  There are no finger holes and you get three ball to
throw instead of two.  Scoring is about the same, with the next two balls added
for a strike, the next ball added for a spare, but a spare can be on either the
2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> ball.  Any way it was a lot of fun, with no
one doing great, but just fun.  When we got back to the Elders apartment, the
power was back on so we watched the rest of the movie and we all enjoyed it. 
We were then told those that will be transferring.  We had more transfers than
normal because of necessary re-alignment due to the problem that there are more
missionaries going home than are coming into the field.  This, we are told is
because of the raising of the standards for missionaries.  We agree completely
with the Raising the Standards, but sure miss the replacements.  President
Brimhall is going to have to close some of the areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt;punctuation-wrap:simple;
text-autospace:none'>            Well, we love the work.  We are still
struggling with the language.  I am not sure if I will every get it.  President
Brimhall keeps telling me not to worry about it, but we do, as it would be so
much easier to communicate with these sweet people.  They understand a lot more
English that they can speak, but it is still hard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
just received a call from President Brimhall, asking us to add a couple more
presentations to our calendar for the 16<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> of
July.  He is so special and concerned about us, and expresses his appreciation
for the work we are doing.  We sure love him and his sweet wife.  We also enjoy
the couple that serve in the Mission Office, Elder and Sister Clark.  They are
from Bountiful, Utah.  Elder Clark has also been called as a counselor to
President Brimhall, so they were out yesterday with us.  Sister Browning cooked
us a wonderful roast beef dinner with all the potatoes and vegetables.  We had
been able to buy some lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, celery, broccoli and
cauliflower, so that was the first tossed salad we have had since getting here,
it was sure a treat.  The vegetables came from a northern providence whose
climate is more like California and we found them at an open market in
Angeles.  We enjoyed having the Clark’s come to have someone that you can just
visit with and understand each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
took a nap after getting home, and then had to go over and get some Book of
Remembrances that the Elders were to get to us.  We went to San Jose for a few
groceries.  After dinner, I wrote a letter to my family and we tried to send
some pictures to our children.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

home.  I fell asleep while studying.  Mae studied Tagalog quite a lot today.  I
worked on the computer and did dishes.  Time sure seemed to fly by today, with
out getting much done.  We did take some Book of Remembrances to Eve and Eliza
Gajonera, after printing a picture of Mae &amp; me and writing a note to go
with it.</p>

went walking this morning, then spent most of today planning for
presentations.  We did go visit the Dator family for a few minutes.  I told him
that he could wash our car on Saturday mornings.  We will also try buying some
of our vegetables through him.  Elder Clark called to let me know that
President Abo of the San Jose Stake may have an overhead projector that we can
use.  We sent Elder Clark and President Brimhall an e-mail on a handout we want
to give out in some of our presentations.  We got an e-mail from Jeff &amp;
Gail and one from Mike.  We also got an e-mail from Nancy Litchford, which
rather discouraged me.  Both Mae and I went to bed on the discouraged side
tonight.</p>

planning the 15 minute presentations that we are to give on the 16th &amp;
23rd.  That is really hard and I am having trouble getting my mind to focus. 
We went to San Jose and got the overhead projector and screen that we get to
use until we go home.  They are both new pieces of equipment.  We went over our
presentation but were not satisfied with it yet.  I tried to get on the inter
net to find two pictures we would like to use, but couldn't find anything.  It
was late when we went to bed.  We did get an e-mail from Becky and Scott.</p>

didn't go walking this morning as we were too late getting to bed.  I prepared
an omelet for our breakfast.  We attended District meeting and as always were
very impressed with the Elders.  We got 5 new Elders, but lost we lost 7 from
our District.  Elder Clam is Elder Barrett's new companion.  He was from the
Guimba 2nd Branch.  After meeting we went for a little drive.  I could really
feel the power of Satan working on me and I felt like I would really like to just
drive to the airport and go home.  We went home and started work on our
presentation instead.  Marlyn soon had a nice dinner ready for us.  We laid
down for a nap, but Bishop Duroncho brought us a clothes dryer.  It will need
some repairs, but it is better than nothing.  I lay back down.  I wrote a short
letter to President Mercado then took it over to his home.  I stopped and
talked to Ronald Dator about repairing the clothes dryer.  He will come by in
the morning.  We worked on presentations the rest of the afternoon and
evening.  We used the flannel board and figures and set up two scenes and took
pictures of them.  I then transferred them to the computer and made overhead
sheets for our presentations.  We were very pleased with the way they turned out.  
We were late getting to bed.  Oh well, that's not too unusual.</p>

were waked at 6AM by Marlin Dator so he could wash his car.  His wife Imalga
and their son R J also came.  That kept Mae up to visit with them.  I did get
some work done on the computer.  Ronald Dator and his partner came over to work
on our dryer.  They were until 11 AM working on it and got it working fairly
well, but the timer doesn't move.  We worked on the presentations right up to
the time we had to leave for meetings.  President Mercado called me and needed
some information that I took down to the Munoz chapel.  We got out to Guimba.
Where I helped President Mercado set up for District Presidency and Branch
Presidency meeting.  I held a training session for the Branch Clerks and
Executive Secretaries that went fairly well.  At 3:30 PM we put on a
presentation on Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching for the Guimba 2nd Branch. 
That went ok, but we made changes to the presentation, on the way to San Jose,
for the presentation we were to give at 6 PM at San Jose Stake.  We were late
getting started due to a meeting that was already in progress when we got to
the Stake Center.  We got started about 6:30 PM.  That went well.  It was after
9:30 PM by the time we got home.  Mae fixed some supper while I got things
unloaded from the car.  I stayed up and made my journal entry, but let Mae go
to sleep.  I needed to stay up a while after eating.  Elder Barrett told us of
a contact they had this morning that told him of his bad luck lately.  He and
his wife had to move from one house to another because of the water coming into
their home from the rains.  They were traveling between the two, when they had
hi-jacker's take their car.  After two weeks, they got their car back.  On the
way home they ran into a tractor and wrecked their car.  Needles to say, they
felt like they were having a streak of bad luck.</p>

school, I went into the Youth class and really enjoyed it.  After the block
meetings we returned home.  Mae took a short nap or rest as the heat really
seemed to get to her today.  I fixed lunch, and then I laid down for a nap. 
Mae continued to write our family weekly letter.  We attended the Sacrament
meeting at Munoz 2nd branch.  After that we attended the Branch council meeting
for they were making plans for Home Teaching.  We were glad we had for we were
able to give them some guidance.  </p>

at a special program that the Guimba 1st Branch will be putting on to remember
the 1st person baptized into the church, in the Guimba area, 23 years ago. 
They ask us to address &quot;The Responsibilities of being a Pioneer.&quot; 
This will take place on July 28th.  We said we would.  Brother Silvia came over
and helped us with our computer.  He removed the Norton Anti-virus program.  He
showed us how to use Power Point, and did several other things to clean up our
files.  He was here for over 3 hr, so we gave him P300 and had him eat lunch
with us.  I took a nap in the afternoon, and then we spent the rest of the afternoon
and evening working on our presentations.  While I was sleeping, Mae wrote in
Christine Mercado's Book of Remembrance.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

for High Cholorstal.  We had Elder Barrett and Elder Clam over for breakfast
this morning.  We spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon working on
presentation materials.  We went to San Jose shopping and on the way dropped of
handout materials to a copy store.  Brother Silvia stopped on his way home to
load an anti-virus program for us and to give us a disk containing graphics for

Mae and I gave a presentation on Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching.  We felt
it went well.  We had to take Elder Cache to Guimba on the way home.  The other
Guimba Elders weren't there when we got there, so we had to stay and be with
him, until they came.  He introduced us to his Land Lord, who invited us in and
was a very graces host.  After getting home we got something to eat.  We then
went over to visit President Nuque.  We enjoyed visiting with them and when I
asked him what he suggested we do differently, he said to continue whit what we
were doing.  We had been concerned that we had upset him last Sunday, but felt

to Clark a little early, so stopped to look at an area shortly after you enter
Clark base.  We visited with a family that was there, but the thing that amazed
us is a man came selling ice cream.  He had a hand pushed wagon.  But what was
so surprising was where did he come from?  We were the only potential customers
in the area, so why would he be in that area?  We went on over to the dentist
and she had to pull the tooth for Mae.  We went to the mission office after
visiting the dentist.  We went out to eat with the Clarks.  I then had Mae
&amp; the Clark’s drop me off at Indulgence Spa, where I got a treatment, for
my back was hurting so bad the past few nights.  Dr Rosella is the one that
recommended this place, but when I walked in I was a little concerned.  Everything
went ok and I felt much better when I was finished.  We stopped at a wood
carving shop where we had ordered some trays, but they weren’t ready for us
yet.  We did buy two bowls however.  We visited with President Brimhall when we
got back to the mission home.  He was excited with our presentation yesterday. 
I asked him about doing it again for Panique District Priesthood meeting, and
he said yes.  We are going to try to put the presentation on power point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went to District Meeting this morning, then
came home and ate dinner.  I worked on my journal, changing it from Microsoft
works to Microsoft word.  That took me a lot longer than I had planned.  Mae
and I worked all evening getting the power point put together for my
presentation for tomorrow.  I called Elder Clark and visited for a few minutes
about the meeting tomorrow.  Elder Barrett and Elder ______ stopped in for just
a few minutes.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke about 5 AM with my back hurting.  I
worked all morning on the power point presentation and with Mae’s help was
ready to leave for the Paniqui Stake Priesthood meeting in Moncada by noon. 
After getting to the main highway that we usually go south to Tarlac, I turned north. 
I was not sure how far I had to go, and I had forgotten to take the name of
where I was to go.  I felt that I had gone too far, so thinking I could ask
someone, if I had the name of the town, I tried to call Mae.  Our cell phone
was out of time so that didn’t work.  I just prayed and felt that I should
continue north.  In just a few miles, I came to the Moncada chapel.  I was
there early so had time to set up.  We couldn’t get President Brimhall’s
computer to read my disk, so I had to use the overhead slides.  I wasn’t
feeling very good about the way it went.  This evening we watched the movie
“Charlie” and enjoyed it.  I sure love my beautiful wife, she is special.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended the block meetings at Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch.  We returned home for lunch, a nap and got dinner on cooking, then went
to Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch for Sacrament meeting.  As we came in, President
Nuque told me that Brother Silvia was to speak this afternoon, but had to be
out of town.  He asked if I would take his place.  I used the hymn, “I Believe
in Christ” and added Temple and Family History into it.  It went ok.  We
stopped and saw the Sariano family after meeting.   The power went of during
sacrament meeting, which isn’t unusual, but we had put a chicken on the
rotisserie before coming to meeting.  The stove is gas, so no problem, but the
rotisserie turns with electricity so it burned on one side.  We invited Elder
Barrett and Elder Clam for dinner.  With out power, the house was hot and dark,
so we ate out on the patio.  It was very present and with a little breeze,
quite comfortable.  After the Elders left we stayed out for a while.  We opened
all the windows to let in what air we could, but it was stile hot sleeping.  I
got up at 11:30 PM when the power came on and the lights were on.  I set the
fan up and we slept ok the rest of the night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke with my back hurting; Mae rubbed it and
tried to get it in place.  I wish I know what we should do.  I don’t want to
get a new mattress if that isn’t the cause.  We worked all morning with our
schedule planning.  After lunch, Mae got on the computer to write our family
letter, I took a nap.  We got e-mails from Sandi, Becky, David M. and Page
(Tayler), Jeff and Amber Stevenson.  I got a e-mail ready to sent to Elder
&amp; Sister Maharry, then caught my journal up to date.  We made some changes
to our Home Teaching presentation.  Mae stayed up late trying to get some
e-mails off.  I fell asleep in the front room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up at 5:30 AM but let Mae sleep a wile
longer.  The weather was bad so we couldn’t go walking anyway.  We fixed
breakfast for the Elders; they then gave us some lessons in Tagalog.  That
really depressed me and I don’t know what to do about it.  It really started
raining while we were eating and it continued all day.  Our power went out
about 10 AM and has remained out all day.  Our phone also went out.  We went to
San Jose to get some money out of the bank and did some shopping at CVC.  There
is a lot of trees blown down and a lot of flooding.  Power is out all over the
area and the businesses that are open have their own generators.  We took a nap
when we got home.  We tried to study for the presentation tomorrow, but were
not sure if the meeting is still going to be held or not.  We went back to San
Jose and purchased a phone card for our cell phone, but our battery is low so
needs to be recharged before we can use it.  We got a sandwich for dinner, then
went over to Gajonera’s to meet with them to go over the CMIS for the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch, but they were not home.  After trying to find them, we came home, and
gave up for the day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 3 AM with my back hurting.  I took
some Aleve and tried to go back to bed but couldn’t go to sleep, so set up in
the chair and slept until Mae woke me at 5 AM.  The storm has continued all
night with high winds and heavy rains.  The storm is considered to be a typhoon
with a #4 ratting.  It has done a lot of damage and a lot of flooding.  We
still don’t have electrical power, so don’t have water.  We had to take a spit
shower and get ready with candle light.  Our phone is also out so we stopped at
the Elders house and used their phone to call the mission home.  The Elders at
the mission home told us that the meeting was canceled due to the storm and
would be rescheduled.  We came back home and I went back to sleep.  Mae came in
to wake me at 10 AM, and about then, Brother Sylvia, President Gajonera and Ernesto
Damacio came by to see if we were ok.  Also that President Gajonera could let
us know what happened to them last night.  Because their roof leaked so badly
they had to go down to the church house to sleep the night.  The three of these
brethren had been checking on families to see if they were ok.  Other than some
of them got water in their homes, everyone was ok.  We had enough power in the
computer to show Brother Sylvia our power point presentation.  We also took
time to explain the program to President Gajonera.  After lunch we went to San
Jose and got some gloves, then came back to help Brother Roger Sylvia clean his
house.  It took us a while to find his home and by the time we did with the
help of others, they had it cleaned up.  We checked on Sister Sariano, as her
husband is out of town.  They are ok.  We checked with the Corpus’s and they
had water in their house, but had it all cleaned up by the time we got there. 
We came home and set out on the patio and played a game of Rook.  We then fixed
dinner.  While it was cooking, I took some information about our computer to
Roger Sylvia.  He thinks he can fix a problem we are having on it.  The power
came back on this evening, and the phone was back working for a while.  The
power went back off for just a minute, but shut the phone back off.  After
dinner we did up the dishes, and it is sure good to have power and water
again.  Elder and Sister Clark were able to call us just before the phone went
back out.  They informed us that our Zone Conference is to be held tomorrow. 
We will have to change our plans as to going to Angeles tomorrow.  I worked on
some changes to our power point presentation this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We did get a chance to go walking this morning. 
As we returned to the house, Elder Barrett and Elder Clam were waiting for us. 
With the change in the Zone Conference schedule, the place of meeting was also
changed, but some of the Elders could not be contacted, so Elder Barrett asked
if I could go to San Jose and get them from the Stake Center.  I did, then stopped
at home and got Mae, and then went on to the Munoz Chapel.  I also tried to
find some keys to the recreation hall, as we needed a portable chalk.  The
meeting went well and as always President and Sister Brimhall gave marvelous
advice to us.  After meeting we took the Elders that came from Guimba part way,
to where they could get a ride.  We tried to return President Gajonera’s keys
to him, but no one was home.  We came on home and got something to eat, then
took a nap.  We took handouts to the copy shop for copies for Saturday’s
presentations, tried to e-mail Scott from a computer shop, but the system had
failures, stopped at Marlin Dator’s to schedule the washing of the car, got gas
in the car, and returned the keys.  We came home and worked all evening on
presentations.  We did receive e-mails from Jackie Thompson, K. Byron, Jeanie
Burgess and Scott, that we copied to a 3 ½” floppy disk and read when we got
home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 5:40 AM, though we had planned on
getting up at 4:30 AM.  I guess I miss set the alarm.  We had to hurry in order
to get away by 6:30 AM for Angeles.  We got to the Bank at 8:50 AM and had to
wait 10 minutes for the bank to open.  We cashed a check, and then went to the
mission home.  We visited with Elder and Sister Clark for a few minutes and
then went to Mae’s dentist appointment.  While Mae was having her teeth worked
on, I went to Rock Bottom Office Supply and got some ink cartridges.  We went
out to eat with the Clark’s and really enjoyed being with them.  We stopped at
the wood shop and got the serving trays we want to send home to our children. 
We looked at the end tables, and want to get them, but are concerned about the
shipping.  We left the mission home about 4 PM for home.  In Tarlac the traffic
was terrible and we had heavy rain.  A trike bumped the back of the car, but I
didn’t think much about it, until we got to Munoz and we saw the Elder’s
walking, so offered them a ride.  They asked what had happened to our car.  It
did bend the back bumper in, but I think it will pop back out.  We got home in
time to go to the print shop and pick up the handouts we had copies made of
today.  We were sure tired, but took time to go through our presentation for
tomorrow at Gapan, before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, July 25, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This morning we went to Gapan where we gave a
presentation, we then came home and I let Mae off.  I went right to the Munoz
chapel to the District Presidency meeting.  President Nuque got there right
after I did, but no one else came so we played two games of chess.  President
Nuque beat the first one and I won the second one.  At 3PM President Mercado
came and we went into the office.  We were another ½ hour opening mail and
President Desalas came.  I asked to be excused at 4:30 PM so we could go to Rezal
to give another presentation.  We took Elder Barrett and Elder Clam with us,
and then picked up Elder Hayman and Elder Park in San Jose to go with us also. 
We got there in time ok, but because of a Institute class we were 45 minutes
late starting.  It went well, but not to well attended for two Wards.  I talked
to one Bishop and he doesn’t have counselors that support him.  The other Ward
is even worse, as the Bishop went to Saudi to work and just walked out of his
calling, leaving the Elders in charge.  When we left to return home, the Elders
were visiting and I took a wrong turn.  I finally realized the road didn’t look
right and asked where we were.  We had to back track quite a ways.  I was a
little concerned as we were low on fuel.  When we turned around, we had a
prayer and returned ok.  I stopped in San Jose to get gas, before coming home. 
It was after 1 PM before we got the Elders home.  We got something to eat, and
then watched the video “Charlie” before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch this
morning.  I woke upset over some of the things that are not going right here in
this area, wondering what should be done.  I made a list of concerns and am debating
what to do about them.  After Sacrament meeting we came home and I took a nap. 
Mae worked on the family letter.  We attended the meetings at Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch.  The Branch President asked Mae and I to talk in Sacrament meeting.  We
came home and got dinner ready and had Elder Barrett and Elder Clam come to eat
with us.  Mae worked on letters to e-mail, while I worked on a talk for
tomorrow.  We are having trouble with our internet connections and can not get
on the internet now.  I updated my journal before we went to bed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Woke early with a back ache and it took a while
to get back to sleep.  About that time, the alarm went off.  We decided to shut
it off and sleep a little longer.  Brother Roger Silvia came to make a
correction to our computer, but was unable to do so as our phone connection is
having problems and we can’t get on the inter-net.  Brother Silvia said it is
in the pone line and not in the computer.  That is a great relief to know.  We
called the phone co. and they are trying to repair the line.  This evening they
called and thought they had it repaired, but when I called back and told them
that it still wasn’t working, they said they would have to come to the house
tomorrow.  We went out to Guimba to speak at an activity in honor of the first
converts to the church in 1980.  As I began to speak, I completely changed my
talk.  I think it went well, but Mae was surprised at my talk and when she
asked me about the change, I said that I was as surprised as she.  We were
going to go shopping after we got home, but was to tired so just stayed home
and read the e-mails we got this morning.  We had to go to a computer shop to
get our e-mails as the land line is still not working.  President Clark call
and we talked for a few minutes.  We sure enjoyed getting letters from our
children.  Mae is sure a special wife and sweetheart.  Sure love her!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke early and couldn’t go back to sleep
because of a back ache.  We did get up about 6 PM and went walking at the
collage.  After we got back we showered and had breakfast.  We then took a nap,
then Mae got birthday cards ready to mail to Taylor Paige and Garrett.  Mae
stayed home while I went shopping in San Jose.  She stayed home because the
phone co. said they would be here today to repair our phone line, but they
didn’t come.  She did get some studding done and part of the Family letter
written.  I mailed the Birthday cards, deposited our monthly check, looked at
three stores for a new bed, and went grocery shopping.  This evening we had
Roger and Heidi Silvia and their two children Karen and Darin over for dinner. 
We watched the DVD “Building Faith in Christ” before dinner.  Mae had a nice
dinner ready and we enjoyed it.  It was interesting that their children are
just as picky as are our grandchildren.  I guess children are the same all over
the world.  The reason for having then over this evening is it is their 4<sup>th</sup>
Wedding anniversary.  We put the video “Charlie” on but the children became
tired so they had to take them home.  It has been a good evening; we hope they
enjoyed it also.  After cleaning up the dishes, Mae and I watched the ending of
the movie and as always cried at the ending.  As Mae was brushing her teeth,
the temporary tooth that Dr. Rosales but in, came out.  She will have to wait
until we go to Angeles on Monday to get it replaced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, July 30, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was up at 2 AM with back pain so didn’t get
very much sleep.  When I did lay back down, Mae let me sleep late.  We didn’t
get a lot done today, as I spent quite a bit of time trying to use the cell
phone to get a call in to the phone co. to report our phone is out of order.  I
also tried to call the mission home, but couldn’t get that call through.  Mae
was able to call her dentist.  They would like her to wait until Monday to come
in.  I called a furniture co in Tarlac to find out their location so we can go
there to check on a bed.  We worked on the computer trying to get some ideas
down on things that would help the leaders here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, July 31, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I didn’t sleep very well again tonight.  We got
up and went walking anyway this morning.  After breakfast we took a nap, and
then we worked on some of our files in the computer.  Elder Barrett and Elder
Clam came over about noon, so we invited them to eat with us.  I took them over
to San Jose where they did a split with Elder Hayman and Elder Park.  Elder
Clam and Hayman went with me to San Isadora to see if the Elders there had a
copy of “To the Home Teachers of the Church” that we use in man of our
presentations.  They think the Bishop there will have a copy and will bring me
one tomorrow at District meeting.  I took Elders Clam &amp; Hayman back to San
Jose, and then came home.  The phone co hadn’t come to repair our phone line
yet.  I called the phone co. but got little help there.  We worked more on some
of our files.  I tried to develop some forms in Excel but couldn’t figure it
out.  I have tried to reach President Clark, but haven’t been able to get
through.  I think they are also having phone problems.</p>
