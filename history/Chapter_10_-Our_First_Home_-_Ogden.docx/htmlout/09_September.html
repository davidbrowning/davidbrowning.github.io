<p class=MsoNormal>            We went walking this morning at 6:30AM, though
it was over cast.  We took our umbrellas with us, but didn’t need them because
it didn’t start raining until we had got back to the car.  We worked on letters
most of the day.  Mae cut my hair this afternoon and I dyed her hair for her.  This
evening we visited the Lozano family and gave them a lesson using the video of
“Mans Search for Happiness”.  We sang a song and challenged them to read daily
from the Book of Mormon and to attend meetings next Sunday.  We visited with
our neighbor across the street when we came home.  We found that he has a
Masters Degree from Cornell University as he grew up in the United States.  He
now works for the Philippine Government.  We didn’t think he worked for we
always see him at home taking care of household responsibilities.  His wife is
a professor at C. L. S. U..  Their names are Rhept and Elvira Daza and their
children are Zyrille, Xenobia, Xabiena (Viera), Xerxes (Xees).  Very
interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We enjoyed a walk this morning although I was
quite stiff for some reason.  We prepared breakfast and had Elder Ragasa and
Elder Clam over.  They helped us with Tagalog, and then as we were visiting
they told us that some of the Hymns are in Tagalog in the Gospel Principles
book.  We made an index of them and put in the book so we could find and learn
the Hymns in Tagalog.  We went out to Guimba where we went with Elder Caspe and
Elder Bondad to visit the Doria family.  While we were visiting, Sister
Browning noticed a large open sore on the left ankle of one of the younger
children.  It was very swollen and infected.  When she asked about it, she
found that medication had been prescribed, but in visiting with the Elders,
they said that the family did not have the money to purchase the medication.  I
asked the Elders about welfare help, and they said that the branch president
didn’t feel that he could use the Fast Offerings, as the father is not active
in the Church.  We are concerned that this child needs medication right away.  While
we were visiting with these children, the older of the two sons, with the
disease, asked Sister Browning if he could make a request.  She said, “Certainly”
and he asked if it would be possible for them to go to Jolly Bees.  The closest
Jolly Bees would be in San Jose.  We sent a e-mail to President Brimhall asking
him if it would be appropriate for Sister Browning and myself to rent a vehicle
that could take the mother, the two boys and the two younger siblings, along
with ourselves and treat them to dinner at Jolly Bees?  We enjoyed visiting
with the Doria family - these boys and their mother.  We feel that we brought
some joy and attention into their lives which they are in need of.  We gave
them a Tagalog “Book of Mormon Stories” for Children and they were excited as
we went through some of the stories with them.  We also visited two other
investigator families, who the Elders are teaching.  The first family was the
father and sister of a new convert and they are now taking the lessons and said
they would come to church next Sunday.   The second family is a young married
couple with a three month old baby, and they are very excited about the lessons
they are being taught by these two fine missionaries.  We really enjoyed the
opportunity to share some scriptures, personal experiences and bear our
testimonies.  It was an exciting, spiritual afternoon.  This evening we went to
an appointment with the Gallcitas, but they weren’t home.  We visited with
their son-in-law, daughter and one year old grandson for a few minutes, and
then came home.  We were on the computer until 11:30 PM with e-mails and my
journal before getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up at 5:30 AM but Mae was too tired so I
went back to sleep also.  That seemed to put us behind all day.  Roger Silvia
came over and we tried to correct some problems on the computer, which we did,
but it took a lot of time that I didn’t seem to have.  He didn’t leave until
after 4PM.  I guess the main reason he came by was to borrow some money.  I
gave him P200 that will help some.  That is hard to know what to do.  I spent
the rest of the evening until 8:30PM working on files on the computer.  Mae
said I needed to e-mail Shellie because she will be going on trip tomorrow. 
The pressures are great at times and I don’t seem to handle it to well.  We
went to the Corpus’s this evening and gave them some thoughts on studying the
scriptures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went to Tarlac this morning and had breakfast
at McDonald’s.  President and Sister Clark met us there at 8:30AM and we went
to the Camiline &amp; St. Ignicia Zone Conference.  It was presided over by
President Brimhall.  We really enjoyed the instructions and the special spirit
that the meeting carried.  After the meeting the Zone leaders had arranged for
a nice dinner to be served.  We then went to Camiline and saw the house that
the Maharry’s will be living in.  It is very nice, but bigger than I would
want.  Camiline is a beautiful area and I’m sure the Maharry’s will enjoy it. 
We got home at 6:30PM and had planned on having President Nuque and his family
over to watch “The Other Side of Heaven”, but Sister Nuque didn’t feel well, so
we rescheduled the evening for next week.  We were late getting to bed because
we worked on getting some reports ready on the computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, September 05, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae got up and baked cookies for the Elders. 
She let me sleep in.  Brother Roger Silvia stopped by and returned ½ of what he
borrowed yesterday.  I told him he didn’t need to for we need his help on the
computer and I want to pay him for his time.  He was walking much better and
said that he had tried the exercises that we had told him about and it had
really helped.  We attended our District meeting and enjoyed being with the
Elders.  When Sister Browning announced that there were cookies at the end of
the meeting, I couldn’t believe how fast the cookies could go.  President Apoa
called me and needs another overhead projector and screen and wants to use
ours.  After District meeting we came home and got it and took it over to San
Jose.  While in San Jose we stopped at Jolly Bee’s and were able to make
arrangements to bring the Doria family to Jolly Bee’s for lunch next Thursday. 
Jolly Bee’s was very accommodating and are furnishing every thing, if we
understood right, free of charge, just to help this family.  The young lady
that was helping us was named Sugar and I told her she has just as sweet as her
name.  We also arranged for Romel to drive the van to bring the family over and
back.  That will cost us P1,000.  We came back to the church house and gave the
Elders assigned to the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch some medication to put on
one of the younger children’s leg where he has a sore.  We gave Elder Ragasa
and Elder Bondad a ride to the Elders house.  As we got there, Elder Ragasa
said they had some mail for us, so I turned across the street to get it, and
turned right in front of an on coming car. I don’t know how, except that the
Lord just protected us, that we didn’t get hit broad side.  I just didn’t see
that car coming.  It sure scarred us and the ones in the other car also.  After
eating lunch we went down to pay our phone bill.  We also stopped at the Santos
and set our schedule a little later for tomorrow.  We came home and took a
nap.  We decided to visit the Silvia’s, as Roger said we sure help their family
to have a better spirit, when we come.  We got home as the phone was ringing. 
We thought it might be Gajonera’s as we had invited them over this evening, but
they couldn’t make it tonight.  I typed a letter to President and Sister
Clark’s so asking for his help in getting us some ink cartridges and a price on
a power point projector.  Mae made some corrections to the Branch’s organizational
charts.  I entered my journal entries for the past couple of days.  We were
again late going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, September 06, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As we were late getting to bed last night, we
didn’t get up early and go walking.  Brother &amp; Sister Dator came and washed
our car.  I worked all morning trying to get the Home Teaching records to print
out for Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch, but could not figure it out.  I became
very frustrated over it and finally gave up and took a ½ hr. nap before I got
ready and left to meet at President Nieto’s house, where President Nuque,
President Mercado and Brother Dator met to go to Cabanatuan for a Leadership
Training.  I felt bad as all of them had to ride in President Nuque’s jeepnie
while I rode by myself.  To make things worse, they picked up three more on the
way before we left town.  I followed them as I did not know the way to the
chapel in Cabanatuan.  President Mercado asked me to attend the training for
Auditors.  Elder Funk from Roy, Utah was the instructor.  It was good for a review,
but Mae and I had figured most of it out from the Church Handbook of
Instructions, when we had been asked by President Apoa to train the San Jose
auditors.  After the training we stopped at Jolly Bee’s and got something to
eat.  It was after 6PM when I got home.  Mae had Sister Carolyn Kaye Rubio
visiting, when I got there.  After she left, we went to the Santo’s and showed
the DVD of “Finding Faith In Christ”.  We were there a while longer discussing
how we can build our Faith in Christ.  When we got home, Mae then got on the
computer and the inter-net to write to our family and to reply to Chelci’s last
letter.  She didn’t get through until almost mid-night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, September 07, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left for Guimba at 7:30AM, that we could
attend the meetings at Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch.  On the way out we saw
where a rice mill had dumped their chaff from the rice cleaning.  There were a
dozen or more people out their sifting the chaff for left over rice, that they
might have food.  The rice harvest is just getting started for the second crop
and again farmers are putting the rice on the highway so it can dry.  As you
travel, you have to go around it or drive over it.  They are allowed to use ½
of the highway as a drying area.  We enjoyed visiting the Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>
Branch and attending their meetings.  I took the time to bear my testimony in
Testimony meeting and to make a correction as to the question I had been asked
to answer last Saturday.  We came home and Mae took a nap while I worked on the
computer, then I took a nap while Mae worked on the computer.  We attended
Sacrament meeting at the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch this afternoon and really
enjoyed it.  This evening we invited the Elders over for dinner.  We then went
to Brother &amp; Sister Trabalno’s and had a nice visit with them.  We came
away very humbled at the condition that they live under.  They make a very
small income, but pay their fast offerings and tithing first.  She said that
there are many baggers that come to their door every day and she tries to give
something but they don’t have much to give.  He said that his neighbors don’t
like them as they won’t drink and smoke with them.  They have two boys and said
that they were their greatest achievement and joy.  We had a prayer with them
and left very humbled.  We have never experienced the poverty and trials that
these people are going through.  We wish we could give them greater hope, but
hope the messages of the restored gospel helps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning at the
college.  After breakfast and studding the scriptures we went to Roger Silvia’s
and visited just a minute with Heidi to see if Roger could come over Wednesday
evening and help us on the computer.  We then went to San Jose to do our
shopping, pay our water bill and get some office supplies.  We also stopped at
the San Jose Stake center to get our screen, but it was locked in the satellite
control room and no one there had a key to it.  While grocery shopping we again
realized what it is to be a minority.  Four school girls probably 8 to 10 years
old, were curious about Americans and wanted to ask me several questions.  Of
course I couldn’t speak Tagalog and they wouldn’t speak English so
communication didn’t go very well.  They just stayed with me for several minutes
and really became a pest.  Mae didn’t help because she just left me to handle
the situation by myself.  We didn’t get back home until 1PM and Marlyn had
dinner already for us.  After eating we did some studying for this evening’s
presentation.  I printed off a picture of the Corpus family and e-mailed a
picture of the Elders in the Santa Ignacia Zone.  We received a e-mail from Roy
and Linda.  I took a nap before we went visiting this evening.  We asked Marlyn
if she would accompany us as we went to visit the Lozeno’s, which she did and
it helped a lot.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I really wish that I knew if we are doing much
good.  We haven’t got any of our families to attend church regularly yet, maybe
the Corpus’s and we did have the Santo’s come out once, we haven’t made much
progress with Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching and we haven’t felt much
success in Leadership Training.  In Roy’s letter he indicated that Julianna and
her companion have had several baptisms.   I know that just baptizing is not
the goal, but it is at least something to gage what you are accomplishing.  I
am just becoming more confused as to what to expect out of this people????</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, September 09, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning.  We
invited Elder Clam and Elder Ragasa over for breakfast.  I prepared biscuits
and gravy for them which were something new for them.  The biscuits were ok,
but I have made much better.  For one thing the oven wasn’t hot enough and I
should have raised the rack higher.  We enjoy the Elders and they try to help
us with the Tagalog language, but I think that Elder Ragasa enjoys staying to
long.  I guess that with the great Elders we have had in the past, we expect
more out of them.  I wrote an e-mail to my siblings and sent it off.  We worked
on our presentation for this evening, tomorrow morning, Friday morning and
tried to reach the Elders in Cabanatuan about a presentation there on
Saturday.  This evening we visited the Galletes family.  When we got there, the
parents were not there.  We tried to talk to their 13 year old son Vince, and
he did very well helping us to understand that they would be there in a few
minutes.  They came shortly after and we enjoyed showing them the DVD “Building
Faith in Christ”.  We followed up with some thoughts about the film and it went
well.  Again, it would sure be better if we could speak Tagalog.  As we were
about to leave Brother Galletes asked me, for his son, as to how much our
laptop computer cost.  We told him about $2000 and he figured it to equal 8
months wages for him.  They are not in the poor class of people, but they don’t
have much.  That is about what our grocery budget is for a month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, September 10, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We have been busy all day, but I not sure just
where the day has gone.  We did go over to the Corpus’s and gave them a
presentation on reading the scriptures.  We sure enjoy this family and hope
they will remain active.  Brother Roger Silvia came over about 5PM and helped
me on the computer.  We still can’t figure out what has happened to our Home Teaching
merge program.  This is a real concern for us.  We worked on a workshop
presentation for Friday morning part of the day.  I took a nap and Mae wrote
her family a letter.  We got two e-mails from Sandi and were happy to hear that
she has got a new job with the high school, just across the road and will have
full benefits.  Scott also sent us a cute e-mail.  We sure like to hear from
our family!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, September 11, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and walked this morning at the
college, came home and had breakfast, read our scriptures and prepared for our
workshop for tomorrow in District Meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had such a neat experience today that I had
to sit right down and share with you.  You remember that we have told you about
the Doria family and their two sons, Armando and Fernan who have muscular
Aprathy and how there is no cure and they will die and that two of their
brothers have already died at ages 14 &amp; 9.  Armando is 13 and Fernan is
11.  They are cute boys, I think we sent a picture to you.  We will send another
one of the party we had at “Jolly Bees” with them today.   I’m sure we told you
about scheduling a van to take them in and meeting with “Sugar” who is over the
party room and schedules the parties at Jolly Bees.   She talked with her
manager and we got the impression that Jolly Bees was going to pay for
everything and put on a wonderful party for the boys, their family and
friends.  Then when we were telling President Nuque about it, he said that he
was sure they wouldn’t do that, but that she was probably meaning Jolly Bees
would provide prizes for the games, the mascots, balloons, etc.  So we planned
on paying for the food.  It turned out that we had 14 people there.  Dad and I,
the two Elders who serve in their area, a friend of theirs who is a recently
returned missionary and so cute, Romel the driver of our van, the two boys,
their parents, married sister with her two little girls, and two younger
brothers.  The boys and other children were so excited.  The father usually
works practically around the clock to provide for his family so we didn’t think
he would be there, but he was – so we were excited to meet him and have him
there with all his family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I think I told you last time that
the youngest boy, age 3, had a terrible sore on his ankle.  I gave the Elders
some bacterial ointment, out of our first aid kit, to give to the mother and
have her apply it to the sore.  She did and the sore was better today.  I was
happy for that.  Anyway, we met the Elders and the Van at a waiting shed as we
enter Guimba.  We then traveled to the home of the Doria family.  They were all
ready and excited.  The father carried Armando and the returned missionary
carried Fernan.  We loaded them into the van and headed out to San Jose which
is about 45 minutes away.  Jolly Bees was ready for us and had us go into the
party room and brought out fried chicken, rice &amp; gravy and drinks for
everyone.  It was delicious.  They then brought out balloons for all the
children.  After we had all finished eating, the two mascots came out – Jolly
Bee and Katie.  They wore those big outfits which the Jazz and other sports
team’s mascots use, only these were a bee and a girl.  They were so cute –
dancing, shaking hands with everyone, etc.  They stayed with us practically the
entire time and played the games with us.  They had dad and I play the games
also.  The two boys, of course, could not join in the games, but they enjoyed
watching.  Sugar, was the MC and was so cute.  She was excellent.  They gave
out lots of prizes and we had a wonderful time.  We were there from 1:30 to
almost 4:00p.m.  As it was winding down, Sugar asked me if I would give an
inspirational thought to the boys and handed me the microphone.  It was neat
expressing my love for these boys, their family, all those who attended, Sugar
and the others from Jolly Bees and especially our Heavenly Father.  I handed
Dad the mike and he also said a few words, after which, Sugar expressed her
feelings and told about the experience she had had trying to call us to confirm
our reservations.  She had not asked for our names, but had written down our
last names from our missionary badges, had not asked for our telephone number
or address.  After we left that day, she realized she needed to ask us some
more questions, but didn’t know how to reach us.  She called information being
almost certain that they would not be able to help her because they always ask
for the full name.  She told the operator that she only knew that our name was
“Browing” and was sure we lived in Munoz.  The operator told her that she had
no one with that name and wondered if it could be spelled differently.  She
then thought of Browning and the operator said “yes, I have a Browning in
Munoz”.  She was able to call us and felt the Lord had guided her to find us. 
She told Dad when he answered the phone that day, that she thought that a small
miracle had just taken place and explained how she had gotten our number.  As
we left Jolly Bees today, Sugar asked us for our cell phone number and we gave
it to her.  We had the Elders with us as there was not enough room in the van
for them, so we were on our way out to Guimba when we received a text message
from Sugar.  It read “somtyms God arrives w/ a whsper  oder tyms he jst drops
ryt in, but no mattr how God enters r life, He alwys brngs somthng nice!  Lyk
u!”    We responded back saying “yes, but he used a Sugar angel like you!”  She
responded back again saying “Tank u very much, its so nice knwing dat in ds
world dr r stil gr8 pipol extndng deir help lyk u, tank u, n bee happy!”  Sugar
frm jollibee.  I think you can all figure out this tex message as everyone
abbreviates when doing a text message.  Anyway, she’s really special and her
boss is also.  She wanted us to meet him and we wanted to also so we could
thank him, but he had stepped out for a few minutes.   We will just send him a
card thanking him as Jolly Bees paid for everything.  We didn’t have to pay for
any of the food, etc.  Sugar said her and her boss were hoping someone would do
something like this and they were excited to put on this party for us, and they
thanked dad and I for coming to them.    It was so much fun to see these boys
and their family having such a good time.  It was a great experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we got home we expected the Nuque family to
come this evening.  I went over to CVC in San Jose and bought a few items that
we needed.  We then ate some dinner and got things ready.  We popped a large
bowl of pop corn.  When it was after 7PM and they hadn’t come, Mae called. 
President Nuque had gone to Manila on a job interview and hadn’t got back, so
they can’t make it.  I checked the e-mail for a form from Elder Karen at the
mission office, but it hadn’t come.  There was however some e-mails from our
family, so we took them off and read them.  We then transferred the pictures we
had taken today to the computer files.  Time flies and it is bed time, although
Mae wants to get on the computer for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, September 12, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae didn’t come to bed until almost 1 AM, so we
didn’t get up and go walking this morning.  I woke concerned about the District
Presidency and the way that is going, also concerned about President Nuque
interviewing for work in Manila.  We commented about our prayers and we are
getting so that we have so much to pray about that it doesn’t take long until
we are praying for ½ hr for all the people and their problems.  We attended
District meeting and gave a 45 minute workshop on “Obedience” that went quite
well.  President Brimhall and the Assistants to the President came for house checks
today.  We invited them to come to our home before returning to Angeles for
dinner.   They said that would be great as they were planning to visit our home
also.  They came about 3PM and we really enjoyed the few minutes we had to
visit with them.  We prepared for the Nieto’s to come this evening to watch the
movie “The Other Side of Heaven”, but they didn’t come, so we watched it our
self.  Before doing so I transplanted one of our plants out front that is
getting too big for the pot that it is in.  We were after 10PM getting to bed,
as we stayed up to write a Happy Birthday e-mail to David.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, September 13, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As I was saying my prayers this morning, I felt
that our presentation for today was wrong.  I talked to Mae about it and we
went to work and redid our outline.  We finished just in time to leave for
Cabanatuan, without time to even go through it on a practice run.  We got there
about 12 noon and were met by a counselor in the Stake Presidency.   He said we
would wait until 2 PM to start as the Sisters were to meet at 1 PM but they
would stay to meet with the Priesthood.  We could take as much time as we
needed.  The presentation went well and after we had some questions.  A Bishop
came back in the building and informed us that we had a flat tire on the car. 
He took my key and he and another Brother changed the tire for us.  We stopped
at McDonald’s for something to eat before coming home.  We went over to the
Santo’s and held a Family Home Evening with them that went fair.  The father likes
us to come to visit, and we think the mother would like to be active, but we
wonder if we are doing any good with them or not.  When we got home we cut up
some meat and browned it for making grave for tomorrow.  President and Sister
Clark will be coming for diner with us.  I sure love my companion and
appreciate her patients with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and left early for Guimba.  We picked
up Elder Clam and Elder Ragasa on the way, and went out so we could attend the
Branch Conference at Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  President and Sister Clark
were there and we enjoyed being with them.  After the meetings, we invited
President and Sister Clark to have dinner with us.  President Clark and I
discussed the reports that Elder Karen has been trying to send to me, but for
some reason their e-mails are not coming through to us.  They stayed until 4PM
before leaving to return to the mission home.  We worked all evening getting
the District Survey Reports made up.  We were just finishing and had planned on
going visiting with Elder Clam and Elder Ragasa when they came.  They said that
they had received a call from President Brimhall who told them he wanted the
District Survey reports to him tonight.  We did not have all the reports
updated so while Mae entered the data, the Elders and I went out to get it.  We
had a recent update on President Gajonera branch so left Mae with that.  We
went to President Nieto’s but had to wait for him to return from a birthday
party.  We left Mae with that information to enter, and we went to Guimba. 
Elder Clam was familiar with the area so we were able to find the homes of
President Cabuyaban and Brother Sagon, but we were too late to go to Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>
Branch, so came home.  Mae and I worked until almost 1AM before getting the
reports sent to the mission home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, September 15, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke before 5AM with some concerns about the
church records, so got up and studied the Church Hand Book of Instructions
until Mae got up about 7AM.  We talked to President Clark several times today
about the reports we had sent and they tried to send us a copy of the form
President Brimhall would like us to use, but they were unsuccessful at getting
it through to us.  Mae worked on the CMIS from Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch
most of the afternoon.  We received an e-mail from David that really excited
us, as he told us that they are expecting their third child in May of next
year.  Becky also sent us a cute e-mail.  We feel so blessed with our family. 
We went on an appointment this evening with the Lorenzo family.  We asked
Marlyn to accompany us as an interpreter and sure enjoyed her help.  We showed
the DVD of “Finding Faith in Christ”.  It went well.  We probably got the
message through, but we feel the families enjoy and feel better with someone
that knows the language.  They told Marlyn that they had planned on going to
meetings on Sunday but their boss called and wanted them to stay home as he was
coming down to visit them.  We have got to get over to Brother Bustos, who is
their boss, and get him reactivated or something.  We sure seem to keep busy
and didn’t get to bed until 9:30PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, September 16, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke up at 2:00 a.m. and was unable to go back
to sleep thinking about the work here in the mission, so got the computer out
and went over the records we had input from the Branch CMIS lists, calculating
the percentage of unknown families in each branch.  Mae woke at 4:00 and we had
to take a sponge bath as we had no water.  We weren’t sure why we had no water
pressure, but at 5:00 a.m., it was back on.  Maybe they had shut the pump off. 
By 5:30 we were on our way to Angeles.  We stopped in Tarlac and got some
breakfast aned I realized I hadn’t taken the money with us.  So when we got to
Clark, we drew out 6,000 pecos from the ATM machine at the bank.  We went to
the mission office and visited with the Clarks and then I met with Elder Karen
and we tried to figure out the problems we’re having with our Merge Files and
the CMIS data file.  Mae looked at the supplies in the mission office and
bought 2 song books, 2 more Children’s Book of Mormon Stories in Tagalog, and 2
triple combinations.  Mae and Sister Clark then went shopping for Elder and
Sister Maharry as they will be arriving here on the 25<sup>th</sup>.  She
bought some groceries for us.  When they returned, I left the computer with
Elder Karen to work on.  The four of us left for Angeles.  We dropped our car
off at a tire repair shop to fix the spare tire and the left rear tire.  We
went to lunch at the Fortune Restaurant at which Elder and Sister Clark paid
the bill.  The food was Chinese and very delicious.  We then went shopping for
dishes, pots and pans and other household supplies for the Maharry’s at the
Pure Gold store.  Afterwards, we picked up the car.  Mae and I stopped at a pharmacy
“Mercury Drug” and bought Mae’s pills (blood pressure and Estrodine).  We made
another stop at the wood carving shop and ordered a caribou foot stool.  When
we arrived back at the mission home, I again worked with Elder Karen on the
computer and decided to leave the computer with him to see if he could work out
he problem.  He will send the computer back to us on Thursday with President
Brimhall as we will have our zone conference.  We ate the crepe desserts
(yogert for me)which Mae had purchased, in President and Sister Clark’s
apartment.  We loaded our car with the items for the Maharry’s and our
groceries and left for home shortly after 5:00 p.m.  We got home at 8 p.m. very
tired.  Before going to bed, we called Elder Clam and arranged for me to pick them
up in the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, September 17, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I picked up Elder Clam and Elder Ragasa at 6:30
a.m. and we went to San Jose to the City Circle.  Most of the Elders, from the
zone, arrived shortly after 7 a.m. with the Guimba Elders getting there before
7 a.m.  The San Jose Zone used this day for a Community Service Project.  We
waited until 8 a.m. before the city officials came and arranged for us to go to
a building project.  It is a subdivision of duplex homes built mainly by
donated labor and donated materials, for low income families.  After getting
there we were divided into two groups.  Our group hauled gravel to the cement
mixer, the cement was dumped into a trough, then shoveled into buckets.  We
formed a bucket line and passed the buckets of cement to a worker who poured it
into the forms.  The other group did about the same kind of work as did we,
except they were pouring footings and foundations.  We worked until 11 a.m.,
when transportation came to return us to San Jose.  While there, we had the
director of the project explain to us some of the details of the project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=1Paragraph style='text-indent:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>            We
found this to be a good experience and when we returned to San Jose, one of the
city officials expressed gratitude to us for our service.</p>

<p class=1Paragraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=1Paragraph style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>            After
getting home and eating dinner I took a nap.  Mae worked most of the morning on
getting a Tagalog Book of Mormon marked for a short review of the Book of
Mormon, so we could take it to the Galletes this evening.  We also started
working on a dance instruction for next Friday evening.  President Nuque called
at 5:30 PM to see why I hadn’t shown up?  I had forgotten that I was to meet
him this afternoon at 5PM.  We will wait now until Saturday afternoon to talk
about the Health Fair.  Mae saw a mouse run under the couch so I had to chase
it down and kill it.  That was fun with Mae trying to help me while standing on
a stool.  I finally killed it with the broom.  The Galletes were not home when
we went there this evening.  We stopped and visited Sister Saranio and her
children for a few minutes.  I visited with President Clark about the Maharry’s
home and the items that we yet need to purchase for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mae is feeling a little better this morning.  It has rained
most of the night so we slept in.  We attended zone conference and thought it
was the same as we had been to in Cameling, we still really enjoyed it and got
more from it.  We love President and Sister Brimhall.  We had talked to
President Clark this morning and there is some concern as to the home we had
planned on renting for the Maharry’s, the landlord raised the rent.  When we
called President Clark after zone conference, he said that it was worked out. 
Mae and I then went to Tarlac shopping at Saver’s Mart and picked out a
refrigerator, a water heater, 3 fans and an air conditioner.  We called
President Clark for his approval.  He wants them to call him tomorrow.  We
think we have things lined up for delivery and installation for next Tuesday. 
We got home at 8 P.M.  The Assistants to the President returned our computer so
Mae went to work on it entering Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch to get it finished
so we can return it to the Elders tomorrow at District Meeting so they can take
it to the Branch President on Sunday.  Elder Karen couldn’t get the program to
work on our computer, but can transfer the data files to the office computer
and they work great.  At least we can print them out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, September 19, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had District meeting this morning so had to
get up for that.  We did sleep in a while, and then had to hurry to get ready. 
President Brimhall sent us a tex message asking us for some pictures and a
short write up on the Community Service Project we did as a zone last Wednesday. 
I prepared that after returning from District Meeting.  We also tried to get
the Branch Survey reports ready for the Elders to take to their respective
branches, but I talked to President Clark and we decided that we can wait until
a week from Sunday for them to be filled out.  Mae had me take a short nap this
afternoon.  We went out to Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> building, where we attended a
youth dance.  They had Mae and I teach some dance steps to the youth at the
beginning.  We tried to teach them the two step and the swing.  That went fair
and some of the youth tried to do the steps later during the dances.  The youth
were good sports and we enjoyed the evening.  It was fun dancing with Mae. 
When we would get dancing the floor would clear and they would clap for us,
that was a little embarrassing.  It was a good evening and we were impressed
with the youth and the youth leaders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, September 20, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in this morning because we didn’t think
it would be too busy of a day, but that soon changed.  We got a call from Elder
Shaw in Tarlac just before we were ready to sit down for breakfast.  He wants
us to give our Home Teaching/Visiting Presentation to their Stake on October 31<sup>st</sup>. 
I worked on getting an e-mail to President Brimhall and also attached 4
pictures of the Doria family which were taken at Jollibees in San Jose last
week.  While I was doing that, President Mercado came over and asked Mae if we
could bring the screen and overhead projector to the meetings which were
supposed to start at 12:00 noon in Guimba.  Mae hadn’t planned on going, but
President Mercado said “See you there” and Mae asked if she was invited as it
is usually just for the priesthood.  He said “yes, as we will have the
auxiliary leaders there.” We had to hurry in order to get President Brimhall’s
e-mail off.  It took us longer to get to Guimba because there were several
places where Palay was spread out on the road.  The meeting didn’t get started
until 1:00 and the first meeting was with the Branch Presidents, but only two
branch presidents were there – President Gajonera and President Cortez and a
counselor from Munoz 2nd.  President Mercado gave a good thought that I really
like, <b>“If we always do what we’ve always done, then we will always be what
we’ve always been!”</b>   The second meeting should have had all of the
auxiliary leaders there, including the branch presidencies, however, no one
else showed up so finally President Mercado cancelled the meeting and we came
home.  Mae did have some time to visit with Christopher and also Kathleen and
she felt it was important as Christopher is a new member of the church and he
had questions.  He is such a neat young man.  Mae sensed that Kathleen was
having problems so was able to talk with her and, hopefully, help her.  After
returning from the meetings, we went directly over to San Jose to do our
grocery shopping at the CVC store.  The grocery bill went quite a bit higher,
than we thought it should. Mae looked over it and found an error so we drove
back to the store and showed it to the manager, who went to the cashier and
they found the error.  Instead of the groceries costing us 3,972 Pesos, (almost
$80.00) it only cost us 2,300 Pesos ($46.00).  We stopped and paid our water
bill, came on home and Mae quickly made a dessert while I warmed up leftovers. 
We were just eating when President and Sister Gajonera and their baby James
Justin and also Myra (Sister Gajonera’s sister) came.  I popped some pop corn. 
Within a few minutes Eliza and Eva, who are President Gajonera’s sisters came
as we had invited them also.  We enjoyed watching the video “The Other Side of
Heaven”.  As many times as we have seen it, Mae and I still enjoy seeing that
show.  We served the dessert with ice cream; we had drinks, popcorn and candy,
and yogurt for me.  We had a very enjoyable evening and walked the family up to
the main highway to catch a jeepnie home.  We did up the dishes before going to
bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had to get up at 5:30AM so we
could leave for Lupao, which is North of San Jose.  The Elders ask if we could
attend as they are dedication the new chapel.  When we got there early no one
was there.  We took a short drive and took some pictures before returning.  We
took some pictures of the building when we got back.  They held Ward Conference
but nothing was said about dedication the building.  I was asked to speak
during the Sacrament meeting.  I had felt that that might happen, as often when
we attend a new Branch or Ward, we are ask to speak, so had thought of a few
things.  When the Bishop asked me to speak and I saw the program, I was
surprised that they would ask as they had six or seven speakers on the program
already.  When we returned home, we ate some lunch and then took a nap.  We
attended the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch’s Sacrament meeting and before the
meeting started Brother Umipig told Mae that she was scheduled to speak, but he
had forgot to ask her.  She quickly prepared some thoughts and did a very good
job.  We really feel the guidance of the Spirit at time like that.  We heard
that Brother Silvia had hurt his arm and did not come to meetings today.  We
were visiting with President Mercado and indicated that Brother Silvia was
having problems and he said “They can expect things like that as they are
trying to prepare to go to the temple”.  It is true that Satan often tries to
stop us.   We stopped by their place and found them ok, but they didn’t have
the money for a trike fare to get to Church.  He had told his children that as
they hadn’t attended meetings that Elder and Sister Browning might come to see
them.  They were glad when we came.  I hope things soon start going better for
them.  We had Elder Clam and Ragasa for dinner this evening and then took them
to an appointment.  We went over to visit Brother and Sister Sariano and their
family for a few minutes.  The Sariano had come to church but I hadn’t seen
them so Mae felt we should stop by to see them and take some brownies.  We had
a nice visit, but Mae got mobbed by the children wanting her attention.  We
came home and Mae cleaned up the dishes and stacked them for Marlyn.  I filled
out my journal, but Mae then wanted me to check the e-mail.  We were up late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We did sleep in until almost 7AM, but we have
been on the computer all day trying to get work done.  We did get some e-mails
off and received a beautiful e-mail from Becky.  Scott sent us three pictures
of their family that we sure love.  We were after 11 PM getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up at 4:30AM to leave for Tarlac by
5:30AM, as we had to stop at the Bank of the Philippines and try to draw some
money out.  I could only get P10, 000 out of the ATM as our check has not
cleared yet.  Our water pressure is turned off at night lately, so when we get
up early, we don’t have water to shower with.  That is a pain.  We ate
breakfast at McDonald’s before going to Camiline to the home the Maharry’s will
be renting.  Savers from Tarlac delivered the refrigerator, air conditioner,
water heater and fans.  They had to wait for the Clarks to get there with the
money.  Mae and I stopped at Saver’s on the way home and ordered a mattress for
the Maharry’s.  When we got to Munoz, we stopped at Brother and Sister
Trabalno’s to see if they would accompany us to see the Galletes family
tonight.  They did and we had such an enjoyable visit.  We gave a presentation
on studding the scriptures.  We were very tired when we got home but received an
e-mail from Mike, with 4 attached photos, so had to take time to receive then. 
They are great pictures.  We also received a great e-mail from Shellie and
Maryon Frazier answered us back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke about 5AM this morning then and then went
back to sleep for a while.  I got on the computer and was there most of the
day.  I did make some calls on the bed and water dispenser for the Maharry’s. 
I had things arranged for Mae and I to go to Camiling on Friday to receive the
delivery, and then President Brimhall called and invited us to attend Zone
Leaders Counsel on Friday.  I had to make some changes in the schedule.  We had
an appointment with the Lozano family this evening.  We asked Marlyn to go with
us.  When we got there Sister Lozano asked if we would come back next week.  We
said yes and left.  We stopped and visited Sister Hilda Monta, the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch’s Relief Society President.  We had a nice visit with her.  We then came
home and I worked longer on the computer getting the district unit organization
charts completed and printed off.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, September 25, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended District meeting this morning.  I
was asked to give a spiritual thought in the one meeting.  Then in the general
meeting of the Zone, President Clark had asked me to talk to the Elders about
budgeting.  I tried to stress the importance of the Elders learning to budget
not just for now but to help them after their mission.  I guess I did a poor
job of that because I sure upset Mae and didn’t realize it until we had got
home and was eating dinner when I noticed that Mae was troubled about something. 
When I asked her what was wrong she told me that she thought I was quite male
chauvinistic.  I am not sure how to handle things like that.   Mae said I had
told the Elders that if they didn’t learn to budget, their wives couldn’t
either and they would be in a mess.  Mae told me that I made it sound like
women can’t budget and that she certainly couldn’t.  She said many women do a
better job at keeping budgets than men do and she felt she had done a good job
when she did the budgeting because she would just get it going good and I would
change jobs or we would move, and she would have to start over again since it
wouldn’t be the same salary, etc.   I apologized and we made up.  This
afternoon Mae gave me a haircut.  This evening we went to President Nieto’s to
watch the video “The Other Side of Heaven”.  We had told them that we would
bring the refreshments, so we bought ice cream, drinks and Mae made a fruit
cocktail desert.  We found out that they had changed from the Nieto’s to the
Umipig’s and Sister Umipig didn’t know we were bringing refreshments.  She had
prepared lots of fruit and a nice casseroles and had expected many more that
what showed up.  We really felt bad that we couldn’t eat the prepared foods, but
only the fruits and boughten items.  It was a very enjoyable evening.  It was
late when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 3:45AM and woke Mae at 4:20AM to get
ready to leave for Angeles at 5:30AM.  We picked up Elder Hilderbrant, Elder
Ragasa and Elder Clam rode with us.  We attended Zone Leaders Counsel at the
mission home.  Elder and Sister Maharry had arrived last night and attended
with us.  Elder Hilderbrant was interviewed and called to be a Zone Leader.  He
won’t know until next week where he will be assigned, but we know we will be
loosing him from San Jose.  We really enjoyed attending and being with all the
zone Leaders, the office Elders, the Assistances to the President, Brother and
Sister Clark and especially President and Sister Clark.  I got Elder Karen to
help me with a computer question.  He was sure busy with everyone wanting him
to assist them.  We stopped at a couple of stores trying to buy some soap for
Sister Nieto.  We were late leaving the mission home so we did not get to
Saver’s Mart in time to pay them, so I will have to return tomorrow.  We got a
cute e-mail from Jeff this evening.  Well it is late so will close for now and
try to get some sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, September 27, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had to go to Tarlac this morning to pay the
bill on the furniture that was delivered to the Maharry’s.  That took all
morning.  We got back in time to have some lunch and take a short nap before
going to a meeting to discuss the Health Fair to be held December 9<sup>th</sup>
&amp; 10<sup>th</sup>.  We’ve been ask to head the Staff Group Leader, which is
over all the other groups.  I have some reservations as to whether or not
President Brimhall will approve that assignment.  I asked president Nuque to
e-mail President Brimhall to ask for his approval.  After finishing there we
debated on going out to visit some families, but decided to go home first to
get organized.  It started raining hard and continued into the night.  I felt
quite confused and depressed as to our focus.   Mae got on the computer and
wrote the family letter.  I studied the Church Handbook of Instructions as to
the meetings that should be held under the direction of the District or Stake
President, and it amazing.  Here again I am not sure what direction I should
take.  We have worked for almost the whole time we have been here on Home
Teaching and Visiting Teaching, but I don’t see any thing that has developed
from that and I don’t know what we should do about it.  I guess that my nature
just wants to fix things and when I can’t, I get frustrated and concerned.  Mae
doesn’t seem to understand that, she thinks we are making a difference and that
I am being too negative.    I fell asleep while she was typing on the letter,
so when we went to bed I couldn’t sleep so got up for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch this
morning and really enjoyed all the meetings.  Elder and Sister Clark came but
were late because of the slow traffic due to road construction, a wreck and
palay on the road.  We invited them to come home with us for dinner.  Mae
prepared roast beef, potatoes and carets for dinner.  We enjoyed visiting with
them.  They had to leave at 3PM, so Mae and I attended the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch Sacrament meeting.  We had Elder Clam and Elder Ragasa over for dinner
this evening.  Our land line has been dead all day so we have not been unable
to e-mail our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking this morning.  We are
trying to decide where to place our focus and what we can do to help the work
go forward here.  We see many problems, but do not know what the solutions
are.  I balanced our bank statement from the Bank of the Philippine Island.  We
finished up the letter to our family and took it down to the computer café as
our land line still isn’t working.  We also sent a short note to Mike and
David.  We got an e-mail from Shellie who again balled me out for not trying
harder to learn the language.  I really didn’t need that as far as my mood, but
maybe I do.  After lunch we went over to San Jose grocery shopping and to make
our monthly bank deposit and withdraw.  This evening we went to visit President
Gajonera and President Nieto to line up a time to meet with them and go over
the CMIS.  It was 7:30 PM when we got home.  We got something to eat and when
to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke during the night with some concerns and
so decided that I needed to fast and pray for my Father in Heavens help, for I
do not know how to proceed.  My 1<sup>st</sup> concern is over the focus of the
work we have been doing.  Most of our focus has been on the Home Teaching and
Visiting Teaching.  We have been here for six months and I feel that we have
seen very little if any difference in those programs.  The other concern is the
language.  I have made almost no progress with this area.  Shellie has said that
I’m lacking faith; Mae feels I am not spending enough time studying and
probably both are right.  Anyway, I feel that I need help from more that myself
so am turning to the Lord in Fasting and Prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went walking again this morning.  I helped
Mae get breakfast for her and the Elders.  After breakfast we studied on
Tagalog.  While we were discussing the language, President Nieto called Elder
Clam and asked if they could meet him at 5PM to try to go through the CMIS and
get it ready for Elder and Sister Browning, as we were coming for it this
evening.  As we discussed the situation we realized that he did not understand
what we had discussed with him last night.  He may have worried about it all
night.  We wanted to help him.  We asked the Elders to try to explain what we
want to do and see if we also can come at 5PM to help.  We waited all day for
the phone co. to come to repair our phone line, but they never did.  A delivery
man brought our phone bill and Mae asked him about our phone being dead.  He explained
that the phone co. is putting in some new lines in our area and that no one had
service in out area.  It will be until at least Thursday before service will be
restored.  I worked on Microsoft Access this afternoon trying to get reports
ready to send to President Brimhall this coming weekend.  Elder Karen called me
and helped me with the report layout.  Elder Clam sent a text to us, to let us
know that we could come up to President Nieto’s at 5PM.   There were several
there from the Branch.  I explained the Church record concept to them, and then
we started going through the CMIS and marking it.  President Nuque came and
recognized what we were doing and felt that he had a better knowledge of the
membership in the Branch than any of us there.  He suggested that he go through
and mark the CMIS for us, but that he would have to wait until Saturday
morning.  We decided that that would be the best so adjourned until Saturday at
8:30AM.  Mae and I then went to the Galletes family and had an enjoyable discussion
with them as to the blessings that we had experienced because of the Gospel in
our lives.   We felt good at the way that went and the Spirit that was there. 
I tried to print a program for Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch Conference, that
President Gajonera had given me last night, but couldn’t get it to print like I
felt it should.  I will have to get Roger Silvia to help as he was the one that
designed it.  I am glad that they asked me to print the program for Branch
Conference, for as I read it I found that I was one of the speakers on the
program.  Oh well, I guess I would have found out sooner or later!  It was
after 10PM before I completed my journal entry.</p>
