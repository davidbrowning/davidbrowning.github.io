<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            It
was a normal Saturday morning as we got up to start the day.  While I took a
shower, Tyler had Grandma Play games with him. Shauna started breakfast, Mae
went to take a shower and though I played with Tyler, he soon wanted to watch
TV.  Shauna turned it on and saw a news bulletin that the Space Shuttle
Columbia had just exploded as it re-entered the atmosphere, all aboard of
course are gone.  We watched the reports as they came in most of the morning. 
Mae played &quot;Mother May I&quot; with Tyler &amp; Emily quite a bit and it
was fun to see how she &amp; the children enjoyed it.  We said our goodbye's
with tears in our eyes and left for home at 2:45 PM.  We stopped at Target and
bought a wedding gift for Joey and Stephanie Maurer.  We selected an Iron that
was on a display priced $9.99, but when it rang up, it was $19.99.  Mae asked
the clerk about the price and said we would select another, but the clerk said,
&quot;No&quot; and changed the price to the display price.  That is good public
relations.  I hope people don't take advantage of it.  As we traveled home Mae
had us study the Tagalog language.  By the time we got to Inkom, my head was
hurting and I was frustrated.  Mae recognized the frustration and she became
frustrated for she doesn't know how to help me and I don't either.  It became
tense for a while, but we talked about it.  Though we didn't come to a
solution, we got over any bad feelings.  We got home after 6 PM, hurried to
change clothes and went to the Reception.  It was a nice reception, and we
enjoyed visiting with many we know.  Most of the conversations turned to our
Mission Call.  We set a date to attend the Temple and go out to eat with Keith
and Kathleen Nelson.  After leaving the reception, we stopped at the grocery
store, then at Artic Circle for a fish sandwich.  We were late getting to bed
but it has been a good day.  I sure have a special Sweetheart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in until after 8 AM, then Mae did some typing on Mom Jensen's history and
I caught my journal up.  Bob came down and invited us to dinner after Church. 
Mae called Shellie to see how they are doing.  Jase is being a hand full for
her as he is getting into more things, breaking items and writing on walls and
furniture.  I told her to be grateful she can still put him to bed at nights.  
Time went by so fast that we had to hurry to be ready for our appointment with
the Stake Presidency.  However when we got to the Stake office, it was locked. 
We tried to call Brother Laprevote, but he is out of town.  We finally went to our
meetings.  Special Fasting and Prayers are being offered for Lorin Davis and
Candace Tesch, both having extreme medical problems.  Many friends talked to us
about our Mission Call.  Sister Maggie Klass gave us two figurines made by
Billy, one small ceramic figurine of Christ and the other glassed ceramic
figurine of a couple.  He wanted us to have them, in expression of our
friendship, and in appreciation for a book we had given him at the time of his
Fathers passing, friends are great!  We stopped at Scott's for a minute to say
Hi!  Kylan is so excited to have us come and Ashley is getting to enjoy us
holding her also.  We are so blessed with a neat Family.  We ate a nice chicken
and noodle dinner with Bob and Carroll.  This evening Mae and I continued
working on personal histories.  It is nice having two computers, so we can both
be typing at the same time.  Jeff and Gale came over for a few minutes, to
visit and sign some insurance papers.  We continued working on our histories until
it was after mid-night when we went to bed.  It is sure nice being retired,
although our calendar is sure full of things to do and places to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It is nice to be able to sleep in and not feel
the pressure of being at a job on time.  I am sure we will need to have a
little tighter schedule when we get on our mission.  When we did get up, we got
busy and didn't stop to eat breakfast until around 10 AM.  I wrote a letter to
President Brimhall in response to his phone call, then used Mark's computer and
sent the letter by E-mail.  Mae and I went shopping for items we need to take
with us on our mission.  We thought we were well organized but still had some
confusion.  We went into Riverdale, where we bought a new set of hair clippers.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We came back to Inkley's and arranged for family
pictures to be taken just before Jeff &amp; Gale's Wedding Breakfast.  We drove
over to Kaysville, to check with Joanne's Restaurant about taking the pictures
there, and found that it was closed.  I went to leave, but Mae asked me to
drive around back, just to see if anyone was in the office, but we found no
one.   I was going to leave, but Mae said that there was a light in there.  I
told her that it was just a “night light”, but she insisted so reluctantly I
stopped and she jumped out of the car and checked the door, but found it was
locked.  A car, which had just drove into the parking lot stopped and a lady
asked us if we had a Banquet scheduled there?  When Mae said that we have a
Wedding Breakfast scheduled, the lady said that Joanne has lost her restaurant,
and that she (this lady) would be the new manager.  She said that Joanne had
taken the banquet schedule with her and would not let them know who had
scheduled the banquet rooms.  This lady said she would call us tomorrow so we
can reschedule with her.  We were sure glad that we had gone over there.  We
were just totally amazed at how the timing of everything could possibly have
worked out so that she was able to see us in the parking lot and felt that she
should stop and ask us, and that we were only in the parking lot because Mae
felt impressed that we should be there.  We felt that there had to have been
some intervention because had we not followed Mae’s impressions and had the
woman not had the impression to drive down and check the building, we would
have never made those connections and on Jeff and Gail’s wedding day, we would
have arrived there and there would have been no preparations for the wedding
breakfast.  We don’t know what we would have done.  We know the Lord loves his
children, and since Jeff and Gail were getting married in the temple, he wanted
them to have a special day. <span style='color:black'> </span> We were sure
glad that we had gone over there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             We did other shopping for Mae a dress for the
wedding, white shirts, socks, belt, bras, nylons, western boots and other
miscellaneous items.  We stopped and got a fish sandwich for dinner, and on the
way home bought a frozen yogurt.  It was sure fun shopping with Mae.  We got
home about 11 PM.  (Modified Oct. 26, 2004 – before sending this to Gail for
her scrapbook) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up at 8 AM and I wrote in my journal, and then transferred data to our palm
pilot.  Bob came down and visited for a few minutes.  We were late getting
breakfast and had to rush to be ready for our lesson in Tagalog.  Because Mae
has an appointment for her and Mishelle at 1:00 PM, Brother Black moved his
schedule up to 11:30 AM.  While Mae and Mishelle were gone, I tended Kylan.  He
cried when Mishelle left, but soon settled down and we had a good time.  Mae
and Mishelle had gone to meet with Jennie Porter, trying to see if she can help
Mishelle with her many health problems.  Jennie at least gave Mishelle some
hope.  They were gone until after 3 PM.  I tried to call Joanne's <span
style='color:black'>Restaurant but the phones are disconnected.  We drove over
to Kaysville before going to our appointment at the Stake Presidents office and
talked to the new manager of Joanne's, she said that she hadn't called us
because she won't have phone service until Friday.  We got ever thing scheduled
for the Wedding Breakfast.  President Craven gave me a Priesthood Blessing, and
then Brother Stratton, a High Councilman, gave Mae a Priesthood Blessing.  Both
Blessings were very appropriate and reminded us of the Love Our Father has for
us.  We were told that we would be guided to accomplish the work we are
assigned to do.  President Craven also felt impressed to share with us a
scripture, D &amp; C 101:1-5.  He counseled us to put our names in place of
Joseph and Sidney.  Both blessings confirmed things we are aware of.  I think I
especially need to work harder and have more Faith.  After returning home, we
got something to eat, called and visited with June Moulton, then watched two
shows of &quot;JAG&quot; that Bob had recorded for us.  We started to watch
another show, but decided it was too late.</span></p>

style='color:black'>            I took extra time entering my journal entry due
to unfamiliarity's with this computer.  We received and made many phone calls
this morning.  We received an E-mail from President Grant Brimhall, in response
to the E-mail I sent to him on Monday.  It was really good to receive his
welcome and answer to some questions.  I balanced our bank statement and that
wasn't too good, we are going through money to fast.  I am not sure where the
time went, but the day went by fast.  Both Mae and I got treatments from
Randy.  We were late getting to bed, just trying to get organized.</span></p>

for an appointment by 9 AM.  We met with Dr. Jacobson to set up appointments
for Colon tests, and then went to Dr. Lee's office, where Mae got some of her
mission shots.  Next we went to Dr. Bennett's and both got treatments.  We went
to Inkle's and exchanged our camera case for a smaller one, then to Bath Bed
&amp; Beyond and got a wedding shower gift for Gale.  We ate a Big Whooper for
lunch as we drove, and got home in time for our lesson in Tagalog.  We then met
Keith and Kathleen Nelson at Chuck-A-Rama for dinner.  We then went with them
to the Ogden Temple and attended a Session.  It was a long and fast day, but we
enjoyed it.  Mae stayed up late working on various items, but I was had so went
to bed.</span></p>

style='color:black'>            I woke at 1:30 AM and couldn't sleep, so got up
and wrote a letter to Larry.  I don't know if I will ever send it or not.  It
was after 6 AM when I finished and tried to go back to bed.  Mae let me sleep,
but I only slept a couple of hours.  We got some things done around the house. 
I made some calls, adjusted the sensor on Bob's back porch light.  David called
and is concerned for our safety with us going to the Philippines.  From the
news reports, the United States is now on &quot;orange&quot; alert concerning
the possibilities of a Terrorist attack.  Both the Middle East and North Korea
are real problems now and war could break out at any time.  He also has a
friend that he works with, that ask one of the Dr. that he called on, what he
thought of the news.  The Dr. asks him if he really wanted to know.  When he
said he did, the Dr. said he thought it is the End of the World starting.  He
showed him through scripture just why he thought that.  I had to tell David
that I agreed, and that if it is, I can't think of a better thing to be doing
than the Lords work.  We talked for several minutes.  He is sure sweet to call
us, and I appreciate his concern for us and our safety.  Mae called our
daughters and daughters-in-laws to talk to them about the color coordination
for Jeff and Gale's Wedding Reception.  They are ok with it, so I had better
keep quiet and calm about it.  I wish that I hadn't said any thing last night
about the flowers and dresses.  This afternoon Mae took the car and went
shopping for the Shower she is giving tomorrow.  I used the pickup and took the
V.C.R. over to Mishelle's so Kylan could watch a video and she could get some
rest.  I then went to Dr. Bennett's for another treatment, picked up a gas
additive for the storing of our vehicles, returned the pajamas I had bought at
J. C. Penney's and ordered two other pair, checked with Radio Shack on a surge
protector, then went to Tuxedo Junction to be measured for a Tuxedo, from there
I stopped at the shoe store to get my boots repaired.  It was after 6 PM before
I got home.  Mae had dinner prepared when I got home.  We watched a show on TV,
but Mae kept busy as normal, preparing got Gail's shower tomorrow.</span></p>

She let me sleep in a little longer, but I woke shortly after 8 AM.  I was able
to help her get the car loaded.  I stopped to check with Bob about the light. 
It seems to be working better now.  I ate then got the dishes done.  Scott came
over to help me reinstall our scanner.  I had planned on scanning the pictures
that Mae had assembled of her Mother's, but we spent most of the day, until
Scott finally had to take Kylan home.  I continued with out success until Mae
came home.  We then went to Tooele to attend a 45th wedding anniversary for Tom
and Karen Egglund.  We really enjoyed visiting with several of our old friends
from Erda.  We took some pictures, so when we got home; we transferred them to
our computer.  Mae was very tired after the busy day she had.  I worry about
her and the speed that she keeps going.</span></p>

but time goes fast, plus I got a call asking that I be at the church at 11:45
AM to meet with the Bishop.  Mae prepared dinner and but it on to cook at
Scot's.  Meetings were very good and we enjoyed the block.  Jeff and Gail came
over to Scott's also for dinner.  After dinner we played games for a while. 
Jeff &amp; Gail had to go over to their home to prepare for the Single Adult's
to come this evening for their Ward prayer.  Mae and I stopped over to their
place for a few minutes to see how they were doing.  They are sure starting out
married life with some nice things.  Gail has been preparing for marriage even
before she completed High School.  She has also had several showers and received
many nice gifts.  We left when several guests started arriving.  We thought we
could get to bed early, but it was late as normal.  I had a bad headache so
slept in the recliner tonight.</span></p>

closed out the Browning Family account and our savings account.  It was 12:30
PM when we got to Mike's.  I repaired the plumbing to the tub in the upstairs
bathroom.  This evening was mainly taken up by Mike helping Mae and I learn how
to scan photos.</span></p>

we took our lesson in Tagalog.  After our lesson, I scanned some pictures into
Mike's computer.  After Mike got home from work, he &amp; I went to the bank,
where I added Mike onto our checking account.  We then drove to Provo and
bought me a photo shop program.  Mike, Becky, Mae and I played a game and
visited this evening.  At 11 PM we let Mike &amp; Becky go to bed.  Mae and I

into my computer.  This evening Mae tended the children, so Mike and Becky

behind.  Mae and I decided to scan the Porter family pictures in by the page
for now, and then we will go back and edit them when we have more time.  Mike
helped me organize our lap top computer.  Mike then burned a CD with the
pictures that I had copied to this point.  This evening we played two games of
&quot;Settlers&quot;, the second one I won.  Out of the six or eight times we

family members were invited to a lunch at the Golden Corral.  It was a great
time and we sure enjoyed being with the family.  After getting home Mae and I
worked on the two computers with up dating our name and address fills and I
designed some flip cards for our Tagalog memorization.  We were going to do

our children know, so we called all of them.  Bob came down and we talked to
him.  The morning sure went by fast and before we know it, it was time to go to
church.  Meetings went well and I think my lesson in Priesthood went ok.  We
went over to Visit Teach and Home Teach Vicky Hall and Lori, also helped Vicky
with a recording she is making.  From there we stopped at Crystal Lowery to
return the name cards for some Family Research that I did the endowments for. 
We came home thinking we had the rest of the evening to do things, when Roy
called and ask if they could come over.  We were just preparing dinner so
invited them to eat with us.  Irven called and ask if they could come also.  We
just added some more potatoes to the pot and made plenty of gravy, then enjoyed
the evening with them.  After they left, I transferred the photos from our
camera to our computer.  It was after min-night when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'><span
style='color:black'>            Most of today was spent on our computers; Mae
worked mainly on training materials for the Tagalog language.  I spent my time
mainly scanning pictures.  This evening we went Home Teaching to Billie &amp;
Maggie Klass.  We were there for two hours, including Maggie fed us supper. 
That's a record long time for H.T.  We did enjoy the visit and they are good friends. 
They gave us a Statue of Christ to give to Jeff &amp; Gail for there wedding. 
We also did some shopping for blouses for the girls, but didn't find anything. 
We did more on the computers after getting home.  We were late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'><span
style='color:black'>            This morning I fixed breakfast while Mae
cleaned house.  I then got on the phone for over two hours, checking on our
baggage and medications we need to take with us.  That was not very
successful.  I sent an E-mail to Sister Clark, using Mark's internet.  That
takes longer, for Mark likes to visit and I enjoy visiting with him.  I got
more pictures scanned into the computer.  Colleen Forsyth (maiden name Moulton)
called me to let us know that DelMar had fallen a week ago and was now in a
nursing home and not doing well.  We drove over to see him and though I don't
know if he knows we were there, we were able to visit with Sister Moulton and
some of their children.  We went to the Bountiful Temple and were able to go
through the session with Juliann, Roy and Linda.  After the session we were
invited to stop at Linda's cousin for desert.  We left there and went to Jennie
Porter's to get some items.  Every where we go, Mae is studding our Tagalog
Language and I feel the pressure continually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'><span
style='color:black'>            I didn't sleep very well, so Mae let me sleep
until 7:45 AM.  We have had several phone calls this morning.  Colleen called
to let us know that DelMar passed away at 9 PM last night.  I am so glad that
we took the time to stop over yesterday.  Mae gave me a hair cut after we ate
breakfast.  I called Larry Braithwaite to let them know of Delmar's passing. 
Mae left at 11 AM to attend a Dr. Appointment and do several other items.  I
did the dishes and de-boned a chicken that Mae had cooked the other day.  Bob
brought Cole down for me to tend for a few minutes.  He had to take Carroll
into the hospital with heart problems.  Sherrie came in just a few minutes and
got him.  I studied for our lesson and got prepared for that, then took a short
nap that was interrupted three times by phone calls.  Mae was a few minutes
late for our tutoring lesson, so Brother Black and I got started with out her. 
She came just as we were ready to have a prayer.  I got ready to meet with Ed
Sorenson to prepare our income tax forms and was going to run a couple of other
errors but Mae wanted me to put up my computer.  I finished scanning Mom
Porter's pictures into our computer.  Roy, Shellie and the boys came just as I
was finishing up.  I went over to Ed's, but he was late getting home.  Some how
his wife had made a mistake in his schedule and I think Scott missed out on his
appointment with Ed.  Dinner was ready when I got home.  Garrett bought a new
Palm Pilot, so he and I did some comparing and trading of programs.  I am amazed
at the abilities these kids have with computers.  Time passed to quickly and we
were late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'><span
style='color:black'>            We were up at 6 AM to be ready and at the Salt
Lake Temple at 9 AM.  Jeff and Gale got there a few minutes later.  Gale's
Uncle and I were witnesses to the marriage. Elder Halverson was the Sealer that
performed the marriage and he did a beautiful job with very good advice and
insight as to the covenants entered into with the marriage covenant.  The other
thing that was so special was that we had all of our children and their
companions in there.  There were a total of 56 people in attendance.  After the
wedding we went out for pictures on the Temple Grounds, then we held a Wedding
Breakfast at the Kayscreek Banquet Center, and that went very well.  We were
served Corn on Blue with baked potato, vegetable and carrot cake for desert. 
The food was served hot and in a timely manor.  After the concerns we have had
with the arrangements of this dinner, we were much relived at the way it turned
out.  We had 110 family and friends attend the Breakfast.  We had a
photographer from Inkle's Photo come there and take Family pictures for our
family.  The Bride &amp; Groom didn't get there until 2 PM so we started the
dinner and had the photographer come back to finish after we ate.  We had time
to go home and relax for just a few minutes, then went to the Snowcreek Chapel
for more pictures and at 6 PM friends and family came to a reception.  We had a
continual line of people coming through until 9:15 PM.  We stopped the line,
about 8 PM, long enough for Chelci to sing two songs for the Bride &amp;
Groom.  The Bride &amp; Groom then cut the cake and the Bride tossed the
Bouquet.  Jeff, Gale, Mae &amp; I watched their wedding video.  Mae &amp; I
hauled a load of gifts to Jeff &amp; Gale's home, Marcille and Gale's brother
also brought a load each over.  It was after 11 PM when we finished getting all
the gifts into their home.  Mae &amp; I stopped at Taco Time for something to
eat before we went home.  Roy &amp; Shellie had just got the boys to bed when
we got home.  Our children had all gone to Scott &amp; Mishelle's to visit and
play games.  We were up for another hour visiting before going to bed.</span></p>

style='color:black'>            Roy, Shellie and Garrett went skiing at Powder
Mountain this morning.  Mae went to Dr. Bennett's this morning, and then did
some other errands.  I tended the younger boys while she was gone.  This
afternoon I took Jeff and my tuxes back, washed Jeff's car, bought cards and
flowers for Steven Browning and Delmar Moulton's funerals.  This evening Roy,
Shellie, Mae &amp; I went to Salt Lake where we met Mike and Becky at the Black
Angus, for dinner.  We enjoyed being together and visiting.  We sure feel
blessed with our family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'><span
style='color:black'>            All of our family, except Jeff &amp; Gale, came
for breakfast.  Bob prepared biscuits for us and I made gravy and eggs.  Mike
had prepared a slide show of Jeff &amp; Gale's wedding and showed it to us.  He
also helped me burn a CD of the Porter pictures that I have scanned.  Sandi had
us play a game together as a family.  A paper shopping bag was placed on the
floor and each person had to bend down, not allowing hands or knees to touch
the floor, and pickup the bag with his mouth.  After each had done this, a
couple of inches would be cut off the bag and the next round would start.  I
was eliminated on the second round.  Roy, Brad and Sandi stayed in until there
was less than 1/2 inch left.  Chelci was still in, so Brad took a $5.00 bill
and placed it on the floor and challenged Chelci that she could have it if she
could pick it up, and she did.  I left at 1 PM to attend Steven LeRoy
Browning's viewing.  Mae, Sandi, Shellie &amp; Roy, Mike, David and Scott came
up before the Funeral.  Roy and Linda ask me to conduct the services.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'><span
style='color:black'>            After the Services, we again gathered with our
Family and had lunch.  This evening Mae gave birthday gifts to all of our
grandchildren, as we will be gone for the next two years.  We sure enjoy our
family.  By 8 PM all of them had left for home.  Mae and I then cleaned up the
house.  Roy &amp; Linda came over about 9:30 PM and visited for a while. 
Families are special.  Mae &amp; I watched JAG, which Bob had recorded for us. 
I sure love that girl! <img width=576 height=363

went so fast.  We were working on our computers when Mae asks me what time it
was.  We were both very surprised when it was 11:45 AM and we had to hurry to
get to our meetings.  After meetings we stopped at Scott's for a minute then
took the Family Goal poster from the Stake to each of our Home Teaching
Family.  We spent the rest of the afternoon and evening working on our
computers.  Mae had me scan several more pictures into our computer.  It seems
that a lot of time can be spent on the computer.  We did get an E-mail sent to
Brother Black.  We received a nice e-mail from Sister Clark of the Philippines
Angeles Mission.  She said that they have found us a nice home.  It was after
mid-night when we got to bed.</span></p>

style='color:black'>            Mae &amp; I left this morning at 9 AM to get
our tax returns.  It looks like we will get $2,000 back from Federal and just
under $600 from the State.  That will sure help.  We went over to Nancy's and
got some pills for Mae, then went to the Viewing and Funeral for Delmar M.
Moulton.  Although sad to have him gone, we are happy that he is relieved from
the pain he was in the other day when we visited him in the nursing home.  His
wife and family are comforted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the assurance
of a Glorious Reunion with him in the future.  He was a wonderful man who has
lived a good and full life.  We had the opportunity to visit with several that
we know when we lived there in Ogden, Laura Dixon, Dale &amp;  Cora Thinnes,
Carol Peterson, Marian Rice and of course all of Delmar's children and their
family's.  June is doing very well but I doubt if she will be with us very much
longer, they were to close as a couple to be separated very long.  We came home
to change and eat.  We worked a little on the computers getting my journal
caught up, scanning a few pictures, and preparing some flip cards to help us
with the Tagalog language.  We went to Tooele and visited with LaDel and
Eleanor Brown.  We visited and played Rook, at which Mae and LaDel won at over
500 to -290.  It was sure a wonderful evening.  It snowed this evening so the
roads were slippery in some areas as we came home.  Mae studied both going and
coming.  It is amazing to me how she can memorize the Tagalog words and their
meaning.  The language is what scares me about this mission call for I am not
getting it.  Everyone keeps telling me that it is because I am telling my self
that I cannot memorize or that I just lack confidence, or don't worry for it
will come, but what ever the reason, I am not getting it.  I was sure tired
when we got home.</span></p>

style='color:black'>            Both Mae and I woke feeling under pressure from
all we need to do to be ready to enter the M.T.C.  I tried for over an hour to
call the Philippines Consult Office in San Francisco; I also tried L.A. and
Wash. D.C., before finally reaching a live person.  They told me that in order
to take our nuturanance into the Philippines with us, I needed a letter signed
by a Doctor.  Bryce wanted me to come up and talk to him as what he should do
to lay tile flooring, lower the ceiling and install new cupboards in their
kitchen.  I stopped in Sunset trying to find Edith Mayhue's home, but didn't
remember the address.  I got home in time to take a 10 minute nap before taking
our tutoring lesson in Tagalog.  Mae and I then went back to Edith's and she
let us borrow a picture of Roy's family.  I then took Mae to a Dr. Appointment
to have her eyes checked.  While she was there I went over to Speedy Pack and
mailed a bucket of whey to the mission home in the Philippines.  I also
laminated some sheets for Mae.  Mae was ready when I got back to the doctors
office.  From there we went to Inkley's to see the proofs of our Family
Pictures we had taken.  We then went to Bowman's and filled some prescriptions
for Mae and bought us some fried chicken for dinner.  We stopped at Scott's to
see if we had large suit case there.  We visited a while there, then went to
Jeff &amp; Gail's and watched them open their wedding gifts.  They got a lot of
very nice gifts.  They gave both Mae and Marci a bouquet of flowers in
appreciation for the Wedding Reception.  We enjoyed being with them and seeing
how happy they are.  It was late but we stayed up and watched TV for a while
before going to bed.</span></p>

Mae went to lunch with her good friend Jackie.  This evening I went over to
Kathy Sheffield's and with the help of Brother Hawks, administered to her.  She
is having attacks of kidney stones.  She is pretty sick.  I also bought some
rubbers for my boots, some down pillows and a set of luggage.  I also stopped
at the Davis Hospital for my prep kit that I will take tomorrow before going
into the hospital on Friday.  I was tired when I got home so just quit.  I
watched &quot;JAG&quot; that Bob recorded for me last Tuesday.  Mae kept going
until 11 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

you our.  We had our Tutoring session, though I had to excuse myself several
times.  Mae has sure been good with me and felt bad that I had to do this on my
Birthday.  David and Sandi both called me to wish me a Happy Birthday.  Mae bought
me a balloon and a frozen yogurt that I have to save until after tomorrow. 
Terry called to thank Mae for the picture she sent to him as a Birthday Card. 
She sure enjoyed visiting with him.</span></p>

7:30 AM for my colon test.  The test it self wasn't too bad. Dr. Johnson
removed one small spot but said every thing else was ok.  We had to weight a
while for the anticsedick to wear off.  A nurse that was born in the Philippine
came in and talked to us about the area we will be going to.  It was really
enjoyable visiting with him.  We went over to Scott's so we could tend the
children while Mishelle went visiting teaching.  I really wasn't feeling very
well as my system is trying to get reestablished, so I went to sleep.  Mae took
Kylan with her to get our clothes so we can stay with Scott &amp; Mishelle for
the weekend.  This evening we made the bed and studied for our lesson
tomorrow.  We think that as we made the bed, Mae must have stepped on the cord
and unplugged the heater to the bed, for when we went to bed, the matter was
very cold.  We had to sleep on top of the covers to keep warm.</span></p>
