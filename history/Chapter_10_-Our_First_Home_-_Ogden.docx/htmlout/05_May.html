<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up and went walking at the collage this morning.  It was a beautiful
morning and we enjoyed the walk.  We took the camera with us and took a few
pictures.  After breakfast Elder Jex and Elder Irorita came over and brought us
our money and the bucket of whey that finally came.   We were glad to see the
whey arrive for we were down to the last bag of whey we had brought.  They
worked with us for a while on the Tagalog language before they left.  We worked
on entering more membership records onto our computer.  There are a lot of
errors in the membership records and will take a while to get them corrected. 
Brother Ronald came over and installed a light above the kitchen sink for us. 
We went to San Jose to open a bank account, but the Banks are all closed until
Monday.  We ended up stopping at the store and shopping for some groceries. 
For dinner this evening we cooked a chicken on the rotisserie to see how it
did.  It turned out very good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
decided to sleep a little longer rather than get up and go walking this
morning.  We attended Missionary District meeting this morning.  This afternoon
we went to an inter-net cafe and pulled off the forms sent to us by Elder
Pearson for Home Teaching.  That took about 1/2 hour to down load it.  After
lunch we went to San Jose and bought a hand held cell phone.  We worked on
inputting the membership of Guimba 2nd Branch.  Mae did most of it as she can
type much faster than I.  She also took the time to type a letter to our
family.  It rained hard for over an hour this afternoon starting about 4 PM. 
We don't know if the rainy season is starting or if this is an unusual storm,
for every one has been telling us that it should start raining next month.  I
quite working on memberships about 8:30 PM to prepare for District Presidency
Meeting tomorrow, and to enter my journal entry, also wrote a letter to my
brothers.  It's late!</p>

went walking this morning, then came home and ate breakfast.  I attended
District Presidency meeting.  There was only President Mercado and I but we
held it anyway.  At 11AM Elder Clark, Elder Kendall, Elder Jex and Elder
Irorita came for District Correlation meeting.  That went well and after we
invited the Elders to eat dinner with us.  Mae had prepared a nice roast
chicken dinner.  This afternoon we planned on how to present some Leadership
Training.  We also went to San Jose and bought a hand saw and I cut the legs
off the wooden table.  We then moved the table into our bedroom and set the
computer up on it.  It will be a much cooler place to work and it will get the
mess out of the front room.  I worked on District records and an agenda most of
the evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
attended the block meetings of Munoz 1st Branch this morning; Mae bore her
testimony during the Testimony meeting.  We then came home and took a nap.  We
went back to the 2nd Branch Fast and Testimony meeting, and then stayed for the
Branch Priesthood Executive Committee meeting.  We were given more meetings to
try to attend, we are keeping very busy.  We went over to President Nuque's
home and talked to him as what President Mercado wants us to do for the
Leadership Meeting this coming Saturday.  It took us a while trying to find his
home with out the Elders help.  I have felt a lot of depression today and after
visiting with President Nuque it was even greater.  We are having a hard time
commutating with these people.  I know that a major reason is the language, but
I am not sure we think the same.  I'm sure that culture is a part of it.  I
feel so inadequate in this calling.  When I express this to Mae, it just upsets
her.  I am certainly learning a lot of empathy for Joanna.  We spent several
hours this evening, putting information together for President Nuque to look
over for suggestions for the leadership meetings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
worked on getting information for President Nuque in preparing for leadership. 
We went over to the inter-net cafe but they are having problems now so we couldn't
use it.  We took the papers over to President Nuque, and then went to San Jose
to the bank, but the manager isn't there today.  They can not open our account
with out her approval, so we will come back tomorrow.  We drove to Cabanatuan
to the mall.  There we got some office supplies that we needed.  Mae went to an
inter-net cafe while I went to the grocery store.  I found about 1/2 of the
things we wanted there.  When I got back to Mae, she had only been able to send
our letter to our family.  The inter-net was so slow that we gave up.  We
hadn't been able to find any material at the mall, but as we were leaving
Cabanatuan I saw a fabric shop.  We went back and were able to get the material
for me 3 pair of pants and for Mae two dresses.  We also stopped at a nursery
and got two pots and soil for Mae to plant tomatoes in.  President Nuque called
this evening and thanked me for the material and wants me to take 15 to 20
minutes of the meeting on &quot;The importance of starting the meetings on time&quot;. 
I transferred some pictures from the camera to the computer this evening while
Mae read a chapter of our book to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up and started our reading of the Book of Mormon in English and Tagalog,
when I became very depressed.  It just isn't coming through for me.  I am only
reading sounds.  We went walking this morning at the collage then came home and
prepared breakfast for the Elders.  They were late but it worked out anyway. 
They went down to the phone co. with us and we thought we got everything worked
out so that we can call long distant with out going through an operator.  The
lady at the phone co. said it would be working by this afternoon, but we tried
about 5 PM to call the Clarks and it wouldn't let us.  We went over to San Jose
to the Bank of the Philippines Islands and met with the Branch Manager.  She
was very pleasant  and we got an account opened  so that we can deposit a
checks drawn on Wells Fargo in Utah and after they clear, have them converted
to Paso's that we can draw out through a check, the ATM or at the Bank.  That
should work out.  We stopped at the store for a few items.  It took us all
morning to get those things done.  That is one thing about this place, things o
at a slow pace.  After lunch we took a nap.  I know that I am a real concern
for Mae because of my discouragement.  I worked on financial records for a
while and found the P700 mistake that Sister Clark had made in our
reimbursement.   We call to let them know.  Elder Clark and I visited a while
about ways to transport some of the families that lives some distant from town
into church.  Mae entered more records into our computer file and I did some
studying for my presentation this Saturday.  Mae prepared one of our favorite
casseroles for diner this evening.  It was sure good.  We tried to get E-mails
today, but everyone seems to be having problems and our phone doesn't work
yet.  That's the way things seem to go here.</p>

got and went walking this morning even though it was late before we got to bed
last night.  We got the phone working, so called our family.  We were able to
talk to Sandi &amp; Terry, Becky, Shellie and Jeff.  We didn't reach David or
Scott so just left messages for them.  Mae worked most of the day entering names
into the computer.  We took a break this morning and took the material for me
some new pants to President Mercado's mother.  We also took a lamp that we
bought at Cabanatuan to Ronald to see if he could fix it.  We learned a lesson
that you never buy anything like that with out testing it before you buy it. 
This afternoon we took another break and went to the internet cafe and got some
e-mail from Shellie, David Michael, David and Georgia.  While there we sent two
pictures to our family, an e-mail to my family, to Mae-s family and one to
Mae's friends from work.  Mae got the records all entered for Guimba 2nd Branch
before quitting tonight.  It was after 11 PM before we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were too tired to get up and go walking this morning.  We had a nice breakfast
and left in time to get to Zone Conference, but when we got there at 1/4 to, it
was already starting.  We felt bad coming late, and then President Brimhall
said that they had moved up the starting time and hadn't informed us of the
change.  It was a great conference and we really enjoyed it.  When we took a
break and had refreshments, I noticed that the Elders left a mess, so I got a
mop and broom and cleaned up.  When we finished up, Erma had box lunches for us
and again it was very good.  She will be leaving probably with in a month for a
job in Canada and will really be missed by the missionaries.  From Zone
Conference we took Elder Irorita and Elder Jex with us.  We stopped at
President Nuque's to get a projector to take to Guimba, but it was not at his
home.  We went out to Guimba 3rd Branch chapel where the District was holding a
Youth Conference.  It was well attended and well organized.  We went out with
the youth with the challenge to give away a Book of Mormon.  Elder Irorita, Mae
and I ended up talking to a young Mother with a 7 month old baby.  She is home
from Hong Kong long enough to have her baby, but in a couple of months she will
leave the baby with her mother-in-law and return to Hong Kong to earn money to
raise the baby.  That is to often the way these people are.  Oh how they need
the Proclamation to the World.  It started to rain so we had to return to the
Chapel.  A lady saw us hurrying to get out of the rain and came out with an
umbrella and walked to the chapel with us, then returned to her home with the
umbrella.  That was so sweet of her.  We got to visit with a couple of young
Sisters about some problems, I hope we helped.  We had to stop in Guimba and
buy some bottled water because we had ran out and were so thirsty.  We brought
Elder Irorita and Jex back home with us.  It was 8:30 PM by the time we got
home.  Mae fell asleep on the bed while I was making this entry.  She is so
special and good to me and I so often make her feel bad because of the way I speak
to her.  I did it again this afternoon.  I just hope she will keep forgiving
me.  She is sure a special girl and a great blessing in my life.  If I can just
live worthy of her so I can have her as my Eternal companion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
did get up and go walking this morning.  It was a beautiful morning and we took
a new route that we hadn't taken before.  The collage grounds are very
enjoyable, fairly quiet and peaceful.  There are many large trees that give
lots of shade.  We attended the Missionary District meeting this morning and
although we don't have a lot of assignment there, we enjoy the association with
the full time Elders, and are continually amazed at their leadership
abilities.  We stopped and bought Mae some ice cream on the way home, also
stopped at a road side stand and bought 6 mangoes.   Marlyn had a nice dinner
prepared for us when we returned.  I was on the phone with Elder Pearson at the
Mission Office, trying to get the Home Teaching programs working.  This
afternoon we went into Munoz to get help putting the internet line onto our
computer, but will have to wait until Monday morning.  I tried to find out what
was wrong with our camera as it quite taking pictures.  I finally gave up as I
needed to do more preparation on my presentation for tomorrow.  Mae read
through the instruction booklet on the camera and found where it said to
disconnect all power source for 3 minutes and let the computer reset it self. 
That worked and the camera seems to be working ok again.  David called this
evening.  It was so good to hear from him.   He will call again on Monday
morning for Mothers Day so the children can talk to us.  It was so good to hear
his voice.  We are late getting to bed again this evening.</p>

President and the Branch Presidents.  We got to Guimba at 9:45 AM and the Youth
Conference was still going.  That has really been a successful event and it was
well planned.  The Clarks got there at 10 AM, but there were no other leaders. 
At 11 AM we left and came to our place.  I guess I misunderstood and I found
out Sunday that the meeting was at 2 PM.  I guess that if I do not
understanding the language and do not understanding the way these people think,
I just get mixed up.  We really enjoyed visiting with the Clarks but felt bad
that they came out here for almost nothing.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
met with two Elders at San Jose this morning at 7:45.  We went to the chapel
where we met with the Bishop and his councilor.  One Elder went with the
Bishop, while the other Elder and the councilor went with Mae and me.  We
visited a couple that is less active.  He has been an Elders Quorum President
but hasn't gone to church for over a year or two.  He says that his problem is
that he can't conceive that as man is, God once was and that as God is, man may
become.  I told him that I couldn't conceive it either, but that I know that
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God and bore my testimony to the truthfulness of
the Church.  We challenged them to pray and read the Book of Mormon daily and
not to let things that we don't understand hang us up.  Through study, prayer and
time we will understand.  We had a very good visit with them and challenged
them to also prepare to get there Endowments in the Temple and to be Sealed for
Time and all Eternity in the Temple.  We also visited another Brother, but his
wife wouldn't come out and visit with us.  I got the feeling that she is not a
member.  We visited three Single Sisters that I understand are going to the
Institute Ward.  We then went back and reported out visits to the Bishop.  It
was a good morning.  We hadn't planned to be the complete morning and had
wanted to go to Guimba 2nd Branch and visit with the Branch President, but will
have to do that another day.  Mae isn't feeling the best, she has a tooth
ache.  She lay down for a few minutes while I prepared some lunch.  We attended
Munoz 2nd Branch meetings this afternoon.  When we got home this afternoon, Mae
laid down to sleep.  I made my journal entry.  </p>

has been rather a discouraging day.  Mae has had a tooth ache and hasn't felt
well.  I went down to the computer shop for an appointment to get the internet
put on our computer, but the owner I had the appointment with wasn't there. 
They reached him on the cell phone and he said he would meet me at 6 PM.  I
went to San Jose and it took me almost an hour to make a deposit.  I stopped at
the store and bought some groceries.  Other than doing some studying I didn't
get much done this afternoon.  I went down to the computer shop at 6 PM and it
was closed up.  I hope we are doing something that is worth while being here. 
I am sure the Lord sent us here for something, but right now I wonder what.  I
decided to try to connect to the internet myself.  I thought I got every thing
ready, but when I dial it gives me an error message.  I gave up for tonight. 
We did spend some time planning presentations and studying before going to bed.</p>

Irorita for breakfast.  Mike and David both called to wish Mae a Happy Mothers
Day.  I let them talk to her and the Elders helped me with Tagalog.  We also
discussed some other training for the Elders on Home Teaching.  Mae called Dr.
Mildred Santos Rosales in Angeles and got an appointment to get her teeth
checked this afternoon at 5 PM.  I ask the Elders if they would help me
administer to Mae, which they did.  President Brimhall called to find out how
Mae is doing and offered his concerns.  When I said we were bringing her to
Angeles to the Dentist he was glad.  He was also concerned as to me knowing the
way, and was relieved when I told him that Elder Jex had drawn me a map.  We
left for Angeles about 11 AM and got there before 2 PM.  Elder and Sister Clark
took us shopping.  Mae wanted to go even though she didn't feel very well.  Mae
was very impressed with Dr. Rosales.  She checked her teeth and cleaned them. 
She gave Mae a prescription for some medicine and wants her to come back Friday
afternoon.  The bill came to P800 or about $16.  She also doesn't think that removing
all of Mae's teeth and giving her false teeth will solve the problem but is
afraid that Mae will have trouble all of her life.  We came on home, getting
here after 9PM.  Mae went right to bed while I got things in and made this
journal entry.  I then played a game of Harts on the computer just to relax.</p>

still isn't feeling well so we again slept in.  Marlyn came this morning or we
probably would have slept longer.  We worked on the internet setup until we
finally got it working.  We were on the phone several times with the phone
company.  At first our line wasn't set up right.  Then we couldn't get it to
except our pass word.  We finally found out that the phone co. was having us
use the wrong pass word.  After getting it working we got the e-mails from
Scott, Jeff, Maggie Klaas, Jacqueline Thompson and Billie Ririe.  When I
started to read Scott's I got so homesick that I couldn't read.  Scott and
Mishelle also sent a beautiful picture they made for Mae especially for Mothers-Day. 
We sent our family letter to our children and sent all the family letters to
David and Shauna, as we found out that they haven't been getting the e-mails. 
This afternoon we took a nap, and then worked on outlines for our family
reactivation assignment.  Mae hasn't felt well all day.  Sister Mercado came
over with her son Larry and brought my slacks she made for me.  I tried all
three pair on and they are great.  When I ask her how much, she said P250
each.  I gave her P1000 for them and feel they are worth that.  We gave her
material for two dresses for Mae.  We visited for a while with them and really
enjoyed them.  After super Mae went to bed early.  I stayed up and did some
studying, then played a couple of games of Harts.  At 9:45 PM I woke Mae and
had her try to call Dr. Cottel, our Dentist in Utah.  Dr. Santos wants some
history on one of her teeth from him.  She tried to call but they are closed on
Wednesday and that is what day it is there.  We will have to try tomorrow
night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in, then at 8 AM Elder Jex and Elder Irorita came over to help us with
our Tagalog.  I guess I took up all the time so we decided that next time Elder
Irorita will help Mae and Elder Jex will help me.  The Elders wanted to use our
computer to plan some of the training for the Elders in the District meetings. 
We invited them to have lunch with us.  After lunch and doing up the dishes, we
took a nap.  I went down to the Munoz Chapel at 4 PM for a meeting with the
Munoz 2nd Branch concerning Home Teaching.  I waited until 5 PM but no one came
so I went over and filled the car with gas and came home.  I was upset that no
one came for the meeting and expressed my frustrations by throwing my boot
down.  I'm not sure but I must have also sworn.  Anyway I really upset Mae.  I
went outside to go for a walk, but don't feel good about walking here on the
streets, so just set out on the porch trying to sort through my feelings.  When
I came back in Mae was writing me a letter and really bawled me out for my
actions.  I guess I deserve it, but I am very frustrated not knowing what to
do.  Elder Jex advised me to just pick one pronoun and listen for that word as
I hear the people speak.  While I was outside I tried that with the family
across the street, but didn't pick out one word that was said.  Along with the
language, I am not sure how to help the Priesthood Leaders, especially when I
can't meet with them.  I have prayed for guidance and direction and
understanding, put as of yet that hasn't happened.  I also need patients.  I
not sure of my feelings, not alone, being able to put them down in writing. 
When we took our showers this morning the drain plugged up and we had a
swimming pool in our bathroom.  Because of our problems and having to call Dr.
Cottel in Ogden, we were very late getting to bed.  I had Elder Irorita call
our landlord so he could tell them what the problem was.  They said they would
be over today to get it unplugged, but didn't make it.  I put my rubbers on my
cowboy boots and we had to slip that pair of boots on to use the bathroom, what
a pain.  This evening I saw a large spider on our cupboard and killed it. 
After writing in my journal I wrote quite a lot in the stories I am trying to
write down for my family.  Mae came in and we started to talk, and then said
prayers, by the time I got back to the computer, it had locked up with an error
and I lost all my work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
woke with a start about 3 AM dreaming about a spider on me.  It took me a long
time to get back to sleep.  We got up at 5 AM and took some what of a bath in
the kitchen sink.  We left at 6:45 AM for the mission home.  Traffic was bad
put we made it about 10 AM.  We stopped by the bank and gave them a $500 check
to cash for us.  Their phone line was down so they had to wait to get it
cashed.  I said that we would return but if not they could give it to Elder or
Sister Clark for us.  We went over to the mission office, but everyone was at
District Meeting, so I worked on a letter to the branch Presidents.  When the
Clarks came they took Mae and I out to lunch at a Chinese Restaurant.  It was
very good.  We also enjoyed visiting with them.  I worked with Elder Pearson on
the computer programs for Home Teaching.  Mae went to the Dentist, who checked
her teeth and x-rayed them.  It looks like we will make several trips to her
before they get them cleared up.  It was after 5:30 PM before we left for home,
getting there about 8:30 PM, but we stopped at McDonalds to eat.  When we got
home we found that the landlord had been here and unclogged the bathroom drain,
so we were happy for that.  We checked the e-mail and had an e-mail from
Shellie and Jeani, so Mae was on the computer for a while with that.  I then
had to enter my journal.  It was after 10:30 PM before we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in, and then I had a District Meeting to attend.  President Mercado and
President Nuque were there and we had a very successful meeting.  I really felt
good about that.  This afternoon Mae and I attended the Munoz Branch 2
activity.  They had the use of a privet resort with swimming pools.  It was
well attended and we enjoyed being with them even though we couldn't go in
swimming with them.  This evening we worked on various projects until almost 10
PM, on the computer.  I don't know what we would have done had we not brought
this laptop computer with us.  We are always saying that we need two computers
so we can each be working on them at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Yesterday
while with the Clark's, we learned of a family that the father had been shot in
the leg, and because of the poverty of the family, couldn't afford to get
medical attention.  The bones have now deterate to the point that he cannot
walk or work.  The wife just gave birth to their second child and couldn't
afford to stay off work, so went back the day after giving birth.  As a result
of going back to work to soon she has complications and now can't work at all,
now there is no income for the family.  They live in a tent with no sides, and
one bed.  There is no electricity or plumbing or any of the essentials for a
home.  Boy! Your hart just hurts for these people.  I called Sister Clark this
morning and ash her to take some money from the check that I took to the Bank
yesterday for cash and get some food or what ever would best help this family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
went to Guimba this morning and attended the Guimba 2nd Branch.  I was really
impressed with the attendance.  The brother that gave the Priesthood lesson
really impressed also.  Because Mae and I had read the lesson, I was able to
have an idea of what he was talking about, but the Spirit that was with him and
the way he gave the lesson is what impressed me.  After Priesthood I commented
to Elder Wilkinson about the lesson and he informed me that this brother has
only been a member for three months.  He also told me a little of his history. 
He is married and has two daughters.  While he was taking the Missionary
lessons, his wife didn't want any thing to do with them.  Her brother had a job
lined up for her to go to Japan as an entertainer.  (In Japan an entertainer is
most of the time a prostitute.)  Any way she would make good money.  When her
husband objected the brother had a contract put out on his life.  He had to
flee to Manila and hide for a while, when he returned his wife had gone.  With
the Philippine laws on marriage he can not get a divorce nor ever remarry as
long as she is alive.  The trials these people have to face continually amaze
us.  We came back home for lunch, then returned to Munoz 2nd Branch for
Sacrament meeting there.  Mae had baked a cake and made baked chicken for
dinner.  The Elders had appointments until late so we invited them to stop in
before quitting for the night.  They came about 8:45 PM and we warmed up some
diner for them, then I drove them to there place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
went walking this morning, then went to the basketball court to watch the
Elders and the youth from Munoz 2nd Branch play ball, however the youth didn't
show up.  We came back home and decided to call Scott &amp; Mishelle.  It just
happened that all the Utah Family was gathered together, so we got to talk to
all of them.  I got a little concerned about the cost so that put a damper on
things.  We went shopping at San Jose and again being concerned about cost and
I could feel it with Mae.  We tried to take some pictures but our camera isn't
working.  We took a nap, and then worked on language.  We sent letters to our
family, Bishop Walker and President Saunders.  We were a while doing that, Mae
got on the computer and sent a reply to Scott, then started writing to Sandy
Peterson.  I said too much and again upset her.  We love each other and enjoy
being to gather, but some times with all the pressures things get tense.  We talked
quite a while this evening before going to bed to get feelings out.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
didn't get up in time to walk today.  Elder Jex and Elder Irorita came over at
8:30 AM and helped us with the Tagalog language.  David called about 9:25 AM
and we visited with them for over 1/2 hr. as his Mothers Day gift.  They just
returned from a trip to Las Vegas boating on Lake Mead.  They had a wonderful
time.  David said that his work is going great.  His group was mentioned in a
memo from the President of the Company because of their outstanding success. 
It was good to visit with them and to sing Happy Birthday to Shauna.  Mike sent
us an e-mail concerning the refinancing of our house.  We spent some time
trying to order Norton Anti-Virus on the inter-net, but didn't get through.  We
also got another message that was strange to us.  I e-mailed Mike back with
answers to his e-mail and questions about our computer.  Our drain in the
bathroom plugged up again today, so I spent a while getting that opened back
up.  We studied Tagalog through out the day and went visiting this evening.  We
only visited the Sarianto family, but had a nice visit there.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
read our scriptures, went walking and then came home for showers and breakfast. 
We did companion study, with most of our time going to set up our schedules. 
We got some studying in on Tagalog and it was time for lunch.  Marlyn prepared
a fish dish for us that was good but Mae felt a little squeamish about the fish
eyes still being in the fish.  We did get a nap in and worked more on Tagalog
before going out to visit.  We stopped at the Umibig's and set up an
appointment to visit with them on Tuesday.  We drove around the area trying to
find another family, but didn't find them so we will have to check with the
Elders as to where they live.  We worked on a presentation on &quot;The Purpose
of Life&quot;.  We checked our e-mail as we needed an answer from Mike.  There
was a note from Shellie with concern for a family we had told our family about. 
They said they would deposit $100.00 in our account to help out.  Mike did
reply to our e-mail questions.  There was an e-mail also from Sandy Peterson. 
Mike also sent 2 pictures of Mattie and a picture of all our family gathered at
Scott's on Sunday.   It was great to get the e-mails and the pictures.  We were
late getting to bed.  Boy, the time goes by fast!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            This
morning we got up, read the scriptures and then went walking.  We came back to
our house, showered, ate breakfast and then left for Guimba.  Traffic was heavy
so we were a few minutes late getting to the Guimba Chapel.  The Elders, the
Branch President and the 2nd Counselor were there, but they didn't have a key
to the parking lot gate.  When the 1st Counselor came he and the other
counselor went some place and when they returned they had the key.  Mae went
into the Primary room where there was an air conditioner while the rest of met
in the Branch Presidents office.  We had an opening prayer, and then I explained
what my ideas were as to the Branch records and how we could use them for Home
Teaching and to correct the CMIS records.  We had a very successful meeting and
finished shortly after noon.  We came back home and got something to eat and
them laid down for a nap.  We got up enthused to start correcting the computer
records, but found that we couldn't get the Micro Soft Access program to work. 
We finally tried to call Elder Pearson at the Mission Office, but he was out. 
After dinner this evening we watched the video containing &quot;Man's Search
for Happiness&quot;, &quot;The First Vision&quot; and &quot;The Restoration of
the Priesthood&quot; all three in Tagalog.  While doing that we cut each others
hair, and then showered before going to bed.  David called just as we were
going to bed.  He and Mike want to know what they can do to help the family
that we told them about that is in such need.  We will check with President
Brimhall and let them know.  It was good to hear from him, the call came
through so clear.  We sure have a neat family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
didn't go walking this morning as Mae wanted to bake cookies to take to
District meeting for the Elders.  Sister Mercado came with the dresses she had
made for Mae.  Mae was very pleased with them.  We enjoyed District meeting as
always for we are so impressed with the Elders.  Elder Jex had Mae &amp; I take
a few minutes at the first of the meeting and explain a little about Home
Teaching.  We came home for lunch and Marlyn had it ready for us.  It was very
good.  We took a nap and then did some studying in Tagalog and prepared a fun
exercise in the Tagalog language for our Grandchildren.  We did go out and
visit with the Nieto family this afternoon.  We had a good visit and invited
them to come over to our home on Saturday, May 31.  We came back home and I
backed most of our files on our computer up onto a CD.  We sent two short
e-mails to Scott and one to Mike.  While Mae did that I popped some corn to
have with us tomorrow while we travel to Angeles.  I made this journal entry and
we went to bed by 10 PM.</p>

got up at 4 AM to get off to Angeles this morning.  We left at 6 AM and got
there just a little after 8 AM.  We visited with the Clark's a few minutes then
got started working on the Home Teaching program with Elder Pearson.  President
and Sister Brimhall wanted Elder &amp; Sister Clark, and Mae &amp; I to go with
them to take some pictures under a huge Rain Tree.  It was big and should be
some great pictures.  Our camera isn't working so I hope they send us some
copies.  We got quite a lot done with Elder Pearson, and then went out to eat
with President &amp; Sister Brimhall, Elder &amp; Sister Clark at a Chinese
restaurant.  When we got back to the office, President Brimhall wanted to have
us explain what we are doing and how it can be used in the Mission.  He wants
us to type up a set of detailed instructions so that this system can be used by
other groups.  Mae and I worked on the files trying to be sure we understood
each phase of the system.  We did run into a couple of problems, but over all
it's working.  Elder Pearson had left before we were able to find these
questions, so we hope he can help us a little Monday when we come back.  We
left for Munoz shortly after 5 Pm.  We stopped at McDonalds in Tarlac on the way
home for dinner.  We also filled the car up with gas when we got to Munoz, so
we would be ready to go Monday morning.  </p>

did sleep in until 6 AM, the attended the Sacrament meeting for Munoz 1st
Branch.  As we came in President Gajonera came to me and ask if I could help
him.  I ask how?  He said that neither of his counselors had come and neither
had his speakers for Sacrament meeting.  I said I would talk.  I tried to put
my thoughts together during the Sacrament and prayed for help.  I ask Mae if
she would bear her Testimony.  She gave a short talk and testimony on prayer. 
I used the &quot;Jacobs Dream&quot; outline that we had prepared for my
subject.  It worked well, although I had to give it in English.  I brought Mae
home, I took a short nap and then I went back to a meeting with the District
Presidency.  That went well although I am not quite sure what President Mercado
wants me to do for the meeting on June 14th.  Elder and Sister Clark came for
dinner, also we invited Elder Irorita and Elder Jex also.  I had to miss it
because of the meeting.  I met Elder Clark at Priesthood meeting of Munoz 2nd
Branch.  We attended that set of Branch meetings.  Mae and I came home and I
wrote a letter to our family, getting it just about completed, when I tried to
bring up another file and lost my letter because I hadn't saved it.  I was late
rewriting it and didn't feel that I liked the 2nd one as well as the 1st.  Mae
stayed up longer doing some typing.</p>

got up at 4 AM so we could get away by 6 AM.  However, as I opened the gates,
Ed, our neighbor across the street, was out so I spoke to him.  He visited with
us for a few minutes.  We didn't have time but it isn't too often we get to
visit with him, so we took the time.  When we got to Tarlac, the Sony dealer
wasn't open yet.  It was 7:45 AM, so we went to McDonalds and got breakfast. 
We went back to the Sony dealer and they were just opening, when we had him
look at our camera, it worked perfect.  We got to the mission home at 9:30 AM
when we got to the mission home.  Elder Pearson was waiting for us for their
plans changed and he needed to take two of the Elders to get their drivers
license.  He worked with us for just a few minutes and got our problem solved. 
We got to Mae's dentist appointment at 10:05 AM.  She worked on Mae's teeth and
explained the situation to us, taking over two hours.  It had been raining all
day, but when we were inside of the Dentist office, it really started coming
down.  The water was running down the street until it was about 3 or 4 inches
deep and covered half the road.  By the time we left, it had let up and the
water was soon gone.  It has continued to rain lightly all day.  Elder and
Sister Clark invited us to eat dinner with them.  The food was wonderful and we
did enjoy visiting with them.  When you drive onto Clark Base you enter a
different world.  The traffic changes, the crowded dirty villages are left
behind and many of the beauties of the Philippine Islands are there.  We really
notice the change.  We came home and took a short nap, then got up and ate
supper.  I then wrote in my journal, before we got on the enter-net.  We got
letters of to our family, then Mae wrote a letter to Lois Falck (was Porter)
and a letter Elder &amp; Sister Staples.  The Staples are also serving here in
the Philippines, although in another mission, but we were in the Sr. M.T.C.
together.  We know Lois from the first time we lived in Arizona.  We hadn't
heard much of her, except that she had got a divorce.   We met her and her at
the Sr. M.T.C. also; she and her husband were working there.  Well it was after
10:30 PM before we got to bed.</p>

wasn't feeling the best so when I got up, I let her sleep.  I woke this morning
having a dream about my extended Family.  It didn't make much sense but it made
me Home Sick just the same.  I wrote Roy and Linda an e-mail.  Mae prepared
breakfast while I was still on the computer.  We started working on Guimba 2nd
Branch data file.  President Mercado called me asking me to get a message to
President Roselio A. Cabuyaban of the Guimba 1st Branch.  I called President
Nuque to see if he had a phone number that he could give me or that he might go
with me to Guimba or draw me a map.  He wasn't home when I called but he called
me back in a little while when he got home.  When he didn't have a phone number
or know where he lived, I mentioned driving out there.  He said, for my safety
don't drive out there.  There is too much water.  It has been raining every
since yesterday and very hard.  I called the Elders shortly after noon and they
said they thought they could deliver the messages.  When I hung up, president
Mercado called to see if I had been able to get the messages through.  I was
glad that I was able to report my actions.  After lunch I tried to arrange the
washing on lines so it would dry.  However with all this rain and the moister
in the air I am not to sure how successful that will be.  We took a nap, and
then went to San Jose shopping.  After returning home we prepared a
presentation to give to the Umipig.  After eating dinner we wet to their home. 
They were not home, so we returned home.  It has continued to rain through out
the day and doesn't sound like it is going to stop.  I guess we are really in

Home Depot, when I called it is an automated system and the first thing I need
is my account number, so it wouldn't let me have access nor let me talk to
anyone.  I e-mailed Mike back asking him to find a statement and e-mail me the

then had us leave our car at the Church parking lot.  There were two buses
full, each having 10 people plus the van that President Nuque hired which had 9
of us in it.  It was almost 4AM before we got away, getting to the Manila
Temple.  We ate our breakfast on the tables on the back patio, as the temple
doesn't have a cafeteria.  Mae and I went through a session, in Tagalog but we
used the ear phones in English.  We thought that they wanted to get away
shortly after 2PM, so we just waited, but the Nuque's were after 4:30PM with
the work they wanted to do.  I did get the opportunity to shake hands with
Sister and President Oaks.  They were coming in the Temple just as I was about
to leave.  We took several pictures and visited with several we know and some
we just met.  It was almost 5PM when we left for home.  It was after 9:30PM
when we got to Munoz.  The church parking lot was locked up and President Nuque
didn't have a key.  President Nuque climbed over the fence and got our key to
the house out of the car, then took us home.  Because I have to leave early in
the morning, I called the Elders, and then walked to the highway.  There, I
found a trike for hire and we picked up the Elders, and then went to the
church.  With their key, we were able to unlock the gate and get the car out. 
It was after mid-night when I got to bed and Mae stayed up later than that.  It
cost us P700 for the bus trip and P30 for the trike fare, so it was a little
expensive, plus a long day.  We were sure tired.</p>
