to the Governor of Egypt under Pharaoh, he was given the daughter of one of the
Egypt Priest to be his wife.  From this marriage came Ephrin and Manassa of
which the Priesthood blessings continue.  I asked how the Priesthood could come
through Egyptian linage if the Egyptians are of the seed of Cain?  Brother
Caldwell had been researching my question and found the answer in the Second

went into the Doctor this morning.  He said that he would deliver the baby
tomorrow.  Mae also took David into a new Doctor, Dr. Swanstrom.  Dr. Swanstrom
practices alternative medicine, although he has a medical degree from a medical
college in the U.S.  He then went to Europe where he received additional
training in Germany and France, before returning to Boston to practice.  Due to
health he moved his practice to Scottsdale Arizona for the drier climate. 
Sister Price is the one that recommended that Mae take David into see him.  She
had experienced a heart attack and the Doctors had put her in complete bed
rest.  We had been told that they gave her very little chance of ever getting
out of the bed, not alone ever taking care of her family again.  Last Sunday,
we saw her to meetings.  Mae talked with her and she told about her experience
with Dr. Swanstroum.  With the great concerns we are having with David’s health,
in desperation Mae called Sister Price.  She got Dr. Swamstroum’s phone number
and called him.  He didn’t have an opening for several days but he recognized
Mae desperation and told her that if she could come in during his lunch hour,
he would see David.  Mae was there and after testing David, He said that David
was low on Calcium, Iron and Sugar.  Without those essential elements the
oxygen going into his lungs could not be transferred to the body.  The chicken
breast that has developed on David is from the great effort he is using to get
air.  In reality David is suffocating.  He explained that David was low on
iron, potassium and sugar.   He gave Mae some supplemental to replenish those
needed items.   We had a nice F.H.E. and then we all went to bed early.</p>

children when they were born and I would be with Mae for this one.  She said
that they didn’t do that in this hospital so I would not be able to.  I asked
to speak with the Doctor.  He told the nurse to get me a gown and then he told
me that if I fainted he would just kick me off into a corner for he didn’t have
time to worry about me.  At 11:27AM Mae gave birth to a 8lb 4oz baby boy.  I
stayed with Mae until 2 PM.  I then went to work for 2 hours.  After dinner

worked until 11AM and then took the rest of the day off.  I went to the hospital
to see Mae and our baby.  Mae’s room has been extra hot so she didn’t sleep
very well.  She had complained to the nurse but nothing had been done.  I got a
chair and felt the incoming air and it was hot.  I took a piece of cardboard
and stuck in the vent to at least stop hot air from coming in.  I brought the
children up to see Mae and the Baby about 7PM.  I sure love that gal.   </p>

Leaders when they come to Oral Evaluation is, have you visited with at least

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
have been working on a new Subdivision, east of Greenfield and North of Brown. 
I believe that I started this job shortly after finishing the Sun City
project.  Ken Osburn was the superintendent on this job.  I had finished the
interior finishing of 4 or 5 homes in this subdivision and Ken was very pleased
with my work.  I am not sure just when Ken came to me but I will add this
detail here.  Ken Osburn came to me with a concern about the last home I had
finished for him.  He had sold the home to a couple, without children, and they
wanted several changes to the home.  First they wanted the third bedroom
converted into an office.  In the office they wanted the cloth closet removed
and a book case built in place of the closet.  They then wanted an “Oak U shaped
desk” built in and stained a light oak.  From the bottom of the U they wanted a
Ecology Box designed wall, constructed out of rough sawn 4” X 6”s, stained a
dark oak, from the desk top to the ceiling.   Next they wanted to change the
Family Room by adding high gloss black painted chair rail around the walls. 
They wanted to cover the lower half of the wall with a Bright Red wall text. 
The upper wall and ceiling painted in a bright white.  The floor in the Family
room carpeted with a black and white checker board design.  The carpeting in
the living room was to be shag white and the covering in the rest of the home
was to be in a blond carpet.  Although I didn’t agree with the changes it was
ok with me to do the work.  I did make one suggestion that Ken agreed with me
and that was that I just remove the closet doors, storing them in the back of
the closet and then building shelving that would fit inside the door opening. 
This way, if someone in a future date wanted to change the room back into a
bedroom we would be able to just remove the shelving and reinstall the doors. 
Ken agreed with that idea.  I came home from work today with quite a bad head
cold.  We held Family Home Evening and then I went to bed.</p>

to see the lights.  We got suckered into a dart game and ended up losing about
$14.  For our budget that was quite a lot of money.  We came out of that “trap”

the home.  I personally felt horrified with the outcome.  A short time after
the finishing the home, Ken came to me and told me I needed to completely redo
the home.  Just before finalizing the sale the couple dissolved their marriage
with a divorce!  Ken said the there was no way they could resale the home as it
now stood.  Oh well, I did that job by the hour when I remodeled it and I would
again redo it by the hour. There was no school today in honor of Presidents Day

morning the carpeting that I bought from Ken Osburn was installed in our
bedroom and master bath.  Just to explain about the carpeting, I have been
finishing some homes for Osburn Construction Company.  The one home, after
completing the normal finishing, Ken came to me and said that the buyer wanted
some changes.  He of course paid me for my time.  He had me make some very
drastic changes.  The one bedroom was changed to an office with a built in desk
and a built in book case.  Ken had originally told me to remove the closet and
build the book case in its place.  I had suggested that I just remove the
by-fold doors and build the book case so that it would fit inside the closet. 
He had accepted that idea.  The desk was built into an U-shape, made out of
birch, with an decorative wall shelving made out of rough sawn 4” X 6” pine
beams.  I finished the changes, but before the painter came back to stain and
finish the shelving and desk, the wall-paper hangers came in and hung
wall-paper.  They used the desk for a gluing table so when the stain was
applied the stain would not take where the glue had been spilled.  I had to
come back and spent several hours sanding the desk.  The only thing that I can
say about the wall paper throughout the house is that it looked horrible, not
in the hanging but in the customers picking.  The carpeting was just as
horrible.  The front room, entrance way, hallway, master bedroom and master
bathroom was I very light blond in color.  When I saw the house I just gasped. 
Ken said that it was the customer’s choice.  Well two weeks later Ken came to
me and Said that he needed me to go back and remove the desk and remove the
shelving so that it was back to the original finish.  The customers had got a
divorce and didn’t want the home now.  He said that he couldn’t sell the home
the way it was had what to completely restore and remove all the carpeting.  I
said that the carpeting in the bedroom would be ok if used in a master bedroom
only.  Ken made me a very good deal if I would take some of it.  That is where
we got the carpeting for our house.</p>

Leon.  As a family we picked that name as we drove to the church.  After
meeting Dad Jensen said that that Leon was his middle name and his son’s first
name.  Then a member of our Ward came up and said that he must be the God
Father as that was his first name.  It was purely coincidental in the choosing
of the name Leon.  We held Family Home Evening this evening so that Dad Porter

door hardware that I had gone to get last Friday but they were out of.  We then
came back home and got Mae.  From there we went up town where we bought
everyone ice cream for a treat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked 9 hours at the Mesa Genealogy Library installing a door on the east side
of the building.  This is the job that I had bid on earlier but they felt that
my bid was too high.  I think they found out that they couldn’t get any one
else that would do it for less than I had quoted them.  The door was 4’ wide X
8’ high X 1 ¾” thick.  The frame was made of 2” X 12” and together the door and
frame weighed about 180 lb.  It was really quite a lot of work for me to
install by myself.  I had told the Director of the Center that he needed to
have a painter lined  up to paint the door before the sun came up the next day,
as if that Arizona Sun would shine on that door without it being painted, it
would warp the veneer finish of the door.  He assured me that he would.  When I
got home this afternoon we took our family and went over to the Fraizer’s.  We
visited with them for a few minutes but also got some vegetables from their
garden.  This evening Mae and I attended the High Priest social.  It was a very
enjoyable evening.</p>

meeting I was released as Executive Secretary.  Jim Fraizer was sustained as
Executive Secretary.  Ron Shumway called me this afternoon and asked if I could
come over to his place later this evening.  After getting the children to bed
this evening, Mae and I went over to Ron and Audrey.  I believe that Larry had
informed me that Ron had resigned from Hugh Aircraft to accept a job as the
manager of the Data Processing Department for Tanner Brothers Construction
Company, is the largest highway construction company in Arizona.  When we got
to Ron’s he told me that he might have an opening in the Data Processing
department at if I would be interested.  Of course I told Ron that I was very
interested.</p>

finish a job for the Genealogy Library.  When I was finished with that I would
be over.  When I got to the Library the Supervisor told me that he got quite a
scare when the painter came Saturday evening to paint the door I had installed. 
He said that when the painter looked at the job he said “Who in Hell hung that
door?”  He told the painter, “Ken Browning, why?” to witch his painter replied
“I haven’t seen anyone hang a door that firm for a long time.  He didn’t want
that door to ever come out, did he?”  I was pleased with that comment.  I
finished installing the door hardware and was paid for the job.  I came home and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                At
that conference Oscar McConkie, a younger brother to Bruce R. McConkie, was the
visiting authority and main speaker.  Prior to him speaking, he was introduced
by our Stake President.  Our stake president said:  “You might recognize that
Oscar McConkie is a brother to Bruce R. McConkie, who is a member of the quorum
of the 12 apostles.  In the ward which Oscar McConkie &amp; his family lived,
he had been called to serve as Elders Quorum President.  The ward was then
divided and his first counselor was called to be bishop of the one ward and his
second counselor was called to be bishop of the second ward and Oscar McConkie
was retained as President of the Elder’s Quorum.  Later, the ward was divided
again and again both of his counselors were called to serve as bishops and
again Oscar McConkie was retained as the Elder’s Quorum President.  A short
time later, his stake president called him in for a personal interview at which
time the stake president thoroughly interviewed him as to his personal
worthiness.  As the interview concluded, the stake president opened his drawer
and pulled out a letter signed by the president of the quorum of the twelve at
which he had been directed that under no circumstances should Oscar McConkie be
advanced to be a high priest. A short time later, Oscar McConkie was called to
the First Quorum of the Seventies.  Had he been ordained a high priest, he
could have never been called to this position.  And so, at this time, Oscar
McConkie was in the presidency of the first quorum of the seventies.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                At
the conclusion of the introduction our Stake President asked Oscar McConkie, if
he felt that it would be appropriate, that he might relate to us the story of
his father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
will attempt to retell that story, to the best of my ability, as I remember
after more than 38 years.  Therefore, this story, without deeper research, can
only be taken for just that - a story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Father
McConkie, as referred to by Oscar, had been called to serve as a bishop while
quite a young man with a young family. While serving as Bishop for over 30
years, Mother McConkie passed away.  All of their children were by this time
married and raising families of their own.  Quite regularly Father McConkie
would still call the family together for a Family Home Evening, to which all
would respond.  On one occasion, as the family gathered, father McConkie
reminded the family that he had served for over 30 years in his calling and
with the passing of his sweet wife, he had been released as Bishop.  He told
them that he was now very lonely as he missed this dear companion and felt that
he had completed his calling here on earth.  He, therefore, asked the family to
join him in prayers asking that Heavenly Father might release him from this
earth and join his sweetheart on the other side.  Oscar said that as a family
they were a little reluctant but said there was no disagreeing with Father
McConkie, and so they all joined in their prayers for this desire.  A couple of
weeks later, Father McConkie, again called for a Family Home Evening, at which
time he recalled his previous request.  He said that he had a dream and was
visited by a massager that told him that he was bothering the Father with his
request to pass on.  He was told that in the first place, he had not fulfilled
the assignment he had been given to fulfill while here on earth.  The messenger
continued telling him that he should have never have been called as Bishop,
except the person who was to be called as bishop was not living worthy of the
calling and so it became necessary to give the calling to him.  The messenger
then told him to look, and as he looked, he saw a large group of spirits that
were waiting for their Temple work to be done for them.  The messenger then
said, “This was your assignment.  Now quit pestering The Father and do what you
were assigned to do.”  So Father McConkie told his family to discontinue
praying for him to go home.  In a couple of weeks, Father McConkie again called
his family back together.  He explained that he had spent every day at the
Genealogy Library but did not know what to do.  Father McConkie therefore asked
his family to pray for help to be given to him that he could accomplish his
assignment.  After some time had passed, Father McConkie again called his
family to meet together.  He said that he just wanted to report as to what
progress he was making with his assignment.  He reported that the following
week, after he had asked for their help, that as he watched others searching
thru the micro-film on the readers, he decided to give it a try and as he
reeled through a film he noticed that there was a little green light that moved
as he advanced the film.  He watched it until it stopped..  As he had passed
the light, he paused and then reversed the film, and would go until he again
found the green light moving along with the names.  Reversing again the light
would move with the film and then suddenly stop again.  Reversing, he again
moved until he found the light.  This time he looked closely at the record
where the light had stopped; and he realized that that record was a record on
one of his family’s ancestors.  He would then write all the information down
and then again start advancing the film and the light would also advance.  Each
time the green light stopped, he again repeated the process.  He told his
family that following this process, by the end of the day he had found several
of these records of those that were in the group he had been shown.  Following
this procedure each day he had been able to turn in the records for several
hundred names for the Temple work to be done.  Oscar McConkie then told us that
Father McConkie continued this routine for quite a long period of time before
he again called the family for another meeting.  Father McConkie then reported
that he had received another visit from the same messenger.  This time the
messenger told him that he had completed the work that he had been assigned and
that if he would like to have his original request that it would be ok and his
work would be complete.  Before making that decision he was to look; as he did
he saw another group much more numerous than the first.  The messenger then
told him to look and he saw another man and was told that this group was his
assignment.  The messenger said to him that he could see that this person would
not live long enough to complete his assignment.  The messenger told Father
McConkie that should he want to, he could help him with his assignment.  Oscar
McConkie concluded the story by telling us that Father McConkie was still going
to the library each day when it was open he still continues to following the
little green light..</p>

8:30AM for Priesthood meeting and at 10AM I went to a Missionary Training class
at the Stake Center.  I returned to the Chapel in time to be with my family for
Sacrament meeting, when we got home Mae had a very nice dinner waiting.  This
evening Mom and Dad Jensen came over to visit.  I am sure that after the
children went to bed, Mom, Dad, Mae and I set at the kitchen table and played
Rook, had hot Postum and Ginger Snap cookies.  That was a standard when Mom and
Dad came over.</p>

asked what the position would be that they wanted me to fill.  He told me that
it would be the Supervisor of the 3<sup>rd</sup> shift.  I told him that I
really wasn’t very interested in working mid-night shift.  He told me that they
only wanted me there until I could train someone to fill that position and then
I would go into the programming staff.  He said that something had come up and
they were now in immediate need of someone that know the work and could step
right into that spot with very little training.  He expected that I would only
be on that shift for a year or two at the longest.  We talked about the housing
market, which right now is not good in Arizona.  To that he assured me that if
I would put our house on the market and made the move in two weeks, then if had
problems selling the house, the bank would either help me out with payments or
would take over the house and they would sell it.  I asked about the wage and
when he told me what they were offering, I told him that I couldn’t accept that
low of wage.  He said that the cost of living was higher in Arizona than in
Utah, to which I told him that for our family it would not be that much
cheaper.  He raised the offering amount some.  I asked about moving expenses,
to which he asked me to get three bids and send them to him.  The Bank would
pay the lowest bid.  I asked about the time frame that they wanted me to be
there and he said that he know that I would at least require two weeks and that
would be ok.  I ended the conversation by telling him that I would like the
weekend to make my decision.  I have very mixed feeling about this decision.  I
would like to move back to Utah, yet I would like to finish this Mission Call. 
My main concern is that we do the will of our Father in Heaven.</p>

bitter feelings towards each other.  It took me a long time before I could even
hear a commercial on the radio about the bank that I didn’t get a sick
feeling.  In talking with Dad Jensen about forgiveness, he asked me if I felt
that if I were to meet John on the street, if I thought I could at least shake
his hand and be friendly, to which I said I thought I could.  I have never had
that opportunity but I still think I could.  I can say this much, it sure made
some major changes in our life.</p>

entry indicates that we ran out of gas in the moving van just before we got to
Flagstaff, Arizona.  North of Flagstaff, as we went through the intersection to
Tuba City,  I saw two Missionaries get out of the back of a pickup and wave to
the driver.  It was too late for me to stop the van but I thought that Mae
might see them and stop.  When she didn’t I pulled over and stopped and of
course Mae stopped behind me.  I told her that there were two Missionaries
trying to catch a ride, and she should go back for them.  She wasn’t sure so I
had her stay with the truck and Mike and David who were ridding with me and I
drove back and offered then a ride.  We drove up to the truck and I had them
ride in the truck with me and Mae and the children road in the car.  I took
them as far as the Gap turn off and explained that because of the moving van we
were going by way of Page.  They said that they wanted to go by the way of
Jacob Lake, as they had a contact there.  I stopped and let them out.  Mike and
David again got in the truck with me and we continued on.  We did stop at dam
when we got to Page for a few minutes before continuing on.  When we got to
Kanab, I honked at the same two Missionaries that I had given a ride.  They had
told me that they traveled by hitch hiking all the time.  They found it interesting
that they would leave their apartment in Tuba City, seeing a hitch hiker
already trying to catch a ride, so they walk on down the road a block, catch a
ride and travel to several locations, as much as 300 miles before returning
home in the evening and still see the same person in the same spot, still
waiting for a ride.  We got to Kanab about 8:30PM so we stayed the night in a
motel.</p>

weren’t very worried about time this morning so took our time getting away.  As
you leave Kanab, there is a cave that is advertised so we stopped to see it. 
It is a Tourist Trap, but we didn’t have any money to spend so we soon left. 
We stopped a couple of times along the way just to get out and stretch our
legs, but still arrived at Sunset by 8PM.  We just left the truck in the
driveway and went to Mom and Dad Jensen’s in Layton, where we stayed the night
with them.</p>

we got up and had breakfast we went over to the home in Sunset to unload the
moving van.  This home was the home that belonged to Mae’s parents.  When we
had made the decision to move to Utah, Mae called and told her parents.  They
said that the family that had been renting the house were about to move and
asked if we would be interested in renting it from them.  Mae was especially
excited to move back to the home she had been raised in.  Many of our family
came to help us move in.  There was Irven, Bob, Grant, Kathy, Bryce, Georgia
and Rick as well as Mom and Dad Porter.  Deanna came and got all the children to
tended them for us.  With all that help we soon had the truck emptied and most
things put away.  Mae wasn’t feeling very well this afternoon so I had Mom
Porter take her to their home.  Even though there will be many things for Mae
to rearrange and put in different locations, we had everything ready so that we
could sleep as a family in the home tonight.</p>

We didn’t have any luck.  I got home from fishing and went to bed about 10AM. 
Irven and Sandy came over as well as Bob to talk to me about a business
opportunity.  Irven had seen some property west of Ridge Road in Syracuse for
sale at quite a low price.  I brought up a couple of concerns.  First: it is in
a swampy area almost Lake level, with no place for drainage.  Second: there is
no utility west of Ridge Road in that area.  Irven felt that in time utilities
will probably be brought in.  I guess I squashed the deal with my concerns. 
(Even today in 2016, Irven still brings up that opportunity that we passed up. 
If my memory is correct of the peace of property he was talking about, it is
still only a piece of property where a few horses are pastured, even though
some of the property around that are is now in housing.  Maybe someday, someone
will find a way to drain the area and we might find that we missed out on a
great deal!)  Mom and Dad Jensen bought a home in Layton today.  While we were
in Arizona they came down there a couple of winters.  They would stay with
another couple from Idaho Falls that had a winter home in Mesa.  I guess that
with us being down there they had got talking about moving down.  One day while
working at the Idaho Falls temple Dad had mentioned to another worker that he was
thinking about the move and would probably sell their home there in I.F.  The
next day the fellow ask Dad what he would be asking for the home.  Dad hadn’t
put much thought into it and quickly figured what the home had cost him to
build, not considering the inflation.  He just came up with a rough figure. 
The next day the man said that he would like to buy it and would give him what
he had said.  Well, Dad wouldn’t back down or refigure once he had given a
price so he sold the house.  They then found out that we were moving back to
Utah.  With us moving, they really didn’t want to be in Arizona alone.  They
stopped in Layton and looked at a home and so bought it.  Over all it worked
out fairly well for them in the long run but there is quite a story about that.</p>

checked about renting a small trailer.  The price was very reasonable,

questioned the attendant, telling him that I was going to take it clear to
Idaho and back.  He said he didn’t care where I took the trailer but the charge

Layton. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                What
happened is that Mom and Dad got thinking about the cold weather in Idaho.  We
were living in Arizona and while I worked for the air line, they enjoyed flying
down to the warm Arizona weather.  When I left the air line it was a long trip
to drive down.  They came down to Arizona a couple of winters and stayed with
some of their friends that lived in Mesa during the winter and in Idaho Falls
during the summer.  They had talked about selling their home in I.F. and buying
a nice trailer home in Mesa.  One day while at the Idaho Falls Temple, where
both of them were working as Ordinance Workers, Dad Jensen was visiting with
another Brother and expressed their thought about selling their home.  The
Brother asked Dad what he would ask for his home.  Dad, without really thinking
about the inflation facture, gave a figure, really way below market value.  The
next day the Brother came back and told Dad that he would give him cash for the
house.  Well, Dad wouldn’t go back on his word so he sold their home to this
couple. They called a trailer company in Mesa and made an offer on a home and
put a down payment on it.  Almost the next day after the closing of the home in
I.F. and the agreement to purchase the mobile home, I called to tell them that
we were moving back to Utah.  When I called them, they were ready to get in
their car to come to Arizona.  As Mom and Dad drove south, they decided that
they really didn’t want to move to Arizona, if none of their family weren’t
going to be living there.  As they were driving they discussed their options.
When they got to Layton they stopped at a Real Estate office to see what was
available in the area.  I think they were only shown a couple of homes when
they decided on the one we moved their things into.</p>

10:30AM. They stayed long enough for me to get home so they could say good bye
before they left.  Before I laid down to sleep Mae told me that she had found a
dog.  I questioned if it met all my specifications.  She said that it did.  She
said that the lady that did her hair had just the dog.  Mae took Mike into the
Dr. for a physical examination before he starts school.  I went into a meeting
at work from 4 to 8PM.  In that meeting I brought up the problem that was
occurring with my employees.  As I saw it the problem, it mainly stemmed over
two employs that had not received a raise in pay, for over a year.   I was then
told that these two had found that if they were a little short of money before
payday, they could cash a check, make a tear in the routing number, the check
would then reject as it went through the check reader.  Because they worked as
“batch balancers” they would see their check come through the bank.  They then
would simply put the check into another Bank’s work, and the check would take another
two or three days before returning to the bank for clearance.  One of the banks
recognized the seam and reported it back to our bank.  The two were called in
and confessed their action but didn’t think it was wrong.  They could have been
fired over it but it had been decided to let it go with a warning.   This
incident took place almost a year before I returned to work for the bank. 
Management also decided that they would also forgo any raises.  I expressed my
feelings that they were two of my best workers.  I felt that it was wrong to
continue to punish them by withholding raises and if they could not make amends
then they should be terminated.  After returning from the meeting, I had to go
back to work by 11:30PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
stained and put the 1<sup>st</sup> coat of varnish on the cabinets I am
building for the bank.  We had the kids shuck the corn that we picked on
Saturday.  The whole family helped as we cut the corn from the cob, washed it,
blanched it in hot water and then cooled it down in ice water.  We then bagged
the corn in plastic bags and put it into the freezer.  We sure enjoy the corn
put up that way and it is so much cheaper than purchasing it from the store. 
After finishing up that job, we went down to Mom and Dad Porter’s where we held
Family Home Evening.  I am sure that Mom had a nice dinner ready when we got
there.</p>

did not go well last night and so I was late getting home this morning.  I woke
up at 2:45PM and was still upset about work.  Our Ward asked everyone to set
today aside for a Temple Day.  Therefore, this afternoon we went to the Ogden
Temple with other members of the Ward and went through an Endowment Session. 
Following the session everyone went to Sister Miskin’s back yard for a party

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in'>(From my entrance on Tuesday, August 20<sup>th</sup>, I believe I can and
should add some insight to this entry, as to some of the reasons why work
didn’t go well!)  When I got to work last Thursday evening, the Senior
Programmer met me and said, “I heard that you were going to come into the Programming
Staff and if so when?”  I told him that I was not sure, but that is what John
Howard had told me when he hired me.  He said that he had never heard anything
about that move until he was told a rumor this morning.   This conversation
caused me to reflect on this, through the night.  Sometime ago I had met with
John, asking him about the promise to move me into the programming staff.  He
had told me that we needed to first train someone to take my place.  I should,
therefore, select someone to train.  I suggested Bobby (don’t recall his last
name) to which John agreed, pending Bobby’s willingness.  I met privately with
Bobby and asked if he would be in favor of that position and he had indicated
that he would.  For some time I have been training Bobby and I believed that he
was now well qualified to take my position.  In recent meetings with John, I
have told him that I felt that Bobby was now qualified to take over the Night
Shift Supervisor position.  However, nothing has ever happened.  Thinking of these
past events, I determined to again confront John, but John is now on a two week
vacation and will still be gone for another week.)</p>

Mae was returning to our camp site, she saw that the gate to Camp Beaver was
open so she drove into the camp to show the children where she went camping
with the Girls Camp when we lived in Ogden.  Well, when she went to leave the

been at this time as we were talking about marriage, and Terry was dating some
very pretty nice girls, that he said that he would not get married before he
was 24 years old.  It ended up in a bet for a steak dinner that he wouldn’t
wait that long.  As it ended up I had to pay that bet.  I received a call
asking me to meet with our Stake President this evening.  I went over to the Stake
Center and met with President Peterson of the Stake Presidency.  He extended a

Utah, Bob and Pauline Hien stopped at our place and asked us to go for a ride
with them.  Bob drove up to Peterson, then turned west and at a dirt road drove
about 1 ½ miles south, up the cannon to this open meadow, with a small pond fed
by a spring.  Bob stopped the car and asked me what I thought.  Questionably, I
ask what he meant.   Bob said that he had a chance to buy this area.  I guess I
discouraged him for as I couldn’t see much he could do with it, being 1 ½ miles
of paved roads with no utilities to the property.  I guess that shortly after
that Uncle Dale purchased this property and put a cabin on it.  I have always
wondered if I was wrong in my advice to Bob.)   I took Mike and David out away

Georgia and Kim.  After dinner, Hal and I started a game of chess.  I indicate
in my Diary that I won.  To add a little more detail, Hal made a bad mistake
and I took advantage of it and put him in serious trouble, with his next move I
would have his king in check mate.  About that time Mae came in and said that I
needed to get ready to attend Sacrament meeting.  Hal jumped on that and said
that we would just call the game a draw.  I responded that he needed to make
his move first and that I still had time to get ready for Church.  He kept
stalling until Mae came and said that we needed to leave.  I told her to take
the children and go.  I would catch the next Wards meeting.  Hal of course
encouraged me to attend the meeting.  I refused to call the game a draw so he
could stall as long as he wanted but ether he made his move or concede the
game.  Hal finally tipped his king over and conceded.  I quickly changed my
clothes and made it to Sacrament meeting.  Following Sacrament meeting Deanna
came over to our place.  We ate super and then played some Rook.  Larry called
me to let me know that he had two people, the Allen’s and the Elis’s, that are
interested in buying our home.  The problem being, that both of them want it
for nothing.  Maybe if I could have seen the future, we would have been better off
just getting out of the house.  However I turned the offer down.</p>

and I went with Mom and Dad Porter to Joal Holbrook’s Wedding Reception.  At
the Reception someone was playing the organ to provide background music.  When
I got investigating, I found it was Ralf Provost.  We had known Ralf and Belva
Provost in the Sunset 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward when we were teenagers and were close
to them after we got married.  During all that time I did not know he could
even play the organ.  Here he was playing, without even music to read and while
others were talking to him.  We know his daughter, Robin, played the piano but
had never known him to play.  He said that he had played since a teenager.  His
mother had used some egg money to give him one lesson but when his father found
out about it he really balled her out for wasting the money on something
worthless.  Ralf therefore taught himself to play.  He had never told anyone
else until as Stake Executive Secretary, one morning at a Stake meeting the
Stake President asked Ralf if he could find someone to play the opening song. 
Not seeing anyone at the meeting that could play, Ralf said to the Stake
President, I guess I could.  The Stake President almost laughed.  He played for
the meeting and has been playing in public every since.</p>

that I could replace them.  We figured it would be cheaper to install new doors

materials to build new kitchen cabinet.  This evening Mae and I attended the

she had left her purse at the school.  To make it worse, all the cash from my

and no signs posted so we drove up it to the foot hills.  We then got out and
hiked up a canon, until we got to a fence that was posted.  We then turned south
and walked until we came to the next draw and then hiked back down the
mountain.  When we got almost to the bottom of the draw, Irven saw a doe and
shot at it.  Soon a group of men came ridding up on horses.  They demanded to
know what we were doing trespassing on privet property.  I told the one that
seemed to be the leader of the group that we had not crossed any property that
was posted.  He called me a liar and demanded that we retrace our path and go
back over the mountain in which we had come.  He said that we hadn’t crossed the
fence at the top of the draw we came down, as it was posted.  I told him that
we had came up a draw to the north.  Until we came to a fence that was posted
and so we turned south.  We follow along that the fence then came down the next
draw we came to.  He again called me a liar and indicated that he was going to
force us, with his horses’ and rifles and to make us go back to the top of the
draw and over that fence.  I know that going over that fence would put us
completely out of the area we had left the car.  I wasn’t sure about his bluff
but I was too tired to retrace our path and I refused.  At that point a younger
person road up to the older man and said that the direction I had indicated we
had come would not have been posted.  He then back down and told us that we
could continue to our car and then to get off his property.   We did that and
went on home, very tired, getting home about 9:30PM.   I got a little sleep

Following Sunday School the three of us went visiting some of the Brethren and
finished our Oral Evaluation on Home Teaching for last month.  After getting
back home from Sacrament meeting I helped Mae with a few items and then as a

fell asleep.  Mae let me sleep there until I got up at 10:30PM and got ready to

individual framing that would go between the already existing 4 X 4 posts.  I
tried to explain that the siding would not alien with the existing post
settings.  He got a little upset with me and went into the house.  Mom came out

looked at the wall, then made the comment that he was sure glad that I hadn’t
listened to him because he could now see my reasoning in the design. </p>

Margie Nelson’s Sister and Brother-in-law, Lois and Jerry Ellsworth.  Of course
Mae has known Lois through Margie but we have become closer acquaintances with
them being in the Square Dance Club.  Jerry was elected president of the Double
J club and it was then that invited us back into the club, when we moved to
Sunset.  Jerry works for Sunset City and so whenever he is in our area with the
snow plow, he will swing in and clear out the heavy snow from my driveway. 
This has really helped as we live on the State Highway and when the State plows
clean the highway it really packs our entranceway.  He did this until someone
reported it and before the winter was over he had to stop helping me out.  I
will also add this experience in.  When we first moved into the home in Sunset,
I decided to raise the driveway so that it would not be so steep, plus I wanted
to pour concrete for the driveway.  I had 2 or 3 dump truck loads of fill
delivered and was starting to spread it out by hand with a shovel, when I had
the time.  One morning when I got home from work, the fill was all leveled out
and packed down.  I never found out who did it but I am sure that it was Jerry
using the large front loader or the road grader of the city.  With that it
would have only taking him a few minutes but it saved me many, many hours with
the shovel.)</p>

Presidency.  They became close friends and we also became friends with their
family.  Sandy attended a Ward Young Women’s slumber party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Work
must have gone pretty well last night and when I got home I slept for a little
while.  This afternoon Mae and I took Scott with us and drove up to Pocatello,
Idaho to Rich and Lois’s home, so we can attend Phillip and Lisa’s wedding
reception.  Irven and Sandy were also there when we got there.  Having a little
time before the reception, Irven and I took a couple of Rich’s snowmobiles and
went for a ride.  This evening we attended the reception.  We then went to
Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice’s home where they let us stay the night.  From
what I can make out in my Diary, Irven and Sandy must have also stayed the
night with Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice.  Today was Mae’s Birthday but we
didn’t do much celebrating for her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning Uncle Irven, Irven and I attended Priesthood meeting.  When we returned
from meeting, Aunt Bernice prepared breakfast for us.  Mae woke up this morning
with a bad headache.  We ate breakfast and visited.  It also gave s a little
time to visit with Lesley.  Rich and Lois invited us out to their place for
dinner.  After dinner we left about 2pm for home.  Mae was sick with the flu
and so she slept most of the way home.  After getting home Mae just went to
bed, while I took all the children and went down to a family party at Mom and
Dad Porters.</p>

tended the children, while I put weather stripping and new thresholds on the
exterior doors.  I took the children to a show this evening.  Mae stayed home
in bed.  I went into work at 11:30pm as normal.</p>

went fairly well last night although, one person called in and quite without
any notice.  Another person got sick at work and had to go home early. When I
got home from work, Mae was still not feeling well but was up with the
children.  When I woke up this afternoon I wasn’t feeling very well.  Although
tonight is New Year’s Eve, we just stayed home and went to bed.</p>
