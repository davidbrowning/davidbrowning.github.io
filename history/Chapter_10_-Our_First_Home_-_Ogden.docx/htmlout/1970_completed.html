<p class=MsoNormal>1970       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This is the first entry that I made in a
Diary.  Dad Browning has kept a diary as long as I can remember.  After Dad’s
death I found a brief case that had belonged to him in our belongings.  He had
brought it to our home a few months prior to his death, when he and Mom had a
quarrel and Mom had ordered him to leave the house.  Not knowing just where to
go, Dad called Bob and asked him to call me to see if he could come and stay a
while with us.  I of course said he could, so Bob brought him over to our
house.  He only had a few things with him and this briefcase was one of them. 
Dad stayed about a week with us and then called Rich to see if he could go
there and give Rich a hand around his home.  I took Dad to the Gray Hound bus
station and he went up to Rich’s.  He stayed there for about a month when he
called Mom and asked if he could come back home.  She softened and Dad came
back home to Sunset.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Dad died March 1967 and as best that I can
remember it wasn’t until we moved to Clearfield in the spring of 1970 that we
came across the briefcase that he had left while staying with us.  Inside the
briefcase was a picture of my Grandfather and Grandmother Browning and we
believe Dad’s brother, Steven Elias.  (Again we only think) that they are in
their grocery store on 27<sup>th</sup> street in Ogden.  There was one Five
Year Diary that he was using up to the time of his death, and it had recorded 4
years and the starting of 1967 and a new unused Diary that I guess was to start
1968.  There was also a few letters from some of Dad’s children from his first
marriage.  I believe that I have returned those letters to the writers. 
Anyway, while looking at the items in the briefcase I decided that I should use
the blank diary and start keeping it.  This first year I only did a hit and
miss keeping it but that is how I started keeping a daily diary.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After completing this first Five Year Diary
and starting on a second Diary, I had the opportunity of attend a Stake
Leadership meeting in which Spencer W. President Kimble of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostle’s, was the visiting Authority.  In his address, he counseled
each of us to keep a daily journal.  I felt quite pleased with the thought that
I had started and kept “Almost a full Five Year Diary and started another”,
until he added, “Brethren, when I tell you to keep a Daily Journal, I do not
mean a Five Year Diary.  There isn’t enough room in a Five Year Diary for you
to enter what takes place in a day, not alone any feelings.”  He then added “a
Five Year Diary isn’t worth the paper it is written on.”  That really deflated
my feelings.  Since that time I have kept my Journal Entries in a Journal or a
spiral note book and then when we were called on a mission in 2002, I have kept
the entries on a computer, printing each month’s entry off and keeping that
copy in a binder.  This year, 2014, I decided to transcribe the data from my
first original Diary.  I have taken the option to correct, add to and enlarge
upon many of the entries.  I have realized that what President Kimball said about
the Five Year Diary was totally correct.  I have realized that for anyone
except myself, the Diary would be of very little value from those entries. 
Even I find that I do not remember what some of the entries meant.  The one thing
it does for me often is to remind me and then my memory kicks in and I can fill
in some of the days with more informative and interesting details.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(I had no information recorded except this incident which
took place during the Summer of 1970.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was driving home from work one afternoon,
in my pickup when I saw a car, with a lady in it, off to the side of the
Freeway, maybe a couple of blocks from the Clearfield exit #650N.  I pulled
over and walked back, to see what the matter was.  The lady said that she was
on her way to pick up her husband from work.  She know that the car was low on gasoline
but had hoped that there was enough to get to her husband and then to a service
station.  But she didn’t and now she had no way to let her husband know that
she wouldn’t be there to pick him up.  I didn’t have anything with me to tow
her car with but I got a nail can out of my tool box.  These cans were empty,
one gallon cans that I had cut the top out and used to keep various sizes of
small nails in.  I had one can that only had a few nail still in it so I emptied
the out in the weeds off the roadway.  Using a siphon hose that I carried
behind my seat, and drew out a little gas from my gas tank, I washed the can
clean.  I then siphoned out a couple of cans of gas, dumping them into her gas
tank.  I saved a little gas in the 2<sup>nd</sup> can, opened up the car hood
and poured the remainder of the gas into the carburetor.  I had her try to
start the car and it started right up.  I told her that she should have enough
gas to get her to a station.  I then got in my truck and came on home.  I
noticed that she followed me to our home on South Main Street, but when I
turned into our driveway she continued on south.  I never thought any more
about the incident.  The next morning when I came out the back door, on the
steps was a toe chain.  As we were renting the home from Mae’s Uncle Dale and
we were just south of his manufacturing plant, I surmised that someone had
borrow a chain from him and thinking that he still lived there, had put the chain
on his door step.  That evening when I got home from work, I took the chain
over to Dale.  He said that the chain wasn’t his.  He could tell that because
he bought his chain in the bulk, plus he used a different type of hooks.  The
only conclusion that we could come up with is that the lady I helped, know
where I lived as she followed me and after getting her husband from work, they
must have brought the chain to me to show appreciation for my services to her. 
I think of that incident every time I use a tow chain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, June 6, 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mom Married Leo Jensen in the Idaho Falls
Temple for time only. The Temple president performed the marriage.  Although it
took place in a Sealing room the President informed both Leo and Mom that this
marriage was for time only.  He said that Margaret was already sealed to her
previous husband and there for she could not be sealed to him.  It was a
beautiful ceremony.   We think this will be a good union for both of them.  We
think a lot of Leo.  Following the ceremony, they had a nice lunching in the
Ward recreation hall.  There we got to meet and visit Dad Jensen’s family.  From
meeting Leo’s family we think quite highly of them also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, June 8, 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I started work for Browning Arms Co. today. 
When I heard that Browning’s were accepting application for computer
programmers I went up to apply.  I filled out an application and was
interviewed by the Data Processing Manager, Frank Rogers.  After looking over
my application, he commented that I had left one area blank.  I had not filled
in the monthly wage that I would come to work for.  I told him that I was hoping
that he would give me some range as to what they would pay.  He said that he
couldn’t do that, so in my mind, I tried to estimate what we could get by with,
as I really needed this job. I put down that I would work for $600 a month. (I
really Short Changed myself as I really needed a steady job and though it
helped to have a steady income it was not enough.)   When he looked at what I
put down, he said that if I couldn’t program at all, he could give me a broom
and a dust pan and I could sweep floors for he paid the janitor more than
that.  He told me that he would hire me at that wage and then if I could
program as I indicated I could, in 90 days he would raise me to what I should
be paid.  I told him that I would agree with that offer.  I started today as a
programmer on the 360 IBM Computer at $600 per month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, June 21, 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In Sacrament meeting this evening, Bishop
Sander’s announced that our Stake Presidency would be in attendance next week
to take care of some official business.  Of course everyone immediately expects
that it will be a reorganization of our Bishopric.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, June 25, 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting home from work at Browning
Arm’s, Mae and I drove over to Murdock’s to visit with Sister Shirley Murdock
and gave her my Sunday school manual.  I had asked her if she would teach my
Sunday school lesson this Sunday, because I am going to go on a fishing trip to
Idaho.  After giving her the lesson manual I couldn’t help asking her if Kent
was going to be the new Bishop.  To me it just seemed right for him to be
called.  Kent is now serving as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Counselor, in my mind he
would be right for the calling.  Shirley said that they hadn’t heard anything. 
I winked at her and she again said that Kent hadn’t heard anything as to the
changes as of this morning when he left for work.  That does seem strange, this
close to Sunday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, June 26, 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting off work at Browning’s I came
home and met Bob.  We were soon on our way to Idaho Falls to go fishing.  I
have noted in my Diary that we had both Bruce and Anthus Barlow go with us, but
neither Bob nor I remember them being with us.  As we left I told Mae that I
wanted to be back in time to attend Sacrament meeting as I wanted to see who is
put into the new Bishopric.  We drove to Idaho Falls and went to Mom and Dad
Jensen’s, where we stayed the night with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, June 27, 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Bob and I left early this morning for the
Teton Valley.  We found that the spring water was still quite high but we still
had a lot of fun.  It was good to go fishing with Bob again.  It was late when
we returned to Mom and Dad’s this evening and we did come back with a fair
catch of fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, June 28, 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mom woke early and started biscuits and
gravy along with fried fish.  We had just set down and had the blessing on the
food, when the phone rang.  Dad Jensen answered the phone and then said, “Ken,
your wife wants to talk to you”.    I had a gasping feeling as I answered the
phone.  Mae asked me, when we are coming home?  I told her that we would try to
be home before 3PM as I wanted to attend Sacrament meeting, to see who the new
Bishopric would be.  She then said that the Stake President would like to talk
to her and I together in his office by noon!  It was just 7AM then, so I told
her that it would take almost 3 hours to drive there, we would leave as quickly
as we could.  Boy!  Did that call spoil a good breakfast!  We just ate a bite
and left, getting home just before noon.  I slipped on a white shirt, suit and
tie then Mae and I went straight to the Stake Center to the Stake Presidents
office.  President Haslem welcomed us in and told me that Kent Murdock had been
called to be the new Bishop of the Clearfield First Ward and asked me if I
could sustain that motion.  I said that I could.  He then told me that Bishop
Murdock had requested that I be called as his First Counselor and John Ross to
be called as Second Counselor.  He asked me if I would accept that calling and
could I sustain John in that calling.  I told him that I would and that could
sustain John in his calling.  He then asked Mae if she could sustain that
action, to which she said that she could.  We were then instructed to tell no
one else of this conversation until we had been sustained by the vote of the
membership of the 1<sup>st</sup> Ward in Sacrament meeting.  That was quite a
shock but I couldn’t think of any other two Brothers that I would like to serve
with.  That was quite a day.  That afternoon in Sacrament meeting that motion
was put before the congregation and they were asked to sustain us.  As far as I
could tell the vote was unanimous.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, July 9, 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today as a newly sustained Bishopric, we
with our wife’s went to Salt Lake to the Church Office Building about 2:30 pm. 
There we met with James A. Cullimore, an assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles.  Kent Murdock was set apart as Bishop of the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup>
Ward, with John Ross as 2<sup>nd</sup> Counselor and me as 1<sup>st</sup>
Counselor by James A. Cullimore, assistance to the Quorum of the Twelve.  John
was also ordained a High Priest as at the time of the calling he held the
office of Elder.  After that was done we were invited to visit with Brother
Wright who is the Building Superintend of Church Office building.  He showed us
the office where First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve meet weekly.  Most
impressive to in that room was a large oval table, large enough for all fifteen
Brethren to set in comfortable chairs.  With the oval design every person at
the table could have eye contact with all other participants.  The table had
been cut from one large oak tree and sectioned into 4 leafs so that the grain
of the tree made the shape of a butterfly.  It made a beautiful table, as well
as the rest of the decor was very impressive.  This has been a very special
event.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, August 8, 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning we held a “Charles Browning
Family Reunion” and it was held at the Mount Ogden Park.  I believe that at the
reunion, we had almost all of Charles Henry Browning living descendents,
including Bob and Margaret’s families.  We had a nice lunch with every family
bringing “Pot Luck”.  It was a good time renewing family relationships.  Before
departing we had a meeting in which we discussed the desire to continue this
reunion yearly.   Roy and Linda were elected as President and Secretary of the
reunion for a three year period.  As we came home from the reunion, we decided
to stop at the Clearfield Stake Fun Days.  We all had a nice day but were tired
when we got home.</p>

enough water to supply the fire sprinkler system with water.  They figured that
as long as they had to do it, they should make the pond into a swimming pool
and allow all the employees and their family free access to it.  I believe that
if the fire alarm should sound everyone is required to exit the pool.  While I
was there it was never needed for a fire.  After I got home from work our
family went with Mom and Dad Porter’s family along with Uncle Verl’s family to
Antelope Island for the evening.</p>

taken off the church records.  I told him it wasn’t really very hard.  All he
needed to do was to write a letter addressed to Bishop Murdock requesting that
he wanted his name removed from the Church records, date the letter and sign
it.  He could then either mail it to Bishop Murdock or if he wanted I could
hand deliver it for him.  We then visited the Gunn’s, but they had friends
visiting so they didn’t invite us in.  The next time I met with Bishop Murdock

and the kids met me at work at 4:30PM.  We went swimming in the pool there at
Browning Arms.  Mae came in swimming with us this time.  I think this was the
first time she has come into the pool.  After our swim, we drove into Morgan
and looked at a couple of homes that are for rent.  We then went to Como
Springs and ate our lunch under the trees.  Como Springs was a great swimming
pool at one time but it is getting quite run down now.</p>

our thoughts of moving up to Morgan.  He said that he would like to think it
over and pray about it before we made any decisions.</p>

this evening.  We are going to go up to Larry and Tammy’s in Liberty for the
week end, as soon as I get home from work.  As always we had a very enjoyable
evening visiting with Larry’s family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Larry
and I got up at 2:30 this morning to go bow hunting.  We took his horse Star
and Tammy’s horse April.  My horse is about to foe, so we didn’t feel we should
take her up into the hills.  We road east to the hills and then continued up
the mountains.  At one area we had to drop down into a draw.  It was a little
steeper than I thought  was wise to ride the horses and I questioned Larry
about it.  He felt confident that they could maneuver the trail ok, so he went
ahead.  I got off and lead April down the trail.  Just before reaching the
bottom, the rains jerked back and I turned to see April rearing up.  I jumped
forward to get out of her way as she came down.  Again she reared and this time
I jumped off the side of the trail as she came down and ran past me.  I pulled
her in and as she stopped I could see that she had broken her front leg at the
ankle.  The bone was protruding through the skin.  We were an estimated five
miles from Larry’s house.  There were no roads into the area which we were in. 
We determined that we would have to put the horse down, the only problem was
that we had no fire arm with us, as it s against to law to carry a fire arm
while bow hunting.  Larry tried to shot the horse in the heart, but there is
too much flesh and mussel to get an arrow to penetrate that deep.  Larry
finally cut the jugular van and we just had to wait until the horse fell over
dead.  We loaded the saddle onto Larry’s horse and let it out of the mountain
back to Larry’s.  That sure took all the fun out of the hunt and I have never
gone bow hunting again.  After getting home we did take our families and a
picnic lunch and went up to Willard Bason.</p>

our families to attend Sunday school.  We spent a very relaxing and enjoyable
day with Larry and Tammy and their family.  We left this afternoon in time so
that we could attend Sacrament meeting in the Mound Fort Ward.  Luana Moulton
spoke in their Sacrament program prior to her leaving on a mission call.</p>

1949 Chevrolet today.  I am not sure yet if is worthwhile.  I attended

hour in the pool.  We then drove to Morgan to look at a house that one of the
ladies at work told me that is was up for rent.  Mae had prepared a lunch so we
stopped at Como Springs and ate lunch under the shade trees.  Mike started
walking today by himself.  My family is special.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Bishop
Murdock called me to tell me that he had a 1964 Chevrolet Station Wagon come
into his store and he asked if I would like to try it out.  We drove over and
got the car and drove to Willard.  Besides trying out the car, we tried to find
some peaches for sale, but it is still too early for them.  The car really
seems to be in good condition and with our family it would really be nice.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                (I
will add some to this journal that I hadn’t recorded previously.)  Some time
back, since we had moved to Clearfield, we drove to Ogden to attend Sacrament
meeting.  I believe it was because Myrna Moulton was reporting on her mission. 
We were running late and so were driving quite fast on the freeway, when the
bearing in the differential froze up.  The rear wheels lock and I really had a
hard time keeping the car from going off the highway.  We were also lucky that
there was no traffic around us as the car swerved back and forth.  Just as I
got the car under control and almost to a stop, there was a loud bang and the
wheels started turning.  Although there was still a loud squeak we were able to
drive it on the Mound Fort Chappell.  After meeting we drove it home very
slowly, even with it still squeaking.  The following day I took the rear end
apart and it was completely ruined.  I tried two different rear ends that I
found from the junk yard, but neither would fit.  I found out that for that
year of a Nash Rambler they had made about 8 different models of rear ends.  I
couldn’t find the model that fit our car.  We there for were using my Chevrolet
Pickup for our family transportation.</p>

Shellie with me to Browning Arms where I did some work on our Ward Membership
list.  It is pretty simple to keep a listing of all ward members up to date now
that I have them on the computer.  It only took me a few minutes and then we
went for a swim.  We weren’t in very long as the water is getting quite cold. 
After returning home we took all our Family and joined a Family Gathering at
Uncle Dale and Aunt Esters home.  This evening Mae and I attended a viewing for
Sister Tuttel.  She passed away last Saturday at 1:30 AM after a lingering
illness and age.</p>

that we could go swimming.  To this she added, “even if it was freezing and we
freezed.”  Then I told her the Bless Momma that would soon have our new baby. 
To this she added “so I can rock her like this (adding with actions of holding
a baby in her armes).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Work
went well today.  This evening Bishop Murdock and I went visiting. <i> A couple
of additions to this short entry</i>.  As we got out of the car to visit a family,
a dog barked.  (you have to know that Bishop Murdock is a large man with an
athletic build and really looks sharp in a suit, well over 6 feet toll,) When Bishop
heard the bark, he froze and said, “Ken, you go first!”  The second thing that
I would add here, although I am sure this should be at an earlier date.  One of
the goals, Bishop set when we were first called into the Bishopric, was that
when we received a new membership record into the Ward, is that we visit that
person or Family before the membership was officially read in as new members to
our Ward.  Our ward was quite a transit area with a large Trailer Park and
several Apartments.  Often records would come in and before the Family or
Individual could be located, they would have already moved back out.  On one
such visit, we knocked on the door of a address we had received.  A man
answered and when Bishop explained why we were there, the man invited us in and
invited us to be seated.  The man set across the room and I noticed that he set
quite tense on the edge of the chair.  We visited for a few minutes and then
Bishop said that we needed to be going, as we had others to visit.  The man
then asked, “Bishop, why are you’re here?”  Bishop then said that we had come
to get aquatinted with him.  The man then said, “No, Bishop, Why did you come
to visit me.”  Bishop Murdock then said that we had received his membership
record and we just wanted to meet him.  At this the man responded, “I can’t
believe this, I have never had a Bishop in my home that he didn’t want
something and it was usually a donation.”  To this Bishop Murdock said “He did
have one request, we would like to invite you and your family him to join us in
our Ward meetings.”</p>

be at the hospital at 9:30 AM Saturday, and he would start her into labor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                An
addition here: with our leaving the bank’s employment, we did not have a health
insurance.  We had been paying Dr. Naisbitt with each visit, but we had not
been able to save any for the hospital bill.  We figured that we would have to
just make payments on that bill.  However when we talked to the Hospital, we
found out that Bishop Murdock, knowing of our financial situation had made
arrangement that our bill was written off on Welfare.</p>

into the Hospital earlier this morning and had given birth to a baby girl. 
Tammy had called Mae last night and told her that we was going into the
hospital and said that she would save her a room so that they could be
together.  When we took Mae in, sure enough Tammy had talked to one of the
Nurses, who was a friend of ours from the Mound Fort Ward, and she arranged for
Mae and Tammy to be in the same room after their delivery’s.  It wasn’t long
after we got her admitted before they started Mae into labor.  At 2:24PM Mae
gave birth to a 7lb 14oz baby boy.  He was 20 inches long and had dark hair. 
He looks a lot like Shellie.  I was able to be with Mae the complete time.  I

and I actually went up in the “Pair Kit.”  I do not really recall this event. 
I remember that while we lived in Ogden, that Roy and I joined some of Roy’s
friends out there Pair Kitting.  We used our Oldsmobile as one of the towing
vehicles.  You use a Pair Shoot and tie it onto a heavy vehicle with a long
rope.  The vehicle then pulls the rider and at about 15 to 20 mph, the runner’s
feet leave the ground and you are flying high in the sky.  It is quite a thrill. 
This activity later became outlawed, as to many were being injured due to ropes
breaking under the stress.  Also the landing became a little tricky.)   My
Diary also indicates that I butchered a rabbit.  Later this afternoon, John
Ross and I went up to Browning Arms and went Skeet Shooting.</p>

After he told me that he had often given talks in which he didn’t have time to
prepare but just relied on the Spirit to guide and the talk went well.  This

He said that he found out that if you don’t do your part, especially when you
have time, the Spirit leaves you on your own.  He said that he would never try
that again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
had never owned a rifle but when I would go Deer Hunting I would borrow a
riffle from Margaret’s husband, Frank Gun.  If I remember correctly it was just
before hunting season 1968 that Larry invited me to go hunting with him.  The
problem was that Margaret and Frank had got a divorce and that left me with no
one to borrow a riffle from.  Larry had seen an ad in the paper of a new variety
store in Ogden that had Deer Hunting Riffles on Sale.  We stopped there and
they had a 30-06 with no brand marked on it for sale for $30.00 so I bought
it.  I used it that season and did “by accident I think” get a deer.  Later we
took the riffle to a target range and after several tries, decided that it
wouldn’t sight in.  During the next year we again tried several times to sight
it in but with little success.  Again that fall I got a deer but I don’t know
if it was me or Larry’s brother that finally shot the deer but Melvin let me
have it.  That winter I met a fellow that worked at Browning Arms.  In visiting
with him I told him of my riffle that I could not get to sight in.  He told me
to let him take it to work and he would lock it in a sighting clamp and sight
it in for me.  After a week or two he returned the riffle to me but said he
couldn’t get it to shoot twice in the same spot.  He wasn’t sure the trouble but
he felt that the barrel would have to be completely rebuilt in order to correct
the problem.  I just let it go, not wanting to spend that kind of money.  Shortly
before Christmas 1969 a friend,Dick Brower in our Ward, who worked at Smith
&amp; Edwards, came to me and said that after December, all fire arms had to be
registered.  Until the end of December he could still get me a riffle without
the registration.  Also, Smith &amp; Edwards were having a great sale on
riffles now.  I told him that I was broke and anything I would spend now would
take away from my families Christmas.  I told him of my riffle that we couldn’t
get to sight in.  To this he asked what the riffle looked like, physically.  I
told him that it looked like new.  He suggested that I let him take it out to
work and ask his boss what he could give me on a trade in.  Maybe I could get
enough out of it to put a riffle on lay-a-way and get it out next spring when
finances were better.  I told him to see what the possibilities would be.  A
few days later he said that not only did his boss give me a good trade-in
price, even more than I had bought it for, plus he bought me a Remington 30-06
pump riffle, on sale and with his employee’s discount.  Later that spring I was
able to pay it off and get it out of lay-a-way.  This is the riffle that I was
shooting on the Browning Shooting range.  Boy! I sure like this riffle.</p>

the Barns every since we lived in Sunset in the Sunset 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward. 
After moving up to Mountain Green they built a fish hatchery on the stream.  I
had Vergil take us to the ponds where we let the children, catching four fish. 
Vergil had asked me which size of fish I wanted them to catch because he
charged by the size.  I had them catch the medium size.  I asked Vergil how
much business they did and he said quite a bit.  His biggest activity was the
fisherman returning from Flaming Gorge Sunday afternoon.  They wanted to catch
the largest fish they could and a full limit, as they needed to show others how
great the fishing trip was they had at the Gorge.  I got quite a kick out of
that information.  After catching the fish we went on up to the office at

Deer Hunting.  Larry Braithwaite, John Willerton, Jim (a friend of John’s) and
I went to Manti.  We went up Six Mile Canyon where Larry likes to hunt.  This
time we tried going to a different camp site than we have in the past.  In past
years we would camp at the bottom of the mountain and then hike the mountain in
the early morning before the sun came up.  This year Larry had installed special
large and wide tires on his four wheel drive ¾ ton truck.  With all the camping
and hunting gear in the back of the truck, we started up the side of the
mountain.  All went well until about ½ way up we had to cross a stream.  We
started through it and the front tires crossed but when the rear tires went
into the stream the truck spun out.  After a few tries Larry backed the truck
back down a little ways.  We got out and Larry got some heavy tire chains that
Larry had prepared just to fit these wheels. With the chains in place we tried
a second time.  Again the front tires went through the stream bed but when the
rear tires started to climb out the steep bank a rear axle snapped.  We backed
down through the stream with just the front wheels giving power.  It was
getting late into the afternoon by then so we unloaded the camping gear and
carried it down to a level area where we set up our camp site.  We than use
some logs and a 4’ heavy truck jack and lifted the rear end of the truck.  We
removed the rear axles and Larry carried them down the hill to where Larry’s
Father, Lynn had set up their camp site.  The axles were the same as the ones
on Larry’s truck.  Using the Axle from Larry’s father truck Larry came back and
before dark we got Larry’s truck repaired and put back together.  While Larry
was changing axels, John, Jim and I set up our camp.  </p>

day light we again tried to drive the truck up the hill side.  With out the
weight of all the camping gear in the rear bed of the truck we went right up
the mountain.  We had a good hunt; Larry shot a nice two point buck.  Early
afternoon I shot a nice spike.  Larry also shot a doe, which Jim took and
Melvin, Larry’s brother had shot a fawn that he gave to John.  Larry also drove
back to Manti where he was able to purchase two new axels.  We reinstalled the
one axel back into Larry’s father’s truck and Larry said that he had learned a
lesson, never go mountain climbing without a spear axel.  We packed up our gear
and headed home.  It was late when we got home but we had a great time.</p>

must have taken the day off work today as in my Diary entry I indicate that Mae
and I attended the Salt Lake Temple and did some initiatory work.  We then
picked up some supplies for the ward.  We then came home and got things set up
to have a Birthday Party for Sandy right after school.  Following Sandy’s party
we went to a Ward Bazaar and Banquet.  Following the dinner we held a Auction
in which there was many donated items and services to bid on.  I bid on and was
awarded a Ride in a Model T Ford Roadster with a Rumble Seat, owned by Bishop
Sanders and his son.  This whole evening was not only for a Social but also to
raise money for our Ward’s operating funds.  By the end of the evening we had
brought in over two thousand dollars.  It has been a very busy day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Work
went ok today.  At 5:30PM Brother John Ross and I met with the Primary
Presidency and teachers and set them apart in there callings.  That is always
been an enjoyable experience.  I have found that in setting a group, especially
Sisters, apart for their calling that the Spirit is really felt.  On one
occasion after setting a group of Sisters apart, like we did this evening, as
we finished with the last Sister, one of the Sisters asked us a question.  She
then asked how we could give a different blessing to each Sister and most of
the time, give a personal blessing that was for just that Sisters needs.  That
was a Testimony to me that the Lord does guide and inspire those He call’s to fulfill
His work.  I felt it here tonight!  Following this meeting I attended M.I.A.
for the opening exercises.  Bishop Murdock and I then went over to visit a new
family, the Stout’s that has moved into our Ward and to ask Brother Stout if he
would accept a calling as a Sunday School Teacher.  </p>

and David were still sick this morning.  I woke up not feeling well so I stayed
home along with all the rest of my family.  Today was my day to conduct meeting
but Bishop and Brother Ross covered for me this morning.  This evening I felt
some better as well as Sandy, so the two of us attended Sacrament meeting.  I
conducted the meeting.  We had a African American lady that started work at
Browning Arms a month or so ago and I found out that she was a member of the
L.D.S. Church.  In getting acquainted with her and hearing of her testimony, I
had asked if she would share her experience of joining the Church with our Ward
in Sacrament meeting today.  I was there for very excited that I felt well
enough to be there also.  I had announced last week in Sacrament meeting that
she would be a special speaker today.  It was interesting at how large the
attendance was this Sunday.  Her husband was in attendance with her and I had
the opportunity to speak to him and welcome him.  In her talk she told of how
the missionaries had met with them and invited them to read the Book of Mormon,
which they did.  She and her one son accepted Baptism after they received a testimony. 
Her husband also received a Testimony of the Book of Mormon but because he was
a minister of an African American group and had quite a large congregation, he
felt that he could do more good remaining with this group right now.  He hopes
that he can work things out to later join the Church, while leaving a greater
understanding of the plan of God with his congregation, for now.  </p>

been taken to the hospital at 1:30 AM this morning, having suffered a hart
attack.  He seems to be doing ok but of course will be laid up for a while. 
Bishop Murdock asked if I could fill in for a while with the Ward financial
responsibility.  I having been acquainted with the Financial program from
having experience with it while I served in the Bishopric in the Mound Fort
Ward in Ogden.  Of course I told him that I would.  During each meeting today,
Bishop Murdock announced to the Ward members, of Brother McMillan situation and
then added that I would be filling in for him with the financial program.  In
our Ward they have had the custom of the Financial Clerk passing out receipts
before and after meetings.  Bishop therefore told the congregation that if they
had a donation receipt coming to please contact Brother Browning.  Well at the
end of the first meeting, I saw a Sister coming straight toward me.  Almost in
panic I tried to think of her name, but couldn’t.  She approached me with a
smile and said “Brother Browning I believe you should have a receipt for me”. 
I replied by saying, I probably do but could you refresh my memory by telling
me your name.  To this she looked at me almost in horror, as she had lived in
the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup> Ward almost, if not all of her life.  She gave me
her name and I gave her, her receipt.  This Sister never shook hands with me
the rest of the time we lived in Clearfield.  I felt bad over the situation for
I really offended her.  I don’t think there was anyone else that didn’t accept
my weaknesses.  This afternoon as a Bishopric, we went to the hospital and
visited Brother McMillan.  He is in good spirits and seems to be doing ok. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
snowed quite hard today, butting down 6 to 8 inches of snow.  It looks like it
will continue to snow more.  After dinner this evening we took our family to
the Pioneer Elementary school Christmas program.  Sandy had the part of a toy
soldier in the play.  The play was very enjoyable and the children especially
enjoyed it.  after getting the children to bed Mae And I stayed up putting ice
cycles on the Christmas tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked late this evening.  It snowed most of the day today.  When I tried to
start the pickup it wouldn’t start.  The engine would turn over ok but I wasn’t
getting any spark to the plugs.  I found that there was moister in the
distributor cap so after wiping it out the truck started right up.  the
children were already to sleep when I got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
had snowed hard during the night and this morning as I was shoveling the snow,
I strained my back.  I hurt so bad that I had to leave work early and I went in
a Doctor.  I am not sure but I probably went into a Chiropractors.  When I came
back home I had to stay in bed the rest of the evening.  Because of my problem,
it left Mae to take care of the Mutual Married party this evening, by herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
am still not feeling very well and stayed down most of the day.  We did go to
the Wedding Reception for my niece, Linda Davis and Jerry Pool.  It was nice
but I felt disappointed, for I wanted more for her than what I felt in this
reception.  Although they were married in the Salt Lake Temple, they had
Champaign served to those guests that wanted it.  Some of the actions and
comments made by Jerry, I felt were of poor taste and improper.   Mom and Dad
Jensen had come down from Idaho Falls to attend Linda’s reception also.  I
believe they stayed at Bob and Carroll’s tonight.  My younger brother Irven had
came to the reception and brought a girl friend with him, Linda Gallop.  I
believe that Irven and his girlfriend are going to B.Y.U., anyway they stayed
the night with us.  Irven gave Linda an engagement ring this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                A
couple of added comments:  The Marriage of Linda and Jerry didn’t last very
long, however with Linda’s health history, they were able to apply for and did
adopt a baby girl that they named Kimberly.  It wasn’t very long after the
adoption was final that Linda and Jerry got a divorce.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Also
I don’t know what happened with Irven and Linda but that engagement didn’t last
very long.</p>

back is still giving me problems so I have to be careful in what I do.  Mae
prepared a nice dinner for all of us.  We had Mom and Dad Jensen, Irven and
Linda as well as our family here for dinner.  Mike, Shellie, Sandy and I took
part on the Sunday School Christmas program today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I

Roy and Linda’s.  In attendance were Mom and Dad Jensen, Roy, Linda, Steven and
Barbara, Margaret, Ronnie, Terry, Linda and her new husband, Bob, Cheryl and
their baby, and my family consisting of 6 of us. We had quite a house full but
everyone seemed to really enjoy the evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
had to work until 7PM this evening.  Larry, Tammy and their family came down to
spend the evening with us.  Tammy and Mae made Christmas candy.  The children
all played together and of course had a good time.  Larry and I enjoyed
visiting together.  We sure had a good time.  I don’t think there is anyone
that we enjoy spending time with more that the Braithwaite family.</p>

Mom and Dad Porter, Hal and Jean with their daughter Cindi, Bryce and Deanna,
(I believe that Terry was on his mission to Germany at this time) Kim, Carl
(Mom and Dad’s Indian) and my family, consisting of Mae, myself, Sandy,
Shellie, Mike and David.  Again we had a house full but also a wonderful
evening.</p>

Arms gave all employees the day off as well as Christmas Day.  I got up and
prepared breakfast for my family.  I then helped Mae with some house work.  I
then took the children to one of the parks where there was a slaying hill. 
This evening we took the family out visit a few widows and friends.  We then
drove around looking at Christmas lights.  Took the children home to bed and
then at 9.30PM Bishop and Shirley Murdock stopped in to wish us a Merry
Christmas.</p>

came upstairs at 1:30AM and we told her that she had to go back to bed.  After
2 or 3 more times of waking us up, we finally gave in and let her get up at
4AM.  We had a nice Christmas although it was the smallest we have ever had. 
The kids were ok with it.  After some breakfast we took the children and went
to Grandma and Grandpa Porters where Grandma had some gifts for all of us.  We
had dinner and spent most of the day there.</p>

After an enjoyable day there we left for home around 7PM.  It was 10:15PM when
