<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke this morning thinking of so many people that we have met and been
associated with during our life that has in one way or another been part of my
life.  Oh what a wonder life is and there are so many questions.  I am so
grateful that I have had the testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to be such
a great influence and guide to me.  I am so grateful for my Eternal companion
and our love.  When I woke Mae was very restless and her feet were jerking.  I
finally rubbed her feet for her and then I came in the front room and read my
scriptures, expressed thanks to my Father in Heaven and went to sleep in the
recliner until 6:20 when I got up to get ready for my bus trip.  I took a field
trip from Holt Elementary to Thanksgiving Point and when I returned I did a
route substitute on a special ed. Run.  It was 5:30PM when I got home.  Mae had
dinner ready and after dinner I took care of the chickens.  Mae and I then went
to Costco and purchased a air purifier.  We checked the price of some bicycles
but didn’t go further at this time.  We stopped at the Health Store on the way
home.  We watched a J.A.G. segment before going to bed.  David called to let us
know that Dora Darthella Leavitt has passed away and her funeral will be
tomorrow.  We decided to go up with David tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 5AM and started to get ready to leave.  Just before 6AM the dispatch
called and asked me if I could take a bus route today.  It was out of the
Farmington compound so I had to just eat an egg sandwich on the way and go
down.  Mae met David at the Park and Ride lot at the mouth of Weber Canon and
they road together in our car.  The bus that I took was way past do for an oil
change so when I finished the route I called dispatch and let them know.  They
asked me if I could bring the bus up to the shop for servicing.  That would
leave my pickup at the Farmington compound but I thought that Bob might be able
to take me home.  When I got to the shop I called and Bob had just left to go
to the base.  Carroll came over and got me.  When Bob got home he came down and
asked if I could help him get the lawnmower from Cherrie’s.  We went down and
Eric had just came home for lunch so he helped also.  I came home and got the
sandwich and drink for my lunch when Carroll came down with the phone.  Bob was
on the phone and he had got to Antelope Drive and Main Street when the truck
died on him.  Carroll drove me over and I took some wrenches so we could remove
the battery.  We took it to Auto Zone and left it for them to charge.  Bob then
took me to the bus compound.  I talked to Janet about some payroll questions
and then took the afternoon route.  That went well and when I completed the run
I entered my trip information.  Mae had returned before I got home.  I was tired
so we had some dinner and watched a TV show.  It was a pretty good movie but we
had to turn it off a couple of times because of inappropriate senses.  We went
up and visited with Bob and Carroll for a few minutes.  Mae did up the dishes
while I typed this journal entry.  We then went to bed about 10PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got a call from dispatch this morning at 6 asking me to take the same route
that I took yesterday.  I agreed and so quickly got ready.  Mae also quickly
got up and got me something to eat.  The morning run went well.  When I got
home Mae was about to leave to go with Georgia to get the flowers off the
graves before the care crew throw them in the trash.  I fixed me some eggs,
took a nap, called Honest Engine to check the statist off our weed eater and
entered this much of today’s entry.  I left for the Farmington compound at
12:05 because school gets out early today.  The Jr. High had already let out
and the kids were all gone.  I did call the dispatch before I left and went to
the Elementary school.  After taking those children home I drove the bus to the
Clearfield Compound.  It wasn’t until 3:45 PM before they got us shuttled back
to the Farmington Compound.  Mae went to Scott and Mishelle brought their
children over as we are going to tend them tonight and tomorrow.  We took them
to their home and slept over tonight.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night as the twins kept waking up.  I took Kylan
and Ashley over to the school this morning so that Kylan could fly his airplane
and Ashley could roller blade.  After eating breakfast we took all the children
to Dinosaur Park where the children enjoyed the park.  We also ate our lunch
there.  it was after 2PM when we returned to our home.  Mae took the kids outside
and for a walk while I watched a show on TV.  After dinner we took the children
home as Scott and Michelle we home by then.  We visited for a while, I borrowed
their lawn trimmer and we got home about 8PM.  We were both very tired and soon
went to bed.</p>

woke at 6 this morning and so instead of going back to bed and waking Mae I
went to the recliner.  Before leaving for church this morning I walked into the
sun room in my socking feet and felt water.  We are not sure just where it is
coming from yet but I am thinking it is from sub-water.  Meetings went well,
both Mae and I bore our testimony’s today.  Bob prepared a nice for Kathy,
Sherrie, Cole, Mae and I.  After dinner Mae and I took a nap.  I pulled up the
carpet on the west side of the Sun room and extracted over 2 gallons of water. 
I set fans and the blower under the carpeting and pad to try to dry it out.  I
am not sure just how to stop the sub-waters from coming in yet.  We tried to
find something on TV to watch but gave up about 9PM and went to bed.  It was
still 11PM when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
checked out the water problems and concluded that the sup had just go to high
and came through the floor.  I was going to start work on it but Mae wants me
to start getting the yard ready for the party this evening.  I went to
Universal Rental and rented a carpet fan and put it under the carpet.  I kept
it there all day and it looks like it is drying it out ok.  I borrowed Scott’s
weed eater and trimmed the yard.  It gave me quite a bit of trouble and I
finally bought a new spark plug for it and that seemed to help.  Before I
returned home from buying the spark plug, I went to the store and bought a few
items for Mae including a box of fresh chicken that was on sale.  I mowed the
back yard and used the lawn rake to pick up the trimmings.  Mae has been busy
all day getting the house clean and everything ready for the party.  Mae wanted
to have the party outside but the winds picked up and it is threatening rain so
we changed those plans.  Mae really set a nice looking table and had a very
nice dinner ready.  I cooked the meat on the grill.  I had got the grill turned
on to preheat it and then went inside and got the meat seasoned and ready to
put on the grill.  When I went out the grill had ran out of gas and was cold. 
I had to use one of the gas tanks from our camper on the grill.  Everyone
arrived right at 6PM so the meat held up the dinner.  It all turned out ok, the
food was very good, we enjoyed visiting and we played a game of Mormon Bridge
to end the evening with Rick and Georgia tying for first place.  After
finishing cleaning up Mae and I watched a J.A.G. series before going to sleep.</p>

let me sleep until 9AM.  After breakfast Mae gave Bob a haircut.  We then cut
the chicken and trimmed it us, then sealed it with the Seal-A-Meal and put it
in the freezer.  Mae then did the washing and cleaned house.  I started working
in the garden but the tiller had a bearing go out so we went looking for a new
one but they had to order it in.  Mae went to buy some more plants and I
started weeding and preparing the garden.  We got the garden finished planting
and got the water on it.  Mae helped me plant the new plants.  I had also tried
to set the sprinkler on but found that the pressure pump is not working.  We
ate dinner after 7PM and watched a western on TV while we ate.  We then took
time to write our memories of Roy and Linda to send to Julianna prior to Roy
and Linda’s 50<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary.  It was almost mid-night
before we got to bed.</p>

in the recliner.  As she was still asleep I let her sleep longer.  I made the
bed and then went into the sunroom to exercise on the T-Zone machine at 8:30
and that woke Mae.  I prepared hot cakes for breakfast.  After Breakfast I
worked outside most of the day putting up the back fencing that we had to take
down when we had the trees removed back there.  I came in for dinner at 6PM and
watched TV until Mae returned from the book group.  We watched part of a show
and then I had Mae give me a haircut.  I took a shower and we went to bed.  Mae
isn’t feeling the best today but she kept going all day anyway.  Mae gave me a
hair cut before we went to bed.</p>

good day but a lot of repetition of materials we have had before but it seems
that repetition is good for learning.  It was after 5 PM when I got home.  I
took care of the chickens while Mae prepared dinner.  After dinner I started a
game of chess at level 3.  Mae and I went shopping at Winegar’s  for a few
items that are on sale.  When we came out there was a baseball game going on at
the park so we went over and watched it for a few minutes.  When we got home I
finished the chess game and won it.  I entered this journal entry and we
watched a movie from Netflex.</p>

Mae awake so I went in on the recliner.  I slept on and off until 7AM and then
got up.  Mae came in while I was on the T-Zone.  Bob and I worked on the back
fence getting the wire hung and stretched.  We rented a weed mower and cut the
weeds down.  When we took the machine back the battery in Bob’s pickup went
dead.  We had to jump it to get it started but it again died when we got to the
center of Roy.  I called Carroll and she came down with the car.  We called
their road side assistance and a tow truck was sent out and toed the pickup to
Dee’s Auto Repair.  When I got home I hurried and showered and then started
cooking the meat for dinner tonight.  Mae had gone to get her hair done this
afternoon but had the meal prepared and the table set before she left.  We had
Bob and Carroll as well as Robert and Sally Taylor for dinner.  We had a nice
evening but the Taylor’s do like to talk.  I filled this entry out and Mae
finished the clean up from dinner.  it is late so we turned the lights off and

prepared cabbage casserole for lunch.  This evening we went over to Jeff and
Gail’s.  They cooked hobo dinners over a fire and they turned out very good. 
Gail attended an adult session of their Stake conference.  We enjoyed being
with their children and Jeff is always cute but he was busy trying to get the
tree house cleaned up.  After the children were all to bed, Mae and Gail played
as partners against Jeff and I in a game of Rook.  The girls scored a 200 hand
in the first two hands and then Jeff and I came back with a 200 point hand. 
From there the hands went back and forth and Mae and Gail finally won the
game.  Mae and I stopped on the way home at the Wal-Mart store to get a few
groceries for tomorrow.  It was mid-night by the time we got home.</p>

back and Bob soon had a nice dinner ready.  After eating we went back and
visited with Leslie.  This afternoon Mae and I went to dinner at Scott and
Mishelle’s.  It was a Birthday Dinner for Ashley who turned 9 years old
yesterday.  We had a nice dinner and then went to the Layton City Park for a
little while.  We went back to Scott’s house for Birthday Cake but it was
Cheese Cake that Ashley wanted.  I didn’t dare eat either anyway.  After
getting home I worked on my journal while Mae visited with some of our children

Edwards.  While at Smith &amp; Edwards Mae backed out of the display tent and
tripped over the door canvas falling backwards.  I couldn’t reach her but she
bent forward and so just rolled backwards.  I didn’t think she was going to get
hurt at all but when her head hit the floor it was hard enough that it hurt. 
After setting for a few minutes she seemed ok except for the bump on the back
of her head.  When we got to the car she did take some a Tylenol.  This evening
I helped Jeff check out his yard sprinkler system.  I called Veldon &amp; Patsy
to see if it was ok if we came to their place in Cody Wyoming on the 9<sup>th</sup>

see if they could repair it.  The store manager called Hulet Packer but got the
same answer that they had given me.  He told me that we would call his manager
and see what could be done.  I when to Honest Engine and they had me new weed
eater.  I also went to Home Depot and found the light bulb for the light over
our fireplace.  While there I bought 2 cases of light bulbs as Jeff told me
that before the summer was over we would not be able to buy incandescent light
bulbs.  So I stocked up on them.  When I got home I spent the rest of the
afternoon trimming the yard.  Mae took Ben and Rachel to Dinosaur Park.  Bob

the dumps.  On the way we stopped at a salvage yard an unloaded some of the
metal and got paid over 16 dollars.  When we got home I took the pressure pump
for the sprinkler system apart and found the motor in bad shape.  Bob and I
took it to a shop in West Ogden and when then checked it out it was toast.  It
cost us $379.05 for a new unit.  We started the remounting of the pump but was
suggested that we mount it in a better place where it is not exposed to so much
water and winter moister.  Mae went to a Relief Society program this evening. 
I watched a couple of shows on TV.  Mae watched most of the 2<sup>nd</sup> show

pick up the children.  We went to East Canyon Reservoir fishing.  We mainly let
the children fish and we just kept busy driving the boat and helping them with
the equipment.   Connor caught 3 fish, Emily caught 4 fish, Tyler caught 2 fish
and Mae caught 1 fish.  I didn’t fish until just a few minutes at the end.  In
talking with others we found that most people are not catching very many for
the past couple of weeks so we felt good at the luck we had.  When we got to
David and Shauna’s, David grilled 4 fish and Shauna prepared the rest of a meal
with Mae’s help.  We stayed and enjoyed having dinner with them.  On the way
home Mae and I stopped at the Good Earth Health Store.  It was late when we got
home and put the boat away.  I made this entry and we went to bed.</p>

got up at 6AM and after a quick breakfast I took David’s pickup back to them. 
I stopped on the way and filled it with fuel.  We left for Tooele at 9:30AM and
got to the Stake Center at 10:50AM.  Scott and his family came just as we were
getting out of the car.  We enjoyed being at the Baptism for Dowson Caires. 
The program was very good and JaNae bore her Testimony for the first time. 
Brad baptized Dowson and did well although he had to do it three times to get
him completely submerged.  Following the baptism everyone was invited to
Sandi’s where they had a nice lunch.  Mae and I stayed after everyone else left
so that I could install a ceiling fan for Sandi.  After that was done we ate I
light dinner before coming home.  I entered this much of today’s journal entry
and then downloaded our files onto our external hard drive so that we could
send our laptop into H.P. to get the Sound card repaired.  I tried to back up
the fills on the lap top but now the external hard is about full.  I tried to
delete data on the external hard drive and about lost data on the lap top.  I
got it restored and have decided that I will buy a new external hard drive and
use it instead of taking a chance of losing data.  Mae is still working on her
talk so I will play a game or two while waiting for her.  We will then go to
bed.</p>

got up at 6 but I went back to bed for a little while.  We wished each other a
happy Anniversary before going to Church.  Meeting went well and Mae did well
with her talk in Sacrament meeting.  We stopped home for just a few minutes
before going to Bountiful.  There was many friends that attended the Sacrament
meeting in which Kathleen and Grinn Clark spoke before their departure to
England for a 18 month mission.  After the meeting we went to their home for a
lunching.  Because of rainy weather they had to have everyone inside and that
was quite a crowd but we still enjoyed visiting with the Hyer’s and the
McHarry’s.  Also  Karen and Joseph Delosantos we there and it was fun to visit
with them.  We left there and went to Scott’s and Michelle’s for a few minutes
and they gave me a Sheep Skin massage mat for a Father’s Day.  We then went to
Jeff and Gail’s to celebrate Ben’s Birthday.  It was after 8PM when they put
the children to bed.  We then stayed and played games with Jeff, Gail and Marcy
until 10PM.  I took the trash out and we had to let Parris out for a few
minutes.  We are tending her as Sandi is at Girls Camp this week.  I filled
this journal entry out before we went to bed.</p>

at golden Corral.  We recognized a gentleman there and so spoke to him and
found it was Elis Kendrick who was in the Bishopric when we became engaged

and helped me weed the garden and I got water on it.  I did get a 15 minute nap
in after lunch but still came in very tired at 5:45 this afternoon.  Bob and I
went Home Teaching to Brother and Sister Thurman.  We also took sister Johnstun
a cutting of roses.  They were not home so we just left them on their front
door step and I called and left a message on their answering machine.  Mae and

Home Depot and returned a electrical tester as it didn’t work.  I bought me a
new tool box, a screw driver and a hose splice for a garden hose.  Bob went
gulfing with Grant this afternoon, so I did some more digging for the drain
pipe.  When Bob got back we tested and adjusted all the sprinkler heads.  As we
were finishing I stepped on a soft spot that was starting to balloon up.  We
dug down and found that a saddle clamp had given way and so we had to replace
it.  I took a shower and filled out this entry before we went to bed and
watched another J.A.G. series.  Mae has been busy all day on the computer.  </p>

I got on the computer and started backing up our data files so that we can send
our laptop in for repairs.  When I came to Mae’s picture file there is over
80,000 pictures.  I just had to laugh at that many pictures.  Bob and I went to
Salt Lake and got my pickup as they can’t find anything wrong with it.   I got
gas in the truck and by the time I got home Mae had my lunch ready to take and
also had lunch ready to eat before I went to get Randy.  Randy and I went
fishing at East Canyon and had a good afternoon.  I caught 5 nice fish and
Randy caught 3.  We stopped at home and had Mae take pictures of us and the
fish before I took Randy on home.  Irven and Sandy were here when I got back
and we visited with them for a while.  It was good to see them but I was quite
tired.   Bob has the air conditioner on and it is quite cold down here.</p>

computer is crazy.  I am not sure if it is working or not.  Bob cooked fish and
biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  He cooked up the four fish that I brought
home from Thursday and that was more than the four of us could eat.  It was
really good. I have worked outside most of the day.  I finished digging the
drain line trench that goes from the front door to almost the back fence.  When
we installed the drain line in the first place we crossed an abandoned
irrigation pipe which raised the drain line a couple of inches.  This worked ok
but over time the rise caused debris to settle and plug the drain line.  I dug
the line out and broke the irrigation pipe allowing the line to be pushed
down.  I hope this will eliminate the plugging.  I also took lowered the last
50 or so of the drain line so that we can till or plow that back area with out
worrying about digging up the drain line.  I also perforated that section of
the line so that it can drain out better.  After getting this job completed I
got things loaded into the pickup to attend the family party at Rick and
Georgia’s.  This evening was very fun to have many family members in
attendance.  Rick and Gerogia really went all out.  I tried to get Rick to let
me spell him off at the grill but he wouldn’t.  It was 11PM when we got home. 
Mae and I had stayed and help clean things up.</span></p>

went well.  Bob prepared dinner for us and that as normal was very good.  Mae
and I took a nap this afternoon.  This evening Scott and his family came over
and we grilled chicken and hot dogs for dinner.  It was very nice outside so we
ate out there.  It was after 9 when they left and we finished cleaning up.  We
read a couple of days of Mike’s journal that he sent home to Becky and she
forwarded it on to us.  It sounds like he is having a great time there in China.  It’s late so we will retire now.</span></p>

working out back and Mae must have also been out.  Anyway he came by this
morning and said that he would till the area that I want done for $125 so I
told him to do it.  He suggested that I spray the weeds and then water the area
so that it will till good.  He will plan on being here on Thursday if the parts
come in for his tractor.  I bought a sprayer and sprayed the weeds.  I also
cleaned up some trash, mainly pieces of wood.  I put the water on the area and
will let it run until morning.  This afternoon I got the boat ready to go for
tomorrow.  I also brought up the tent trailer and set it up so that we can get
it ready to go to Lava next week.  I went to bed about 8:30PM so that I can get
up at 3AM to go fishing.</span></p>

had a good day; Randy caught two that he could keep and one that we had to
release.  I had to release 4 beautiful cutthroat trout because they were over
15 inches and kept two cutthroat and two rainbow trout.  The wind came up and
got so strong that we headed for the dock.  When we got out of the canons to
the open water the waves really got rough so I had to go to the south bank and
then follow the south and east shore back to the marina.  It was after 9PM
before I got home.  After getting home I was told the Patriarch Elwood Johnston
was in the hospital with blood clots in his leg.  I was very tired so we soon
went to bed.</span></p>

would just sleep through most of the session.  Mae drove to the Bountiful
 Temple and I did sleep on the way down.  We were asked to be Session
Witness’s.  That kept me alert and we really enjoyed the session and the Great
Spirit that we felt there.  We came straight to our chapel so that we could
attend the funeral services for Sister Miriam Virginia Fairman Johnston.  She
was a fine member of our Ward and a Sister-in-law to Patriarch Johnston.  We
were glad that we had supported the family in attending the services.  There
wasn’t a lot there.  When we got to the chapel I realized that I had left my
glasses at the Temple.  When we got home from the funeral I called and found
that security had found my glasses and I could pick them up later.  We had a
few chorus to take care of around the house before we then went back to the Temple
for my glasses.  Nick called and we decided to go fishing tomorrow.  When we
went to the Temple for my glasses, I had Mae go in for them and I waited in the
car outside the Temple.  Mae was in there for over 45 minutes before they were
able to find them.  We went into the McKay Hospital to visit Patriarch Johnston
and found that he had been released earlier.  We went out to eat at the
Chuck-A-Rama.  After dinner we stopped at Home Depot for some parts to repair
the trolling plate on my boat as in the wind yesterday, we were blown into
shore and bent the plate pretty bad.  We stopped by the Johnston’s and gave
them some fresh peas and a fish.  I filled out yesterdays and today’s journal

it reassembled.  Mae and I weeded the garden.  I then got ready to go fishing. 
Nick came about 1PM and we went up to East Canon Reservoir.  We were able to
get a camp spot for tonight only as the park is completely reserved for the
weekend.  After setting up the tent we started fishing.  We had good luck and
caught our limits.  We cleaned and fillet the fish and cooked three of them for
our dinner.  As soon as the sun went down it turned quite cold.  It was a
moonless night and the stars were so bright.</span></p>
