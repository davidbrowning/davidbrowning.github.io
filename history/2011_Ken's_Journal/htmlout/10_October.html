<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept most of the night in the recliner.  When we were ready to go to bed last
night Mae was working on her journal program.  I set in the recliner to wait
for her and fell asleep.  I woke at 4AM and then went back to sleep in our
bed.  We woke about 7AM.  After normal morning routines I took care of the
chickens and rabbits.  I turned water onto the garden and then started washing
the windows.  Feed the rabbits and chickens and came in just in time for
Conference to start.  I was sure impressed with all of the conference session
today.  While watching conference this morning I pealed pears while Mae cored
them and sliced them for drying.  During the afternoon session I filet the fish
we caught yesterday.  This evening I picked Scott up and we attended the
Priesthood Session in Scott’s Stake.  That too was a very enjoyable session. 
Afterwards we picked Kylan up and the three of us went out to eat at the
Rooster.  It was good and we enjoyed being together.  I took my wheel barrel
and shovel to Jeff’s after I took Scott and Kylan home.  I had to stop for gas
before coming on home.  Mae has sure been working today.  I worry about her
doing so much but it doesn’t help to say anything about it.</p>

didn’t get up until almost 8AM and then had time to eat and make the bed before
General Conference started.  We enjoyed most of the day watching conference. 
Bob invited us up for lunch then this evening we had Scott and his family come
for dinner at 5PM.  Bob also came down and ate with us.  We enjoyed visiting in
the back yard while the children ran around.  Kylan brought his airplanes and
flew them around the yard.  He is very good at being able to control them.  It
was after 8:30 PM when they left.  I helped Mae clean up the house and it
didn’t take long to have the house looking good again.  I think we will watch a
show on DVD before going to bed.  I got a call this evening asking me to drive
route bus 338 out of the Farmington compound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t sleep very well last night but was up at 4AM and couldn’t go back to
sleep.  I got on the computer and entered my bids for next week’s field trips
and some payroll information.  My routes went quite well.  I took a nap in between
the morning run and the afternoon run.  I also had time to put the last of our
camping items away from our last trip.  On the way home this afternoon I
stopped at Home Depot for items needed to help Scott reroof his house on
Saturday.  This evening Mae and I went for a walk and before we finished it
started to rain.  We had to hurry home.  We worked on our lesson for this
Sunday.  I got a call from the Utah Firefighters asking for donations.  I would
like to help but we just get one after another calling us.  We did turn on the
TV to see if Orem High School was one of the High Schools selected be shown on
the program.  It evidently was not chosen for it didn’t come on.  I got another
call to take a bus route out of the Farmington compound in the morning so I had
better get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 4AM to get ready and get to the compound in time.  When I got to the
Farmington compound I could not find bus 328.  At 6AM I went to the office and
tried to call the dispatch.  I checked the bus parking chart and there was no
328 at the compound.  Dispatch told me to take a extra bus.  I started up 68
but found out that the interior light would not work so I switched to bus 67. 
The first high school run worked out ok but on the Jr. High I had trouble
finding the address’s and was late on that run.  That put me behind on the
grade school.  It really was a trying and confusing run.  It was 10:30AM when I
finally got home.  Mae has been working on food storage most of the day.  She
also visited with Shellie by phone for a while.  Bob prepared lunch of fish,
biscuits and gravy for us.  That was sure good.  Mae and I worked on our new
GPS and we think that it is now working.  I took a nap and then went on the
afternoon routes.  The afternoon runs went much better.  I was very tired when
I got home.  We watched some shows on TV before going to bed.  Mae called and
visited with Sandi.</p>

woke about 5AM and was afraid that I would wake Mae I went back to sleep in the
recliner instead of going back into the bedroom.  It was after 7AM when I got
up and found that Mae was up working on the storage bedroom.  After breakfast
we took care of the animals and got ready to go to the Temple.  We took Bob
with us and went to the Bountiful Temple.  There was no parking on the top
floor of the parking lot so we went to the lower level.  It too was almost full
but we enjoyed the walk.  The session was enjoyable and we got to participate
in the Prayer Circle.  The Brother that set next to me had some paralyzes in
his left side so I was able to help him with some of the clothing.  Bob and I
got to the waiting area long before Mae did as she met Adele Clay who she used
to work with at the School District.  I couldn’t help but think that while waiting
I saw someone that was lamed, someone that was blind, many that are old and
halted and Bob is deaf: when the Lord comes all these will be cured.  Until
then we need to care for them until that day.  After leaving the Temple we went
to the Chuck-Wagon and ate lunch.  After getting home Mae and I took a nap in
the recliners.  I got a call from Roberta telling me that because of rain my
field trip has been canceled.  She called back in a few minutes with a run for
me for tomorrow, Friday and Monday.  Things seem to work out one way or the
other.  We then went to Kitchen Needs and purchased food storage items.  We ate
super when we got back and then plan on watching a movie before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
went into the bus compound and road with Cindy (bus 471 route but we drove bus
364 today) to become familiar with the route so I can take it on Friday and
next Monday.  That went well and I came home expecting to be able to get some
things done around the house.  I got a call from dispatch asking if I would
take the PM rout for bus 336. As I left I forgot to take my bus bag with me (big
mistake).  I got the address for the elementary school but I didn’t get the
city.  When I got to the compound I found that bus 336 was a Thomas.  I had to
become familiar with all the differences between a Thomas and a Blue Bird.  I
couldn’t get the radio to work nor could I figure out the loading / unloading
lights.  I stopped on top and got Steve to come out and help me.  His first try
he got no response on the radio but then it started working.  He showed me the
switches for the lights and I went on.  The first school out went ok as I had
students help me.  When I went to the elementary school I made a wrong turn.  I
tried to put the address into the GPS but I didn’t know the city.  Without my
bus bag I didn’t have the schools addresses with me.  I tried to call the
dispatch and couldn’t get the radio to work.  I was parked so I tried to call
the dispatch on the phone.  No one answered even when I tried other numbers.  I
tried to wave another school bus down but he just waved and went on.  Finally
Rosa called me on the radio and I finally got it to answer.  By then I was too
late and Rosa had another driver cover the route.  All together it was another
frustrating event.  Mae had been busy most of the day canning.  I helped her
some when I returned home.  I did work on the computer trying to get things
straight for my run tomorrow.  </p>

woke early and then slept in the recliner until we got up for me to go to the
bus shop.  The runs this morning went well.  Mae was busy cleaning and she was
in the mood to get rid of quite a lot that we no longer use.  I loaded it in
the car for her and she will drop it off at the D.I.  After she left Bob called
me to help him carry a lot of Carroll’s clothes to his car and he took them to
the D.I.  The D.I. is getting quite a load today.  I took a nap before I took
the afternoon run.  We sent out to eat with Scott and his family.  After that
we went up to see Jeff and Gail.  After putting the children to bed we played
two games of Rook.  It only took three hands for each game.  The first three
hands Jeff and I took all three hands and won.  Then the next three hands were
taken by Gail and Mae and they won.  That was interesting and I have never seen
it go that way.  </p>

went over to Scott’s and we started reroofing his house.  Jeff joined us about
10:30AM and that helped a lot.  We worked until dark and then put things away. 
We got almost 2/3 of it roofed and it was probably the hardest part.  I had
called Kip and he let us borrow his roofing gun, so that really helped and it
saved Scott renting a gun.  When I got home Mae made me some dinner.  I took a
hot bath and socked for a while.  I then filled out this journal entry.  Mae
has also been very busy all day but that is normal for her.  I wish she could
slow down a little.  I played a game of chess and lost before going to bed.</p>

wish it was done but I’m sure it will take tomorrow to finish the job.  Our
Family History class went ok but I played the wrong DVD segment.  Bob invited
us for dinner and then later we took a nap.  Bob then called down to us and a
good movie was playing.  Irven and Sandy came over and visited for a while.  I
helped them get some tomatoes and squash from our garden.  It was 9PM before
they left so I entered my journal while Mae prepared my lunch for tomorrow as I
will have to go from my bus run over to Scotts to work on their house.  I am
having some trouble with my IPOD.  It is low on battery and I haven’t been able
to get it recharged.  It seems to be working now so we will hope for the best.

had a bus run to go on this morning and when that finished I went to Scott’s
about 9:30AM and we got started shingling their roof.  Scott and I had some
opportunity to visit about Church matters.  I felt that went very well. 
Roberta called me and said that I did not have to make the afternoon run as the
driver got back into town and would make it.  That really help with the roofing
job as I didn’t have to stop and drive bus.  About 4PM President Craven and his
son Kyran came over and helped us finish the job.  It was late when we
finished.   I got home very tired and sore about but very glad to have that job
finished.  Before going to bed I called the Sub-Line and asked them not to call

meeting, Mae and Marna McPhie went out to have lunch.  I took care of the
animals and got my lunch.  I also tried to get some information for Roy about
Bob’s tax problems.  I had a Special Aid run this afternoon that went quite
well.  I did have some problem with the bus that I wrote up at the end of the
run.  Because Mae had the car at lunch I had Bob take me to work.  Mae came to
get me after my run.  She stopped and paid for the service on the pickup and
got the key before coming for me.  We stopped on the way home and got the
pickup.  After dinner this evening Mae and I went over to the church house to
see the computers in the Family History area and some physical rearrangements
of our class room for Sunday.  We heard that Brother Bill Reid passed away this
evening.  That is sure a blessing for him as he has been sick for a long time.

me.  This afternoon I took a bus run.  It was kind of funny; the run was
changed on me three times but it worked out ok.  Mae had Book Group this
evening.  I finished cooking the chickens and stripped the meat from the
bones.  I watched a show on TV while doing that; “The Valley of the Dolls” and
I really appreciate the life I live with the Gospel of Jesus Christ to give me
purpose to life.  I received a phone call about 10PM asking me to take a run in

chicken that I butchered yesterday.  I took a Field Trip this afternoon, taking

hair.  I have a headache this morning and feel quite depressed but I will get
through it.  Mae went over to the Relief Society social this morning.  I made a
new cover for the one chicken feeder as the chickens seem to be sitting on the
one and messing in the trough.  Bob prepared lunch for me as Mae ate at the
R.S. program.  I set down to watch the BYU vs Organ football game and fell
asleep before it started.  The game was under way when I woke.  I watched the
game.  I did get all the squash out of the garden and stored in the garage.  Mae
weeded Bob’s rose bushes in front of the house, trimmed the yards, picked the
strawberries, tomatoes &amp; peppers while I ate and was sleeping.  Scott and

didn’t hear the alarm go off and Mae woke me at 7AM.  We had to hurry to get to
meetings on time.  Our Family History class went well.  As soon as that
finished we went over to Gale’s ward, as she was asked to talk in Sacrament
Meeting.  She gave a very good talk and bore a strong Testimony.  Jeff was also
there to support his sweetheart.  After the meeting we went over to Jeff’s and
borrowed his trailer.  Jeff showed us his new office furniture, which he bought
from the plant in Clearfield, as that plant is now closed.  He bought it for
Gail to have as she does a small pre-school and also does scrapbooking and Jeff
said it isn’t working for her to use his office for all that.  Especially now
that he will be working more from home as he is still the Controller for the
Greenville plant in Ohio.  He will go there for one or two weeks a month and
the rest of the time, he will work from home.  They put her office furniture in
Matt’s room and they will put Matt down with Ben in his room and make Matt’s
room an office for Gail.  Bob had dinner prepared for us when we got home.  Mae
went Visiting Teaching and then Bob and I went Home Teaching to Sister Fallis. 
After getting home Bob, Mae and I got on the New Family Search and updated
Bob’s Family records.  Bob is sealed to Charles but not to his father, Lester. 
We found that that cannot be done until after his death.  His children should
continue to do the work on the Young line with that blank until then and then
add that ordinance.  We prepared for me to get up early in the morning for the
bus run.  We went to bed early but shortly after going to bed Bob called to see
if I had taken the garbage out.  That woke Mae and she couldn’t go back to

and I took her some eggs.  It has been good to work with her.  This evening Bob
and I went Home Teaching.  We took a squash to Casey’s and checked to see how
Sister Casey is doing.  We also had a nice visit with the Thurman’s and the
Johnston’s.  After getting home I went out and gathered the eggs and put new
straw in the nests.  I quickly entered this entry and we are going right to
bed.</p>

Mae and I got up early this morning.  Even with getting up early, it was 8:30AM
before Bob and I left to go fishing.  We then had to get gas in the pickup and
boat and buy worms for fishing.  It was after 10AM that we got onto the lake. 
I was almost ready to try going somewhere else due to the reports that I had
received the East Canon was very poor fishing.  Bob and I had a very good
morning and by 1PM we were limited out and back to the boat dock.  We noticed
that the tires are in bad condition on the boat trailer so I stopped at
Discount Tire and ordered two new tires to be mounted on the boat trailer.  I
left the trailer and boat there and Bob and I came on home.  We cleaned and
filed the fish before I went back to get the boat.  Mae had taken Tyler, Emily,
Connor, Kylan and Ashley to the Salt Lake Zoo for the day.  Later in the
evening Shauna came for their children and Scott and Michelle came for their
children.  We ate our dinner in front of the TV this evening.  Mae and I
watched TV for a while before filling in this entry and going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were going to go fishing but we were too tired to get up early so when we got
up and had breakfast, I took the boat to Willard Bay so that I could take the
boat off the trailer and repair the trailer.  Bryce also went with me and helped
with the repairs.  After repairing the boat trailer, we took a ride in the
boat.  Mae had lunch ready when I got home.  We then went up to Park City where
we stayed with Mike and Becky in their condominium.  We went out to eat at the
Wasatch Brew Pub.  It was good but the dish that I wanted they no longer make. 
After we returned we played a game of Rook and the girls won.  We really
enjoyed the opportunity to spend some time with Mike and Becky.  </p>

didn’t sleep very well but we didn’t get up until 8AM.  Mae and Mike cooked breakfast
that was great.  After eating Mae and I came home.  I feel that this needs to
be recorded and so will enter this in my journal; Bob has worked for several
days getting all the items that Carroll has made or collected together that his
children might go through them and take what they want.  He has worried that he
handles the disposal in a proper way.  I know that Sherrie helped him one day
and took some items but to Bob’s disappointment none of his children came
today.  I can’t help but feel a little of his disappointment!  After getting
home we went up to Gail’s mothers and picked quite a few apples.  Returning
from there I tried to get on the computer to enter some payroll information and
to search for any awarded Field Trips, but the payroll is locked up for
processing so I will have to wait.  We were going to take a nap but Sandi
called and asked if we could meet her in Bountiful to return Paris to her.  We
kept Paris while she and Nike went to Lake Powel with some friends.  After
getting home I caught up my journal before dinner.  We watched a show on TV
even though we had seen it before.  I then worked on our new recorder for a
little while trying to learn how to use it.  We also played the DVD segments
for our lesson tomorrow.  It was late when we finished so we went right to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke at 6AM so got up and started the day.  I added some to the journal entry
for yesterday.  I also got my IPod on to recharge as I had again forgotten to
turn it off and therefore ran the battery down.  Our Family History class went
well.  After returning home from meetings Mae made some dinner.  Bob had
forgotten to take a key with him when he came to Church so he wasn’t able to
come home between Priesthood meeting and Sacrament meeting to start dinner.  I
set down in the recliner and soon fell asleep after we had eaten.  Mae and I
walked over to Brother Larson’s to check on him as he wasn’t at church today. 
We have heard that he had fallen but we are not sure if this is a 2<sup>nd</sup>
time or just a report from his 1<sup>st</sup> fall.  He was not home so we
didn’t find out.  I stopped and talked to Sister Fallis.  She was waiting to
find out how much it would cost for plumbing part to install the water faucet
to their horse corral before they started digging.  When I told her the cost
she said that they would get started.  Mae and I played a game of Rummy, at
which Mae won.  Bob cooked chicken and gravy and Mae prepared us some rice. 
After eating Mae and I studied our lesson for next week.  I called Randy and he
will go fishing with me in the morning.  I called into the Sub-line to let
Malissa know that I am not available to run bus tomorrow.   Mae and I watched a
movie on DVD before going to sleep.</p>

woke at 4:40AM and got up to get ready to go fishing.  Mae got up just before I
finished and got my lunch put to gather for me.  I got to Randy’s shortly
before 7AM and we soon left.  We stopped at the Maverik on 300 N in Clearfield
to buy some fishing worms but they were out.  We found some at the Maverik on
700 S and then went to the Chevron where I bought gas and natural gas for the
truck.  It was 8:30AM before we got to the East Canon Reservoir and got the
boat launched.  It was almost 1PM before we both caught our limits although we
had both released some small fish.  We stopped at my place and cleaned the fish
before I took Randy home.  It has been a very pleasant day fishing.  When I
returned home, I fled my fish and got them sealed and in the freezer.  I took 1
½ fish up to Bob and he cooked it for dinner this evening, along with some
fried potatoes.  It made a very nice meal.  Mae has been busy all day with
various projects.  This evening I changed the cutting blades on the rider lawn
mower for Bob.  I am tired this evening.</p>

woke at 6AM having not slept the best because of my CPAP.  Mae got up at 6:30
as she has a dentist appointment this morning.  I went back to sleep and didn’t
wake until almost 9AM.  Mae had made waffles for breakfast and they we waiting
in the oven for me.  I worked on the dishwasher and reversed the door seal to
see if that will stop the leak.  I got on the computer and did some work on my
payroll entries.  Mae was home just long enough to have lunch and then she went
over to tend Jeff and Gail’s children so Gail could attend the Temple.  I
worked on the garden the rest of the day getting all the plants pulled out and
tilled it and also tilled around the fence line.  As I finished Jeff called and
is coming over for his trailer.  I went with him and helped load some
furnishings for his office in his basement.  He will be working mainly out of
his home for a while.  I drove back with Mae.  We had some toast for super as I
ate a piece of pizza at Jeff’s before we left.  I took a hot shower and went to
bed.  We went to bed about 9PM but I woke at 11PM.  I couldn’t go back to sleep
with my legs and arms hurting so I went into the recliner.</p>

slept most of the night in the recliner and got some sleep.  After breakfast
Mae and I went to the Stake canning shop and we canned the rice we bought a
couple of weeks ago.  We were back before 11AM and I started arranging our
storage on shelves.  We have a lot of storage but little that we can eat.  Mae
had an appointment with Deanna Davis so she went there.  Roberta called me and
asked if I could take a bus run this afternoon.  I told her that I would.  I
was about to get me some lunch when Roberta called me back and said that they
had a emergency and ask if I could take that run instead.  That was at 1:03PM
and I needed to leave the bus compound at 1:15PM.  I told her that I couldn’t
get there that fast and she told me to do the best I could.  It was almost 25
after when we left the compound but it went well and things worked out.  I got
home about 10 minutes before Mae did because she did some other shopping.  We
got something for a late lunch and then went into Apria Health care to get some
help with my CPAP.  We stopped at Cosco and Home Depot before coming home.  We
had a late dinner so I am not sure if I can lay down in bed to sleep.  Both Mae
and I slept in the recliners tonight.</p>

Mae and I slept until 6:30 before we woke up.  Neither of us even got up during
the night.  Maybe we need to do that more often.  We started on apples shortly
after we ate breakfast and put up 12 quarts of apple sauce along with drying
quite a few apples.  After lunch Bob and I took the load of garden trash to the
dumps.  It took us longer to unload it than we thought it would so Bob was late
for his Doctors appointment.  Mae went up to David’s where she tended Connor
for Shauna.  She had a meeting to attend today.  Shellie called and wanted Mae
to go with Sandi on the cruse with her and Roy.  That caused some problems with
Mae and I.  It upset me that Mae would consider going on a major vacation without
me and I guess I didn’t handle it very well.  When I returned from taking the
trash to the dumps, I cold packed the apple sauce as well as peeled and sliced
more apples to dry.  I also watched a movie on TV.  It was just about over when
Mae returned home.  We ate some dinner and then we went to a “Know your
candidates” night at the city recreation center.  After returning home I helped
Mae put the apple sauce away and then I entered my journal entry.</p>

woke at 4:15AM and got up.  I had time, study my scriptures, do my stretch
exercises and get ready and leave for a bus run.  I just rode along with the
driver and I will take the afternoon run.  I put a new tail light in the Buick,
fed the chickens and rabbits and ran electrical cords to all the water feeders
so they won’t freeze.  Mae and I have decided to go on the Hawaiian cruse with
Shellie, Roy and Sandi on the first of December.  That will be our Christmas
gifts this year.  We are not going to go to Alaska this next summer.  I took a
shower before going to the bus compound.  The afternoon run went very well. 
While I was sweeping the bus Noland called me.  He had several questions about
framing a shed.  I invited him to meet me at home and I loaned him some tools. 
He got there just a few minutes after I did.  I gave him some tips about
building that I hope will help him.  Bryce came over to trade Noland vehicles
and so he went with us to pickup Deanna.  She has been tending Shanna’s
children today so was at their home in Kaysville.  We went there and then the
four of us went to the Bountiful Temple.   We were able to get right into a
session but it was still after 9PM before we finished.  We stopped at our place
and had some pie and ice cream.  This was a apple pie that Bob had made for us
so I could have some.  Of course I didn’t put any ice cream on my slice.  We
stayed up late after Bryce and Deanna left and watched a show on TV.  </p>

getting things going I took my boat over to have it winterized.  When I
returned I winterized the tent trailer and did a couple of minor repairs to
it.  I also got the water units for the rabbits and the chicken plugged in to
the power so that they will not freeze in the cold weather.  This afternoon I
was called about my boat and went over and got it.  Bob helped me get the cover
tied onto it and put it away for the winter.  That really makes me sad to know
that I am through using it for the year.  This evening we went to Tooele to
attend a Family Halloween Party at Sandi and Nike’s home.  Sandi had really
gone all out with food, decorations and games.  All of our family except
Shellie’s family and David (Mike’s son) were there.  It was a very enjoyable
time but we were late leaving for home.  Mae and I did stop for gas at a Maverick
station for gas.  Mae went in while I was fueling the car and bought us a
medium dish of Yogurt.  We shared that as we drove.  We got home just before
mid-night and I was very happy when we got there.  We went right to bed.</p>

from the Stake presented the lesson on Handicap People that was very
informative.  After returning home Bob had dinner for us.  We then took a nap. 
Mae only slept for a few minutes but I slept for quite a while.  Jeff, Gail and
children came over for dinner.  We also invited Bob to join us.  After a nice
dinner, Mae &amp; Gail stood Jeff and I in a game of Rook.  This time Jeff and
I won.  I made some payroll entries and entered my journal after Jeff’s family
left.  It’s been a good evening.  Mae and I watched a movie on DVD before going

back to bed for a while.  I prepared breakfast of pan cakes and eggs while Mae
started the washing.  Working together we got the sheds cleaned out and
separated several items to go to the D.I.  Bob had loaded a lot of items that
he wanted to get rid of into my pickup.  We added the items we had and Bob and
I took them to the D.I.  this evening I took Mae out to eat at the Golden
Coral.  It has been a busy day but we also accomplished a lot and enjoyed
working together.  We watched a D.V.D. before going to sleep.</p>
