<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                No
calls this morning to drive school bus, so soon after breakfast Mae and I
started on apple sauce.  This afternoon I went with Bob to Wells-Fargo Bank
where we met with Stacey Watt’s to discuss the tax information Roy needs to
continue working on Bob’s tax problem.  She made some calls to get the records
of the change to Bob and Carrols reverse mortgage from Wells-Fargo to RMS.  She
had trouble getting the information from her own bank.  We think the
information will be faxed to the bank tomorrow.  We got 19 qt of apple sauce
and 5 qt of apple juice put up today.  This evening we watched some TV before
going to bed.</p>

woke a little after 2AM with my mask.  I slept the rest of the night in the
recliner.  I got up about 6:30 and read my scriptures and had prayer.  I then
checked on Mae but she was up by then.  I fixed breakfast for us as I know that
Mae had an appointment at 10AM with Deanna.  I worked on the computer for a
while.  When Mae returned home we had lunch.  I then picked up some parts and
changed the light that was on the west side of the house and installed it on
the inside and west of the carport.  I think we will enjoy it there more and it
will do a better job in that area.  This evening we watched the show “Ice
Castles” on TV.  When we turned the TV on that show was just finishing.  It
then was replayed so we were able enjoyed it from the start to end.  Mae and I
find great joy in just being together.</p>

mask woke me about 3AM so I removed it.  That is getting to be almost a
“Standard Occurrence” and I don’t know what to do about it.  I again woke at
5:30AM and realized that I probably would not get a call out, so I went back to
sleep.  I didn’t get up until 6:30.  Mae had woke at 2AM and slept the rest of
the night in the recliner.  She didn’t sleep very well.  I finished my journal
entry from yesterday and started today’s entry.  We ground Stelt grain into
flower and Mae made bread again.  Last time was good but today’s bread was even
better.  I made up some Almond Butter before going outside and collecting fall
leaves to but over our strawberries in the garden.  Mae prepared dinner for
Scott and Jeff and it was very good including hot Scones.  It was good to have
the boys here again.  I took a bus run out of the Farmington compound this
afternoon.  I got home shortly after 4:30PM.  We had to hurry in order to make
it to the Bountiful Temple this evening.  Bob also attended with us.  I
finished this entry after we returned.  We soon went to bed.  I hope that we
both can sleep better tonight.</p>

slept quite well although my mask kept waking me until I finally removed it.  I
got up at 5AM and after reading my scriptures, saying my prayers I started
working on transcribing my 1970 through 1974 Diary to a computer file.  That is
quite a job, separating years, making corrections and adding some missing
details.  I worked until 8AM on that before getting myself some breakfast.  Mae
didn’t go to sleep until after 3AM so I am letting her sleep as long as she
can.  This afternoon I took a bus route that took me into North Salt Lake. 
That was a new experience.  This evening we watched Hall Mark Christmas
movies.  Before it ended we had watched three shows before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke early and Mae prepared Skillets for breakfast.  It snowed last night and
the weight of the snow caused two large limbs to break of the large tree to the
west of the house.  The one fell into Mike’s yard but didn’t cause any damage. 
The other fell onto our fence and did damage the fence.  I was planning to work
on the computer for a while but Mae needed to do some work on her pictures and
then was taking the computer with her.  I let it upset me and then I really
goofed by saying that I didn’t think all these pictures programs really wasn’t
necessary.  That comment upset Mae.  I took the computer tower and left.  I
went to Staples and bought a power unit for the computer.  I called Scott and
he said that if I would bring it over to him he would help me install the power
unit.  Scott was able to help me and we got the computer repaired.  I then
helped Scott with a material list to finish a room under the Family Room.  Jeff
always wanted to do that and now Scott and Michelle now want to.  After going
home I finished putting the computer back together.  I was able to get on the
School Districts web site and bid on some field trips and enter some
information into my payroll.  Noland came by with some of my tools.  He paid me
for the nails that he used.  I took a nap this afternoon and Mae woke me by calling
me to tell me she was on the way home.  This evening we attended the Adult
Stake Conference meeting and really enjoyed it.  The messages were very
appropriate and well given.  A brother sang a solo in between speakers.  He
sang “How Great Thou Art” to a beautiful arrangement that just thrilled you
with such feelings.  After returning home Mae turned the TV on and we watched
the last half of a show and then another show.  During advertisements I entered
this journal entry.  Mae had left the mouse to the lap top computer at the work
shop she went to so I am working the lap top with the built in mouse plate and
it is really hard for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
and I both slept well last night, getting up at 6:30AM.  We walked to our
chapel to attend Stake Conference.  Both Mae and I wore our winter overcoats
and were very glad that we did, as it was quite cold.   We did see several that
were still without even a sweater.  The conference was very good.  After
conference we were starting to walk home when Sister Saunders asked if we were
going to stay for choir practice.  They will be performing on the 11<sup>th</sup>
of December.  We do not know if we will be here or not, because of the
possibility of going on a Hawaii cruse, but we practiced with them anyway.  Bob
had dinner ready when we got home.  He likes to cook and his food is very
good.  Mae helped him do up the dishes and after coming downstairs she and I
took a nap.  With the desk top computer now working we are both able to work on
computers at the same time.  I worked on journals and Mae worked on pictures.  This
evening we went over to Jeff and Gail’s.  Marcy was also there.  I helped Jeff
hang a white board on his office wall.  We also talked over some electrical
changes Jeff would like to make.  After the children were put to bed we, the
adults, played some games.  It was a nice evening but we soon went to bed when
we got home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in'>One thought that I would like to add here: Last night as we attended the
Adult session of Stake Conference, both Mae and I took notes.  Again it was
very obvious that Mae has a much better ability to take notes than I do.  As I
am writing my notes, I cannot concentrate on the next thought and enter a note
on the last thought.  Mae can do that and keep up with the speaker.  As I have
been transporting children to and from school I often transport children with
mental and physical handicaps.  Some of them look and act normal but cannot
remember which hinder them in math and reading.  There are so many versions of
disabilities that are now being recognized.  I wonder if I don’t have some
disabilities.  As a child I had some difficulty in speech and learning to
read.  Reading has and is still difficult for me.  To multi task is also very
difficult.  Are these symptoms of disabilities or are they just differences in
natural abilities that we each are born with?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night so I let her sleep in as long as possible.  I
got up about 6:30AM and went about my normal morning routine.  I read my
scriptures, got on the exercise machine, took care of the rabbits and chickens
and of course had my morning prayers.  I then fixed some breakfast for me.  America
First Credit Union sent Bob the information that we requested on his 2009
checking account.  Bob and I went over to Paice Tax and Accounting in
Clearfield.  There we met with Kris McLamb and went over with her, the problems
we are having with the I.R.S.  We were there almost 2 hours but felt very good
about the way she handled the problem and the way she was able to contact
I.R.S. and get to the problem.  This morning I called some Tree Service Co. to
get some suggestions and prices as to what we need to do with the large tree
west of the house.  I am concerned about what to do with that tree and very
concerned as to what it will cost to have it taken care of.  Exodus Tree
Service came out this afternoon and gave us a quote to trim or to remove the
tree.  Trimming the tree would cost us $1,200 and removal of the tree would
cost us $5,000.  Bob checked with the Home Owners Insurance and if the tree
came down causing property damage, most of it would be covered by the
insurance.  I was able to enter some bids on some of the routes that are
opening up for new drivers.  There were several routes that are out of the
Farmington Compound and I really don’t want to commute that distance so I put
in for the routes that are out of the Clearfield Compound and only two special
ed. Routes from the Farmington Compound.  After dinner this evening I gathered
the eggs and then Mae and I went shopping.  We bought Mae a suite and ordered
me a new jump suite.  When we got home I entered this journal entry before we
went to bed.</p>

we went to bed last night my legs were jumping and I couldn’t get them to
settle.  It kept Mae awake and she finally rubbed them for me.  After that I
seem to have settled down and slept until early morning.  Sometime after 2AM I
removed my mask but didn’t wake enough to get up for a while.  After 3AM I used
the bathroom and then couldn’t go back to sleep.  Mae had gone to sleep in the
spare bedroom.   I got up after 4:30AM, read my scriptures and said my morning
prayers.  I then started this journal entry.  Mae woke about 7AM and fixed some
breakfast.  I then went back to bed until 10AM.  Mae was gone to the store to
get the chicken we ordered last night.  We bought two 40LB boxes of boneless
chicken breast and had one box tenderized.  Roberta called me asking me to take
a run tomorrow.  Later she called again and asked if I could take a PM run at
2PM.  It was then 1:47 PM so I had to drop everything and go.  The run went
well and after returning home Mae and I finished packaging the chicken for the
freezer.  We finished about 7PM and watched a little TV but there wasn’t much
on.  </p>

repair a water valve.  It was very difficult to work on it and I thought that I
could just remove the guts, buy new parts at Durk’s and replace them.  Problem
is that this is an old valve and they are now made in China and the parts do
not interchange.  I had a bus run this afternoon so I had to do that before
returning to Irven’s.  I finished the bus run at 4PM and went to Irven’s.  It
was after 8PM when I returned home.  I was very tired when I got there.  Mae
had gone out to eat lunch with Georgia and then tended Scott and Michelle’s

Primary Sacrament program.  Ben participated in the program and we were so
proud of him.  When we got home Bob had a nice dinner ready for us.  He is so
good to do that on Sunday’s.  This afternoon we worked on getting Christmas
Cards addressed.  I was able to get the computer to print the addresses on the
envelopes.  Mae called and visited with Sandi for a little while.  I worked on
my journal getting it up to date.  It seems that the last couple of days I have

After I returned to the bus compound and left the bus.  I went to Scott’s and
worked on their basement.  At noon I went back and got the bus and went back to
Weber State to get the students.  As I was returning home Mae phoned me and asked
if we wanted to go to Hawaii?  Sandi had got a call and said that they had a
room for us.  It was more expensive than we had planned on but our room would
have an ocean view.  I told her to go for it.  We now have less than two weeks
to be ready.   Mae had Brother Larson and Bob for dinner this evening.  We
visited for a while after dinner.  Mae and I attended the wedding reception
Alyssa Barker this evening.  I was very tired so we went to bed soon after
getting home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in and then after breakfast I went over to Scott’s again.  Mae and I went
out to Sandi’s this evening for the Birthday Party Nick is giving Sandi.  It
was a very enjoyable evening with several couples there.  After eating Nick had
all that would like make comments about their association with Sandi.  It was
beautiful.  After everyone left and we put the furniture back in place, Mae and
Nick challenged Sandi and I to a game of Marbles.  Mae and Nick won the first
round, Sandi and I won the second round.  The third round Sandi and I was far
ahead but with only 1 marble left neither Sandi or I could draw a card that we
could use.  Mae and Nick won.  We went to bed after that.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were able to sleep in and then Nick prepared breakfast for us.  Sandi and I
went through the script and slide presentation for her Young Women’s program
this evening.  Their meetings started at 1PM.  We enjoyed the sacrament meeting
and the Spirit that was there.  The Sunday school lesson was also very good. 
Sandi and I left the S.S. class 10 minutes early to set up for the Young
Women’s practice that was held in conjunction with the Y.W. class time.  After
the block meetings ended Mae and I returned to Sandi and Nick’s.  Sandi came a
little later.  Nick had to leave for work soon after we got home.  Mae got our
things gathered up and I packed them in the car.  Mae got us something to eat
and we then went back to the church house to prepare for Y.W. program.  The
program went very well and was very spiritual.  Mae and I left as soon as we
helped get things put away.  We got home just before 9PM.  After getting things
into the house I entered this entry.  I called Shellie for a few minutes to
talk about the trip.  She thinks that it would be good if we brought our
projector and speakers.  I already plan on taking our laptop.  We do have a
concern as our pass ports expired in 2010.  Mae will do some checking on that
tomorrow.    </p>

slept most of the night in the recliner.  We got up at 7AM and started the day. 
We did call Sandi and wish her a Happy Birthday.  I tried to help Mae because I
know that she has a lot to do to get ready for Thanksgiving, her Grandma
children’s Christmas Parties and the trip to Hawaii so I made the bed, cooked
breakfast, then when Sandy wanted to go to Cosco I worked it out so that I
could take them in.  When I came home about noon, Mae hadn’t called on the Pass
Port’s.  I was disappointed and that upset Mae.  It sure discouraged me.  I
spent the rest of the day working on Pass Port’s and then found out that we
wouldn’t need them.  This evening we read a couple of articles from the Era and
then watched a show on Hallmark.  It was one that we had seen before and when
we started the next show it was kind of dumb.  We finally turned the TV off and
went to bed.</p>

woke early and then slept the rest of the night in the recliner.  It has been a
good day and we got quite a bit done.  I bought feed for the chickens and
rabbits.  I also went to JC Penny’s and got the coveralls we had ordered and a
pair of suspenders.  After lunch I was going to take a nap and then remembered
that Western Radiator had called me and said that the car was ready.  I had Bob
drive me in and then I went right to the bus shop.  I got to drive bus 348
which is a new under carriage sports bus.  It really is a nice bus to drive.  I
took the Layton High School wrestling team to Provo High for a match.  It was
9:45 PM when I got back to the shop.  That almost gave me an 8 hour trip.  When
I got home the pickup was gone and Mae left me a note saying she had got a call
from Dollie that she needed help.  It was almost 11PM when Mae got back.  We
soon went to bed.</p>

both slept fairly well last night.  Besides the normal things like eating,
morning exercises and scripture reading, I spent most of the day on the
internet trying to decide what we are going to do on this cruse.  Most of the
activities off the ship look like tourist traps to me.  I looked back into my
journal and found that it was November 3, 1973 when we went to Hawaii the first
time.  This evening we went over to Jeff and Gail’s and after the children went
to bed we played Rook.  I didn’t get a descent hand all night but it was good
to be with Jeff and Gail.  When we got home I checked the turkey and there was
still ice inside.  I am glad that we didn’t wait until this evening to get the
turkey out to thaw like Bob suggested.  It’s late so we will go to bed.</p>

slept a little longer.  I woke Mae at 7:30AM and we did out exercises and had
breakfast.  I helped Mae peel the potatoes before I took care of the chickens
and rabbits.  I then used the lawn mower and lawn broom and cleaned up the
leaves in the back yard.  When I finished that it was time to carve the turkey
and mix the potatoes.  I again used my mud mixer to mash the potatoes.  It
really does a good job.  By the time we had those ready it was time to leave
for dinner.  Georgia and Rick were the host for this year’s dinner.  They had
reserved their Stake center.  I think that we had all the families there except
Shellie’s and Bryce’s family.  Sandi and Nick were there but JaNae and
Chelcie’s family didn’t make it.  We had a great time and everyone seemed to
enjoy it.  It was about 6:30PM when we got home. Mae packed some overnight
needs while I made us a turkey sandwich.  We then went over to Jeff and Gail’s
where we played games and slept over night.  </p>

nap.  Mae has been busy most of the afternoon and evening with the parties for
tomorrow.  I watched a show with Bob this evening.  I then helped Mae a
little.  I repaired the one chair that the seat cover keeps coming off, I
hope.  It was a little after 9:30PM and we went to bed.</p>

Grand Children’s Christmas Party today.  She had the little children first and
then had the older children.  It was a all day affair.  I helped with getting a
few things ready after breakfast and then I went with Scott and Kylan shopping
for a Birthday present.  I did get a heater set up for Bob to put in the rabbit
pen as there is one doe that will have kits while I am gone.  After parents
came for all the children I helped Mae clean up the house for it was quite a
mess.  I then took Mae out to eat as she was too tired to prepare dinner.  We
went to the sizzler and quite enjoyed it.  After getting home I entered this

school.  She then came to Sacrament meeting.  Bob prepared pork steaks for us
for dinner.  After dinner Mae and Sister Shirley Olson went Visiting Teaching
to Sister Fallis.  Bob and I gave them a little over 30 minutes and then we
went there Home Teaching.  Mae and I attended Tithing Settlement after 4PM.  We
were late as we almost forgot our appointment and would have if it hadn’t been
for Brother Dave Probert calling us to remind us.  We went over to Scott and
Mishelle’s to have dinner with them.  After dinner Scott and I discussed
various Gospel teachings.  I hope it helps for Scott is struggling with his
testimony.  It was 910PM when we got home.  I filled out this entry before we

got going about 7 this morning with our exercisers.  I fixed egg omelet and
toast for breakfast.  Mae got the washing going and I took care of the
animals.  I called the tax accountant for Bob to see what she thought, as we
have not received any word from I.R.S. about Bob’s taxes for 2009.  She is sure
that everything is ok.  I got the suit cases out so we can start packing them. 
We then did some running around with various errons.  We laid down to take a
nap but the phone rang and Mae answered it.  It was Mike so Mae talked to him
and I took the nap.  I wrapped the gifts for the Seymore’s and the Drake’s so
we can take them with us.  Mae worked on the checking account.  We (she) got
quite a lot packed.  We watched two Christmas shows on Hallmark before going to
bed after mid-night.</p>

packing.  I ran errons and got the car washed.  I also went to Peterson Medical
and took my sleep test results.  Due to the way the other co. handled things I
can’t get new items until the 29<sup>th</sup> of December.  I think that will
work out because I will not be working again until after the 1<sup>st</sup> of
January.  I sold 3 dozen eggs to Marilyn Bodley this evening.   Mae and I

Johnstun’s.  Mae and I continued packing and arranging the suit cases this
evening.  It was after 11PM when we went to bed.</p>

care of my animals while I am gone.  We finished packing for our trip.  We were
finished and left home shortly after 4PM.  We hadn’t gone fare when we realized
that we had forgotten a couple of items.  We returned home for them.  We next
stopped in Kaysville to get my boots from the Shoe Repair shop.  We then
traveled out to Tooele, stopping at a Sub Way for something to eat.  We took it
to Sandi and Nick’s.  Nick was there but Sandi was still out.  Mae and I
finally ate our sandwich but Nick waited for Sandi.  I was concerned with
eating so late and I was right as I had stomach trouble after we went to bed
and I had to sleep in the recliner. </p>
