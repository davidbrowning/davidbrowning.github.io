<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 7AM, read my scriptures and said my prayers.  I have thought quite a
bit as to what I could tell Garrett that would help him.  I wish I had the gift
of speech, but how do you tell in a few words what you have learned and
experienced in almost 2/3rd of a century?  I wonder if that hasn’t been a
question from the beginning of Adam down and maybe even into the eternities
before this life?  Mae is still under the weather so I suggested that she go
into the Doctor.  She agreed so I called Dr. Lee’s office and got her an
appointment for 11:30AM.  I didn’t know how to handle that time with my
scheduled field trip but Mae said that she could drive ok.  I consented but had
her call me when she got there.  I also asked her to call me when she found the
results.  At 1PM Roberta called to ask if I could take a bus route this
afternoon.  I reminded her that I already had a Field Trip and she apologized
but she also asked about a route for Monday the 11<sup>th</sup>, to which I
accepted.  I had no sooner hung up when Mae called and told me that Dr. Lee
wants her to go to the emergency entrance of the hospital and be checked for
pneumonia.  She needs someone to drive her in as she shouldn’t drive.  Bob and
Carrol are not home so I called Roberta back and told her of the circumstance
and that I needed someone to cover my Field Trip.  She said that it was ok and
for me to take care of my sweetheart.  We went into the McKay Dee hospital
where they confirmed Dr. Lee’s opinion.  We were very impressed with their
concerns and service.  We came home after they had taken blood tests, taken
chess exrays, gave her an antibiotic, an oxygen tank and a prescription. 
Petersen Medical of Roy brought us an oxygen concentrator for Mae to use until the
Dr. says she is ok. Bob took me over to Tanner Clinic so I could get my
pickup.  I also picked up the prescription and did some grocery shopping.  Mae
was watching a movie when I got home and after it got over we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 7:30AM and Mae had slept most of the night.  We watched the Saturday
Morning Session of General Conference on TV.  Bob went into the Dr. this
morning and he said that he has Bromidic and gave him a prescription for that. 
While we were watching Conference Bob went out and mowed the lawns.  When he
came in he said that he didn’t like the lawnmower.  We enjoyed watching the
afternoon Conference Session.  This evening I attended with Mike, David, Taylor
and Scott, the Priesthood Session of conference.  Following the conference
Scott picked up Kylan and we all went to Broster’s for dinner on Grandpa.  I
have wanted to do this for some time.  I felt bad that I had to leave Mae at
home by herself.  I was glad that she was ok when I got home.  we watched the
last of a TV show before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 7:30 AM but Mae hadn’t slept much last night.  After I got up I got Mae
to lay down and she did go to sleep for a while.  Sister Marie McEntire brought
us over some homemade soup as she heard that we had sickness.  That was very
special of her.   This morning session of General Conference was great.  Bob
and Carroll invited us for dinner but Mae wasn’t able because of her oxygen
supply, her medication and her health but I went.  After eating they had me
take food down to her which she later ate.  The afternoon session was just as
great as all the others.  We noticed that we have a leak still coming from the
deck.  Brother Glen Ross called and asked us to speak in the 19<sup>th</sup>
Ward on the 24<sup>th</sup> of April.  Mae worked on Family History for a while
this evening.  we watched a couple of TV shows and went to bed.</p>

woke at 3:30AM and didn’t get back to sleep until 5AM in the recliner.  I woke
with Mae in the kitchen about 7:30AM.  She had slept most of the night in the
spare bedroom, but had slept fairly well.  After getting breakfast Bob and I
did some repair on the deck, trying to stop the water leak in our sun room. 
Mae warmed us some lunch and then after cleaning up the kitchen we both took a
nap in the recliners.  I got on the computer and entered bids for field trips
and also entered the bus route I have taken so far.  I got on the inter-net and
started to schedule some of our summer trips.  We are not sure about the timing
for Sandi and Nick.  We got the time down for Scott’s family and I will try to
make those reservations tomorrow.  While we ate dinner we watched some western
shows on TV.  It’s now almost 10PM so we will head to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>I woke up
with a night mire at 2:45AM.  I tried to open my IPod but it was almost
entirely drained of power.   Not being able to get my mind clear I started this
entry.  I then got tired and went to sleep in the recliner.  We got up about
7:30AM.  Mae was going to start breakfast but I told her NO.  She took a shower
and it about did her in.  later she did her hair and again she was tired.  I
took her to an appointment with Dr. Lee at noon.  He said that her lungs sound
much better but warned her that she should not over do.  He told her that it
could take up to 1 or 2 months before she would be over it, so be patient.  We
left there and went to Nancy’s where we got more items.  We stoped at the
Chuck-A-Rama and ate lunch, although Mae didn’t eat very much.  We stopped Cosco,
Good Earth, Office Supply and Home depot at which I went in for various items
while Mae stayed in the car.  Even though she spent most of the time in the car
she was still tired when we got home.  I fixed us some dinner and we watched a
couple of western shows on TV while we ate.  I was able to get reservations
made for the Buttermilk camp ground in Island Park for us and Scott’s family.  I
also called Lanny Wilding and we will see if we can work out a night or two to
see he and Larue this summer.  I got 2010 of my journal printed off and put in
a binder.  I played a game of Harts and lost before we went to bed.</p>

woke at 3:30AM but finally went back to sleep in the recliner.  We got up about
8AM.  I made breakfast and tried to make waffles but I didn’t beat the egg
whites so they turned out tuff.  I installed some shelf in the furnace room. 
Sister Wanda Miller brought us some stew so we had some of that for lunch.  I
took the pickup over to Dee’s Service and got it inspected and licensed.  While
there I noticed that he had a RV in the side yard.  I asked him about it and
found that it belongs to a customer of his and it is for sale.  I looked
through it and it looks pretty good.  Dee said that he would check it out more
and let me know.  Bishop Smith called this afternoon to let me know that he had
just heard that Mae was sick.  He offered any help that he could give.  I
thanked him but told him that at this time we were ok.  I cleaned out the
chicken coop and got things about ready for the new chicks.  Bob cooked dinner
for us.  This evening we watched two shows on TV before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I got up and worked on my talk for
Sunday.  Mae came in at 5AM and insisted that I come back to bed and try to
sleep.  I slept until about 7:30AM and got up again.  Mae gave me a hair cut
this morning.  Last night I had taken Bob up some fish to cook but I didn’t
hear anyone up at 9AM so I went up.  The dog was still in his kennel and I
didn’t see anyone so I went back downstairs.  We fixed some cereal for
breakfast about 9:30AM as I had to leave for a Doctor’s appointment by
10:30AM.  About that time Bob knocked and said that breakfast was about ready. 
I told him that we had eaten and I had to leave.  My appointment was just for
an annual physical and it went well although I hadn’t come fasting so I will
have to return in the morning.  I stopped and did some shopping on the way
home.  It has rained and snowed most of the day.  Mae and I took a nap this
afternoon.  I got on the computer and found that I had been awarded two field
trips next week.  That will mean that I will drive bus every day next week.  I
searched through my 2005 journal trying to find out how much we paid for the
work trailer but could not find it.  Mae tried to find it in Quicken but it
doesn’t go back that far.  I can see that I leave to much detail out of my
entries.  Before we went to bed we watched “Winchester 73” on Comcast free
movies.  As Mae was getting ready for bed she realized that she has broken out
with a rash.  We don’t know what has caused it unless it is the antibiotic that
she has taken.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
Mae and I slept quite well last night.  I went over to Tanner clinic for some
blood work and while there I got a Tetanus shot as it has been at least 9 years
or maybe much longer since I have had one.  In one of the training classes that
I took they told us of the importance of getting a Tetanus shot as there is now
an antibody in the shot against Whooping Cough.  Mae had already had some
breakfast when I got home so I got myself a bowl of cereal.  This afternoon Mae
and I went to Seagull Book and bought a gift for Jesse in honor of her
Baptismal tomorrow.  We also bought a talk on CD by Meg _____ that we lessened
to.  That is quite a story!  We then went to Peterson Medical and got a second
oxygen tank for Mae.  We then stopped at Dee’s Service and looked at the RV
there.  When we got home I got more serious about my talk preparation for next
Sunday.  Mae prepared us some dinner and when I stopped to eat she asked if we
could watch a show on TV while eating?  I didn’t get finished with my talk but
I think I have a good beginning.  It is now after 10PM so we will head for bed.</p>

Mae and I slept well again last night.  I woke just before that alarm went
off.  We showered and ate breakfast.  By 9 AM we left for Provo to attend the
Baptismal for Jessica Joe Browning and her cousin Stewart Jefferson Rust.  Mike
baptized and confirmed Jessie with Gramps George Stewart and myself as
witnesses.  Tayler Paige Browning gave a beautiful talk on the Gift of the Holy
Ghost. Scott, Mishelle and their children plus Jeff, Gail and their children
also came to support Mike and Becky.  After the services we went over to the
Rust’s where family on both sides gathered for a lunching.  When that broke up
we followed Mike over to the Orem High School and went inside.  This is the
school where Mike will be the Principle next year.  It is a new building and
very nice.  Mae was tired but we brought the portable oxygen tank so that
helped.  When we got north of S.L.C. the traffic soon came to a stand still. 
When we got to 5<sup>th</sup> North in Bountiful we took off and went the old
highway.  I don’t know if we saved any time or not because when we got to
Farmington the traffic on the freeway was flowing.  After getting home we laid
down for a nap but the phone then rang so I jumped up and answered it.  I
talked with Sandy for a few minutes and then Georgia called.  I let Mae sleep
and after talking to the two of them I worked on my journal.  I then started on
my talk again and after dinner Mae watched a DVD movie while I worked on my
talk.  </p>

woke about 7AM and got ready for church.  I let Mae sleep in longer as I don’t
think it would be good for her to go to church today.  I attended Priesthood
meeting in our ward and then came back home.  I attended the 10<sup>th</sup>
Ward Sacrament meeting and spoke with Brother Roper of the High Council.  Bob
and Carroll invited us for dinner.  Bob had prepared a nice roast and it sure
tasted good for a change from chicken.  This afternoon we relaxed and took a
nap.  I worked on a talk for two weeks from today.  We have two High
Councilman, which are asking us to speak with them on the 24th.  Depending on
how Mae is feeling, maybe I will have to give both talks.  I have a bus route
to take tomorrow so we will go to bed early tonight.</p>

woke shortly after mid-night and tried to sleep in the recliner the rest of the
night.  The clocks chiming woke me every hour until 5am when I got up.  I fixed
my breakfast and then put my bids in for next week.  I got to the bus compound
on time but when I checked the oil in the bus it was almost out.  I had to get
a mechanic to add the oil and that put me 25 minutes late leaving for my
route.  None of the youth we at the bus stops when I got there except the last
stop.  I took those youth to school but during the mean time I missed my Jr.
High run.  That got covered by other drivers.  I did get my Elementary youth in
and then took a field trip.  That went well except they were late returning.  I
still made it for the afternoon runs.  I stopped on the way home and got my
baby chicks.  Bob had dinner of liver and onions ready when I got home.  I got
my chicks settled and then showered and got ready for Bob and I to go Home
Teaching.  I made my bus entries on the time sheets and then filled out this
entry. Mae went into the Dr. this afternoon and he said that she is really
doing well.  She should be able to get by without the oxygen before long.  She
is sure special and sure takes care of me.  She had me a lunch for today and my
breakfast ready for me this morning.  This evening she has my breakfast about
ready for me for tomorrow.  It is almost 10PM so I need to get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
drove bus 433 again today and thought that I was doing better.  Rosa called me
on the radio and ask me to stop and see her after I finished the morning
route.  I did and she wanted to talk to me about why I left my first stop 5
minutes late.  I explained that the youth were not at the stop on the route and
we found that the route sheet had been changed but my sheets were not.  That
put me behind and so it carried to the Jr. High schedule and on that run I took
a wrong turn and that put me even late getting the kids to school.  I thought
that I made up the time for the grade school but it just took me longer than is
scheduled and I was late there.  after getting a new route sheet from Rosa I
drove the route for the High school in my car.  Mae soon had lunch ready for me
when I got home.  Mae and I took a nap.  I got mixed up on my High School out
route and lost 5 to 10 minutes taking them home so I was late to the Jr. High. 
I lost another 5 minutes on a wrong turn and so was over 15 minutes late
getting to the grade school.  They had called the bus shop, so all in all it
was a bad day.  This evening Mae went to the Book Club.  I tried to find a TV
show to watch but there wasn’t much.  David called and we decided that we will
get together with David and Shauna Friday evening.  I got a call from the bus
shop and they want me to take a different route tomorrow.  That’s ok with me.  I
straightened some of my papers.  Mae came home just as I found a decent western
show so we watched that before going to bed.</p>

came home and ate and returned at 7AM to take a sub run on bus 49.  That rune
went very well.  I also took that route this afternoon and again it went well. 
In between runs I helped Bob go to R.C. Willies and get a love seat.  I got a ½
hour nap also.  Mae went to Jennies for some pills and then went shopping for
wedding gifts for Caleb and Mishelle.  When I got home we did some checking for
a motor home.  Bob and I also went Home Teaching at Therman’s.  I filled in

we started plans to repair his tree house.  This evening we attended our Stake
adult meeting for Stake Conference.  It was really a good meeting.  I am going

very good.  When we got home I tried to find directions for the route I am
driving tomorrow but the directions are very confusing.  I will have to go into
the dispatch in the morning and get a map to give me directions.  It had been
quite a frustrating day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
took a Special Ed. Route this morning and although I also had a sub-assistant
we made out ok.  Mae was out weeding the rose gardens when I got home and
though I tried to get her to quite she completed the job.  I took the same
route in return after school but this time I had the regular assistant.  Mae
and I went to Salt Lake to get me pickup but when we got there it was not quite
done, waiting for some parts to come in.  We stopped in Bountiful and ate at
the Chuck-A-Rama.  I sure enjoy being with Mae.  When we got home I worked a
few minutes on the computer and then Mae and I watched a show on TV, “Reap the
Wild Wind” before going to bed.</p>

slept in until 8AM.  After breakfast Bob went with me to S.L.C. to get my
pickup.  They gave it a full tune up which cost $500.25 and he is going to talk
to the CNG dealer and try to get me a used CNG tank.  When I got home Mae was
out working in the yard.  We tried to get the weed eater to work but gave up
and went to Wal-Mart and bought a gas operated one.  I took a bus route this
afternoon that went well.  This evening I trimmed the yard and then mowed the
lawn.  Bob is concerned about the lawn mower but I thought it worked ok.  It
was 8:45PM when we quite and came into the house.  Mae was outside helping me. 
We showered and then watched a DVD before going to bed.</p>

woke about 5AM and went back to sleep in the recliner until 6 when Mae woke. 
We were just starting breakfast when Scott called to see if Mae could help with
the children as Mishelle is down with another migraine headache.  We hurried
with breakfast and Mae went over.  While doing up the dishes from breakfast I
made some almond butter.  I then mowed the front lawn.  Bob and I then went
into Ogden to look at a motor home Bob had seen at Roy’s Car and RV’s.  It was
a fair buy and had quite low millage but not quite what we would like.  He had
a large 40’ RV with a pop out that was beautiful for $35,000 that was a great
buy but really too large and still out of our range.  While in Ogden I did some
other grocery shopping at the health stores.  It really stormed on us before we
finished.  When I got home I fixed something for lunch and took a ½ hour nap. 
I then worked on my talk until Mae got home at 5PM.  She was tired so I fixed
some dinner and then I helped her boil and color eggs.  We watched a couple of
western shows on TV while we did the eggs.</p>

got up at 6AM and got ready to go over to Jeff’s to help him.  Mae didn’t feel
very good so I had her stay in bed.  That didn’t last very long.  I took my ice
auger and rented a fence post auger at Universal Rental.  Jeff and I dug 4 - 12
inches holes about 36” deep under their tree house.  My plans are to pour these
with concrete and then use them to support the tree house.  The augers worked
very well with the exception of one hole and it had some heavy roots that we
had to cut out.  This afternoon we went to Home Depot for some material.  I
will have to call back tomorrow and place an order.  I did order some materials
at Intermountain Concrete Specialties.  Jeff and I took some junk to the dumps
and then while we had the trailer we got 3 yards of bark and took up to David. 
This evening Gail invited Mae and I over for dinner and then after putting the
children to bed we played some games.  It was after 11PM when we got home.</p>

looked like rain this morning but it never did and Mae’s prayers were
answered.  I took the grill apart this morning to find what I need to repair
it.  Mae had breakfast ready by then so we ate and then I went to Lowe’s to get
the parts.  I repaired the grill, planted and weeded the garden, took a nap
after lunch and then helped Mae get ready for the Family Easter party.  All of
our boys and their families were able to come.  It was fun but both Mae and I
were worn out when they all left.  I really don’t know how Mae keeps going like
she does.  The boys went over to get a drink so I went with them.  While they
were getting their drinks I got me a Frozen Yogurt but I shouldn’t have because
my feet and legs hurt the rest of the night.  Mae was so good to rub my feet
and then put liniment on them so that they would relax.  We both slept well.</p>

both started doing more studying on our talks.  We attended our Wards

Wards we were asked to speak in.  I spoke in the 27<sup>th</sup> Wards
Sacrament meeting and this afternoon Mae spoke in the 19<sup>th</sup> Wards
Sacrament meeting.  Bob prepared dinner for us in between meetings.  He is
special at doing that.  This evening Mae and I went upstairs where we played a
game of Canasta with Bob and I against Mae and Carroll.  The first hand Bob and
I really had a good hand but that was the last and our wife’s won us so badly
that we didn’t even add up the last hand.  After coming down stairs I sent a
e-mail to Shellie with the name and addresses of some of my nieces and nephews
so they would have them for sending out wedding invitations.  We started to
watch a DVD of Truman Madsen’s on the Life of Christ, but became to tired so we
went to bed.  </p>

After breakfast I got on the computer and bid for next week’s field trips.  Bob
and I went over to R. C. Willie’s and got the dishwasher that Bob and Carroll
had bought. Mae had chicken casserole ready for lunch so we took it upstairs
and shared with Bob and Carroll.  I spent the rest of the afternoon installing
the dishwasher.  Mae and I took a ride up to East Cannon Reservoir just to see
how the water is doing.  It is still down 20 feet from the spillway but they
are letting it out the bottom about as fast as they can to control the lake
level.  It was a nice ride and we enjoyed the being together.  We stopped at
David’s for a little while and took some desert to them for F.H.E.  When we got
home I went out to the garden and covered many of the plants as it may get
quite cold tonight.  This weather is getting quite depressing.  </p>

Mae and slept about another hour.  After breakfast I got ready to go to Jeff’s
to work on his project but Bob told Mae that their dishwasher did not work.  I
spent another couple of hours checking it out and then called the service
center.  There was another 45 minutes to an hour and then nothing happened so I
will have to call back tomorrow.  I worked over at Jeff’s until 5PM and was
tired when I got home.  Mae took Sister Olson into a Doctor’s appointment this
morning and was there most of the morning.  Mae had dinner ready and then I
took a nap.  Mae then gave me a haircut and I took a shower.  We watched a
movie “Secretarit” on DVD before going to bed, we really enjoyed it.</p>

got up about 6:30AM.  After reading my scriptures, saying my morning prayers,
getting on the Tzona and stretching, I when upstairs and called the appliance
center for Bob and Carroll to get a technician to repair their dishwasher.  I
spent quite a while trying to find motels going and returning from Arizona but Mae
wasn’t happy at the prices until I became frustrated with that and quite.  Then
Mae wanted me to work on Family History but I was still too upset to understand
that.  I took a nap and then called on getting our computer repaired.  The
extended warranty with Staples said that the problem had occurred during the
coverage of H.P. so they wouldn’t cover it.  H.P. said that their warranty had
expired so they couldn’t repair our computer.  All in all I think we got the
shaft.  Bob cooked liver and onions for lunch but I was on the phone until my
lunch was about cold but it was still good.  I went up to Universal Rental and
rented a cement mixer.  From there I went to the bus shop to see what bus I
have for tomorrow’s field trip.  Bus 11 and 327 are available but bus 327 would
not run for me and neither bus has the proper wheel chair restraints so I went
back to dispatch.  Every one that can help me had gone for the day.  I will
have to come in early tomorrow to see what I am to do.  I went to Sherrie’s
where I borrowed Eric’s trailer. Next I went to Home Depot and got the glue lam
beams and some 4 X 4’s for Jeff’s job.  I got to Jeff’s just after 5PM.  Jeff
and I mixed the cement and poured the 4 concrete pillars under their tree
house.  We finished and I got home at 8:30PM very tired.  I showered and filled
in this journal entry and we went to bed.</p>

challenges that you, our children, are having.  With those thoughts sleep left
me.  By 11:30PM I had to remove my air mask and set up.  I was gasping for air
and was shaking uncontrollably.  By midnight I knew that I would not be able to
drive the bus route that was assigned to me in the morning.  I knew that I

covered me up to keep me warm and remained with me trying to comfort and care
for me.  I finally broke into crying and that slowly broke the uncontrollable
shaking and gasping for air.  I finally got Mom to go back to bed, although I
am not sure she has gone back to sleep.  I knelt in prayer, pleading for help
and literally asked my Heavenly Father to let me die.  The answer came and I
was chastened that I had no right to ask for that.  Christ was the only one
that had that right and he did it for each of us.  Not knowing what else to ask
for, I set back in the rocker.  Whether or not I slept I am not sure.  I

After checking out the machine he found out that it is malfunctioning and he
will order a new computer board.  However Bob and Carroll have a decision to
make as to whether they want him to repair it or have R.C. Willy’s install a

have Mae call in this morning.  I also got the run for May 4<sup>th</sup> straightened
