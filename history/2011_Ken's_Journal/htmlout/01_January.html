style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                We woke early this
morning, dressed and ate breakfast.  We then drove to Elder and Sister Shaw’s
where they were waiting for us.  The four of us drove to the west coast.  We
were able to find the Creek Canyon road, in which we first drove down when we
went to Morro Bay the first time.  Spring is starting to show although it was
not as beautiful as it was first time we went this way.  It still is a very
pretty and enjoyable way to go..  It rained on us all day but it did not stop
us from having a wonderful day.  We first went for a walk to the beach at Morro
Bay, we then took a ride up the East side of town in the residential homes and
where you could get a wonderful view of the ocean.  We next found a McDonald’s
and got something to eat.  From there we went to the wharf area and went to the
shops to get out of the rain.  The first store we went into we bought warm
jackets and hats.  It felt so good to have on warmer clothes for thou we had
brought jackets it was to cooled and wet for just what we had.  We spent some
time just shopping but buying very little.  This afternoon we drove north to
where we could view the elephant seals.  While there we visited with two park
rangers that explained that in the early 1900’s these seals were thought to be
almost extinct, then they found a small group of the elephant seals and through
preservation programs there are over 200,000 that live along the west coast from
Mexico to Alaska with 17,000 to 20,000 that resides on the west coast about 7
miles north of Hearst Castel.  Some of the large bull seals may weigh 3 ton
with the mother seals averaging 1,500 lb to 2,000 lb.  After giving birth to
one pup which weighs 7 to 8lb.  The female will lose 25 to 30 lb per day in
feeding the pup.  She will nurse the pup for 28 days at which time the pup will
average 300lb.  The female milk is about 65% milk fats or about like
Mayonnaise. At that time she will go into the water and head for Alaska to the
feeding grounds.  She will travel as far off the western coast as 2,000 miles
and very deep so as to avoid the Orca (killer whale), where as the males will
swim much closer to the western shore and only 6 to 8% of them will get past
the Orca and survive.  The pups will remain on the shore for about 3 weeks by
them self for they don’t know how to swim.  After 3 weeks they will begin to
venture into the water and will soon swim off to Alaska and then will return
next year to the same beach in which they were born.  Although it was raining
very hard while we were at the beach, we got some very good pictures and really
enjoyed learning about the seals.  We were there about an hour and all of us
were wet when we got into the car.  We came back to a Home Town Buffet and
ate.  I had Sister Shaw drive for about ½ hour while I took a nap.  I then took
over and drove on home.  It was about 8PM when we got home.  I got on the
computer and typed this entry.  Mae and I then took showers and went to bed.  <b>GREAT
DAY!</b></span></p>

that we could get to choir practice as we will be singing in our Ward
Conference next week.  We had time to prepare our nursery room.  I set the
tables for 16 because we don’t know who many will be in attendance this year. 
Being the first Sunday of course we had testimonies. They were very good and
Spiritual and we enjoyed that.  To our surprise we only had four children in
nursery.  Nathan’s father stayed in with him and then they left at one
o’clock.  Josh came and his mother stayed with him.  Also we had the twins.
Jonathon and Jeremiah and they were just as good as can be.  When nersury ended
Jeremiah didn’t want to leave with his sisters so he started to fuss, he didn’t
want to leave nursery.  We gave him his picture and told him to take it to his
mother so that settled him down.  It was really the best nursery we have had. 
It was raining hard as we left the church.  When we got home we used the
electric blanket and cuddled up on the bed and took a nap.  We had slept for a
while when Georgia called to wish Mae a late Happy Birthday.  I entered this
much of my journal and then we ate dinner.  I helped Mae do up the dishes.  Mae
got on the computer and worked on her “Project Life” while I watched the three
series of the MESSIAH.  We then played a game of Rummy in which Mae beat me by
quite a ways, so I challenged her to a game of “Knock” in which she won me four
hands in a row.  I finished this entry and we went to bed.  I played three
games of Solitary on the computer and lost all three.  Tonight is not my night
with games.</span></p>

at 9:30 and woke me at 10:30 for breakfast.  She had prepared waffles with
fruit and they were delicious.  After breakfast I helped wash the dishes.  I made
almond milk and almond butter this morning.  We took a walk going south through
the pistachio grove and back.  It is fun to walk together and visit.  When we
got back I repaired the toilet as the flush plug keeps leaking.  I then took a
nap in the recliner until dinner.  After dinner I worked on getting a copy of
the pictures that we had taken on our trip to the coast with the Shaw’s.  I had
just finished that when they came to have Family Home evening with us.  We do
have an enjoyable time when we are with them.  It is almost 10 PM now and about
time to go to bed.</span></p>

stood another day off!  It was hard getting up and going this morning.  Elder
Shaw and I worked on the home getting the stove set and started on the
dishwasher.  I needed some parts so Elder Shaw went to town for those.  While
he was gone I worked on some electrical outlets in the duplex.  Lee came and
asked if I would go with him to the Sherwood homes and remove some carpeting. 
We did that but also needed to remove tack strips and baseboard.  I hadn’t
brought tools for that so I had Lee call Elder Shaw and have him bring the
needed tools.  Lee then went back to other work and I stayed.  When Elder Shaw
got there we finished the job so that the tile layers could come and install
tile in both houses.  It was 4:30 PM when we finished and got back to the plant
so we locked up and I came home.  Mae, among many other things took some
Sisters and they went into the Senior citizens lunching.  She is also starting
to do deep cleaning of the house in preparation to us going home.   Mae had
dinner about ready when I got home.  I took a shower and shaved before we ate. 
After eating I took a nap.  I started a game of Chess and then saved it while
we read an article from the Ensign.  It was President Eyring’s from the
Priesthood session of General Conference.  It left me wondering if I am serving
properly on this mission.  I finished the game of chess and won.  Mae played a
game of solitary while I brushed my teeth.  I then finished this entry before
we went to bed.</span></p>

worked on installing the dishwasher.  As we needed some material we decided to
go to the Sherwood farm and get the set of stackable washer and dryer.  After
loading and securing it to the pickup we went to Home Depot.  It took us a
while but we found most everything we needed.  It was almost noon when we
returned to the home.  We now have power on the home and so we were able to
turn light on and use interior electrical outlets.  That is sure a help.  After
lunch we got the dishwasher installed except for the securing the washer to the
cabinet top and I had to go to Lee’s shop to cut a board for that.  The tile
company came this afternoon to install the tile baseboard.  We had to move the
refrigerator out for them to tile behind that.  It was after 4PM when we
cleaned up and locked things up.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got home so
I cleaned up and we ate as we watched a western movie.  Mae is still having a
lot of flam in her lungs and doesn’t seem to be getting over it.  She doesn’t
seem to be getting worse but it just isn’t clearing up.</span></p>

didn’t go back to sleep.  When the alarm went off I was still very tired.  I
thought that I might go home early and take a nap but we found too many things
that needed attention and just kept busy until after 4PM.  We lost some time as
today was the plants birthday celebration so that took an hour or more.  Mae
had the desert to furnish this month and then after that ended she went to
Wasco and took dinner to Shirley West as she has had foot surgery.  I was able
to get some almond flour that was extra.  It makes great almond milk.  I got
home before Mae did so I started dinner, roasted some almonds for and started a
chess game.  Mae finished up dinner when she got home.  I made a batch of
almond butter while she was preparing dinner.  We watched a series of J.A.G.
while we were eating dinner.  I helped Mae do the dishes.  I finished the chess
game and because of a dumb move I lost the game.  We read President Monson’s
talk from the General Priesthood Session of General Conference before going to

myself ready for work.  Mae didn’t sleep the best last night and she isn’t
feeling well.  She did have my lunch ready for me so all I had to do is get it
out of the fridge and put it in my lunch bag.  I heated some frozen waffles and
cooked me a couple of eggs.  Mae got up but I convinced her that she should
stay home and rest, not going to the school to help there.  I went to work and
Mae did go back to bed.  We added a kitchen light and hooked the washroom
ceiling fan up to the hallway ceiling fan so that both works off the same
switch.  Lee called and asked us to give him a hand at loading a stove, a
washer and a dryer and taking them to the house that Sarah will be moving into
tomorrow.  We needed some parts to hook up the dryer so I went to Floyd’s for
those parts.  It was after noon when we finished then after lunch we finished
hooking up the stackable washer and dryer and getting them into the Washroom. 
It was a very close fit but we made it.  We installed the new light fixture
into the kitchen and installed corbels on the counter top.  I came home and
found that Mae had stayed home and did take a nap and did slow down a little. 
She took the car in to have it serviced then she washed and vacuumed it.  That
way, the car is ready for the boys to take back home.  Scott and Jeff got away
about 3PM to bring the pickup to us.  They have called us a couple of times as
they travel.  That is one of the good things about having cell phones.  Mae and
I went shopping after I got home from work.  We met Bishop and Sister Brown in
Costco while there.  As we were driving to the restaurant Bryce call on Mae’s
phone.  He told Mae that Deanna’s sister --- had just pasted away after
undergoing treatment for cancer.   We then went to The Home Town restaurant to
eat and while there met Recardo and Candi Orozco there so invited them to join
us at our table.  We had a very enjoyable time visiting with them.  While we
talked the conversion story of Brother and Sister Orozco came up.  I found it
very interesting.  At a High Priest social several months ago they had told us
that he had met Candi while he was delivering supplies to a store where she
worked.  He said that he was impressed with her and wanted to get to know her
better.  One day as he was delivering supplies she was in the cooler where he
took the supplies.  He told her that he wasn’t going to let her out until she
kissed him.  She said that she was too cold to stay longer so gave him a kiss
and that started their romance.  A few years after their marriage they felt
that they needed religion in their home so they started going to various
church’s.  one day two Spanish speaking missionaries knocked on their door. 
Although he speaks Spanish he told them that his wife couldn’t and he wanted
her to hear what they are saying.  They said that they would have someone else
come and two days later two English speaking missionaries came.  He said (with
experience now) that they were both “Greenies”.  However the Spirit was there
and they felt it.  After the first discussion the missionaries ask if they
could return and they said yes.  When the missionaries ask when she said how
about tomorrow.  They continued the discussions on that kind of a schedule.
When the missionaries ask them if they would attend church they said they
would, however the next Sunday they had something come up and didn’t make it. 
The next Sunday they did attend and felt so good.  However their son told them
after meetings that they had to go to the store and buy dress clothes and
ties.  Candi said that no one had said anything to them about their dress. 
They had wore the best clothes they had but they weren’t what they now consider
dress for church.  There story was really interesting and it reminded me of
Tonie and Leah.  We were a couple of hours eating and then we left for home. 
on the way we listened to “The Brothers” on CD as we drove.  We are sure
enjoying that story and it really keeps you intrigued.  It is now 11:30PM and
the boys should get here sometime between 1 and 2AM.  I guess we will o to
sleep now.</span></p>

arrived here at 3AM.  They called us on the phone just as they arrived at our
house.  We of course got up to greet them and get them settled in bed.  We then
went back to bed also.  I woke early thinking about Bryce’s phone call.  Marcene
was a little older than were Mae and I and was already married before we moved
into the Mound Fort ward and met the Green family, so we really didn’t get to
know her.  Marcene and her husband did not remained active in the Church.  I
thought of Marge and Evan and them being there when Marcene passed through the
veil.  They would greet her with all the tenderness of loving parents.  Then I
thought that they also would be there to greet me when that time comes.  Marge
would have that beautiful smile that I know so well and Evan would have a
twinkle in his eye and a warm hand shake and just three words, you found out.  I
will have to say, yes I did.  I stayed in bed until 6:30AM before getting up and
found that Mae had gotten up and was asleep in the recliner.  I took the
opportunity to have my morning prayer and to read in the scriptures.  I then
got the lap top and worked on my journal.  Mae got up about 8AM but she had
been up from 3AM to 5AM before she went to sleep in the recliner.  Mae and I
made a nice breakfast for the boys of waffles and egg omelets.  I helped Mae
with the dishes and then we took the boys around the farm.  Mae then had a nice
dinner and after doing up the dishes the four of us went into Bakersfield
shopping for some speakers that Jeff wanted but really didn’t find what they
wanted.  After getting home we played some card games until the boys were tired
and went to bed.  I finished this entry while Mae straightened up the kitchen. 
We went to bed about 9:45PM.</span></p>

and Mae had breakfast ready.  After breakfast we help them finish packing ant
the left to return home about 6:45AM.  We have sure enjoyed having them even if
it was such a short time.  Mae and I then showered and got ready for Church.  After
setting up our class room for the nursery we joined the choir for practice. 
This is only the 2<sup>nd</sup> practice for this number and we will sing today
in our Ward Conference.  Practice went quite well.  Sacrament meeting went very
well, the musical number, which was a combination of pages 79 and 32 of the
Hymn Book, also went well.  Bishop Lee Brown, President Carter and President Slaughter
of the Stake Presidency spoke and gave very appropriate and inspiring talks. 
Our nursery went quite well although we had 9 children, our two assistance did
not come but Sister Slade stayed with Josh for a little while, Brother Pablo
stayed with his son Nathan and Peter Guyton stayed with the twins and he really
helps us with all the children.  We were tired by the time it ended and glad to
go home.  Mae’s back was hurting so she got on the Chee machine while I cooked
us some scrambled eggs and heated some freezer waffles.  After eating we lay back
in the recliners to take a short nap but it was 2 ½ hours later that we woke. 
We put on the DVD “Bells of St. Mary” and watched it.  We were interrupted by a
call from Sister Bonnie Slate.  She had told us, as we were leaving the church
that she had lost her wedding ring.  We didn’t remember seeing it in the
nursery room and she looked in some other places.  She left saying that she
wasn’t sure that she had it on when she came this morning.  She called to tell
us that they had found it at home.  She then visited with Mae for a few
minutes.  While we had the show stopped I wrote some of this entry.  We also
got us something to eat.  I also called the boys and they are at Provo and the
roads are good.  We watched the rest of the show and really enjoyed it. 
Neither of us remembered seeing the show before but we now want to own it. 
It’s now after 10PM so we got ready and went to bed.</span></p>

be painted so started on the west unit.  Mae didn’t have enough other things to
do so she cleaned and washed the pickup.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got
home.  After eating I showered and shaved and then took a 15 minute nap.  We
went over to the Shaw’s and held F.H.E. with them.  It was a very enjoyable
evening and we got home at 9:15PM.  Mae was fixing my lunch for tomorrow so I
played a game of chess.  I should have played something else for the computer
beat me.</span></p>

didn’t sleep very well the rest of the night.  I really hated to get up this
morning but finally made it.  Elder Shaw filled nail holes and caulked the base
board on the east apartment while I corrected the location of an electrical out
let, hung doors and trimmed out the windows in the west unit.  I quite at
3:30PM so I could get water, fill my truck with gas and get home early.  The
Elders are coming for dinner at 5PM we think.  They didn’t get here until
5:30PM as they were at an appointment that lasted longer than they had
expected.  Bob called while we were eating to let me know that Mark had passed
away.  They are not sure when he died but Barbara and Dean found him dead in
his bed.  They think it was from a heart attack.  Bob said that he would let us
know when he finds out any more.  After the Elders left I helped Mae do the
dishes.  Mae and I then watched the movie “Bells of St. Mary”.  Part way
through the show Mae called Camille Smith to let her and Bishop Smith know
about Mark.  Bob had already called them and Bishop Smith called Barbara and
Dean.  The story is a little different than what Bob had got.  The landlord is
the one that found Mark.  Mark had not come to her on the 5<sup>th</sup> to pay
his rent.  She went to his apartment and knocked a couple of days later but
there was no answer.  She left a note on his door so she went back and the note
was still where she had placed it.  She used her key and found him dead on the
carpet in the front room.  She called Marks son Steve who called Barbara and
Dean.  They are the ones that called Bob to let him know.  I feel sorry and sad
for him.  I will need to get a hold of Steve to let him know about the guns
Mark has buried in Bob’s back yard.  Well it is now 10PM so we had better go to
bed.</span></p>

trimming the duplex and preparing to paint.  Shortly after 2PM electrical power
went off all over the area.  We finial put tools away and prepared to go home
when at 3:30 PM the power returned.  We finished locking up and went home.  I
stopped on the way home and picked grape fruit and oranges from the trees at
the Kimberlina homes.  After getting home I showered and shaved while Mae
finished preparing dinner.  We watched the last half of “The Bells of St.
Mary’s” as we ate.  Mae called and visited with Sandi.  While Mae was visiting
with Sandi I capsulated more Phyt. Aloe.  I then put one of our series of
J.A.G. on and watched it.  Mae then got on the computer and worked on her
journal.  I lay on the Chee machine.  I then typed this entry and we got ready

was cold and foggy this morning.  I think it is the cold and humidity that is
giving me quite a lot of pain in my joints and bonds.  I hurt quite a bit today
and had to take some Aleve to help out.  I did get the west unit trimmed out
and with Elder Shaw’s help we were able to get the primer coat of paint on all
the doors.  It worked well to use a semi trailer to stand the doors in to let
them dry.  Before quitting work today we cleaned out the west unit and stored
all the tools into the tool trailer.  Mae was Visiting Teaching this afternoon
and I got home before she did.  She gave me a hair cut this evening.  I made a
batch of almond butter before I took a shower.  After dinner we watched a
J.A.G. series.  I then filled out this journal entry and while I was at the
computer Mae read an article from “Mormon Times”.  I moved over to a recliner
as Mae started to read a message from President Monson but I soon fell asleep. 
After finishing the article Mae got ready for bed and then woke me enough to
get me to bed.</span></p>

she would wake me so she went into the other bedroom and slept there.  I really
didn’t feel like going to work today but did make it a few minutes late.  I was

see if everything was ok with the Shaw’s so I knocked on their door.  Everything
was ok; they had just been talking to one of their daughters on the phone.  We
worked on building the shelving for the clothes closets for the duplex.  We
worked until after 1PM and then quite so that we could go to the Temple. The
Shaw’s picked us up about 2:30PM and we road with them to the Temple.  As we
got close to L.A. we found a Denney’s and had dinner.  I paid for the dinner to
make up for them driving.  This evening we did Sealings session.  Bishop and
Sister Brown had already arrived at the Temple ahead of us.  Brother Ricardo
and Sister Candi Orozoco also arrived at the Temple about the same time we got
there.  It was a very enjoyable evening being with the other couples at the
Temple and participating as proxies in ceremony for those that have now passed
into the newt life.  It was about 11:30PM when we got home.  Sister Shaw drove
home so Mae set in the front with her so they could visit.  Elder Shaw and I
set in the back seat and slept most of the way home.</span></p>

back in bed for a few minutes when we decided that we needed to get up so we
could get to the Primary’s brunch for all primary workers.  On the way over to
the brunch we called David and visited with him.  The meeting was good and we
enjoyed the brunch although there was a lot that we couldn’t eat.  After the
meeting Mae and I went to the Shafter Railroad museum.  The Guyton’s soon came
to the museum to tour it with us.  We found it to be a very enjoyable tour. 
From there we went to the Insect Lore Bugseum and enjoyed that tour also.  After
the visit to the bug museum we parted with the Guyton’s.  Mae and I stopped at
a Sub-Way and bought a sandwich for lunch as it was now after 3PM.  We came on
home and I thought about taking a nap.  Mae suggested that she go would for a
walk while I took a nap.  I decided I would go walking with her and then we
would see about the nap.  We enjoyed walking together and visiting while we
walked.  I sure love being with that girl!  When we got home I did take a nap. 
We ate some leftovers and watched a J.A.G. series.  Mae worked on her lesson
for nursery tomorrow and I added to this entry.  I also played a game of chess
and the computer won again.  We showered and soon went to bed.  </span></p>

was unable to go back to sleep.  I read my scriptures, said prayers and played
some games on the computer.  Mae woke at 6:30.  After breakfast I took a few
minutes nap before getting dressed for church.  We attended choir practice
although we are not sure if we will be singing on a program again before we
leave.  Sister Guyton spoke during the Sacrament program.  This was the first
time that she has spoke in Sacrament meeting and she did a pretty good job.  We
only had seven children in nursery and one little girl who was there for the
first time became scarred and wet her pants so had to be taken out.  We had
Brenda, our assistant, with us but it seemed like we were very busy.  We were
tired by the time it finished and ready to come home.  After some lunch we both
lay down in recliners and took a nap.  As we were driving home from church, Mae
called Uncle Van.  They were not home so she just left them a message to see if
we might sleep at their place on the 19<sup>th</sup> of February as we return
home.  Uncle Van returned her call at 3:30PM to let us know that they would be
happy for us to stay the night with them.  I played a game of chess with the computer
and it again beat me.  I worked on my personal history, stopping long enough
for dinner and then helped Mae with the Dishes.  I went back to work and wrote
more on my history.  I called and talked to Mike for a while.  I asked him if
he thought it might be possible to get a family picture taken after Sacrament
meeting, but it looks like it might be quite awkward to arrange for it because
of the number of people that they are expecting to be there.  It is now 9:30PM
so we had better go to bed.  It was another hour getting to bed and then Mae
couldn’t sleep.</span></p>

for paint.  After lunch we put the finish coat of paint on the doors.  After
cleaning up the paint pump I took my pickup into have it serviced.  I got home
just after 4PM.  I shaved and showered while Mae finished preparing dinner. 
After dinner I started this journal entry and then took a short nap.  Elder and
Sister Shaw came for F.H.E. and we had a very enjoyable evening.  Mae lead a
very good discussion on Charity and then after we had refreshments and played
Knock.  We made some plans for the four of us to go to San Diego possibly the 3<sup>rd</sup>
4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> of February.  It was 9:30PM before the Shaw’s

the other bedroom.  I tried to get her to go back to sleep but she got me off
to work.  Today we finished spraying painting the duplex and are ready to paint
the trim.  We moved the doors that we had painted the other day and found that
three doors had runs in them so we sanded them down and repainted them.  This
evening we had the Young Elders over for dinner.  They are always enjoyable to
visit with.  As usual Mae had a very nice dinner.  I helped with the dishes
after the Elders left.  I finished a chess game I started last night and it
ended up with me having a king and a knight and the computer had a king and a
rook.  The computer won!  I then read President Boyd K. Packer’s talk form last
General Conference titled “Cleansing the Inner Vessel”.  Mae and I talked about
it and though about Kim and Jeanenne’s situation with their son and also
thought about the heartache we have with our two sons’.  Mae has been
assembling all the materials she has saved from all the lessons she has
prepared for the nursery for the past year.  She has quite a book full.</span></p>

really heavy this morning and it lasted until noon.  We just got start painting
when Lee came and ask us to help him bring the cabinet over.  We stored them in
the semi-trailer.  We found that the one door that we had to repaint still
didn’t turn out so we will have to strip it down and start over.  I think it is
this cold damp weather.  We restarted painting the trim and found that it was
too cold and the paint wouldn’t run smooth.  We quit and cleaned up the duplex
and will let the plumbers, tile layers, carpet layers, A/C and electricians do
their finish.  That will let us have heat in the buildings to finish the
painting.  We went out to the Sherwood homes and made a list of items needed to
get those two houses ready for rent.  The one house is in pretty good shape but
the other house is in bad shape.  I got home about 4:30PM.  Mae had dinner in
preparation but I had time to shave and shower before we ate dinner.  After
dinner I started helping Mae with the dishes but Mae felt that I should call
and talk to Mike and relax.  We did enjoy visiting with Mike for a few
minutes.  I put on the DVD by Richard L. Bushman, “Life and Times of Joseph
Smith”.  We met Brother Bushman at the L.A. Temple last Friday when we did
Sealings.  He was the sealer that we worked with.  He seems to be a great
historian and writer.  I would like to read his book “Joseph Smith: Rough Stone
Rolling”.  I finished this entry and we did some preparation for going to Roy

Linda.  They were not home so I just left a message on their answering service,
telling them that I had a cold and so we decided that we had better not come to
their place this week end.  Elder Shaw and I called it a day at 3 PM.  I
stopped at the dry cleaners in Wasco and got my suit.  As I started for home I
felt that I had better call Roy and Linda to see if they had gotten my
message.  They hadn’t but Linda said that they would like us to come anyway.  I
called Mae and she said that she had put things away but would again get them
out.  When I got home I showered and shaved.  Mae had things ready when I

and broke them into sections and fed them to me.  I liked that.  We enjoyed the
rest of the day just being lazy, visiting, eating, taking a nap and playing Uno
before going home.  We were going to watch “The Bishops Wife” on VHS but again
they could not get their TV system to play a VHS.  Julianna’s husband Phil came
over to see if he could figure out the problem, but was unable to.  I also
picked a box of their oranges to take home with us with us.  In visiting with
Roy we discussed the age of parents and grandparents and when they died. Before
we left, Roy commented that he felt a little scarred to think of his own age
now.  We left their place about 6PM, stopping on the way home at a Sub-Way for
something to eat.  When we got back onto the freeway it was very thick fog.  I
would follow the fastest driver that I could, keeping a safe distant behind him
but keeping view of his tail lights.  We got home about 8:30PM and unpacked.  I
caught my journal up as I hadn’t taken my computer with us.  We were tired and
soon went to bed.  </span></p>

couple of times during the night and slept in the recliner the last part of the
night.  Mae got up at 6:30AM but let me sleep until 7AM.  We ate breakfast
before we got ready for Church.  The fog was very heavy as we traveled to our
church house.  Meetings went well.  We only had 7 total children but had some
of them come in and out during the two hour class.  After church we visit with
Elder Bills and Elder Islas as Elder Bills will probably be transferred this
next week.  After that visit, some pictures and a good by we went out to the
truck we ate some lunch.  We then went to Manuel Macias home and visit with
Manuel and his roommate Camella Leyva.  After visiting for several minutes we
concluded with singing two Hymns, “Oh My Father” and “God so Loved His Son”. 
We then had a closing prayer and left them.  We started to go home but Mae
asked if we could visit Sister West.  We visited Brother and Sister West for
well over an hour.  After getting home I called and visited with David while
Mae called Scott.  It was enjoyable to visit with both of them.  We then ate
some dinner and then I helped Mae do the dishes.  I worked on this entry while
Mae worked on some primary material while we listened to the DVD of the series
“The Brothers” for a while.  I played the last of a chess game with the
computer and was finally able to cause a draw on the game.  We continued to
listen to the story on DVD until we had came to the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
disk so we decided that we had better go to bed.</span></p>

worked on the Sherwood homes today and still have quite a lot to do between the
two homes there.  I got home at 5PM and Mae had dinner ready after I shaved and
showered.  Mae is talking to Jeff and his children so I am writing this part of
my journal.  We ate dinner in front of the TV as we watched “The Guns of

getting the west house finished except for sealing about ½ of the tile floor. 
Mae went to the Carrington Nursing home today and helped out there.  We had
Elder Bills and Elder Manning at our place for dinner this evening.  I made
almond butter and almond milk this evening plus I washed the dishes for Mae

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                It was very foggy
this morning and stayed most of the day.  Elder Shaw and I worked on the
Sherwood homes this morning.  I felt that we needed to remove the old sheetrock
mud from the cracked areas.  After scraping a small area I told Elder Shaw that
I thought that we could do it using his small router.  Elder Shaw didn’t think
that would be necessary to clean out the cracks and he didn’t think I could do
it with the router.  I cleaned the first crack with a 1 ½ inch chisel and it
took me over an hour time besides a lot of work.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> crack I
used the router and did it in about 15 minutes with more dust but a lot less
work.  It did upset me to have Elder Shaw question me.  This afternoon we went
into the plant and started assembling a tin shed by the well to house the
chlorine supply.  This is at the demands of the State.  The kit was
manufactured in China and is more like a Chinese puzzle.  One part was
assembled backwards so I started to reassemble it.  Elder Shaw again questioned
me as to my ability to modify it and thought we could just install it upside
down and get it to work.  Again that upset me.  Without his help I disassembled
the lock and reassembled it correctly and it worked great.  We didn’t get very
far with the project as we spent a lot of time trying to determine the plans
and part numbers.  When I got home I thanked Mae for the note in my lunch box
and one of the cookies that she had given me.  I asked Mae about the receipt
and she said that she couldn’t do it because our blender is not like Sister
Shaw’s.  I said that I thought we could and when Mae questioned me I spoke
cross to the.   I then had to apologize to her and told her about Elder Shaw’s
questioning me.  He had already set me on edge.  Mae told me that maybe I
should be a little more humble.  Maybe so!  Mae had a nice dinner of baked
sweet potatoes, fried fish and spaghetti squash.  It was all very delicious. 
This evening we spent most of the time planning on a trip to San Diego.  I
filled out my journal, played a game of Solitary before we went to bed.  </span></p>

the windows for blinds.  I came home getting there about 4PM.  Mae had me take
a nap and that sure felt good.  After dinner I shaved and showered and then we
watched a DVD.  The show was “The War Wagon” with John Wayne and Kirk Douglas. 
Although we have seen it several times it is still a good movie.  While we were
watching the show Brother Martinez, the Ward Executive Secretary came and said
that Bishop Brown would like me to speak in Sacrament meeting on the 13<sup>th</sup>
of February.  Mae started chuckling about me having to speak, so I told her
that she had to speak also.  Brother Martinez spoke up and said, “Yes!  Bishop
Brown wants both of you to speak and our topic to speak on is Continued
Courtship after Marriage”.  After Brother Martinez left we watched the
remainder of the show.  I then worked on my journal before we got ready for

L.A.  We road to L.A. with the Shaw’s and will stay at the Temple housing this
evening.  We stopped at a Sizzler and ate dinner just before getting to L.A. 
We got our apartment and went to the Temple getting there in time to attend the
Stake Temple meeting in the chapel.  Elder Shaw wasn’t feeling the best so they
didn’t go through the temple session with us.  It was a good thing for them as
we didn’t get out to the Temple and to the apartment until almost mid-night. 
We did really enjoy the session and was impressed with the number of members

8:30AM and just enjoyed it.  The Shaw’s went to a Temple session this morning. 
After we ate breakfast we went to the Temple and did initiatory ordnances.  I
tried to memorize the wording of the ordnances because I have a feeling that we
may soon be called to work in the Temple when we get home.  It is a beautiful
day today with the sky clear and the sun shining.  As we left the Temple we met
a Brother Brown coming to the Temple.  He told me that the most beautiful sight
I would see would be to see my wife in the temple.  I asked him about his
wife.  He told me that he was 96 years old.  He had been married to his 1<sup>st</sup>
wife for 44 years when she died.  His 2<sup>nd</sup> wife he had lived with her
18 years when she died and he has now lived with his 3<sup>rd</sup> wife 7
years and she is in the hospital now.  I asked him if when he was a young man
if he ever even thought that he would live that long.  He said he would never
have even thought about that.  I told him that he has had lots of good
experiences and that is why he is now <u>Brown</u> and we are still <u>Browning</u>. 
To that he laughed and wished a good day and we parted.  After finishing at the
Temple we went to the Visitor’s Center for a few minutes.  We then went back to
the apartment and packed our things.  We net the Shaw’s and were soon on our
way home.  We stopped at a Home Town Buffet for lunch and then came on home.  I
slept most of the way home.  Mae told me that as we came down the Grape Vine it
suddenly looked as though we were coming into the smoke of a forest fire.  It
was just the smog that has the Central Valley closed in.  Not only did the sun
disappear but the tempter dropped 23 degrees.  We got home just a little before
5PM.  I saw that Bob had tried to call three times so I returned his call.  He
had just wanted to talk.  We attended the Saturday Evening Stake Conference
meeting and really enjoyed the Spirit and the messages given by our Stake
Presidency.  We had stopped at Lasson’s on the way to conference to pick-up a
few items.  It doesn’t take many things before you have quite a bill.  After
returning home we decided that just some fruit and toast would be enough for
this evening.  We ate that as we watched another of the J.A.G. series.  We do
enjoy that series.  It was late when we got to bed but it has been a wonderful
day.</span></p>

felt bad when I realized that it was almost time to get up.  It has been cold
in the house and the furnace went on often during the night.  Mae went into the
wash room and noticed that the outside door was open a few inches.  We guess
that it must have been slightly a gar since Friday evening.  Today our Ward and
the Delano Ward attended Stake Conference each in our own Chapels.  This was
done as our Stake has out grown our Stake building.  I believe that 58 Stake
Conference in Northern California were held today and were presided over by
President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency from the Salt Lake Conference
Center in Salt Lake City and brought into the assigned buildings by closed
satellite network.  At 10 AM each conference building was presided over by
local Stake officers and then at 10:15 AM the closed satellite network
broadcasted the program from S.L.C. Utah.  That portion of the meeting was
conducted by President Ronald A. Rusband, President of the Seventy.  He spoke,
follow by the General Primary President and she was followed by President Boyd K.
Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, with the final Speaker being
President Eyring.  It was a great conference.  Our ward held a Linger Longer
following the conference but we didn’t stay as there was nothing that I could
eat because of my special diet.  We came home and then after eating lunch I lay
down in the recliner and took a nap.  Mae got on the computer and worked on her
talk for the 13<sup>th</sup> of February.  After I woke I helped Mae set up
tabled for dinner this evening and then I worked on my journal and my talk.  Brother
Jay Payne came at 6:30PM and the four Elders came shortly after that.  Mae had
a nice dinner already and we enjoyed the time with the Elder’s.  Jay will be
leaving on a business trip in the morning so he left soon after the Elders. 
Sandy called and we visit with her and that was very enjoyable.  I helped Mae
do up the dishes and clean up.  Scott called and we visited with them for a
while.  It was after 10PM when I finished this entry and we got ready for bed.</span></p>

up.  Mae was soon up also.  We are still debating on whether we should go to
San Diego or not.  Elder Shaw and I worked on the Sherwood home.  I thought
that we would get started painting doors but instead we spent much of the day
installing a new kitchen sink and changing the plumbing to it.  It was 4:30PM
before we left the house and then I took elder Shaw hoe as his truck is in for
repairs from the damage that was done to it Friday when the shop borrowed it to
haul pipes with it.  It seems that the load was not tied on the rack properly
and when they stepped on the breaks the pipes slid of the front of the rack and
landed on the hood.  I got home just after 5pm and Mae told me that we were to
go back to Shaw’s for F.H.E. and dinner.  Sister Shaw had a nice chicken salad
with all the trimmings.  We then watched the movie “The Ultimate Gift” with
James Garner.  Although we have seen it before it was worth watching again.  It
is a very good show.  We have decided to go to San Diego and the Shaw’s want to
go with us.  We will go in their pickup so will miss the train ride.  It is
