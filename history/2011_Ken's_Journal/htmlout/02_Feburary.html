figure out a footing for a tower that Lee has to provide for the plants secure
internet stations.  Lee told Elder Shaw what the requirements for the footing
and he wants our help to figure out how to meet the requirements.  I don’t know
how long I had been working on the details in my sleep but I woke very
excused.  There has to be something different in the plans or I under stood the
information that Lee gave elder Shaw and I for the way I understood it, it
would be impossible to form and pour a concrete footing to those
specifications.  Elder Shaw and I worked on the Sherwood homes getting the
Kills Primer sprayed on the doors.  We are now ready to spray on the finish
coat.  We also started prepping the house so that we can texture the areas that
I repair the drywall.  The east home is in pretty bad shape but we will get
it.  I was sure tired when I got home.  I shaved and showered and then we ate
dinner.  Mae had a wonderful dinner ready.  We also watched two J.A.G. series this
evening plus I got a short nap in.  I opened five pomegranates for Mae so that
we could freeze the fruit.  There were two pomegranates that had spoiled but we
feel that we still got them at a good price.  I filled out a financial report
for the plant and will turn it in tomorrow.  Jeff called this evening to tell
us that the division of Honeywell that he works for has been bought by a man
from New Zealand for the price of 1 billion dollars cash.  Jeff is not sure
what changes that will mean for him.  It is going on 10PM so we had better get
to bed.</span></p>

morning with my sweet wife preparing breakfast for me.  She finished packing my
lunch and saw me off to work.  Elder Shaw and I worked on the Sherwood East home
getting the doors painted and then texturing the walls and ceiling where I had
repaired damages.  It was after noon when we got things put away and went into
the office to help Lee move the cabinets into the East Duplex.  We then went
over to the Kimberlina homes and moved furniture from one unit to another
unit.  I also replaced the insides to the toilet tank.  It was almost 5PM when
I got home this evening and I was very tired.  Mae soon had dinner ready.  We
ate as we watched a couple of J.A.G. series while eating.  Mae then gave me a
hair cut before I shaved and showered.  Mae was talking to Georgia while I
showered.  I then worked on my life history while waiting for Mae to Shower. 
We soon went to bed after that.</span></p>

the alarm went off at 6AM.  I would like to have shut it off and gone back to
sleep.  Mae got me going and then prepared breakfast.  I met Lee at the
Kimberlina homes and we moved more things from the center house to the east
house.  We also cleaned up the garage and hauled away some cardboard boxes.  I
then went out to the Sherwood homes and brought back the front door to the
duplex so that we could install it.  Mae met me at the plant and we went into
Merrill’s office and visited with him.  He expressed his apparition for what we
had done while we were here at the south Valley Farm.  It has been good being
here.  Elder Shaw and I worked on the duplex most of the day getting the island
cabinet set and started hanging the bi-fold doors.  We stopped at 2PM for the
plant calibration for Februarys Birthday remembrances.  This evening we
attended the Ward Valentine dinner and dance.  There was a fair turn out and we
had a good time.  It was about 9PM when we got home.  I entered this entry and
we then went to bed.</span></p>

best last night so I let her sleep in a little longer.  I would have let her
sleep until she woke up but I know that she had school to help with and she
would go to that even if she didn’t feel good.  Elder Shaw and I worked on the
east duplex getting the cabinets set and the doors hung on the laundry room. 
On the way home I stopped at the Kimberlina homes and picked grapefruit from
the tree in front of Pains home.  After Mae finished at the Redwood Elementary
school she went Visiting Teaching.  I got home about 4:30PM and being alone I
roasted almonds and made two batches of almond butter.  I do not understand why
but I used the same recipe for both batches but to the second batch I had to
use much more olive oil to get the same texture.  I have noticed that some
batches take more or less oil but I thought it was a difference in the variety
of almonds but this time the almonds were the same variety and even came out of
the same sack.  I don’t understand the difference.  Mae came home after 6PM and
she had stopped and bought some Mexican Food for us to eat this evening.  We
watched the movie “The Man Called Peter” on DVD.  We have seen this show several
years ago but enjoyed it again, just as much as before.  I took the two batches
of almond butter and mixed them together to get an even consistency and put it
into bottles.  I took my shower and we went to bed.  Mae filled out Valentine
for our Grand-children while I showered.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I woke at 4:45AM and
didn’t want to disturb Mae so I lay in the recliner.  I dosed off and on until
6AM when workers started getting equipment out to the yard to work in the orchards
today.  Mae woke a short time later and had me come back to bed.  It was late
when we got up.  We had a wonderful breakfast of waffles and scrambled eggs. 
We worked together preparing it and then again cleaning up and doing the
dishes.  It is good to relax and be with Mae!  I worked on my talk for next
Sunday.  Mae visited with David, Shauna and each of the children.  We had a
knock at the door so I went to it.  It was two gentlemen from the Jehovah
Witness so I stepped out the door and visited with them for a few minutes. 
After lunch I took a nap.  Mae has been busy getting things cleaned and in
order for us to pack to go home.  At 4:30PM we went over to Merrill and Kellie
Dibble’s home in Bakersfield for dinner.  We were happy and surprised to have Bishop
Spencer and Michelle Birch and their family there also.  The Birches are back
for a couple of weeks but Spencer will leave in a couple of days to go back to
Argentina.  They are still waiting for visas to go through before the family
can go there.  We had a nice evening visiting and eating.  We did not know that
the Shaw’s were invited also but Merrill finally called and they hadn’t got the
message.  We stopped at the grocery store for some eggs, two cups of yogurt and
some whipped topping.  We were in and out of the store for just over five
dollars.  Who! That doesn’t happen very often.  After getting home I entered
the last of this journal entry.  We lessoned to 3 or 4 chapters of “The Second
Sun” before shutting the CD player off and going to bed.</span></p>

until 6:30AM, then showered and shaved and got ready for church.  We got to the
church house at 9AM and got our nursery room ready before going into the chapel
for choir practice.  The Sacrament meeting was very good and the testimony’s
very appropriate and spiritual.  In the nursery we had 15 children, one
assistant and sometimes 1 or more parents but it was very busy.  The first 15
minutes or so I held little Brooklyn Allred on my shoulder trying to get her to
stop crying.  She finally did and was good the rest of the time.  It was
challenging but we made it through the 2 hours.  When we got home we were very
tired.  Mae had invited the missionaries over for dinner this evening against
my wishes.  She hadn’t planned on doing it but things just worked out that
way.  I wish that I had been more understanding with her.  We took a nap
although Mae only lay down for maybe a ½ hour and I slept for over an hour when
I heard Mae working in the kitchen.  I got up and gave her a hand with what I
could do in the preparations of dinner.  I worked for a while on my talk.  So
far I don’t feel a good direction with what I am writing down.  Bishop Spencer
Birch had told me a story of a young man in Argentina so I called him and asked
for some details about it.  I had just got off the phone with him when the
Elders came.  We had a lovely dinner and enjoyed the visit, the Gospel
discussion and the Spiritual time we had together.  I did a little more on my
talk but we put on the last CD of the book “The Second Son” of the series by
Chris Stewart “The Great and Terrible” and lessoned to that.  It is now almost
10:30PM so we went to bed.</span></p>

for breakfast.  Elder Shaw and I first changed the filters on the AC units on
the plant office.  We then went out to the Sherwood homes and worked out there
until 3PM.  We came back to Elder Shaw’s trailer and I tried to help Sister
Shaw with Adobe Photo Shop but it is a newer version than ours and it is not
the same at all.  I come home and showered and shaved and we left to go to
Lee’s home.  Lee and Kim took the Shaw’s and Mae and I out to eat at the Red
Lobster in Bakersfield as a going home diner for Mae and I.  We had a wonderful
evening being together.  It was after 9PM when we got home.  Mae worked on the
computer for a few minutes and then I got on it and entered this journal

6:20AM and then got up.  Mae prepared a nice breakfast as normal.  I picked up
elder Shaw and we drove to Tulare which is about 45 miles north on Hwy 99 and went
to the World AG Expo 2011.  We spent about 4 ½ hours walking through the
exhibits.  As Elder Shaw said after that time “We have seen so much I am not
shore if we are seeing new exhibits or just seeing what we have already seen.” 
We left and found a Sub-Way where we ate for much less than we could have at
the fair, and then headed for home.  The farm equipment was very impressive and
interesting as to the new development but I was disturbed that most of the
implement displays were from countries outside the United States.  I couldn’t
help asking, what has happened to the U.S. building our own equipment?  The
other thing that I missed was not having Mae with me.  It would have been much
more enjoyable had she been with me.   We stopped at Home Depot in Delano for a
few supplies and then came on home.  I took a nap for a ½ hour.  I had received
an email from my cousin Gennie Griggs and so I replied back.  Mae prepared
dinner and as we ate a truck drove into the equipment yard.  It was a load of
bee haves so I took the camera out and took a picture of it.  I talked to the
bee keeper and he is from Soda Springs, Idaho.  I asked him if he know the
owners of Trail Creek Lodge and he said that he was their Home Teacher.  We
visited for a few minutes and he told me that he and his father had been
bringing bees to South Valley Farm for 20 years.  Mae got on the computer and
found reservations for a Motel 8 in San Diego for the Shaw’s and us for the
next three nights.  The Shaw’s son hadn’t confirmed reservations for us in time
to get them for this week.  That is ok for Mae’s reservations are much cheaper
anyway; just hoping the motel is a good one.  We watched two series of J.A.G.
this evening.  It is now 9:25PM so we had better get to bed.</span></p>

and found a note from Mae that got to sleep until after 12:30AM so I let her
sleep later.  Elder Shaw and I worked at the Sherwood home masking for paint. 
We worked until 12:30PM and then quite for the day.  Elder &amp; Sister Shaw picked
us up about 2:30PM and we left for San Diego.  Elder Shaw drove and that was
fine with me.  We stopped at Maria Calendars for dinner towards the south end
of L.A.  Although I guess there are many sub-cities it all seemed like one
continues city to me.  There are free-ways and over-passes everywhere.  Boy! I
sure wouldn’t want to live here or as far as I am concerned I don’t want to
live in California.  When we got to San Diego we went to the Shaw’s son’s home
on the Navy base.  There we met their son and their three grandchildren.  Their
son had purchased tickets at the base and saved us quite a bit on money that
way.  We found our Motel and checked in.  The rooms are small but quite nice
especially for the price of $119.00 for three nights.  </span></p>

although the electrical out let that I plugged my CPAP into shut off after
there was no movement in the room so I woke having difficulty breathing.  I
slept most of the night without it.  We had a wonderful day today visiting Sea
World.  It was fun being with the Shaw’s and they having been here before
helped us to see some of the high lights.  The grounds alone were beautiful and
we enjoyed the animals.  We took the “Wild Arctic” ride twice, the “Shipwreck
Rapids” the “Bayside Skyride” , the “Journey to Atlantis” rides and saw the
shows, “Sea Lion and Otter”, “Dolphin” and “Shamu”, plus “Flamingo Cove”, “Shark
Encounter”, “Penguin Encounter”, “Turtles”; in other words we saw almost every
show, exhibit and rides for adults in Sea World.  We were tired but we then
rode up to the San Diego LDS Temple and out to eat at Home Town Buffet.  When
we got back to the motel we invited the Shaw’s to our room where we watched
“The Grass is Greener” with Cary Grant and Deborah Carr,   Mae and I showered
before going to bed very tired.</span></p>

and it was 1:30PM before we got off.  We bought tickets for “The Seal Tour”
before eating lunch.  We just had time to walk to the tour.  That was a Sea
&amp; Land Adventure tour in a water and land vessel.  When we returned for
that we went on the tours of the “The Star of India”, a Pirate ship, a Russian
sub-marine and the U.S. sub-marine -----.  We then went out to eat at “Antonio’s

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                We woke earlier this
morning and got things packed up.  After leaving the motel we went to Old Town
San Diego and went to the Mormon Battalion Museum.  This museum has just been
reopened this year, after it was completely rebuilt.  It is a beautiful museum
depicting the battalion leaving Winter Quarters (I believe) and traveling to a
Mexican settlement of San Diego.  It is very well presented and very
enjoyable.  After our visit there we walked through shopping areas of Old Town.
 We ate lunch at Café Coyote and then Elder Shaw and I walked to the truck and
rested while Mae and Sister Shaw did a little more shopping.  We drove form Old
town to the San Diego L.D.S. Temple and though it is still closed for some
repairs we walked around the grounds and took some pictures.  Sister Shaw had
some CD that we lessoned to as we traveled that were sure enjoyable.  We
stopped at Home Town Buffet before going over the pass from Los Angeles.  I
slept for a while after that.  We got home about 9PM.  It has been a fun and
very enjoyable trip.  I wrote in my journal and worked on my talk for
tomorrow.  </span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I got up before the
alarm, read my scriptures and worked on my talk.  We went to church in time to prepare
our class room and attend the choir practice although we will not be singing
with the choir after today.  Mae gave a wonderful talk, I had more materials
than I had time but I think the spirit guided me and it went fairly well.  I
hope it was encouraging to some in attendance.  The nursery class went well and
I think we had 14 children there today.  We were able to turn the materials
over to Sister Grant who will be taking our place.  We stopped by Manuel
Masias’s home and visit one last time with he and Camella.  I don’t know if we
have done much good there but at least they seem to have appreciated the
visit.  We went to the Ryan &amp; Bonnie Slade’s for a dinner appointment. 
Elder and Sister Shaw as well as Elder Bill’s and Elder Manning were also there. 
Sister Slade provided a very nice dinner.  While Mae visited I set on a couch
and fell asleep.  We went from there to Peter &amp; Tara Guyton’s where we had
dinner with their family.  It was 7:30PM before we got home.  I entered this
journal and played some games on the computer while Mae talked to Shellie’s
boys and then to Shellie.  Shellie told us that Garrett is going to purpose to Nora
tomorrow evening.  That is exciting news.  She also told her that she was
helping Roy in their attic and she fell through the ceiling, landing in their
bathroom.  Luckily she was not seriously hurt.  I have been copying some of the
pictures taken of Wasco Ward activities on to a CD so that we can leave copies
of the pictures that we have taken with Sister Payne.  I also copied my
journals onto a CD so that we have a back-up copy.  It is now after 10PM so we
had better go to bed.</span></p>

early and then went back and cuddled for a few minutes but still would like to
have stayed and slept longer.  I think the vacation and busy Sunday wore us
out.  Elder Shaw and I drove out to the Paramount processing plant and brought
back two pallets of Pistachios to the plant.  When we got back to the plant
Travis Jones told me that he had two boxes of almonds for me.  I also bought a
box of the Pistachios plus Mike gave me four sacks of Pistachios for Elder Shaw
and I going out to get them.  The 100 lb of almonds and the box of 16
pistachios cost me $160.00 so that is quite reasonable.  Elder Shaw and I then
went out to Sherwood and worked on masking the east house for painting.  We
just about have it ready to paint.  I came home and showered and shaved.  At
6PM Mae and I went to Sister Louise Hyer,s for a dinner appointment.  Elder and
Sister Shaw and Bishop and Sister Brown also were invited.  We had a very
enjoyable evening, getting home after 9PM.  I filled out this entry and we went
to bed.</span></p>

best last night and I woke at 4:15AM and in order to go to sleep I took some
asburns and did go to sleep.  Mae realized that I hadn’t slept so she let me
sleep until 6:30AM.  I had to hurry but I was glad for the extra time.  Elder
Shaw and I were able to get the primer coat of paint on the west Sherwood
home.  I was sure tired when I finished so we cleaned up and went home.  Mae
got the truck serviced so that it is ready for the trip home.  She has also
been busy getting things packed.  We relaxed and watched a J.A.G. series while
eating dinner.  After the show I helped Mae do the dishes and then I shaved and
took a shower.  I called Shellie and told her what Brother Kenneth Haywood had
told me about the instructions the Sealer were given.  I just wanted to have
her aware of the changes before they got to the Temple.  Garret and Nora are
officially engaged as of last night.  We sure join the family about being
excited to have Nora join our family.  Georgia called and visited with Mae for
a few minutes and while they visited I got a couple of things packed.  We then
watched a second J.A.G. movie.  While I finished this entry Mae continued to
pack.  She doesn’t stop much!!! </span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                Besides getting up at
6AM, which just gives me time to leave for work at 7AM, I also spent extra time
down loading Mae’s write up on the farm so that it can be inserted into the
farm journal that Mae and Sister Shaw have been working on.  Sister Shaw will
have to finish the scrap book after we leave.  Elder Shaw and I painted the
finish coat of paint in the Sherwood home.  We then removed all masking and
floor protective coverings.  There were several areas that the masking tape did
not hold and paint spray went through and was on the flooring.  I spent almost
3 hours on my knees scrubbing paint off.  I was again very happy that I had my
knee pads.  <u>Mae called me to tell me that Chelci gave birth to a 8LB 1 OZ 20
½ inch long girl, born 2:30 AM today.  They named her Addison Mae and will call
her Addie Mae.</u>  We finished about 3:30PM so I stopped at the plant and
filled my pickup with fuel.  I also stopped at the Kimberlina housing and
picked some grape fruit and there are many left.  Mae had dinner ready shortly
after I got home.  We watched a J.A.G. series while we ate.  We then worked
together packing.  I got a lot packed into the pickup and it made it so Mae can
have room to finish the packing.  Mae was also able to find us a motel in Las
Vegas for Friday night.  We therefore will leave shortly after the dinner at
the plant and start for home.  We want to stop by Brenda Romas’s and tell her
good bye.  She has been a great assistant in the nursery and we want her to
know that we appreciated her.  At 8PM we stopped and watched another series
before going to bed.</span></p>

I worked on the Sherwood home finishing the painting and putting fixtures up.  I
installed two toilets, a bathroom vanity light and a medicine cabinet.  The one
toilet I had to remove the tie down pipe and install a new one as the other was
installed wrong.  I cleaned out my truck but put back some tools for tomorrows
work.  I was going to wash the pickup but the washer was turned off and the
shop was locked up.  When I got home I finished packing the pickup.  Mae has
worked all day cleaning and packing.  We had time to shave and shower and get
ready before the Shaw’s arrived to take us out to dinner.  We went to the Home
Town Buffet in Bakersfield.  It was a wonderful treat and a special time to be
with the Shaw’s.  They gave us a sack of little gifts.  </span></p>

leave.  First I went to the Kimberlina shop and washed my pickup so that it was
clean to turn back over to Lee.  I then went to the plant and found out what
needed to be done on the new office area.  Lee told me that the paper holder,
the paper towel dispenser and the soap dish needed to be mounted as to Handy
Capt specifications.  I had to go to Wasco and buy some parts and also go to
the shop at Sherwood and find a toilet paper holder.  I got all three items
mounted before noon.  Mae got everything ready and came to the plant by noon.  It
was 12:30PM before the food arrived for the luncheon.  Elder and Sister Shaw
were able to return in time for the luncheon.  Merrill said some nice things
about us and he gave us a gift bag with a picture of an aerial view of the
plant which everyone had signed and a large book about farming.  He had us say
a few words also.  I turned in my keys and credit card and we said our goodbyes. 
Lee then took us to the orchard and showed us inside the bee hives.  We went to
Wasco and bought a gift for Brenda and took it to her home.  She was still at
work so we couldn’t see her before we left.  We got gas and left for home about
3PM.  Mae drove to Tahachipi while I slept.  I drove from there to Las Vegas

breakfast cost us almost $30.00 for the two of us.  It was very good, but very
expensive.  We left Las Vegas for St. George, Utah; stopping for gas just on
the outskirts of town.  We then traveled on to St. George arriving at Aunt
Joy’s between at 2:30PM.  Diane and Keith, Aunt Joy’s daughter and husband were
there.  We visited there until 4:30PM before leaving.  Keith invited us to come
to their home in Canada and he would take me out fly fishing on his boat and he
said it is really easy the way he does it.  We stopped and bought new windshield
wipers before driving to Cedar City.  Ten miles before we got to Cedar snow
&amp; ice packed the high way and within those few miles there was 9 to 10 cars
that had slid off into the bar pit, one was on its top.  The highway patrol had
already arrived and an ambulance.  We arrived at Uncle Van and Aunt Allison’s. 
They had dinner ready for us and made us very welcome.  We slept there tonight.</span></p>

at 9:30AM and enjoyed the morning.  Sandi and Nick came shortly after noon and
Mae and I rode to the chapel with them.  The Sacrament meeting went very well. 
David gave a special talk and then played a melody of songs he had put
together.  It was beautiful, it ended with the “Warriors of Heleman”.  There
was a large turnout for the meeting with many relatives on both sides
attending.  David and his family and Jeff and his family also came even though
the roads were very bad coming from the north.  After the meeting the house was
packed with visitors.  About 4PM I decided to drive up to Clinton and unload
the pickup.  We were concerned that the oranges and grapefruit we had brought
from California would freeze if left in the pickup over night and we also
needed some items that were packed in the back of the pickup.  I drove to
Clinton but at 5:30PM at mile marker 323 on I-15 I was involved in an
accident.  I believe that a car in the HVO lane came into my lane, which would
have been the fast lane, and collided with the side of my pickup.  When I got
off the freeway and stopped, I got out of my pickup and walked back to the car
that had hit my pickup.  The driver walked towards me saying, “I’m sorry, I’m
sorry” and I asked him what had happened.  He replied “I’m not sure”.  I looked
at his car but did not go to the side because of the busy traffic.  I asked if
he and his passengers (for he had a young lady in the passenger seat and a
child in the back seat in a child’s seat) were ok.  He told me that they were
all ok.   We determined that there was enough damage to the vehicles that we
needed to call a highway patrol.  He pulled out his IPod and started trying to
find a number to call, so I told him that he should just call 911.  He did and
while we were waiting for an officer, I set in the truck to keep warm.  When
the officer arrived he made a quick survey of the accident and told us to
follow him off the busy freeway as it was not a safe place to be.  We followed
him to the next exit and there we filled out the reports.  After we both filled
out the reports the officer told me that the other driver said that I had
turned into his lane.  I had said that the other driver turned into me.  He could
not determine and so was not going to give a citation to either but would let
our insurance co. determine the fault.  I picked up Jeff and he helped me
unload the truck.  On the way back to Jeff’s mother-in-laws, Jeff and I got
into a disagreement about the Church and I came back quite upset.  </span></p>

of the accident area but I still can’t figure out how it happened.  I called
our insurance co. from Bob &amp; Carroll’s and gave them the information from
the officer’s report.  One thing that I noticed is that the other driver put on
his report is that he was only driving 60 mph when the accident happened.  If
that had been true he would never have been near to me because I was traveling
70 to 75 mph when it happened.  When we got back to Mike’s they had gone to
make changes on their phone service.  Becky prepared a very nice dinner this
evening and then Mike took David, Mae and I to see the Bar J Wranglers perform
at Thanksgiving Point Show Barn.  The show was hosted by the Lehi High School

David.  After the session we went to the cafeteria and ate lunch.  At 2:30PM Taylor
Page came to the Temple and she and David went to the Baptistery where David
was able to be voice while Taylor was confirmed for the dead and the David was
able to be the baptizer while Taylor was baptized for the dead.  Mae and I were
able to observe the ordnances performed.  All in all it was a very enjoyable

trimmings.  Becky’s parents were also invited for dinner.  After we all helped
clean up and at 7PM President Tim Welch of the Hillcrest Stake came.  The 3<sup>rd</sup>
Ward Bishopric had arrived just before President Welch arrived.  When President
Welch arrived Mike turned the meeting over to him.  He asked that we sing a
Hymn with David accompanying.  We sang “I Know That My Redeemer Lives”.  He
called on Bishop McMurtrey to open with prayer and then President Welch asked
for David to bare his testimony, follow by Becky and then Mike.  He then had
Taylor Bare her testimony and then asked for any others that wished to so Mae
and Grandma Stewart, followed by Grandpa Stewart, then myself, followed by
Bishop McMurtrey.  President Welch then set David apart as a Missionary of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and added a most beautiful
blessing.  Standing in the circle was all Melch Priesthood holders, <i>Bishop</i>
Gene McMurtrey, <i>1<sup>st</sup> Con.</i> Jordan Fong, <i>2<sup>nd</sup> Con.</i>
Kevin Ash, <i>Father</i> Michael K. Browning, <i>Grandfather</i> George O.
Stewart and <i>Grandfather </i>Kenneth H. Browning.  President Welch of course
was word in the blessing and gave a marvels blessing.  We took several pictures
before we broke up.  Mike and Becky took David out for desert and a few minutes
with him before he leaves tomorrow.  I started this journal entry when Bishop
Steven Smith called me to see if we were back in the State and if we would be
in Church Sunday.  When I said yes to both questions he then ask if my sweet
wife and I would speak in Church on Sunday.  Of course the answer was yes.  </span></p>

work so that he could be with David when he went to the M.T.C.  We enjoyed
breakfast with the family and then packed to come home.  We left for home about
9:30AM.  The apartment is a mess and we spent some time just trying to decide
where to begin.  Mae got our bedroom cleaned enough so that we can stay
tonight.  She worked all day cleaning.  I worked on getting the kitchen sink
installed but when I finished the faucet leaked.  I got the fridge and freezer
leveled and ready to use.  I removed and extra clothes dryer after checking to
be sure the dryer that matched the washer worked ok.  Scott, Mishelle and their
children came over to help.  They also went shopping and brought back dinner. 
After they left we quite and went to bed.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I woke shortly after
3AM and what sleep I got after that was in the recliner.  Mae slept fairly well
but still feels over whelmed with the work.  When we knelt for Morning Prayer
Mae broke down and cried. After breakfast, I got everything out of the storage
area under the stairs and made plans to build new shelving there.  Bob prepared
dinner for us so that took a load from Mae.  Bob and I went to Lowes and bought
material for the shelves.  We also brought the tools up to the garage so that
we can start building the shelves tomorrow.  Mae and I ate and then showered
and cleaned up so that we could meet with President Mitchel at 5:30PM.  We
visited with President Mitchel for about ½ hour.  He expressed his thanks for
our service and had us tell him a little of what the mission consisted of. 
Before we left he asked us if we would be willing to go with High Councilmen to
speak at various wards, which we said that we would.  We came home, changed
clothes and got some dinner.  We went over to Jeff’s where we spent the
evening.  After the children were put to bed, Jeff, Gale, Mae and I played a
game of Rook.  Jeff and I won but it was a fun time.</span></p>

breakfast and then came over to our home.  Mae did some house work but spent
most of the time working on her talk.  She went to Jeff and Gale’s at 2:30PM to
tend their children while they went on an anniversary trip.  I installed the
new water faucet on the kitchen sink.  Bob and I returned the material that we
bought yesterday as Mae wanted the shelving finished.  I worked most of the day
on cutting the shelving out but at 6PM put things away and quite for today.  Bob
prepared lunch and dinner for us so that saved some time.  This evening I tried
to work on my talk but was too tired to keep my thoughts straight so I gave up
for tonight and went to bed.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                I woke at 5AM so I
got up thinking of the cabinets that I am building.  I read the book of Enos
and though it is short it carries so much Testimony of the plan of life and the
need for a Savior as well as God’s love for his children.  I got me something
for breakfast and then thought that I would clean the walks and driveway of the
snow that has fallen during the night.  I did not think of the alarm that Bob
and Carroll has had installed until a city patrol officer pulled up in front. 
This alarm is going to be interesting but even with it Carroll is still convinced
that people (our neighbors to the east) are still breaking in and have bugged
the house as well as tapped into our electrical system and stealing electricity
from us.  I worked all day on the cabinets for the wash room.  Bob helped me
quite a bit.  At 2:30PM, I road with Bob and Carroll to Jeff’s house, for a
demo of the T-Zone Vibration Technology machine. John Price and his wife
brought it to us and gave the demo.  I was pretty impressed with it.  After the
demonstration John loaded the machine in his trailer and brought it to our
place.  Mae stayed to play game with our children.  I came home and got me
something for dinner and worked on my talk.  Jeff brought Mae home about 11PM. 
He played with our printer until he got it to print my talk.  Any additions or
changes I will have to make by hand.  It’s now 11:45PM so I am going to take a
shower and go to bed.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>                We woke at 6AM in
order to be at church by 9AM.  When we arrived there was no one in the chapel. 
Sandi and Nick drove up as well as Scott’s family and Gail and the children. 
Grenn and Kathleen Clark also came.  It then downed on us that the block
started at 9AM with Priesthood and Relief Society being first.  We were so
embarrassed that we had forgotten that in this Stake the order of meetings is
reversed as compared to our Ward in California.  Some went home as they had
other meetings that they needed to attend.  Some went into the other meetings
and some visited with us until time for Sunday School to start.  we had several
family and friends that came for Sacrament meeting and we felt their support. 
With the Lords help our talks went pretty good.  I thought that Mae’s talk was
very special.  There was a special musical number between our talks and it was
so spiritual and beautiful that I had tears in my eyes when I arose to speak.   I
did get mixed up as to the closing time and I talked to long.  We felt bad that
we couldn’t invite friends and family over to our place but we are still in too
much of a mess with very little room.  Bob cooked us a nice dinner.  We then
went downstairs and took a nap before going to Georgia’s and Rick’s.  When we
got there Kim and Jeanenne, Caleb and Michelle and Bryce, Terry were there. 
Caleb and Michelle were just telling of their engagement.  Michelle is a very
pretty young lady and we are so happy for the two of them.  We had a very
enjoyable evening visiting.  At 7:30PM Terry had to leave for the airport to
return to his home in Alaska.  After all others left we stayed and visited with
Georgia and Rick and played games for a while.  We got home after 9PM but were
hungry so got us something to eat.  I filled out this entry and then we went to
bed and watched a J.A.G. series before going to sleep.  I need to add that all
my children remembered my birthday with gifts and calls.  Mae is very special.</span></p>

about 8:30AM.  Mae had slept part of the night in the recliner.  Her left hand
was sore and she could not close her fingers into a fist.  She wouldn’t do
anything about it although I suggested that she should call the Doctor.  She
got breakfast; we ate and then started to work on the house.  I finished the
shelving with Bob helping me.  At lunch Bob prepared something for us.  Mae
washed dishes, pots and pans, drawers and cupboards.  As soon as I finished the
shelf’s Mae started putting things away.  I gathered up my tools, also added
some finish strips to the back paneling of the cupboards and laid some floor
covering in the storage area.  This evening Mae and I did some grocery
shopping, stopping for a Sub-Way sandwich for dinner. It was 9PM before we got
back home.  Mae put the groceries away while I entered my journal entry.</span></p>
