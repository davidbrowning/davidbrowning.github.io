got up at 3AM and got Sandi’s luggage packed into the car.  When we finished
the car was really loaded.  We had six suite cases, each weighing about 50
pounds, plus the three of us.  We left Tooele at 4:30AM with some winds.  There
was road construction through the Provo area that was slow but then we traveled
on the Nephi ok.  Sandi and Mae tried to sleep when we first started.  When we
moved to the West side of the valley the roads we wet and I could see snow on
the road signs, but the road was good until we went over the hill and then the
snow had collected on to the high way.  The storm has pass through before us so
we didn’t get into it but the roads were slippery from there until we got
almost to St. George.  We stopped at St. George for rather to eat.  When we
left there I let Sandi drive and I slept until we were almost to Las Vegas.  We
stopped there for a bathroom break and then I drove.  There was some winds but
no storm.  Before getting into California we saw snow on the high mountains but
the roads were good.  We stopped after getting to California for gas and a Sub
Way and then went on.  With the G.P.S. we were able to travel right on to our
motel in Long Beach.  We did drive passed the motel but with the cell phones we
called and got directions back.  At the motel we did some rearranging of our
luggage to even out the weight in each suit case.  We then went out to soak in
the hot tub and a swim in the pool.  The news on the TV indicated that there
was bad storms with snow in Las Vegas (we didn’t see any) and great wind destruction
through the L.A. and Long Beach area.  We noticed some winds but not that
much.  Roy and Shellie were late leaving home and when they got to the
California Border they were held up for 1 ½ hours getting through the Border
inspection.  It was 10PM when they got to the motel.  We visited with them for
a little while before we all went to bed.</p>

woke up at 4:30AM, California time, and caught my journal up.  I did so in the
bathroom so as not to wake Sandi or Mae.  I read my Scriptures and then started
this entry.  After that I played a game of chess so that I wouldn’t wake Sandi
or Mae.  Waiting for the rest to get going I also played a game of spider
solitary.  I won both of these games.  We went in for breakfast, which was very
good.  Mae, Sandi and Shellie walked over to a store to buy a few things.  At
12:00 noon we took all our bags to the front and took a taxi to the boat dock. 
When we booked this Motel it was because they would let us park our cars there
and then they would shuttle us to the boat dock.  They realized that they had
miss figured where the port that the cruise ship left out of and they didn’t
deliver to that port.  They took one taxi but made us pay for the second taxi. 
We didn’t have time to settle this now but I will have to talk to the
management before we settle the payment.  We got to the pier at 1PM but the
ship had been two hours late getting to the port, so they were late starting
the check in.  It was after 7PM when the ship left the dock.  We toured some of
the boat and then went to dinner.  Dinner was very good and they sure are
trying to take care of us with Mae and my diet needs.  After dinner we went
exploring the ship.  It is quite a boat.  After leaving Roy and Shellie, Sandi,
Mae and I started for our room.  On the way we passed a dance hall so Mae and I
danced for a few minutes.  Before I went to bed I finished this entry.  It is
now 1:45AM Mtn. Standard time but 11:45 PM Hawaii time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke shortly after 4AM and mainly watched the ocean waves.  After the sky
started to lighten I saw tuna surfacing.  Sandi and Mae came to the port window
and watched them with me.  The waves are quite large and the ocean very rough. 
It is interesting to walk around with the ship swaying.  Mae and I took showers
and then went up to eat breakfast.  We attended a ballroom dance class and
really enjoyed that.  Mae and Sandi did some research of shore activities.  I
took a nap.  I am having mixed emotions about this trip.  After lunch we
watched a ice carving demonstration.  When Mae and Sandi came back we went to the
dance lessons.  We then had some Suchi which was Mae’s first time.  We came
back and got ready for dinner.  We met Roy and Shellie at the Monarch room and
played Mexican Train Dominos until dinner time.  We stayed for a show but I
wasn’t very impressed.  It was bed time when we returned.</p>

didn’t have a lot of activity except meals.  We watched the movie “The Man
Called Peter” using our computer and projector.  It makes it a little crowded
with 5 of us in our room.  This afternoon we attended a dance class.  We then
came back and dressed in our best for the dinner this evening.  We then went
for pictures to be taken.  They had many photographers taking many poses so
that everyone had lots of chooses.  We did have some time to dance in some of
the Ball Rooms before going to dinner.  This was the captains evening in the
dining room.  He spoke for a minute but I really wasn’t very impressed.  After
dinner we attended Show Time and the Big Band.  We were tired but when we went
past the Club Cool room we couldn’t resist going in and dancing until
mid-night.  We were ready for bed tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early as we gained another hour on the clocks last night.  Sandi and
Shellie went exercising early this morning.  Mae and I went walking as the
weather was much warmer today.  It was fun walking all over the upper decks. 
The sun broke through the clouds and everyone was out sun bathing.  Although I
used sun block I still burned just a little.  We were able to use the swimming
pool and they we quite warm.  They must be filled with ocean water because the
water is quite salty and burns your eyes.  Mae and I went for lunch and brought
it back to our room.  After eating we started a show but turned it off because
of language.  Sandi came and said that they wanted to play miniature golf but I
was tired so Mae went and I took a nap.  A hour and a half later Mae came back
and woke me.  We went to a dance lesson but didn’t stay very long as it was
basic Fox Trout steps.  We looked at the pictures that were taken last night
and picked some of what we liked.  We decided to watch a movie this evening so
I hung a sheet over the drapery for a screen and set the projector on the
table.  This set up gave us a much larger picture.  At 7PM we put the show on
hold and everyone went to the evening program.  I stayed behind as the AC in
our room isn’t working right and we have the repair man working on the AC.  By
the time that the AC was repaired and I went down to the theater the show was
just about over.  We then went out to eat.  We came back to our cabin and
watched the rest of the movie.  The movie that we watched was “The Ultimate
Gift” and we all enjoyed it.  It was almost mid-night when the movie ended.  We
soon went to bed.</p>

enjoyed it.  Sandi and I attended the dance class.  While we did that Mae went
to our cabin and lay down for a while.  We then went up to Roy and Shellie’s
cabin and played “Mormon Bridge”.  After getting started in the card game we
attended the Magician show.  Following dinner we finished the card game we
started earlier.  It was late when we were ready to go to bed.</p>

came into port about 10AM.  It was neat to see us come into the island.  Sandi,
Mae and I took a bus tour to the Hawaii Volcano National Park.  Roy and Shellie
took a helicopter tour of the Island.  On the way we stopped at the Mauna Loa
Macadamias plant and saw how they processed the Macadamia nuts.  We also bought
some packages of the nuts for gifts and to eat.  There was rain quite a bit of
the time.  It didn’t look like we were going to be able to get very clear
pictures due to the cloud cover but then it clear up long enough to get
several.  One thing that the tour guide told us was that then the women in
Hawaii ware a flower in their hair, if they are married the flower is over the
left ear, indicating unavailable, it is over the right ear indicates single and
available, if in the middle married but still available.  After returning we
went to a show on board the ship and then to dinner.  After dinner we came back
to our room and the five of us watched “Heaven Can Wait” which was a cute show
but it did take the Name of God in vain too often.</p>

arrived at Maui at 8AM and disembarked shortly after in order to be on our tour
by 10AM.  We took some food with us today as yesterday we had not and didn’t
find anything to eat until we got back to the ship.  Sandi, Mae and I rode the
tour bus to the Sheraton Hotel where we walked through their facilities to the
beach.  It was a beautiful sandy beach where we enjoyed the warm sun shine.  We
also enjoyed snorkeling and seeing the many fish.  We had brought Sandi and
Nick’s snorkeling equipment, plus we rented fins from the hotel.  We really
enjoyed the day.  Mae and I returned on the tour bus at 3PM but Sandi stayed
and returned to the ship with Roy and Shellie as they had taken a sub-marine
tour but met Shellie just after Mae and I left.  They did some snorkeling with
Sandi before they returned to the ship.  When Mae and I got back to the ship we
first showered to get the sand off of us.  We then got us a salad to eat.  Our
plans were to go back into town to a Wal-Mart for a couple of items but when we
started we found that the free shuttle to Wal-Mart quit at 5PM.  It would have
cost us over $20 (one way) to have taken a Taxi so we got back on the ship.  We
didn’t feel that it was worth that amount of money.  I took a nap while Mae did
her hair.  We then went to eat and then attended an Hawaiian dance show.  I
caught my journal up to date before going to bed.</p>

then left for the tours.  Mae, Sandi and I went on a bus tour of Diamond Head. 
Most of the stops, I stayed on the bus because my feet and legs hurt too much
to walk very far.  The tour guide was very good and we did enjoy the trip.  I
have really watched what I have eaten today but tonight I’m still in a lot of
pain.  When we came back to the ship I got me some chicken to eat and went to
the cabin.  Mae and Sandi went shopping.  I took a nap.  Mae and Sandi had a
lot of fun shopping this afternoon.  This evening I watched a show on TV.  Mae
and I went to bed early.</p>

set the alarm and was up at 6AM in order to be ready for our shore excursion at
Kauai.  Mae didn’t sleep very well last night because she was worried about
me.  I do feel much better today, although my feet are still tender.  Roy and
Shellie went four wheeling in the mud.  Sandi, Mae and I went on the Waimea
canyon &amp; Wailua river boat tour to the Fern Grotto.  It was a very
beautiful ride up the river and then when we got up the canyon we docked and
had a short walk up through beautiful jungle trees and plants to a cave.  They
only let us go to a view area because the hurricane had damaged the cave and
loosened the rocks above making it dangerous to go further.  When we got there
the tour was to show and teach some Hula but it started to rain very hard. 
Finally when it broke they had everyone return to the boat where they gave us
the show.  It was good that they did because it rained more.  This area has
more rain than anywhere on the earth receiving over 400 inches annually.  It
was a very worth wile experience.  When we returned Mae and Sandi again went
shopping.  I came back to the cabin and took a nap.  This evening Roy, Shellie,
Sandi, Mae and I went to the evening show, which was a Juggler Entertainment. 
He was ok but I have seen what I thought was better.  We stopped for more photo
shouts and went to dinner and then quit for the night. </p>

had to get up early in order to be on time for our tour.  When we left the ship
the weather was questionable so we took coats and umbrellas with us but then
the weather turned very pleasant.   Sandi, Shellie and Roy went on a tour where
they were able to swim with wild dolphins.  They also saw a hump back whale. 
Mae and I went on a walking tour in the city.  My pain level is high and my
feet and legs hurt.  We checked on the use of a wheelchair but it cost $150.00
for five days and I was not willing to spend that.  For breakfasts I have been
having scrambled eggs but as I finished eating this morning it dawned on me
that they probably are using powered eggs mixed with water and milk.  That was
kind of dumb on my part.  The tour was very good but by the time it was over my
pain level was high.  Mae and I set on a bench and ate a boiled egg.  We were
going to go through a museum when Sandi called and said that they were back
from their tour.  We waited for her to join us.  I decided to return to the
ship and let Mae and Sandi continue in town.  I carried several items back with
me so that they wouldn’t have to carry them around town.  When I got back to
the pier I met Roy and Shellie.  I also took their snorkeling equipment back to
the boat with me so they wouldn’t have to pack it with them.  After dropping
the extra items off at our cabin, I then up to the dining area and got
something to eat.  I then came back to the cabin and tried to find something to
watch on TV.  There wasn’t much on and I fell asleep until Mae and Sandi came. 
We departed Hawaii about 4PM.  As soon as we got out to sea the seas seem to
become quite rough.   We put on the DVD movie “Golden Plates”.  It wasn’t
finished when Shellie called just before 7PM.  She reminded us this evening’s
entertainment.  We paused the movie and went up to the theater.  We were able
to find Roy and Shellie there.  The show was a musical and dance production
that was very good.  However the young ladies that danced wore very revealing
costumes that didn’t cover much.  I couldn’t help but wonder about the two
different entertainments.  After dinner we ended up getting more pictures
taken.  My pain level was high so I found a place to just sit.  When Mae came
we went downstairs to our cabin.  Sandi wasn’t much longer coming to the
cabin.  We watched the rest of the movie and really enjoyed it.  Roy and
Shellie came down to get their scuba gear and while they were here I had Roy
give me a Priesthood blessing.</p>

slept in this morning.  I slept fairly well although the pain level in my feet,
legs and hips is quite high.  I didn’t get up for breakfast but Mae brought
some breakfast down to me.  Mae isn’t feeling very good this morning.  She
seems to have some congestion and a sore throat.  The sea is quite rough this
morning.  The waves are very interesting to me and I think of the earlier
mariners, especially the early Saints and also the scriptural accounts.  Our
cabin boy “Katut” came in to clean our room.  While he was here we got talking
to him and found out a little about his life.  He is married and has two
children.  They are 16 and 10 years old.  His wife works in a hotel.  He works
on the cruise line 7 days a week for 7 months and then gets 7 weeks to go home
to his family.  He gets paid $70 per month plus tips which is $10 per room per
day, for 23 rooms divided by three workers.  He also gets a phone card for 45
minutes each month.  He said that, that time goes so fast that he seldom calls
his wife or talks to his children.  I wonder why things are divided so
unfairly.  We just have to believe that life may not be fair but it will be
worth it.  This afternoon we played some card games.  Mae is feeling worse but
she did go to dinner.  My pain level is decreasing as the day goes on.  We came
back to our cabin after dinner and soon went to bed.</p>

some sun broke through so they went sun tanning.  Mae and I watched a movie on
DVD titled A Walk in the Clouds” that was very good even though it was rated
PG13.  Both Mae and I took a nap.  This afternoon we watched another movie “The
Blind Side” and that was very good.  Roy, Shellie and Sandi came down and we
played some games.  At dinner time Mae still isn’t feeling well.  Sandi checked
with the dining room and she was told that they couldn’t take food out.  So I
went up to the 9<sup>th</sup> floor and got us something.  We had just finished
eating when our waiter from the Dining Room brought our dinner to us.  They
have treated us so good there.  I put most of the food in the refrigerator for
tomorrow.  Mae went to sleep after eating but before she did I gave her a

was quite sick during the night with a high fever.  This morning when she woke
she felt some better.  I woke for a while but it was still dark.  I went back
to bed and may have dosed a little.  When we got up we decided to go up for
breakfast and then go to the hot tub.  Sandi and Shellie also came up for
breakfast at the same time.  They had gone walking at 6AM.  Roy decided to
sleep in.  After eating Mae and I went up to the indoor spa and enjoyed it for
a few minutes.  We came down to our cabin and lay down as Sandi was in
showering.  We then showered and Mae laid back down while I worked on the
computer.  When Mae woke, we watched the movie “The Boy in the Striped
Pajamas”.  It was good but also depressing.  I took a walk around the boat. 
The sea is quite rough and the winds outside are strong.  We were able to
download Sandi’s pictures and Shellie &amp; Roy’s plus our pictures so that all
three of us have each other’s pictures.  This evening the five of us got
together and played games for a little while before getting ready for dinner.  Mae
and I were served a fish with tomato sauce on.  I was concerned about the sauce
so I asked our waiter and he assured me that it had been made especially for us
without any sugar.  It was very good and probably the best tasting food we had
been served.  Mae wasn’t as happy with it as I because of the spices.  After
dinner we went to a dance where I danced with Sandi once and Mae once before we
went to the Pharoes Pallice for this evening’s entertainment.  It was good as
far as performance, but for Mae and I it was too loud, lights to bright, and costumes
too revealing.  After the program ended Mae and I came to our cabin and got
ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
lost another hour because of crossing the time zone.  We are now in
California’s time.  I woke at 4AM and finished yesterdays entry and started
today’s entry.  Not being sleepy I took the camera and went up to the 9<sup>th</sup>
floor.  I fixed me a cup of hot herbal tea.  We found that using our protein
powder as a creamer with the tea makes a very pleasant drink.  I wanted to go
up on the top deck but it is still closed off due to winds so I walked around
the ship for a while.  I went out on the side deck on the 3<sup>rd</sup> level
but it was dark, windy and then it started to rain, so I went back to our cabin
about 6AM.  I went back to bed and after a while fell asleep.  When I woke
again Sandi had left and the skies had cleared and the sun was shining.  Mae
and I went up for breakfast about 10AM.  Mae still isn’t feeling good so we
tried to find somewhere outside to lay in the sun but the wind is still cold
and we didn’t want Mae to get cold so we came back to our cabin.  Our cabin had
been cleaned while we were gone.  That has been one of the fun things about
this cruse is to have the cleaning and cooking all taken care of for us.  Mae
went back to bed and I read a couple of chapters in the Book of Mormon before
working on my journals.  Roy, Shellie, Sandi and I started to play miniature
golf but the winds were so strong that we quit.  Sandi, Shellie, Mae and I
played a short game of Hearts before we went for our dinner. This evening for
dinner Mae and I had pork steak that was very good.  We attended the evening
program but I wasn’t very impressed with it.  Mae and I came back to our cabin
and soon got ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 6AM and soon went up to the 9<sup>th</sup> deck where I could see the
sun rise.  I took several pictures and just marveled at the beautiful sun
rise.  I couldn’t help but think of the scriptural reference as to “Why does
God consider my worth when He has such creations.”  I hadn’t taken a coat with
me and it was very cold so when I got back to the cabin I got back in bed to
warm up.  We went up to breakfast about 9:30AM and then at 11AM we attended the
debarkation meeting.  From there we went to the dance class.  We spent the rest
of the morning packing.  Sandi and Shellie participated in a one mile walk St.
Jude Children Fund.  After lunch we continued the packing.   The ship got into
Ensenada about 4PM.  After it docked Shellie called us and said that they could
see seals from their cabin deck.  We went up but as the men tied the boat it
scared the seals into the water.  After we watched them in the water for a few
minutes, Roy, Shellie and Sandi left to go into Ensenada shopping.  Mae and I
continued to watch the seals return after the men finished securing the ship
and left.  We stayed until one large seal climbed up the rocky bank and lay on
the shore.  More would have followed but a man kept walking on the dock to see
the seals, so the seals would not get out of the water.  We finally went back
to our cabin.   Mae became very worried about the kids safety and so we had a
prayer asking for their safety.   Mae and I then went up to the 9<sup>th</sup>
deck and got us some bean soup.  While we were eating Mae over heard a lady and
she was very upset.  The lady’s husband was in a wheelchair and she had
evidently had a run in with some of the passengers while she was trying to get
both her and her husband’s dinner.  She was about in tears so Mae went over to
her and visited with her for a few minutes.  That is one of the neat
characteristics of my special wife.  She is so concerned about others.  After
eating we went to the game room and played a game of Rummy in which Mae won. 
She does that quite often.  By the time we finished the game Mae was getting
quite worried about the kids.  We just started to go looking for them when
Sandi came.  Mae was very relieved.  They had found a tour bus at the dock that
took them around the city and then to a store so they could get some vanilla.  All
of us went dancing this evening and had a lot of fun.  It was mid-night when we
got to bed.</p>

got up at 5:30AM but Mae and Sandi slept a little longer.  We went up for
breakfast at 7AM and then came back to the cabin and finished getting the
suitcases ready to go.  I took a short nap.  It took us quite a while to debark
but the customs came onto the boat so when we got through them we went right
off.  Sandi’s arms started hurting her so I pulled both her luggage and mine. 
Mae did pretty good with hers.  Roy and Shellie weren’t far behind us.  Shellie’s
bag had trouble with its wheels so that was a little difficult for her.  When
we got into our hotel the cab drivers seemed unaware that they had to take a
receipt into the desk to get paid.  We also discussed the charges that we had
when we first left the hotel where Roy had to pay $45 for their cab fair to the
boat.  The hotel clerk didn’t charge Roy and Shellie’s room for the extra
parking which was a $100 over the cost of the room so Roy and Shellie did come
out ok on that.  We left L.A. about 12:30PM and traveled straight through with
a stop for Sub-Ways and then we stopped at a Shell station for gas, but the
price of gas there was $4.83 per gallon so I only put in 5 gallons.  We again
stopped in Mesquite and filled up along with going into Smith’s and buying some
chicken and potato wedges.  We made a short stop in Cedar just to get bottled
water out of the trunk and then we stopped in Fillmore where I again filled up
at $3.209 per gallon.  We got to Sandi’s at 12:30AM, so with losing an hour
time with time-zone we made it in just about 11 hours.  We were very tired and
sure glad to be staying at Sandi’s.</p>

slept in until after 8AM although I got for the bathroom and read my scriptures
before cuddling back in bed with Mae. We took showers and Sandi cooked us
breakfast.  I entered my journal entries and transferred some pictures to my
computer before we finished getting ready for Church.  We attended Sacrament
meeting and then came back to Sandi’s.  We took some pictures of Sandi, Nick
and their two dogs.  They want to use them for Christmas cards.  We left from
there and came on home.  It was after 4PM when we got home.  Bob was just
coming in from feeding the animals.  I went out to check on the new kits but
all I could tell was that they seem to be ok.  We put away just what we had to
and called it quits for tonight.  We watched a couple of shows on TV before
going to bed.</p>

big washing and unpacking, in fact Mae worked on it all day.  I am concerned
about the way Mae is feeling.  I hope it doesn’t get worse.  I went shopping
for Mae and got the groceries she needs.  I bought some tangerines and
pineapples to take around to my Home Teaching families.  Bob has already taken
out cakes to them.  When I took care of the animals I checked the kits and they
all seem to be ok and I think there are 6 of them.  This evening we went over
to Jeff and Gail’s.  After the children went to bed we played “Trans America”

did get Mae to call and get an appointment to see Dr. Lee.  We went over for
that appointment at 2:45PM.  He checked her for pneumonia  and her lungs
checked out ok.  He did give her a prescription for a antibiotic that might
help her.  It may just have to run its course.  I made a jar of Almond Butter
today.  I did get some pineapple and tangerines put together and delivered them
to my Home Teaching families this evening.  Mae had her Visiting Teachers come
this afternoon.  They told her that many people in the Ward and in the schools
are sick with this illness.  I am sure that a lot of the problem is the
inversion and smog we are having.  It is really a mess outside.  This evening I
really began to feel worse.  We watched a couple of shows on TV before going to
bed.  I tried using my CPAP again tonight.  When I first tried my stuffy head
made it hard to breath but then the air force seems to force my sinus open and
I slept pretty good.</p>

was already there trying to sleep in the recliner.  She went back to bed and I
used the recliner.  I slept until 6:30AM but found that Mae had already gone up
stairs to wake Bob.  Bob had wanted us to wake him at 6:30 so he could take
Cole to school.  I couldn’t go back to sleep so I worked on my journal.  Mae
soon woke and stayed up but after being up for a while I again went back to
sleep.  In fact I took a couple of naps throughout the day as I am still quite
sick.  I did go out and take care of the animals.  The doe has left her litter
and they all died.  I removed the litter box from her pen and put the kits in
the garbage.  This evening Mae attended the Relief Society Christmas social and
reported that it was a very nice event.  While Mae was gone this evening I
worked on the grandchildren’s gifts for the family Christmas party.   At 8PM
Mae and I went to the Stake Presidency’s office where we met with President Park. 
President Park extended a call to me to serve as 1<sup>st</sup> assistant in
our Ward’s High Priest Quorum under Morgan Thomas and said that Brother Charles
Saunders has been called to serve as 2<sup>nd</sup> assistant.  I accepted the
calling and Mae also said that she would support me in the calling.  When we
returned home I continued working on the Christmas presents.  Mae was tired so
we soon went to bed.  I do not have the ability to express the love and
appreciation I have for Mae.  I feel so thankful for her companionship, her
love and the devotion she offers me.  I often feel so unworthy of her.  I woke

slept until 10:25AM and when I woke and looked at the clock I thought it was
almost 6PM.  I was glad when it wasn’t.  We have continued to prepare for

slept good last night.  We enjoyed this morning and then I went to the store
for Mae.  I went over to The Nut &amp; Bolt store and got the screws that I
needed for Scott’s door lock.  I saw a sign that read “Winter Gun Sale” so I
went in and found a used pump 20 gage shot gun, just what I wanted for $128.00,
so I bought it.  Like I told the salesman, I hope it never gets fired but just
the sound of the pump action lets anyone know that there is a shot gun waiting
for them.  When I got home we loaded things for the party into the truck.  We
stopped at Scott’s and I finished installing his lock.  We went over to Jeff
and Gail’s and helped them get ready for the family party tonight.  Their house
looked so clean and decorated very nice.  Mike and his Family came just minutes
before 5PM.  The others were soon there.  We had all our family except David,
who is on his mission, and Shellie’s family.  We had a wonderful evening with
food, games and gifts.  The children enjoyed getting the gifts that was
provided.  I got to give those gifts out and it was cute to especially watch
Ben and Kennedy as their gifts ended up on the bottom.   You could just see the
question in their eyes as to whether there was a gift or not for them. 
Everyone helped clean up and the party ended about 11PM.  Jeff, Gail, Mae and I
then played a game before we went to bed.</p>

around 10AM.  After bringing things in for the party I took a nap.  Mae was
talking to Sandi on the phone.  Mae then took a nap while I brought the journal
up to date, took care of the animals and took Christmas gifts out to the car.  We
went up to David’s this afternoon and enjoyed being with them.  Shauna had
fondue dinner this evening and it was very enjoyable.  She used chicken broth
to cook in and it worked very good.  We played a game of Tran-America before
dinner.  It was a very enjoyable evening and then it was time to get things
ready for Christmas.  The children had agreed with David that they could be up
by 6AM so I set our alarm for 5AM so we could be ready when they were.  Emily
let us have her room and she slept in the upstairs front office where David
mainly studies.  I sure am blessed with a wonderful wife and sweetheart.  We
are very impressed with the prayers that the children offer.  We just hope and
pray that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren can remain
faithful in this the final times of the world.</p>

is a wonderful time and we just hope that the Spirit of Christ is especially
felt a little deeper because of this reminder of giving to others.  After gifts
we had a nice breakfast and then Mae and I left for Scott’s.  We exchanged
gifts and saw what they had received and enjoyed being with them.  Michelle
went with Mae and I to Church but Scott and the children stayed home.  I know
that the twins are a handful but I wish there was a little more devotion and
effort.  I really appreciated being able to partake of the Sacrament this
morning.  With our cruse it has been some time since we have attended Church.  We
did go to Sacrament Mtg with Sandi &amp; Nick when we stayed the night with
them, when getting home from the cruse.  When we came home we did get a chance
to visit with Kip for a minute.  We next went over to Jeff and Gail’s and again
enjoyed a little time giving gifts and receiving gifts from them.  We then went
to American Fork and spent the evening with Mike, Becky and their family. 
Becky and Mike had prepared a very nice Prime Rib dinner.  We gave gifts and
enjoyed that tradition there as well as with all our family.  We played a game
of Trans-America with them, as we gave all of the boys that game for
Christmas.  It was 8:30PM before we left their home and then as we started west
on the main road there was an accident and we were detoured off the highway
into a neighborhood without any directions.  I was a little upset over that as
we did not know the area.  After a couple of dead ends we found our way around
the detour and were again on our way.  We got home and unpacked.  We got a little
to eat and watched a movie on Hallmark.  That was mid-night when it ended and
we almost just cuddled up and stayed in the recliner but then I knew we would
sleep better in our bed.</p>

cramps.  We are concerned as to what is causing those.  I prepared us some
breakfast while Mae did her exercises.  After breakfast I worked on my journal
catching it up.  David and his family got here at 10AM to leave their dog
Divenchi with us for a few days while they take a Christmas vacation to St.
George to be with Shauna’s family.  I went out to take care of the chickens and
found that the chickens had been locked out of the coop last night.  Bob let
his grandchildren take care of the chickens yesterday and I found that the
chickens had been locked out of the coop last night. We got cleaned up and met
Eleanor &amp; Dennis and they then rode with us to Applebee’s in Salt Lake. 
There we met Gary &amp; Ruth, Johanna &amp; Ralph and Pat where we ate and
visited.  I think that Mae and I are in the best of health so our diet must be
doing ok for us.  It was good to get together to visit.  We made plans to meet
next fall at Ralph and Joanne’s condo in Snow Bird for a few days.  That has
always been a fun time.  We enjoyed visiting with Dennis Eleanor while we
drove.  They are just the same as always.  When I got home I rechecked the
chickens and after looking found that most of the eggs had been laid in the
shed.  That might be a problem now for the chicken has found a nesting spot
outside the coop.  Mae and I watched a movie on TV before going to bed.  Mae is
sure a wonderful wife.</p>

have done if we were not here.  I think he had better get one of those alert necklaces
to wear.  I helped Mae make the bed as it is time to turn the mattress over.  I
worked on my journals while Mae prepared breakfast.  After breakfast I bid on
field trips and printed the awarded field trip.  I was going to go to Scott’s
and build on their basement but then tried to help Bob with a Medical Alert. 
Time goes so fast and before I got going, time had gone.  Mae took a fall while
taking David’s dog for a walk.  The chickens have reduced production and most
of the eggs were laid outside the coop.  I filled capsules with my supplements
that I take daily.  While doing that I watched shows on the TV.  Mae watched a
couple of them but then worked on pictures.  This evening I locked the chickens
into the run, trying to get them back to laying in the nests.  </p>

bought Mae a blouse that she had seen while with Georgia.  The regular price
was $45.00 but was on sale plus Mae had a coupon for $10.00 so it cost her
$6.00.  For that price it was very affordable.  We went to the Sizzler in

and Becky were going to meet us also but they thought that the time was 6PM
instead of 5PM.  We had a very enjoyable evening.  On the way home Mae and I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
normal morning routines my mind was concerned as to the designs of the science
project that Scott has asked me to help he and Kylan with.  I spent some time
drawing the designs out while Scott and Kylan went shopping for materials for
the project.  They then came over here and we used Bob’s garage as a work
shop.  We worked on the project most of the day.  We cleaned things up about
3:30PM as Mae and I have a dinner appointment at Irven and Sandy’s at 4:30PM.  Mae
received an e-mail from Sister Judd, informing her that Sister Hyer, in Shafter
California passed away on the night of Christmas Eve.  Mae had become very
close to Sister Hyer while we were serving there on our mission calling. 
Although it was sad news it was also great to realize that she and her
sweetheart are now again together after 26 years since Brother Hyer had passed
away.  She was a great Lady.  This evening Sandy and Irven had prepared a nice
chicken dinner along with all the trimmings.  They had kept me in mind as to my
special diet.  Also Bryce, Deanna and Bob were also invited, plus Mark and
Andrea were there.  Each helped with providing some of the dinner.  Andrea’s
boy friend Walter was also invited but didn’t get there until almost 6PM. 
After we had eaten Bob excused himself and went home.  The rest of us stayed
and played table games until mid-night at which time we cheered the New Year in
before going home.</p>
