got up and Mae soon prepared breakfast.  I tried to get the printer to work on
our laptop and realized that the driver was gone for the printer.  After
spending some time on the internet trying to find where I could order a driver
I finally called HP help and got a support technician.   I purchased a 1 year
Tech Support contract for the printer # CA03050832-0001 that will cover any
diagnostic work on the printer.  My case # 8052529039 was for today’s help. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
started to reorganize some of our food storage but then Bob came down and I
helped him request financial records from the S.S. office, the Intermountain
Retirement program, his Military Retirement and from America First Credit
Union.  We were shocked to hear that the President and Congress is trying to
organize a Super Congress of 6 Senitors that will be able to pass Legislation
that will control Finances and other special needs.  I feel this is totally
against the Constitution of The United States of America.   I was on the phone
for over 2 hours before I made contact with all of those offices.  I then
rearranged some of our food storage so that Mae could get to some of the items
that we can use.  By then it was time for me to go get the missionaries.  We
had Elder Dransfield from Virginia and Elder McColm from California for dinner
and then I went with them and did splits.  I went with Elder McColm’s and we
did a lot of knocking on doors but didn’t find many home.  We visited with some
members including President Steadman.  It was 9:30PM when I got home.  I worked
on my journal while Mae worked on pictures.  We then went to bed.</p>

Along with this I am still very concerned about Brother Brown.   Mae and I got
out and weeded the garden for a couple of hours before it got hot.  I worked on
my pickup and the camp trailer and this evening Bob and I mowed the lawns.  It
was 8PM when I quite.  I did take a 15 minute nap after lunch.  I started this entry
and then Mae and I worked on the 1<sup>st</sup> lesson on our upcoming Family
History class.  As we finished we rubbed each other’s feet and went to bed.</p>

my pickup to Lance Auto in Salt Lake for them to again try to find the CNG
switching problem.  Also to give me an estimate to move the CNG tanks.  Bob
came down to bring me home.  Mae worked on our Philippines Mission pictures
most of the afternoon.  I watched a show on TV.  This evening we tended Scott
and Mishelle’s children while they had a night out.  For most of the time we
took them across the street to the park.  It’s after 10PM so we will go to bed
now.  Good night!</p>

got up quite early but then gave each other haircuts and took showers before
breakfast.  We then decided to go to Golden Corral for their breakfast.  While
there, Scott called and asked if I could help get their new dishwasher
installed.  After we finished our breakfast, I stopped a Durk’s for some
parts.  While I was fixing that, Mae went shopping for a Wedding Gift and some
groceries.  It was after 2PM when we finished that and went home.  After lunch
I took a nap.  Scott called and there is water leaking somewhere.  I stopped
and bought some more parts and went back.  I hadn’t changed any of the plumbing
under the sink but what movement that was made in the piping started old joints
and the shut off valve to start leaking.  I replaced all the fittings and the
valve and checked all the fittings and hoses on the dishwasher again.  Mae came
over a 6:30PM with my suite and I changed so that we could attend Brielle
Carven and Mathew Hunt’s Wedding Reception.  We came home from that and set up
a canapé to eat breakfast under tomorrow.  It was almost mid-night when we
finished up and go ready for bed.  </p>

were up early and started breakfast.  By 9:30AM we had breakfast started and
most everyone was here.  We enjoyed a breakfast of bacon, sausage, eggs and
pancakes along with juices for drink.  It was a very enjoyable morning and most
just stayed around and visited.  We had all of our family except for Scott
here.  After cleaning up we then went to Jeff and Gail’s where we again set up
the grill and Jeff prepared lunch.  We enjoyed playing a card game after
eating.  Roy, Shellie, Mae and I then went home and got cleaned up.  We went to
Cedar Hills to a Wedding Reception for Dana &amp; Mathew Hunter.  Dana is the
daughter of Lois, Mae’s cousin.  Dana and Shellie have been close from their
youth.  From there Roy and Shellie headed for home and Mae and I came back to
our place.  I was really tired even though Mae drove from our place to Cedar
Hills while I took a nap.  We went right to bed.</p>

the chapel to set up chairs but when I got there it was all done.  Meeting went
well.  I tried to get on the computer when we got home and had all kinds of
problems.  I got upset with it and swore and that upset Mae.  Things were a
little tense for a while this afternoon.  We got things ready to have Jeff’s
family and Scott’s family over for dinner this afternoon.  That went well
although by the time they all left we were tired.  I typed this entry before we

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 6AM and got up.  Mae was still asleep so I just did my morning
routine.  Mae woke at 8AM having slept much better than she did last night.  I
prepared egg omelets for breakfast then after breakfast I puttered around and
at 11AM I went over to Scott’s.  On the way I stopped at Deseret Industries and
gave them the old toilet that I had replaced in our bathroom.  I measured Scott
and Michelle’s roof and figured the materials to re-shingle the house.  On the
way home I filled my truck with gas and natural gas.  Mae took Sister Shirley
Olson in to a Dr’s appointment.  She had my lunch ready for me and she had
already eaten her lunch and was ready to leave as I got home.  After lunch I
tried to take a nap but the dryer buzzer went off twice then I got two phone
calls with the last one being Scott.  He came over and worked on our computer
to clean it up and get it to run better.  Before he left Mae returned.  I went
out and weeded the garden and turned the water on it.  After dinner Bob and I
mowed and trimmed the yard.  Mae came out and also did some trimming and
sweeping up the walks and driveway.  We finished up about 9PM.  When I came in
the house Bob called me for help as Carroll was slumped in her chair and was
not responding.  After trying to get her to respond and didn’t get much I
called 911.  The lady on 911 had me get her onto the floor.  Still not get much
response and she acted like she was trying to heave.  911 had me roll her to
her side and when we did she heaved some up.  By that time the ambulance and
paramedics arrived and took over.  They left with her in the ambulance about
9:55PM for the McKay Dee hospital.  Mae went with Bob to the hospital.  I
stayed here to be available for what I can do which isn’t much.  I called Grant
to let him know, also I called Bishop Smith.  Leslie Fallis called concerned
because of the ambulances then later called back to see if she could help in
any way.  Mae called about 10:45 and said that the Dr. feels that she has had a
stroke.  I have been sitting by the phone and playing a game on chess with the
computer.  </p>

that Carroll has had a stroke.  At this point they do not know how serious and
how much damage has occurred.  Bob informed the Dr. that Carroll has a living
will in the hospital files stating that she does not want to be on life
support.  It is now 1:55 AM and no change so I will go to bed.  My chess game
ended a draw.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were woke by the phone at 8:30.  The hospital called to get permission to do a
MRI on Carroll so Mae went up and talked to Bob.  He was up and ready to go to
the hospital.  He had slept about 3 hours.  We got on the vibration machine and
had breakfast before going up to the hospital.  After getting there we found
that the Dr. wanted to visit with the family.  We made some calls.  Grant and
Stacy; Sherrie, Eric and Cole soon arrived.  We were informed that Carroll had
suffered a major stroke with little chance of surviving except on life
support.  The family decided not to go that way but to follow her living will
and just keep her comfortable until she passes which be could be a few hours up
to a couple of weeks.  We left the hospital about 4:30 PM stopping at the
health store for some items before coming on home.  Mae had visiting teachers
come as we got home.  I prepared some lunch.  We called all our children to let
them know the situation.  I took a nap then we went back to the hospital.  Bob
had taken a nap while everyone had left.  I guess that Robert and Patty came
while he was sleeping and they did not see that he was around the corner in the
hallway.  Again Grant and Stacy came up and then when Kathy arrived Sherrie
&amp; Eric brought her up.  Brother Morgan Thomas and Brother Ryan Rogers of
the High Priest Group leadership came up.   It was late because of other duties
that Bishop and Camille Smith came up.  After meeting Bob and Carroll’s family
Bishop Smith talked to the family and then lead us in a Family Prayer that was
very inspiring.  We left to come home after 11PM.  Bruce had not arrived but
was on his way from the Salt Lake Airport.  It’s almost mid-night so we will go
to bed.</p>

woke up early but then went back to sleep and didn’t get up until almost 8AM.  After
breakfast I went over to Packer’s to help with the roofing project.  They were
completely stripping the roofing to the sheathing.  I helped with that but they
seemed disorganized and unprepared.  I tried to make some suggestions which
included safety but that seemed unwanted.  I finally just climbed down and went
home.  I did several small jobs around the house and made some calls about Bob
and Carroll’s funeral plans.  I repaired the mail box stand as someone knocked
the mail box off last night.  Mike came over and asked about Carroll.  He also
told me that someone had knocked his mail box over last night.  I installed a
line to our inter-net connection so Bruce can use the inter-net while he is
here.  For some reason he is still having trouble getting connection.  Mae
spent most of the day cleaning house upstairs.  She really made quite a
difference.  Carroll is about the same as she was last night.  Sister Smith
phoned me and expressed their feelings of appreciations for the love we showed
to them when they came last night to the hospital and spent a few minutes with
us.  They had just came from another visit in which there was great animosity
expressed because the Ward had not responded to their expectations.  After
getting home Mae and I watched a movie on TV while we ate dinner.  It’s getting
late so we will go to bed.</p>

biscuits and gravy.  Bruce and Katie are staying with Bob and he had invited
Sherri, Cole and Kathy to join us as they were stopping over this morning
anyway.  After cleaning up, all the rest left to take care of other things
before going to the hospital.  I worked outside the rest of the day and Mae
went upstairs and cleaned the refrigerator, it really needed it.  We went up to
the hospital about 4PM.  We stopped at Praxair to get me a new mask.  They didn’t
have one but ordered one and it will come to our house.  David stopped at the
hospital on his way home from school.  I called Jared Fairbanks, from Premier
Funeral Services, Inc. and he came up to the hospital and visited with all the
family that was there.  The Hospice nurse doesn’t expect Carroll to last much
longer.  Everything indicates that Carroll’s body is shutting down.  It was
10:30 PM before we got home this evening.</p>

adjusting me he told me to put ice packs on to reduce the inflammation.  After
getting home I did ice my shoulder then I went back to bed and slept for over
an hour.  Mae was busy preparing a casserole for the family when they came
home.  Mae went into the hospital and at 4:20PM she called me and said that
Carroll had just passed away.  I contacted our family and Bishop Smith.  I have
just mainly watched shows on TV this afternoon and evening.  I did try to call
our children but only got through to Sandi and Shellie.  My shoulder is still

TV show.  It was McClintock which I have seen many times but still enjoy it. 
We met with Bishop Smith and went over funeral plans.  Dinner was brought in by

flying over the fence and pigging out on the vegetables.  We caught her in the
act so I trimmed the one wing to see if that will stop her.  Sister Johnston
prepared dinner for us this evening.  After dinner I got Mae to go with me and
we went Home Teaching to the Johnston’s.  I also took a cake to the Johnston’s
and the Thurman’s.  I talked to Sister Thurman and she said that both she and

tried to copy Carroll’s obituary that Bob brought down this morning but could
not get it to come clear.  I worked on getting a better fence around the
garden.  I was going to go with Scott to look at a pickup but that didn’t work
out so Scott canceled.  I got a call from Jared who told me that he had
e-mailed Carroll’s funeral program to me for verification.  Mae had gone
visiting teaching and then to for a hair appointment.  I worked with the
computer until I finally was able to bring it up.  I had Bob and Katie read
over it and we called back to Jared with three changes but other than that it
looked very good.  In between other things I made a batch of almond butter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>I worked in
the garden.  I started putting up the chicken wire but needed help.  I called
Jackie Winterowd (Wilding) as she has been trying to reach me.  She called
about Carroll’s funeral so we visited for a while.  Bob came out and helped me
with the fence until it got late so we put all the chickens into the chicken
pen and locked them in for the night.  When I came in it was late.  Mae had
made me some dinner so I ate that while I watched a show on TV.  It was
“Airport 77” and though I have seen it before I still enjoyed it.  Mae had
other things to do so she didn’t watch it with me.  It was late when we went to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 4AM from a wonderful dream of our courtship and married life.  It
was so special.  I didn’t want to wake Mae so I went back to sleep in the
recliner.  It was 8AM when I woke again.  I helped Mae dry the windows and
while doing that we saw two chicken that had flown over the chicken run fence
so we caught each chicken and trimmed each ones right wing feathers.  That
should stop the flying, we hope!  After breakfast I called and visited with
Brother Probert about funeral arrangements.  Bob helped me and we finished the
fencing around the garden.  Mae gave me a haircut and I took a shower before
going up to the church.  Brother Thomas was at the chapel and had things fairly
well ready for the viewing.  Brother Probert soon came and spent most of the
evening there in place of Bishop Smith as Bishop is out of town but will be
here tomorrow.  Premier Funeral Services soon arrived with the casket and I
thought that Carroll looked very well.  Barbara and Dean arrived shortly as
they worked at the Jordan River Temple today and so came straight up from
there.  It was sure good to see them and visit with them for a little while. 
Brother Thomas asked it the table was ok that they had put in the hallway for
pictures and any other display items.  I called Mae and Bob had forgotten about
that.  Mae helped them gather some things up and then she arranged the table. 
We stayed the evening helping where we could.  It was 8:30PM when we finished
putting things away and closing the building.  Mae got us something to eat and
then we watched a series of J.A.G. before going to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night.  We were late eating but also I just felt
concern as to the small attendance to the viewing last night.  Brother Thomas
was there to help set up and Brother Probert represented the Bishopric.  Sister
Johnston and Brother and Sister Knudsen were there.  President Puffer came but
other than that I didn’t see any one else other than a few friends.  Randy came
up and I thought that was very special of him.   I felt disappointed that as
far as I have been able to see there has been now support from Sherrie and
Eric’s ward.  It made me aware of my neglect of thoughtful in situations like
this.  Bob told me that Mike next door came while we were out for a few
minutes.  Today there was good support especially from family.  The service
went very well and I thought Grant and Bruce gave very good Gospel talks. 
Chelci song accompanied by Sandi was very well done.  Mae went up with them and
turned the music sheets for Sandi.  Sister Leslie Fallis accompanied by Sister
Ann Martin also was beautifully done.  After the interment at the Syracuse City
Cemetery many of the family returned to the church for a lunching by our Relief
Society.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Most
of Bob’s family stopped for a few minutes at the house before departing for
their homes.  This evening Mae and I went with Jeff and Gale and Gale’s mother
Marcy to Cherry Hill’s where we played miniature golf.  It was fun even though
some of us didn’t score very well.  We then attended a concert that was ok.  It
was 11PM when we got home very tired.</p>

After meetings Mae and I got some lunch and then Mae went with me to visit
Lesley Fallis.  I then went to visit the Casey’s and found that Becky is in the
hospital and Isaac’s mother is tending the children.  I reported that to Bishop
Smith and Brother Thomas.  Bob invited us for dinner at 3PM with all his
family.  It was very good.  We visited for quite a while with them.  I did
watch the end of a western and then we watched Perry Mason while I filled some
capsules.  I took the garbage out and entered this journal entry before we went
to bed.</p>

got up at 4AM so that I could go to the Stake onion patch and start weeding by
5AM.  I wasn’t sure just where the patch is this year but thought I could find
it.  After driving around for an hour I came back and called Brother Thomas.  I
then went back and worked for 2 ½ hours getting 2 rows weeded then I moved over
and started 2 more rows.  About ¼ of the way I really got into the weeds.  At
the ½ way point I gathered up what I had pulled and carried them to the top of
the rows.  I then started for on top and went less than ¼ of the way when I
stopped and carried the weeds back to the top.  It took me 3 trips to get them
carried out and I then cleaned the head of the rows out before going home.  Mae
and I hurried and got things packed to go but it was still 2PM before we left
for Pocatello.  I got Bob to buy me some chicken and potato salad which I took
to Casey’s as we left town.  It was after 5PM when we got to Rich and Lois’s
where we stayed tonight.  We enjoyed visit with them and Elise this evening. 
We also played a game of “Mormon Bridge”.  They are sure neat but Rich is
getting quite old.  He is now 87 years old and he is having a hard time
remembering things now.</p>

of September.  Of course I told him that I would.  We stopped in town before
leaving Pocatello.  It was 2PM when we got to Island Park and we then set up
the camp trailer.  I went back to the Phillips 66 station and bought some ice,
filled a propane tank and bought some gasoline.  Mae had dinner ready when I
got back.  We had to rearrange things so that we should be safe from the
bears.  We then walked down to the lake where we saw a moose and her calf.  We
were able to get some pictures of them before they left the camping area.  I
caught up my journal and called President Steadman as I had the wrong scripture

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning and were late getting up.  It was 11AM when we ate
breakfast.  I was thinking that we had never seen the Mesa Falls so we set out
to find them.  We saw a sign that directed to Warm Springs so we took that
road.  We really enjoyed that spring and were amazed at that much water
suddenly coming out of the mountain side.  It was a beautiful area and we
thought that it might be a good place to bring our entire family for a vacation. 
That we will have to see if that works out.  The road that we followed was a
dirt road going through the forest.  It finally came back onto the paved
highway below the Lower Falls.  We stopped there and enjoyed those falls. 
After spending some time there we drove on up to the Higher Falls and that was
an amazing fall to see.  We then drove back towards our camp site but I decided
that we should go on to Big Springs.  Although we have been there many times
Mae was game for it.  It is sad that there are few fish there now but we
understand that a grizzly bear spent the last couple of winters there having a
feast on those large trout.  In the past we have seen possibly up to a 100
large fish in that area.  Today we only saw 5 or 6 trout.  That is a shame but
I am sure they will come back in time.  It caused me to think that the
management of the bears might be wrong, especially with the constant threat of
bears in the camp grounds.  I guess that only time will tell.  We got back to
our camp after 5 or later.  I laid down in the recliner while Mae was putting
dinner together and fell asleep.  As we were having chef salad this evening she
let me sleep for a while.  It had really been a enjoyable day.  We expected
that Scott and his family would be here by 9PM but they called at that time and
said that they were still in Idaho Falls.  That means that they still have at
least 1 ½ hours before they will arrive.  I worked on my journal while Mae read
from some of the Porter History.  It was after mid-night when Scott and his
family arrived.</p>

they hadn’t stopped on the way for anything.  It was after 2AM when we got to
bed.  Mae and I slept until almost 8AM but Scott’s family slept until after
9AM.   It was about 12:30 by the time we got away to Yellowstone.  We enjoyed
the park, the animals and the sights.  When we got to Old Faithful I took a nap
while the rest enjoyed Old Faithful.  We stopped in West Yellowstone to get a
Subway sandwiches for dinner but they wanted $5.50 for a 6” and up to $9.95 for
the 12”.  We changed our mind and decided that we would wait until we got back
to camp for dinner.   When we left there I took the wrong road and after 10
miles or so we realized that we were going the wrong way, so we turned around
and came back.  It was late when we got to camp so we had to hurry and get
dinner ready and eat.  We were again late getting to bed.  I was worried about
eating so late and then going to sleep so I let Mae got to bed.  When I tried
to work on the computer it was discharged.  I then went to ready from the
scriptures and the IPod was also discharged.  I read form Mae’s scriptures
before going to bed.  Mae was still awake I, think worrying too much, but that
is my sweet wife.</p>

Scott’s family was up.  Mae and I cooked up hot cakes and eggs for breakfast. 
I also started up the generator to get things charged up.  After cleaning up
from breakfast we went up to Big Springs where we first went to the Johnny Sack
cabin.  It was interesting to find out that Dad was born 6 years earlier that
Johnny Sack and he lived 3 years longer.  He was born in Norway and immigrated
to America when he was 3 years old.  His father worked for Singer Sewing
Machine Co. as a cabinet maker and Johnny later took up the same triad.  They
believe that is where he learned his craftsmanship.  After viewing the cabin we
fed the fish and let the children play there for a little while.  We then went
to Warm Springs where we let the children play in the water.  I also put on my
swimming suit and went into the water and took a quick bath.  Although the water
is 50 degrees it was still chilly.  The gravel river bottom was the hardest to
stand as it hurt my feet.  We spent quite a while there as the children really
enjoyed the water.  We then went to the Mesa Lower and Upper Falls which also
impressed Scot and Michelle.  It was 6:30PM when we got back to our camp.  We
ate dinner then let the children cook marshmallows over a fire.  I came back to
our tent trailer before 10PM but Mae went back and played games with Michelle,
Kylan and Ashley before coming back to bed.</p>

us being with them and the enjoyable time it has been.  They will stay another
night and come home tomorrow.   It was about 11AM before we got out of the camp
ground.  We stopped for gas in Idaho Falls and then stopped at a rest stop
where Mae took over driving so I could sleep.  She drove to the truck check at
Inkom at which time I drove.  Mae did get some sleep then.  We stopped at
Brigham City for CNG and then got home about 4PM.  We unpacked the items that
came into the house.  While Mae showered I started getting things ready for the
High Priest Group Social this evening at our back yard.  That went quite well

Mae and I or biscuits and gravy.  After breakfast Mae started on the washing as
it had been 2 weeks since she had washed the clothes.  I started on unloading
the pickup.  Both Mae and I worked in the garden getting it weeded and quite a
few vegetables picked.  It was quite hot by lunch time.  Both Mae and I took a
nap after lunch.  I made some phone calls, concerning the face mask for my CPAP
and found out that it had not been ordered because I had to have a Doctor’s
prescription to get a new one.  I told Praxair to call Dr. Lee.  I later called
Dr. Lee’s office and talked to his nurse.  She said that Praxair had called and
Dr. Lee had sent them a prescription.  I went to the bus shop and filled out
request for time off and I lined up bus routes to drive tomorrow and Friday.  I
also went to C.A.L. Ranch for chicken feed, some coveralls and some strikers
for the grill.  Mae had dinner ready when I returned.  After eating we drove up
to David’s, getting there just as David returned from school.  After visiting
with David while he ate I then volunteered to be a genie pig for David to give
me a physical checkup.  According to that checkup David said I was in very good
