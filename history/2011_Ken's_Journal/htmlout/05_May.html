we are going to attend Chelci and Steve’s Ward for the blessing of their
daughter Addison, I did not attend meetings in our Ward.  Mae did want to
attend Relief Society in our Ward.  I got on the computer and made my field
trip bids for the week of May 8<sup>th</sup> through May 14<sup>th</sup>.  I
also caught my journal up to date.  We met at Gail’s at 1:15PM and road with
Gail and the kids.  Jeff had already left for Ohio about noon.  Scott and his
family, Mike and his family and Gail and her family plus Mae and I all arrived
at the church house at the same time.  The blessing of Addison Mae Holste went
very well.  We enjoyed the meeting and the Spirit that was there.  After the
meeting both Chelci’s family and Steve’s family all met at Steve and Chelci’s
for diner.  It was a very nice occasion.  It was late when we got home so after
eating I was unable to lay down so I went to sleep in the recliner.  Mae stayed
up working on the computer sorting pictures until I woke at mid-night.  We both
had trouble going to sleep.  I finally went to sleep but Mae was up most of the
night.</p>

well and when I got home Mae was just getting up.  After breakfast Mae had a
hair appointment and then she did some shopping so she was gone most of the
day.  I spent most of the day getting my boat cleaned up and ready to go
fishing tomorrow.  I added braces to the trolling plate to reinforce it.  Mae
picked up her a fishing license while she was shopping.  We invited Kylan to go
with us tomorrow.  We went over to Sportsman’s Warehouse where we got some
fishing equipment for tomorrow.  We enjoyed reading from President Monson’s
book as we drove.  Bob and I met with a tree removal co. and decided to have
them remove the rest of the trees in the back lot.  It will cost $1,600 but I
think it will be worth it.  </p>

got up at 5:30AM and by 7AM were just about ready to leave to go fishing.  I
suddenly realized that we hadn’t registered our boat.  Mae and I drove to the
DMVA in Farmington getting there at 7:30AM and found that they were open.  We
were less than 10 minutes getting it registered.  We stopped and picked up
Kylan on the way back to our place.  We were on the lake shortly after 10AM. 
it was cold and windy but not bad.  Fishing was slow but we did catch 5 fish. 
Kylan caught the first 2 fish and I let one go because it was quite small.  Mae
tried to back the trailer so I could load the boat but she had difficulty so I
parked the boat and helped her out.  We stopped am hour at David and Shauna’s
while getting our safe and file safe.  David had kept them for us while we were
in California.  After letting Kylan off we went to the Chinese Restraint and
ate dinner.  by the time we got the boat put away and all our clothing, fed the
chicks and got the fish cleaned it was after 9PM.  I entered this journal entry
and we went to bed.  </p>

and I went to Tylor’s basket ball game’s.  he played in a double tournament.

got up and took a bus route this morning.  With the help of my GPS and the
children I was able to get the children to each of three schools.  Last night
when I received the call I understood that the run was for the High School and
the Jr. High School.  As I unloaded the Jr. High students I was about to take
the bus back to the compound but then had the feelings to double check the
route sheets.  I then found that I had an elementary school to take children
to.  It went well and I finished on time.  When I got home the tree service was
working out back and they had marvels equipment to do the job.  I did take a
few pictures but then had to get gas in the car and repair the one seat belt so
we could take the car to Brigham City.  Elder and Sister Clark came at 11:30
and we met Karen and Charles Hyer and Marsha and Roland Maharry at Maddock’s in
Brigham City at noon.  We had a wonderful dinner but what was best was the
three hours we enjoyed visiting.  It was also special to ride with the Clark’s
giving us that added time to visit.  Mae and I then left for American Fork
where we met with Mike and Becky and took them out to dinner for Mike’s
Birthday.  That was a wonderful evening being with them.  It was 10 PM when we
got home.  we then went out and fed the chickens for we had not asked Bob to do
it for us today.  We saw that the tree service had completed all the work of
taking out the trees and stumps that we had wanted removed.  It was expensive
but it would have taken me all summer to have done what they did in a day.</p>

pillars.  Mae attended baby showers ant Georgia’s today.  Bob and Carroll
prepared dinner at 5PM for us and Linda.  I was a half hour late getting home
but Jeff and I did git the job finished.  I was very tired when I got home so
after dinner I took a shower and went to bed.  I put the DVD of Amelia Airhart

and Carroll’s love seat into my truck and we took it over to his place.  We
loaded the extra cement into my pickup as I will need cement to set the fence
post.  Bob when with me.  We went to Home Depot and bought fence supplies and
some plumbing parts.  I also stopped at Greens Farm and Feed and purchased some
chicken scratch, layer mash and starter feed along with another feeder for the
chicks.  When we got home I finished repairing the water line.  I installed a
drain in the line so that it will drain when we shut the water off during the
winter.  Hopefully that will solve the problem.  Bob and I then set the fence
post and installed the top rail.  Mae brought some dinner out to me.  It was
after 7PM when I quit and came into the house.  We did watch a J.A.G. series

I came in for lunch I called about my field trip and it is postponed until
tomorrow so I reminded Roberta that I would be on my way to Arizona and would
be unable to take the trip.  Mae went for a Chiropractor treatment and then did
a lot of other chasing.  This afternoon I planted some flowers for Mae, went
around the back yard with the rototiller and trimmed the grass in the back yard
including the rabbit pen area.  we ate dinner and then I took a shower and went
Home Teaching.  We were able to visit the Thurman’s, the Johnston’s but Brother
Casey did not answer the door.  When I got home Mae told me that Scott, Kylan,
Ashley and Kaitlyn are all very sick and would like a Priesthood Blessing.  Mae
went with me although she stayed in the car.  I mat Dennis, Mishellie’s father
there and we gave them the blessings.  Bob had made us some apple pies and we
had a piece before we went to bed tonight.  I filled out this entry and we went

Bride and Groom came out of the Temple.  They are such a good looking couple
and just radiate with love for each other.  The Wedding dinner was held at a
smorgasbord and the food was very good.  One thing that was quite amusing as
the dinner was about over was that I went to the men’s room.  A gentleman asked
me what the large gathering was for and I told him that it was my Grandson’s
wedding dinner.  He then began to talk about his life and I could not get away
from him.  Jeff finally came and told me that Mom was waiting for me to go and
I was relieved to be able to leave.  The reception was held this evening and
very well attended.  Although we know only a small percentage we had a very

but several of the adults joined with them.  I took a nap and when I got up
some had got too much Arizona sun and did get burned.  Nora and Garrett came

airport.  As we approached the airport there was a fellow maybe in his late
20’s or early 30<sup>th</sup> with an artificial leg.  He was at an
intersection with a sign which read “Homeless! Please Help”.  I had just given
all my cash to Sandi for porter tip, so I didn’t have anything to give him.  I
also do not know what my heartfelt feelings are in a case like this.  We had
some trouble getting to the airport entrance but JaNae and Chelci got on their
phones and soon had GPS instructions.  When I returned from taking them to the
airport I went to the chapel and attended Sunday School and Priesthood meeting
with the rest of the family.  After Priesthood meeting, we had the privilege of
going to the Bishops office and participating in the ordaining of Roy to the
office of High Priest in the Melchizedek Priesthood.  Roy has been called to be
the 1<sup>st</sup> councilor in the High Priest Quorum.  Roy’s father ordained
him under the direction of the High Councilman that was assigned by their Stake
President.  Shellie and Roy then had a nice dinner for us.  Roy’s father and I
enjoyed visiting.  Mae and I decided to take a nap but then Mae made a phone
call to David and she never came back as she was afraid of waking me.  This
evening we enjoyed Family Home Evening and Scripture Study with Roy, Shellie

every other way.  </p>

Wal-Mart to compare prices and the problem both will take too long getting here

Mae had got up and went for a walk with Shellie.  I am fighting with depression
and with some pain especially in my right hand.  Roy had arranged for both
Shellie’s and our car to be serviced this morning.   He and Shellie took
Shellie’s car over to the shop and then Roy went to work after returning
Shellie.  I took a shower and while I was in the shower Mae told me that the
garage was ready for our car.  She and Shellie took the car over.  When our car
was finished Mae and I went over to get it.  After bringing Shellie’s car back
Mae and I went for a ride in our car.  We took it on a road that I could get
the speed up above 70 MPH and above to check for wheel vibration.  There was
none so the balancing of the wheels solved the problem.  We stopped and
discussed some of my depression.  I worked my life history several times
today.  Mae and Shellie went shopping at different stores today.  I did watch a
John Wayne movie this afternoon.  It was mid-night before we went to bed.</p>

Mesa Temple.   After the session we ate in the cafeteria before leaving.  We
went to a store in Tempe and bought me a can of Sterling’s Pre-shave and
lubricator as I am about out of it.  We stopped at a grocery store and picked
up a few items before going on home to Shellie and Roy’s.  I am not sure what I
have eaten but I am in quite a bit of moving pain today.  I am going to go to
bed early tonight.</p>

was after 8AM when we got up.  I am feeling some better than I did last night. 
I think that I will go on the Fathers and Sons outing this evening with Roy,
Kevis and Jase.  I spent about 45 minutes bidding on field trips and entering
two bus run that I had taken.  Bruce and Michelin came over at 10:30 and took
Mae and I out to lunch.  They took us to Whole Food’s which is a health food
store.  It is at least 4 X the size of the store we go to in Riverdale.  In the
one section they have a food bar and we selected what we wanted there.  It was
very impressive and very good.  We enjoyed the visit with Bruce and Michelin
and appreciated their hospitality.  Shortly after arriving back to Shellie and
Roy’s I started with quite a bit of pain.  I am not sure where it came from for
I checked the ingredients of each on tray I ate and couldn’t see anything that
should have disagreed with me.  I took some pain pills and went downstairs and
went to sleep.  I changed my mind about going with Roy, Kevis and Jase
camping.  Mae and Shellie wanted to go shopping this evening.  Because Quint
has to work tomorrow morning he did not go with his Father and brothers.  He
and I therefore played a game of chess.  It was a very intense game and I was
afraid that he was going to win.  I had one knight that was free and that
changed the game back around and I was able to win.  Quint and I then watched a
Maverick movie and before going to bed Shellie, Mae and I watched a movie
entitled ‘To Save Sara” which was a cute Amish movie.  </p>

Quint went to work shortly after 8AM.  We then watched a movie entitled “The
Devils Mathematic”.  Shellie, Mae and I also played three handed Rook.  I took
a nap shortly after Roy and the boys got home.  They had a good time on the
Fathers and Sons outing.  After dinner Shellie and Roy took Mae and I out to a
concert at the Mesa Art Center for Mae’s Mother’s Day present.  The program was
Amazing Grace with Collin Raye.  After getting home the four of us went to Wall
Mart for a few things Shellie needed to buy.  Roy and I went just because we
didn’t want Mae and Shellie going this late at night by themselves.  We had
talked about watching a movie tonight but it was too late so we soon went to
bed.</p>

got up and Mae had us some breakfast.  We attended church again with Shellie
and Roy.  Their Bishop had all the graduating youth speak in Sacrament meeting
and they did an excellent job.  Of course we were extra proud of Quint.  This
afternoon Quint, Kevis, Shellie, Mae and I played Monopoly Deal and I was doing
great and was ready to win on my next turn but Shellie won on her turn first. 
Quint and I then played a game of Chess and Quint started out ahead of me but
then I was able to turn the table and again won.  Roy, Shellie, Quint, Kevis,
and Jase went out to eat with the High Priest Group Leadership.  Mae and I
stayed home and had food that would be ok for me.  However she gave me a cookie
that she had made that we thought would be ok but I don’t think it set right. 
We went to the Seminary Graduation program this evening.  During the program my
stomach became upset and my left heal became very sore.  Mae and I came home
earlier that the rest and shortly after we got here Garrett and Nora came. 
When the rest of the family came they showed us their pictures from their Honey
Moon.  They are so cute and special.  By the time we finished seeing pictures I
was in quite a bit of pain.  After having prayers with Mae I went up stairs to
sleep in a recliner.  I dosed off and on but was awake when Roy locked up the
house for the night and then Kevis came up stairs for a snack.</p>

getting up.  After breakfast Mae and Shellie went to look at a school that
would be for Jase next year.  They we quite impressed with it.  I started
watching the show “Anna and the King” and we finished it when Mae and Shellie
returned.  I went down stairs and read “The Message” by Lance Richardson.  I
completed the book and found it very interesting but really didn’t get much new
out of it.  After dinner this evening we joined Shellie, Roy and Jase in
reading the scriptures.  They are reading in the book of Jeremiah and I have a
hard time making a lot of sense as to the meaning of it.  I can’t help wondering
if there is much value in just reading words.  Roy and I played against Shellie
and Mae in a game of Rook.  Shellie and Mae won but it was a night when we all
had poor hands.  We are concerned about our finances.</p>

and got gas for the lawn mower.  I then helped Shellie and Jase get the mower
going and Shellie taught Jase how to mow the lawn.  I rode the bike to
Wal-Mart’s where I got the nose pieces replaced on my glasses.  I made motel
reservations in Flagstaff for Thursday evening.  Because Quint will be having a
graduation party here Thursday evening, we decided to leave for home after the
Graduation Exercises.   Shellie, Mae and I then played Three Handed Rook and
Mae came from minus score to winning the game.  I needed to fill some capsules
so I watched two John Wayne movies while doing so.   Shellie, Mae and I watched
the movie Australia on the big screen.  We had seen it before but still enjoyed
it.  We were mid-night going to bed.</p>

the guys he work with started.  Shellie, Jase, Mae and I played a game of
marbles this evening before we went to bed.  I really feel that something is
wrong when I don’t accomplish much in a day.  I also wonder about my
relationship with Roy.  I just don’t feel that we have much in common in our
personalities.  I’m not sure that I can explain my feelings.  Of course I have
those feelings about a lot of things and it seems to me that the older I get
the more questions about life that I have and cannot explain.  It worries me

I woke later and then took a shower.  We started packing things to go home.  We
plan on leaving right after the Graduation Exercises for Quint this evening.  I
played the computer a game of chess and I won!  We left for ASU about 4:15pm
and found the way ok with just a little problem trying to find where we were to
park.  We had plenty of time to wait for the doors to be opened before we could
go in and find our seats.  We had a good location to see the exercises.  It was
an enjoyable evening.  It took us a little time to find Quint after the program
concluded and then there was time taken for pictures.  It was after 9PM when we
said our goodbyes and left for Flagstaff.  We stopped at a service station to use
the restrooms.  Just as I was getting into the car a young man asked if he
could talk to me a minute.  He was having problems getting to Gilbert where his
mother lived.  He had spent all his money repairing his car and now was all but
out of gas.  I gave him $10 which should give him enough gas to get to
Gilbert.  We left feeling good with that that decision.  We traveled through to
Flagstaff.  Most of the time we traveled we listening to the audio of “The
Brothers” volume #6.</p>

found a café for breakfast.  We took the Kaibab Forest route to go to Kanab and
then on up to the cross over north of Panquige to I-15.  Mae drove a couple of
times to let me take a short nap.  We had stopped for a break at the bridge
crossing the lower Grand Canyon and then again as we left the Kaibab Forest. 
We again stopped at Meadow for gas and to take a few minutes at the cemetery.  It
took a little walking and searching but finally found Grandpa and Grandma
Bushnell’s graves.  We traveled from there through to home getting home after
9PM.  It was late when we got unpacked.  We got a bite to eat and watched the

that white hen didn’t start laying I was going to have her for dinner.  When I
went out to check on the chickens there was a white egg.  We had to laugh at
that.  I tried to trim the lawns but the trimmer won’t keep working.  I got
quite upset at that.  Bob and Carroll prepared cabbage casserole for us for
lunch.  We ate and then left for the Morgan cemetery where we were to meet with
other family members to decorate family graves.  We had quite a few family
members come up to the cemetery and then afterwards we went to the Morgan Park
where we ate lunch.  The weather turned cold and started to rain so we had to
break up the outing.  We stopped at David’s for a few minutes afterwards. 
After visiting there we went down to Jeff and Gail’s.  Jeff was working on his
tree house so I went out and helped him.  It was 9:30PM when we got home.  We
had lessoned to our book of CD’s as we traveled today and finished it after we
got home.  It has been an enjoyable series to listen to.  I caught up my
journal and that took an hour.  I guess we had just better go to bed now.</p>

shouldn’t complain as others have worse problems.  After meetings Mae and I
visited with Sister Fallis to cover both Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching. 
She was excited to tell us about a man she has met and it looks they may even
get married this summer.  I hope it works out for her.  Bob and Carroll
prepared dinner for us.  After eating I came downstairs and took a nap in the
recliner.  I am not sure if is is the weather or something I have eaten that is
causing so much pain.  Mae worked on her pictures this evening while I went up
stairs and watched a movie “G.I. Joe” and it makes me kind of sick to think of
what so many has given so much for and today most just take it for granite.  This

made some Almond Butter while Mae got our pill boxes filled for another week. 
After cleaning up my mess I took care of the chickens and then repaired a short
in Bob and Carroll’s bathroom lights.  We watched a couple of shows this

into Honest Engine to get it repaired.  I went to Lowe’s and purchased some 4”
X 8” X 16” cinder blocks to place on the rear fence to stop chickens from
crawling under the fencing.  We also checked on the prices of weed eaters at a
couple of places.  Mae went shopping while I took a nap.  We took the weed
eater to Honest Engine, and then went to Costco where we bought some
groceries.  We went to Golden Corral to eat dinner.  It was just nice to relax
and be with Mae.  I’m tired so I think I will go to bed.</p>
