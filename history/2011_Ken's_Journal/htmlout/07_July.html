woke a couple of times during the night and the stars were so beautiful that I
really didn’t want to shut my eyes to sleep.  Another thing that I really was
impressed with was the Big Dipper and the North Star.  They look so natural and
my bearings seemed so straight.  They seemed to be out of place when we were in
  California.  I got up shortly after 4AM and woke Nick about 4:30AM when I
started preparing breakfast.  I again cooked up three fish and four eggs for
breakfast.  We were on the lake by 6AM and started fishing just as the sunshine
came on to the water.  We caught the first fish within 5 minutes and about 3
minutes alter caught the 2<sup>nd</sup> fish.  It took us longer between the
rest of the fish but we were off the lake with our limits before 10AM.  The
fish are also running from 12 to 15 inches long.  We had people ask us both
last night and today where we caught the fish and what we were using.  We
didn’t see very many that were catching fish like we were but East Canon seem
to be good to me.  We cleaned the fish, packed up and was home before noon. 
Nick had to hurry and go home in order to get to work this afternoon.  I put
some things away but soon lay down and took a nap.  Mae had taken Emily,
Connor, Ashley, Maddi and Jessie to Dinosaur Park.  Ashley, Maddi &amp; Jessie
also stayed over this evening.  We got our laptop back today but all our
programs and fills are missing.  I will have to have help restoring the
computer.</span></p>

got up early and then went back to bed for a while.  I worked on my journal
entries for a while getting them caught up to date.  We got our laptop back but
now have to get everything reloaded.  I opened the new weed eater and when I
saw the shipping ticket and the total price I called the company.  They charged
me more than it should have been but they told me that the price difference was
because sent me a 24 volt battery instead of the two 12 volts that I had asked
for.  They also refunded the shipping charges because I paid for it in one
payment instead of 3 payments.  After assembling it I tried it out and it works
pretty good.  We will keep it a little longer and see if we like it.  I trimmed
the yards with the hand mower.  Jeff came by and borrowed my wheelbarrow to
move material with.  I worked on the tent trailer repairing the door lock and
checked out a water leak in the shower.  Mae has been busy with the girls today
along with doing some shopping and house work.  It was late when we ate
dinner.  After Mae put the girls to bed we watched “North to Alaska” for the
dozens time, but we still enjoy it.  We had started another movie but it turned
bad right off so we turned it off.  My stomach was to upset to lay down so I
slept in the recliner.  I am quite sure that I was from going so long between
meals and eating so late.</p>

got up early and took a shower and got something to eat.  It is Fast Sunday but
I didn’t feel that I should fast and cause more stomach problems.  The girls
didn’t want to go to Primary so Mae stayed home with them.  We ate dinner with
Bob and Carroll.  After dinner we went to David and Shauna’s where most of our
family gathered for family pictures.  Nick drove all the way out just for the
pictures and then had to leave in order to get to work.  We went to the Morgan
park were we all played games for a couple of hours, then back to David and
Shauna’s for hamburgers and hot dogs.  This evening we watched a movie that we
projected on the back wall of David’s garage.  It was late when we got home.</p>

and I were busy around the house and yard until 3PM.  We then went out to
Grantsville where we joined Sandi and Nick’s family as well as Roy and
Shellie’s family.  We listened to the program at the park in which Chelci
sang.  She did well although the sound system and acoustics had a lot to be
desirable.  Chelci did win 3<sup>rd</sup> place.  We went back to Sandi and
Nick’s where they had grilled t-bone and salmon steaks with the trimmings.  We
went back to Grantsville to watch the fireworks.  They put on a beautiful fireworks
show but in my opinion they shot them off two fast and it was almost a Grand
Faunally from start to finish and it last about 15 minutes and was over. 
Shellie and Roy’s family came home with us for tonight so it was mid-night
before we got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were late getting up but got up to East Canon Reservoir about noon and went out
fishing.  We caught 3 fish before coming in to the Day Camp area for lunch.  We
went back out fishing and fished until 8PM.  We caught another 9 fish so had
quite a nice catch.  Everyone had a good time with all except Shellie and Mae
catching fish.  Even Tasha got into the act of catching fish for she would get
so excited when anyone started too real in and especially if there was a fish
on.  We cleaned the fish up at the reservoir as there is a cleaning station
there.  After getting home I filet about 8 fish to cook for breakfast in the
morning.  We were very tired when we went to bed.</p>

woke up at 7:30 and got started.  I helped Bob as he prepared breakfast of
biscuits and gravy and fried the fish.  We ate breakfast at 9:30AM and then
Mae, Roy, Shellie, Quant, Kevis and Jase went to Lagoon.  I worked on the camp
trailer repairing the plumbing and then installed a low voltage outlet in the
boat.  I also replaced the electric cord on the downrigger as it was two short
and was pulling on the outlet when changing the position of the boom.  It was
almost 10PM when I finished and quite for the night.  I watched a show on the
arrest of Geronimo on TV.  The family came home from Lagoon about 11PM.  It was

return.  Roy &amp; Shellie pulled our boat and I pulled the tent trailer. 
After arriving at Lava, we went to the Smith Trout Haven where we camped. 
After setting up camp, we went down to the hot mineral baths.  Mae &amp; I
returned to the camp about 9 pm.  Scott &amp; Mishelle and their children had
just arrived.  I helped them set up their camp trailer.  It was 11 pm before
Sandi, Roy, Shellie, Quint, Kevis &amp; Jase came back to camp.</p>

&amp; I prepared breakfast then we all went into town where we rented tubes and
went river running.  I shuttled everyone back and forth in our truck.  While
waiting, I stopped at a store and purchased a few groceries.  We finished up
about noon.  Some of fus ate lunch at camp and some ate in town.  We helped
Sandi , Shellie &amp; Roy pack up and they left for Island Park.  Jeff &amp;
Gail came up this evening about 6 pm.  Mae &amp; I cooked Dutch Oven chicken
&amp; veggies for everyone.  We set up our projector  with Scott’s laptop
computer and Jeff’s speakers and watched a movie this evening “Family Man”
which was good, but still worldly.  It really got cold before we went to bed.</p>

and it had to be cleaned so they closed the pool.  Mae &amp; I played games
with Jeff and Gail.  We really enjoyed being with our family.  Jeff &amp; I set
up our tent and packed the trailer so Jeff could pull it home for me.  They
left for home about 6 pm.  Scott, Mishelle &amp; family roasted hot dogs and
marshmallows this evening.  I had packed our cooking tools in the tent trailer,
which was now gone, so I went with Scott and we found some willows and cut a
couple of sticks for them to roast their hot dogs and marshmallows.  Mae and I
slept in the tent and did quite well.</p>

&amp; I attended Sacrament Meeting at the Lava ward.  The meeting was very good
with a new Deacon speaking and he did very well.  A couple that were just
released from serving in a singles ward for four years.  We came back and I
packed while Mae fixed lunch.  Scott &amp; Mishelle also packed and left at the
same time.  Ashley was so cute and several times said “You’re the best Grandma
&amp; Grandpa ever.”  It has been great being with them.  We left about 2 pm. 
We went by way of Soda Springs to Star Valley, on to Jackson then through Teton
National Park and Yellowstone Park and to Cody, Wyoming where we called Veldon
and Patsy Seymore.  They had invited us, Roy, Shellie &amp; family and Sandi
&amp; Dawson to stay with them.  Roy &amp; Shellie wanted to come here to visit
Roy’s parents who are serving a 3 month church mission here.  It was 10:30 pm
when we got there.  We enjoyed visiting with Patsy and Veldon while we waited
for Shellie, Roy &amp; Sandi to arrive.  It was after midnight before they got
here.</p>

left before 8:00 am.  Shellie, Roy &amp; boys didn’t get up until about 9 am. 
Mae and Shellie fixed breakfast.  After Patsy &amp; Veldon returned, we went to
the church museum.  A non member printed beautiful murals of church history. 
He was asked to come and look at the rotunda at the church.  He studied it and
said he would paint his masterpiece.  He studied our church history for over a
year before starting to paint it.  It is spectacular.  The artist’s name is
Edward T. Grigware.  His wife made him promise that he wouldn’t join the LDS
church, but you can tell that he was inspired as he painted this mural.  Patsy
and Veldon serve as missionaries here and take visitors through tours of this
building.  We went to Patsy and Veldon’s for sandwiches and then went to the
Buffalo Bill Cody Museum.  It is 5 museums in one and was great!  We watched a
“poor” western gun fight in downtown Cody.  Mae &amp; I went grocery shopping
while Shellie, Roy and Sandi went gift shopping and Patsy and Veldon went home to
fix dinner for us.  We didn’t eat until 9 and played games afterward.</p>

(Mae) fixed breakfast while the two of us.  The others either didn’t want much
breakfast and Shellie, Roy and Sandi &amp; Dawon had a continental breakfast at
the motel.  I had a box of Crunch Berries so Kevis and especially Jase loved
that.  We packed up and said our goodbyes to Veldon &amp; Patsy and headed out. 
It rained heavy most of the way through Yellowstone and Teton Parks.  We
stopped for a buffalo who was walking down the road.  We had to go out around
him.  We ate in Jackson Hole and were blessed to rent a “suite” which held all
of us and we were allowed to have the dogs – Tasha &amp; Paris with us.  It
only cost us $275.00 plus tax, which was also a blessing as Jackson Hole is an
expensive tourist town.  We didn’t dare camp, like we had planned, since it was
raining so hard.  After supper, the boys and Ken went back to the motel to get
in the hot tub while Shellie, Roy, Sandi and I went shopping in the many gift
shops.  I finally decided to buy a T shirt, like the others were doing.  It was
fun being with them and then we continued to walk around and window shopped.   When
we got back to the motel, we changed into our swimming suits and went over to
the hot tub.  Ken was in his PJs watching TV and the boys were watching TV
upstairs.  After the rest of us showered and were in PJs, Ken, Sandi and I
played a moose dice game and then we played Rook with Shellie.  It was 12:30

We decided not to camp on the “boat-in-camp site, that we had reserved, since
it was threatening to rain and the forest ranger in Manila suggested we stay at
the nearby campground at Sheep Creek.  She was sure they had campsites open
there.  We found a nice one with pine trees so after setting up camp.  Mae and
I prepared Dutch Oven chicken and veggies and had it ready when the family
returned.  They returned early as a storm came up.  It was raining on us too

Sheep Creek.  Within an hour I had caught 4 fish.  Mae came and got me and that
was a good thing for I was tempted to continue for a little longer even though
I had caught my limit.  We ate breakfast, packed up and left for home.  We got
home about 3 or 3:30 pm  We unpacked and put most things away.  I also spent
some time working on the wiring of a new boat electrical connection as I had
not plugged the boat in when we loaded the boat last night and the plug drug as
we returned to camp.  It was wrecked so I purchased a new plug in Evanston.  I
repaired it when we got home.  I had to drive without tail lights or turning
lights on the boat trailer coming home.  We watched a show on TV while eating dinner

went to the church a half hour early to help set up chairs.  The only problem
is that the priesthood leaders had already set the chairs up.  It’s hard to
know if I should go each Sunday morning as this is the 2<sup>nd</sup> time I
have gone and both times the job was already done.  When I asked about it, they
indicated we needed to be there before 8 am.  I have got to think this over. 
We enjoyed meetings.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner of cabbage
casserole.  This afternoon we took a nap and this evening we played Canasta

fried Zucchini for breakfast at 9:30 am.  This afternoon I tried to restore the
files on our laptop computer, but was unable to so we took it to Staples. 
After watching them get the backiup started, there was no doubt in my mind that
I could never have done it on my own.  We had to leave it overnight and will
get it tomorrow.  We were tired so I took Mae out to dinner at Golden Coral. 
After eating, we went up to Jeff’s and got our tent trailer.  Jeff didn’t have
an electrical converter for the trailer to the truck so we drove partway home
without lights working on the trailer.  I stopped at Auto Zone and bought the
needed adapter.  We were tired when we got home so soon started getting ready
for bed.</p>

pm and so it was after 7 pm  before we got up to East Canyon Resivour.  We set
up camp and then went out fishing until 9 pm.  Dawson did catch 2 fish, but

for breakfast.   We packed the camping equipment up after breakfast and then
went back out fishing.  Nick caught a fish this time just before we quit to go
home.  We got home about 2 pm and Nick, Sandi &amp; the girls had to leave as
Nick had to go to work.  Mae, Sandi and the girls went to the park across the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:27.0pt'>I woke at 7:30AM and Mae was
already up.  After reading my scriptures we went back to bed for a while. 
After breakfast we went out to the garden for a while and I turned water on the
back area.  We are still trying to get our computer set up again.  After some
time I got the pictures that Scott had downloaded plus the pictures that were
on our camera downloaded.  There has got to be a better way to do some of these
things.  I later checked on the external hard drive for Power Point
Presentations that we had made for the training in the Philippines.  Elder and Sister Drover have been called to serve in the Philippines doing leadership training.  They would like to have a copy of our files to take
with them.  I guess that some one just as well use them.  This evening we had
Charles and Carolyn Saunders over for dinner and after eating we played games. 
They are a neat couple.  We watched a J.A.G. movie before going to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae woke at 7AM and went out and dried her
windows and I woke at 8AM.  We decided that we were still tired so we went back
to bed and slept until 9:30AM.  I filed the one fish we brought home from
fishing Wednesday and fried it along with eggs for breakfast.  We did a little
around the house and then went shopping.  We stopped at the post office and at
Staple’s and then went to the D.I. and looked for suits.  We didn’t find one at
the Layton so we went to the Bountiful store.  I ended up buying three suites,
2 pair of pants and Mae a suite, a summer outfit, and a gray wool skirt all for
less than $100.00.  We then went out to eat at the Chuck-A-Rama.  This evening
we went to the rodeo in at the Ogden Stadium.   We really enjoyed it and had
such a fun evening being together.  It was late when we got home but we decided
to watch a show anyway.  It was a good western movie and we did enjoy that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I slept in until almost 9AM.  Mae had gotten
up at 7AM and dried her windows then went back to sleep in the guest room and
slept longer.  We had to hurry as we wanted to see a movie at the theater in Layton that starts at 11:15AM.  We were able to make it in time.  The movie was “17
Miracles” and it was an outstanding movie about the Willies Hand Cart Co.  It
left me with the question as to why I have it so good.  They gave so much, in
fact their all, for their faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints and yet I have so much.  We returned home and got some lunch.  I then
went to Jeff’s and the two of us worked on his tree house building steps.  We
ran out to time as they had friends coming over for the evening.  On the way
home I stopped at the RV lot and looked at a Winnebago RV for sale.  It looks
pretty good and for under $5,000.  Mae and I attended Wanda Miller’s summer
yard party.  This evening we worked on my journal and Mae tried to get on the
inter-net but it looks like out wireless card has gone out on the Desktop
computer.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went over to the chapel and set up
chairs.  When I got home Mae had some breakfast ready.  We attended our
meetings and when we got home Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner.  I took a
nap but Mae helped Carroll with the dishes before coming downstairs and then
she worked on the computer.  This evening Sandi and Nix came and we cooked steaks
on the grill.  After eating we played yard games and then came in and played
table games.  We had a very enjoyable evening.  They stayed overnight with us.

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We got up before 7AM and started breakfast. 
I filed four trout that I fried and also fried eggs.  We ate breakfast about
8AM and then after eating we turned the TV onto the Salt Lake 24<sup>th</sup>
of July parade which we enjoyed for over an hour.  We went to the theater in
Layton when we met Mike, Mattie and Jessie.  We all went to the movie “17
Miracles”.  Although it was Mae’s and my second time to see it, it was still
just as enjoyable.  I hope the rest enjoyed it as much as I did.  Sandi and
Nike went home after the movie.  Mike and his girls came on home with us.  As I
went past the RV Company on Main Street I noticed that the RV that I had looked
at Friday was not there.  I guessed that someone had already bought it.  It was
very enjoyable having Mike and the girls here with us.  While Mike was here he
also helped us to get our computer working.  We also went over to Wal-Mart and
bought a 25 foot cord to hook our desk top computer directly to our internet
terminal.  Mike brought us copies of some of the pictures that we had taken of
our family when Shellie and Roy were here.  He was able to send Costco our
Family picture and they enlarged it and made us copies.  It was a little before
6PM when Mike and the girls left.  Mae insisted that we got up and check on the
RV.  They still had it so we checked it out.  It looks pretty good but before
the evening was over we have about decided that we can’t afford it.  I called
and visited with Lois and she said that they figured that they averaged 6 to 7
miles per gallon on gas when driving their RV.  I typed my journal entry on the
Laptop computer this evening with the 2010 version of Word.  It sure felt more
normal.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up about 1:30AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I tried sleeping in the
recliner but couldn’t.  I finally turned the computer on and got the entries I
made on the desk top, while we have been getting our laptop repaired,
transferred over to my laptop.  I also got some icons set up for Chess, Rummy
and Harts.  I tried to sleep again about 5AM and did sleep some.  At 7 AM I
again woke and wiped the water off the windows.   I went back to bed and Mae
got up.  I fell asleep and slept until 10AM.  I repaired the lawn mower and the
garage door lock.  This afternoon I went to the RV store and got our deposit
back on the RV we thought about buying.  I think that my thinking about the RV
is what kept me awake most of last night.  I purchased new battery for the tent
trailer, a grill for the camp stove, chicken feed and some covers for the grill
and stove.  Besides taking care of the normal house hold duties, Mae also typed
into my journal the entries that we had recorded on note pad while our laptop
computer was in being repaired and the period while we were getting the
programs reloaded.  She is sure a special wife and sweetheart and takes such
good care of me.   This evening we watch a movie on DVD before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 6:30 AM and found a note that Mae hadn’t been able to go to sleep.  We
had stayed up until mid-night watching a movie and her note said that she would
try to sleep again at 3:30 AM.  I let her sleep and wiped the windows down for
her.  She wipes the water from the sprinklers off the windows every morning
before the sun bakes it off and leaves the windows covered with hard water
spots.  After getting me some breakfast I went outside and trimmed the yard
with the small lawnmower so that Bob could more easily mow with the rider
mower.  We also mowed the back area.  Mae slept in until almost 10 AM.  She got
the trimming down while I sprayed all the fence lines and driveway for grass
and weeds.  Mae did get some lunch prepared shortly after noon and then she
went Visiting Teaching.  I watched “A River Ran Through” during lunch and while
Mae was gone.  It was a good movie but it was a little rough with language. 
This afternoon I worked on the stairs for Jeff’s tree house.  This evening Bob
and I Went Home Teaching.  I felt impressed to take some consecrated oil with
us and at Patriarch Johnston’s he asked for a blessing.  I was very glad that I
had followed the prompting.  Mae has spent quite a bit of time getting her
journal caught up to date and she still has a ways to go.  I made this entry
before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept ok last night and got up about 6:30AM.  Mae thought that she would
be going up to David and Shawna’s to be with Emily and Conner today but they
wanted to come here instead.  Shauna brought them down on her way to work.  Mae
enjoyed being with them and spent most of the day with them.  I worked most of
the morning on cutting Jeff stair jacks for the tree house.  I then spent 2 or
3 hours working on Bob and Carroll’s problem with the IRS.  I need to get some
information from Roy but we have tried several times to get through to them. 
Mae and I took the stairs up to Jeff’s and also took a birthday gift up for
Mathew who turns 2 today.  Gail invited us to have dinner with them.  Jeff is still
in Ohio and will return Friday.  On the way home we did some shopping at Good
Earth and Sportsman Warehouse.  After getting back home we tried again to reach
Roy and Linda but couldn’t get through.  We finally called Barbara and
Russell.  Russell said that he would try to locate them and have them call us. 
I finished this entry and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 1:30AM from a sexy dream and Mae just told me to go back to sleep.  I
ended up sleeping in the recliner but that didn’t help as I thought about
fishing.  All in all I didn’t get much sleep.  Bob and I left at 5:45AM to fish
on East Canon Reservoir.  Fishing was slow but Bob caught 5 fish and I caught
only one.  It was interesting as I let Bob use my favorite set of Pop-Gear and
after he caught 4 fish I traded him outfits and he still caught another fish. 
I also was the one that baited both hooks so it wasn’t the differences of
baiting.  Who knows but it is interesting.  We helped another boater that had
backed over his tow rope and tangled it around the prop.  We got home soon
after 4PM very tired.  I came in and talked to Mae for a minute and then I lay
down and took a nap.  I was awaken about 5:20PM by someone calling a wrong
number.  Bob and I put the boat away.  Mae had dinner ready by the time I came
in.  After dinner I called Roy and discussed Bob and Carroll’s tax problem.  We
will have to reestablish their 2009 tax return and then we can solve the
problem.  I explained to both Bob and Carroll as to what information they will
have to call for.  I entered this journal entry before Mae and I retired for
the night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 6:30AM and although I was still tired I got up.  It was a fairly
relaxed Saturday and we did get a few things done.  I filed the fish from
yesterday and Bob cooked fish and fried potatoes for breakfast.  Mae worked in
the garden for a while before breakfast.  I took some fish to the Johnston’s
and the McPhee’s.  I then went up to Serria RV and exchanged the battery box
lid.  They have a camper for the pickup so I asked Mae if we should look at
it.  It is quite nice but it won’t fit on our pickup the way the CMG tank
fits.  I don’t know if we can make changes or not.  I got the new batteries and
box’s installed on our tent trailer.  We went out to eat this evening at the
Golden Corral.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                With
it being Sunday morning I hurried and got ready and went to the chapel to help
set up chairs.  I came back and got Mae.  Because it looked like there might be
a chance of rain we drove this morning.  We enjoyed the meetings but Mae was
quite anxious about Sacrament meeting because she was asked to lead the music
in the meeting.  She has practiced all week in preparation for it and did quite
well.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner.  After dinner I came downstairs
and took a nap.  I wanted Mae to join me but she started preparing for David’s
family to come for dinner this afternoon.  When I woke up I helped he and she
did have a nice meal prepared.  I set up the picnic table so that we could eat
outside.  I cooked the steak and the chicken and helped where I could.  We had
a wonderful evening with our family.  It was fun to listen to David talk about
his schooling experience.  He is enjoying it so much and doing very well.  I
have certainly been blessed with a wonderful wife and sweetheart and I love her
so much.  We turned on a movie on TV and watched the end of it before going to
bed.  Mae also sent an e-mail to our family inviting all of them for breakfast
next Saturday.</p>
