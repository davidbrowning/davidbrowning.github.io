were up early as Mae is going to tend Jeff and Gale’s children while Gale fly’s
back to Ohio to meet Jeff.  They will do some looking for a place to rent
there.  It is pretty defendant that Jeff will be transferred back to
Greensville with his work.  Bob is going to drive Gale to the airport as I have
a bus run to go on this morning.  I road on the bus, that I will sub on tomorrow. 
This afternoon I drove a field trip, taking Syracuse High school’s foot ball
team to Riverton High.  It was a good run but when I got back I had quite a
mess to clean up in the bus.  Mae was about ready to leave to take the children
home when I got home.  After she got to Jeff and Gale’s home and put the
children to bed she realized that she had left her suite case in Bob’s car this
morning.  Bob has gone to Idaho so she is out of luck!  I entered some bidding
for field trips and entered some payroll before going to bed.</p>

got up and had time to read my scriptures and say prayer before going to the
bus shop.  I drove a route this morning and all went well.  After returning
home I took time to do some studding on our lesson for Sunday.  I had some
extra time before taking the afternoon run so I started a game of chess.  I
made one very bad move and the computer beat me.  The biggest problem was that
I got so engrossed in the game that time slipped by.  I really had to hurry to
make the afternoon run.  I think I fudged almost every traffic law in my rush
to get to the school, still being about 5 to 7 minutes late getting there on
time.  I was able to call in and have the school informed so a teacher was with
the children waiting for me.  In taking the Jr. High students home I missed a
turn so had to vary from the regular route a little.  Mae was with Jeff and
Gale’s children again today.  She took them to Dinosaur Park this afternoon. 
When I got home Ben wanted me to play with him outside for a little while.  I
first sprayed the weeds in the north section of the yard with a weed killer. 
This evening we took the children out to eat at the Golden Corral.  They really
were good and enjoyed it.  We then went to the Layton park for a while where we
fed the ducks, went for a walk and let them play on the toys.  At 8PM we took
them to Gale’s mother who will tend then until Jeff and Gail returns Sunday. 
We were tired when we got home but stayed up and watched a movie on TV before
going to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep very well so I got up, read my scriptures and then dried the
windows.  I then type yesterday’s journal entry.  I played the computer a game
of chess and towards the end I could see that it had me beat so I resigned.  I
made almond butter today.  This afternoon I went out and weeded the garden and
picked strawberries.  Mae has been busy washing clothes and getting things for
us to leave tomorrow.  We did take time to go over our lesson for tomorrow.  After
the tempter decreased this evening I went out and weeded the garden and then
picked the strawberries.  I also picked some tomatoes to take with us tomorrow
when we got to St. George.  Mae gave me a hair cut this evening and then we
watched a show on TV.  I found a copy of a talk given by Boyd K. Packard “The
Family and Eternity” and I made me a copy of this talk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
attended our regular Sunday meetings.  During Sunday school time we taught our
first class in Family History.  We had video clips to show the class so we got
the TV and DVD player from the library; however the machine did not work very
well. So that caused us a lot of frustrations and lost time.  I plan on making
corrections to this situation before our next class.  I really enjoyed hearing
and gaining strength from the testimonies that were born today.  I was brought
to tears when one young boy, less than 10 years old, said that his parents had
been fighting to the point that the police had to be called three times.  We
had heard about this situation from neighbors in that area.  He said that he
was so concerned that he prayed and now he doesn’t think they will get a
divorce.  That was about the total that he said but my heart went out to him
and his siblings.  Other testimonies were very inspirational.  It was a very
good meeting.  After returning home we got some lunch and packed thing up for
our trip to St. George.  It was 2:35 PM when we finished and left.  We drove
through with a stop in Fillmore to use a rest room.  While there we did but
some frozen yogurt, which we did enjoy.  Mae drove from there and I took a nap. 
Shortly before getting to Washington we traded and I drove on.  The condo that
Bob and Pauline are using is in a new area of Washington so our GPS could not
find it.  We stopped at a gas station and I talked to a clerk there.  She
couldn’t find it on the phone maps and as I left she just said good luck.  We
called Bob and Pauline’s phone and they did have it on so we were able to fine
them.  We had an enjoyable evening with them.  It was almost mid-night when we
went to bed.</p>

didn’t get up until after 6AM.  After the normal morning routine Mae and I went
walking in the area for a while.  When we returned to the condo I entered
yesterday’s journal on the computer while Mae prepared breakfast.  After
breakfast Mae and I went for a walk.  After returning to the condo I played
three games of games of chess on the computer and the computer won two of
them.   Bob, Pauline, Mae and I played a game of Pit.  We then went into St.
George where we visited the Brigham Young home and then the Jacob Hamblin
home.  We ate after returning to the condo then played some card games. 
Pauline went into the water at the swimming pool but the rest of us were not
that brave.  The water was quite cool this evening as we have had cloud cover
all day.  We enjoyed visiting and ended up watching the news.  We were after
11PM getting to bed.</p>

before leaving for the St. George Temple.  We went on the 10AM session and had
a very spiritual session.  After the session we walked around the Temple
grounds for a little while visiting with others and taking pictures.  We went
into the visitor center for a little while then went for dinner.  As I visited
with the Sister Missionary that met us, I found that her father was from the
Philippines.  That gave us something in common and I enjoyed visiting with her.
  From the Temple we  went to the Golden Corral and enjoyed a very good
dinner.  We enjoyed being with Bob and Pauline.  We stopped at what use to be
the cotton mill but now is a privately owned nursery.  I really enjoyed looking
at and talking about that old building.  We came on back to the condo where Mae
and Pauline laid down and took a nap.  Bob and I enjoyed just visiting about gospel
principles.  About 6PM Mae, Pauline and I went over to the pool and took a
swim.  I wasn’t very long when I came back and after changing I worked on the
computer.  Mae made us some dinner and then we played a game of Mormon Bridge
before retiring for the night.</p>

have finished reading  the Book of Mormon again and the past couple of days for
my Scripture study I have been reading scriptures that I have found special
meanings to me.  I have also been meditating and have concerns about the
assignment I have to speak in Sacrament meeting the end of this month.  After
breakfast I had a headache so I lie down and fell asleep for over an hour.  Mae
woke me and we soon left for today’s activities.  We drove to Pine Canyon and
really enjoyed that area.  We stopped and ate our lunch and then went to the
“Mountain Meadow Manicure” area.  We really enjoyed seeing the monuments and
memorial areas that the Church has been mainly instrumental for erection in
that area.  I had read an account of the events that had happened there but had
never known just where it occurred.  On the way back we went through “Snow
Canyon” and over to the Tuacahn Theater where we will go tonight.  We went back
to the condo and ate some dinner before returning to the Tuacahn Theater for
the show of “The Little Mermaid”.  The play was very well performed and we felt
very rewarded to have been able to attend.  It was mid-night when we ot back to

there we got two frozen yogurts.  That was really too much, but we enjoyed it. 
I think both of felt the affects the rest of the day.  We stopped for a couple
of hours at Mike’s and enjoyed visiting with his family even though he was not
there.  We got home about 6PM and Roy and Linda drove in just as we were
getting out of the car.  We visited with them until 10PM.  I then got on the
computer and printed of my field trip assignments for next week.  I typed this

and worked in the garden.  I went shopping for a speaker set for our laptop
computer so that we can use our computer and projector for our Family History
class.  Bob prepared lunch for us and also Roy and Linda.  After lunch Mae and
Linda worked on the inter-net trying to get Linda registered on family search. 
Mae and I worked on our lesson for Sunday.  We did stop long enough to watch a
movie on TV.  I called Sandy so that we could order some fruit through her,
also to set up a time that they could borrow our projector.  It was after 10PM

the IRS was not open today.  He stayed and had breakfast with us.  I really
feel that he and Linda are along way apart in their marriage relationship but I
do not have any idea how to help them.  As I am around others I really
appreciate the relationship that Mae and I have.  Mae went to an open house and
demonstration about healthy living.  I did some studding on my talk for the 25<sup>th</sup>
of this month.  I became quite sleepy so laid in the recliner and took a nap. 
This afternoon I picked tomatoes for Mae.  I also picked extra vegetables and
we took them to the Stake Family Fun day.  Mae and I put up a batch of tomatoes
this evening.  We also watched a John Wayne movie on TV.  Before going to bed

lunch and then we went Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching to Leslie Fallis. 
We also stopped and had a short visit with Cassey’s.  When we returned home I
took a nap.  This afternoon Irven and Sandy, Bob, Roy, Mae and I had dinner
together.  Linda came over a little later and visited for a while.  Roy, Irven
and I decided to play a game of Knock but Roy was hurting too much to play. 
Because Roy is going to go with Bob in the morning to the IRS he stayed here
tonight.  Mae and I took Linda over to her Mothers.  This is an interesting

mask.  I am not sure if they didn’t receive their training for the IRS because
they didn’t make much since either.  I took a nap when I got home.  This
afternoon Bob and I mowed the lawns.  Mae and I went to Georgia and Rick’s. 
Bryce, Deanna, Kim and Jeannine also came.  We had dinner and then talked about

asked why, she asked me if I had ever driven a new conventional bus.  I said
that I hadn’t so she called someone else and said that I needed to be trained

I took a nap while waiting for the game to get over.   It was after 8PM when I

got up and prepared breakfast, and then Mae, Gale and the children went to
church in Springfield.  Jeff and I stayed in camp and packed thing up to move
to the tent trailer area.  We got all moved over before the rest returned from
church.  We just stayed around camp this afternoon.  Jeff and Gale took a nap
and while they did Mae and I took the kids for a short walk.  Jeff and I stood
Mae and Gale in a game of Rook.  Jeff and I won the first game but before going
to bed we played a second game which Jeff and I lost within four hands without
Mae and Gale even taking a hand.</p>

woke at 3AM and went to the bathroom.  It was such a beautiful night that I was
up until 4AN just praying and enjoying the stars and just amazed with the great
creations of our Heavenly Father.  It was almost 9AM before we got up and
prepared breakfast.  We all road the shuttle bus to the Zion Lodge area and
walked to Emerald Pools.  After returning from that hike Jeff and I went to
town so that I could get on the Davis School District so that I could bid on
next week’s field trips.  We tried a Internet Store, the Springdale Library and
the drove to Hurricane before we got an internet connection where I could enter
my bids.  We also bought a charger cord for my cell-phone and some groceries
before coming back to camp.  This evening we cooked hot dogs on a open fire,
for dinner.  Of course Mae fixed salads and trimmings to go with them.  After
putting the children down to bed we again played a game of Rook.  Mae and Gale
again won Jeff and I.  </p>

children.  After breakfast we went for a walk along the river.  We used the
strollers for the two little children.  Ben enjoyed walking and carrying his
net.  He kept trying to catch lizards.  He did catch one and a butter fly
before we got back to camp.  When we got back to camp Jeff and Gale had
returned.  We had lunch and then everyone but me went to the river to play in
the water.  I took a nap and then tried working on my talk.  I am having a real
struggle with this talk.  I found that a squirrel was trying to eat its way
through the screen netting over a window of the tent trailer.  Had I not seen
it, it would have succeeded in another minute or two.  They are getting to be a
real pest.  All the family returned about 5PM so any more concentration on my
talk went out.  This evening Mae prepared the vegetables and I cooked a Dutch
oven dinner.  This evening Jeff and I got into a good discussion about life and
creation.  It is so suppressing to me that Satan can get such a hold on mans
mind that they cannot or will not see the greatness of God.  Each night I will
wake during the night and got to the rest rooms.  I have difficulty going back
to bed because I just stand in amazement looking at the stars and thinking of
the marvels power that controls the universe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
all got up early and ate breakfast.  We then went to the flag pole by the
visitors center where we loaded on a bus and took a Ranger Guided tour of the
main cannon road.  We stopped and the ranger would take us off the bus and
explain various items of the park.  Our rangers name was Jackland and she was
very enjoyable.  The first stop was shortly after turning North at Junction. 
We stopped and she pointed out the massive land slide that originally dammed
the Virgin River, backing it up clear to the Narrow’s.  Again in 2000 a much
smaller slide but did back the water up.  It blocked tourist from leaving the
Zion Lodge for a day and then it was several days later that they were able to
get the cars out.  We saw how the re-dredging of the rivers flow and building
solid channeling by the CCC Camp workers has changed the washing out areas and
protecting the road and walk ways, but now they are realizing that epically the
cotton wood trees are dying from lack of water.  It was interesting for me to
see how the lack of wisdom of man in the control of nature.  We did see wild
turkey and mule deer as we came into the Zion’s Lodge area.  We stopped at the
Big Bend area and saw the construction of ancient Indians in the area.  While
there I saw 4 California Condor’s that were flying high around Angel Landing.  
These birds almost became extinct (down to 23) but due to conservation efforts
there are now about 400 and the Zion’s area is where many are coming to live. 
It was after noon when we returned to camp.  While Mae was preparing lunch I
fell asleep for a little while.  After lunch I let Mae take a nap while I did up
the dishes.  I tried to enter this entry while outside but the sun was so light
that I couldn’t see the computer screen.  We had a couple of squirrels that are
pest in camp.  I decided to catch one of them and so used the transport cages
and tied a string to it.  We baited the cage and it wasn’t long until we had
one go for it.  He was really shook up for a few minutes until I let him go
free.  We then drove up through the tunnel where we parked and hiked up
observation point.  It was a fairly easy hike and Ben and Rachael hiked most of
the way.  When we came back down, on the South side of the canon was a young
mountain goat that Gale and I watched for a while.  It climbed the face of the
canon with ease and was enjoyable to watch.  After getting back to camp we got
something to eat and put the children to bed.  Jeff, Gale, Mae and I played a
game of Rook which the girls won again.  </p>

and I got up a little earlier so we could hike to Hidden Canyon.  Jeff took
Gale and the children into St. George where Gale and the children will continue
with Gale’s mother to California to see a sister that lives there.  Jeff wasn’t
sure just when he would get back to camp.  Mae and I made the hike and really
enjoyed it.  We took our time actually starting the trail about 9:15 AM.  The
distance to the mouth of the canon was listed as a two mile round trip with a
ascent of 850 feet.  We did go into the canon quite a ways on a non-maintained
trail until I became concerned for Mae’s safety in climbing rocks.  On the way
back we again just took our time enjoying being together.  It was near 1PM when
we got back to the shuttle.  We stopped at the Zion’s Lodge and got something
to eat for lunch.  After getting back to camp we changed into our swimming
suits and went to the river where we took a bath.  It really felt good to get
clean and also to cool off.  We hadn’t been back very long when Jeff came
back.  He got something to eat and then went up the canon to hike the Angle
Landing trail.  The trip indicated a 4 hour hike but Jeff made it in 2 hours. 
When he came back he didn’t feel like sleeping so he left for home.  We got
some things packed up to leave in the morning before we went to bed.</p>

got up at 7AM this morning.  Mae hadn’t gone to sleep until after 2AM so she
didn’t get much sleep.  It was 11AM before we left Zion’s park.  We drove to
Ephraim where we got two doe’s and a buck from Taylor’s Rabbit farm.  When we
had accepted the mission call to California I had given Diane Taylor my buck
and two does as well as several kits on the condition that we could get a new
start when we returned home.  This seemed to be the time to get rabbits started
again so we went out of our way to get them.  We then went to Mike and Becky’s
so that we could wish Mattie a Happy Birthday.  We visited there for about an
hour.  We then traveled on towards Sandi’s.  we needed to pick up our projector
and some fruit that Sandi had got for us.  When we called Sandi to let her know
that we were coming she offered to meet us at the truck stop in Lake Point to
save us some time.  She also picked up some KFC chicken for us as we hadn’t
stopped for anything to eat for super.  That really helped but it was still
10PM when we got home.  It was mid-night before we unpacked the essentials, put
the rabbits into their cages and got to bed.  We were both very tired.  Mae had
driven part way to let me sleep for an hour but when she tried to sleep the
phone kept ringing with different ones calling to see where we were.  It was
almost a joke that all the calls came in one after another and when Mae tried
to sleep.</p>

until 6:15.  We attended our Ward block and taught our Family History class. 
We came home after our meetings just long enough to feed the chickens and check
on the rabbits.  Mae went with me to the 16<sup>th</sup> Ward where I had a
speaking assignment.  We did get the building location mixed up and went first
to the Chapel on 800 North.  We went in and soon realized we were at the wrong
building.  We stopped at our Chapel and found that it was also the 16 Ward
Chapel.  My talk went fairly well although I almost completely changed it when
I got up.  We stopped at home for a minute and got the lunch that Mae had
packed.  We ate it as we went up the David and Shauna’s ward in Enterprise. 
Emily and Connor participated in the Primary Sacrament program.  Emily sang
with five other girls and she and another girl also played their violins for
part of the accompaniment of one song.  It was good to be with David and his
family for a little while.  We stopped at Jeff’s and visited with him for a
little while before coming on home.  We did watch a movie on TV this evening
that was pretty good but it sure made me appreciate the Gospel of Jesus Christ
and the hope we have.  I also realized how much I Love my sweet wife.  I
finished catching my journal up to date before we went to bed.</p>

lunch.  I made up some capsules of our food supplement.  We invited Bob to have

on time.  The run went well even thought on the High School run the first three
pickup stops, there was no one there.  I called dispatch to let them know and
was informed that Tuesdays are late in days for Layton High so to continue the
route.  The 4<sup>th</sup> stop there was one girl and she helped me find the
next stop.  That was another girl and she helped me with the rest of the
route.  The Jr. High route and the Elementary route’s went well.  I was low on
fuel when I returned to the bus compound but when I went to fill up there was
no gas card.  I checked with dispatch to find out if I was going to also run the
afternoon routes and was told that I would.  Mae and I had appointments with
Deanna Davis for treatments at 10AM.  When we came home I did get ½ hour nap
time.  Bob prepared liver and onions for lunch and of course he prepared
chicken for Mae.  The afternoon runs went well.  When I got home Mae was busy
putting up fruit so I helped her for a while.  Before eating dinner I took a

Mae with putting up fruit.  I took care of the chickens and rabbits.  The new
chickens are starting to lay and now we are getting 6 to 7 egg per day.  The
old hens have completely quite laying so I hope that I can kill then Friday. 
The Knudsen’s have extra tomatoes so I went over and picked a bushel of them. 
Mae went Visiting Teaching, ran some errons and then went over and helped the
Knudsen’s get registered on New Family Search.  Bob and I mowed and trimmed the
yard.  Bob cooked some chicken and noodles and set some down for us to have for
dinner.  After eating I peeled pairs for Mae and she got then sliced and on the
driers.  While we were working we watched some shows no TV.  It is almost 9:30PM

order for a new CPAP mask, filters and hose.  I talked to a manager and told
him that this was my 4<sup>th</sup> trip in and I wanted to know what is going
on.  He assigned Margo to get me a mask sent and it should be at my place
within a week.  I next went to Cost-Co and purchased a new Garmin GPS with Free

Mae some spices.   I helped Mae peal tomatoes, she is making spaghetti sauce. 
After lunch I did get a short nap before taking a field trip.  I took Wood
Cross High School’s girls Volleyball team to Cyprus High in Magna.  They played
three games and won all three games.  It was after 10PM when I got home.  Mae
was still up and just finishing up the sauce.  I had asked her not to do any
extra work but she went out and blow the grass trimmings of the driveway and
sidewalks.  I was upset at her but it doesn’t make any difference.  Maybe if we

boating for a little while after we finished with the fishing.  We then loaded
the boat.  Mae wiped the boat down while I cleaned the fish.  We then ate our
lunch before leaving for home.  We stopped in Morgan to get some ice to cover

Browning Outlet store and bought me another Browning hat.  When we got to
Riverdale we stopped at Good Earth for some bread and a few other items.  Bob
