well as her hand is quite uncomfortable and my mask was leaking air until I
finally took it off.  She slept in the recliner from 3AM until we got up about
8AM.  We worked on cleaning and straitening the house.  I had to take the
pickup over to Custom Auto Finishing at 1900 Washington, Ogden at 12:30PM so
that the insurance Co. of the fellow that banged up my pickup could take
pictures of the damage to my pickup.  Bob and Carroll wanted to take us out to
dinner for my birthday so they brought Mae with them and met me at the Chuck
Wagon in Ogden.  After eating, Mae and I went looking at some front room
furniture.  We are pretty sure that we found what we want at R. C. Willies at
Riverdale in Ogden.  We checked with a couple of other stores but didn’t find
anything that we liked.  We also stopped at Costco and got I few groceries. 
Mae got most of the books put away but I had to almost get cross with her to
get her to stop and rest.  I am concerned about the stress this whole thing is
causing her.  I got her to make an appointment with Nancy so we can get a
checkup.  We went to bed before 9PM but read the rest of our book “The Angels
of Morgan Hill” by Donna Van Liere.  It was a very good story and we have
enjoyed reading it together.</span></p>

got up about 7AM but tried not to wake me.  After breakfast we went into see
Nancy.  We were there for over 2 ½ hours.  We stopped at Costco where I had
taken print cartridges to be refilled.  We also bought a few other items
there.  We ate a salad that we bought at the fast-food area.  When we got home
Mae went right back to work on the house.  I went with Bob into R. C. Willies
and bought the recliners that Mae and I had picked out yesterday.  When we got
home I helped Mae continue to clean and organize the house.  We went up to
David and Shauna’s so I could borrow their small trailer to remove old
furniture and get our new recliners.  I enjoyed having Mae with me and we
stayed for a little while and visited with the family.  I got my 2010 journals
printed off and put in a binder.  It was after 9PM when I finished this entry
and I need to get Mae to quit and we will go to bed.</span></p>

and Mae was sleeping in the recliner.  Mae went back to bed but didn’t go back
to sleep.  I read my scriptures and said prayers but wasn’t sleepy so I worked
on my personal history.  It was stormy this morning but I decided to get the
old furniture out and go to R. C. Willie’s and get our new recliner and love
seat recliner.  With Bob’s help we got it out.  we had tried to find someone to
help but didn’t have any luck at that.  The weather broke and we were able to
get the furniture changed and the old ones taken to the D.I.  When we opened
the new furniture we found that they had given us the wrong love seat.  R. C.
Willie’s will bring us the correct one tomorrow.  I did stop at Green’s and
ordered 12 chicks.  They won’t be delivered until the first of April.  Bob
fixed us some dinner but it was several hours in between breakfast and dinner. 
Mae has been busy with the home and also got on the computer to answer some E-Mail. 
Tonight is our Stake Temple night so we attended the Temple.  We stopped at
K.F.C. on the way home and got some chicken for a late dinner.  I filled out
this entry and then we watched a show before going to bed.</span></p>

up and Mae woke me to let me know that R. C. Willie’s was here with our love
seat recliner.  They brought it in, took the wrong one out and assembled the
chair.  We are happy with the set.  Mae made waffles for breakfast.  After
eating we went to work on the apartment again.  Each day it looks better.  I
got the water distiller cleaned and operating.  I also washed the windows on
the outside.  Mae washed the inside of the windows and together we made them
look so much better.  This evening we watched “Little House on the Prairie”
while eating dinner.  there wasn’t anything else worth watching.  We set in the
love seat recliners and read from the book “To the Rescue”, the Biography of
Thomas S. Monson, for a while and then I entered this entry.  We then watched a
DVD before going to sleep.</span></p>

went back to sleep in the recliner where I slept until after 7AM.  Mae also
woke about that same time.  Before breakfast I went up to get some water from
the distiller and found that the bottom water barrel had cracked and was
leaking quite badly.  I hooked a hose on to the line and let the tanks drain.  
After breakfast I went to work on the kitchen faucet but could not find where
it was plugged.  I pulled it completely apart but did not find the problem so I
went to Lowe’s and returned it for another one.  While doing that I also
returned an extra board that I had bought when I built Mae’s shelving in the
pantry area.  While I was working on the sink Bob brought down a cable control
box saying that he had that one on the TV in his room and didn’t need it now. 
We hooked it up and I was able to watch the BYU vs Wyoming in basketball.  It
was a good game.  After the game and when I had repaired the kitchen sink Mae and
I went back to Lowe’s where we bought a kitchen sink plug and looked at window
covers.  We then went grocery shopping for a few items and then to Wal-Mart’s
for some other things that Mae had on her list.  We came home for me to change
clothes and to put the groceries away.  We then went to watch Tyler’s
basketball game.  The other team had the Morgan team considerable over height
but Morgan’s team played well and lost by only 4 points.  At one point they
were 14 points behind.  We came home, I filled out this entry, and we took
showers and went to bed.</span></p>

in the recliner about 4AM but didn’t sleep very well.  We attended our block
meetings and I was asked to close Priesthood meeting with prayer and also
Sacrament meeting.  Mae and I stayed and practiced with the Ward Choir as we
will be singing nest week during Ward Conference and preparing for Easter
Sunday.  Bob prepared dinner for us and Irven and Sandy.  As always it was very
good.  The six of us played a game of Mormon Bridge after dinner.  Robert and
his daughter stopped by to get a leg brace for Patty.  I guess that she is not
doing very well.  This evening we had waffles and scrambled eggs for dinner and
then we went over to Jeff and Gale’s.  After being with the children for a
little while they went to bed.  Jeff and I stood Mae and Gale in a game of
Rook.  Jeff and I won but it took a few hands as both teams took some
setbacks.  After getting home I got on the T-Zone and while I was on it Mae
read more from our book on President Monson.  I filled out my journal before we
went to bed.</span></p>

wasn’t able to go back to sleep.  I lay in the recliner for almost an hour but
still wasn’t sleepy so I got on the T-Zone for 10 minutes and then went to the
bathroom.  I read my scriptures from Mosiah 4 and then started this entry.  I
played the computer a game of chess and won this game.  I still wasn’t sleepy
so I got on the T-Zone machine.  I tried to sleep in the recliner but my feet
were cold so I held them up to the fireplace and got them warm.  I did get back
to sleep for a few minutes but woke again at 6:30AM.  Mae woke about 7:30AM so
I got up and we started the day.  I prepared breakfast of hot cakes and eggs. 
Bryce came over about 9AM to see the T-Machine and to talk about the Alaska
trip.  Larry Saiz came over at 11AM and got our health insurance changed for
us.  I worked on my talk for Saturday evening until Mae prepared lunch.  Mae
was busy with washing clothes and still cleaning the house.  I tried to get the
information that I needed for an application for Davis School District.  I
called Michelle Tiller but she never returned my call.  Mae and I signed our
tax forms and had Mr. Sorenson file them electronically.  We stopped at T-Mobil
to see about a home phone but those are no longer available through T-Mobil. 
We went into Home Depot and purchased a new window for the sun room door with
tilt blinds.  We also bought blinds for the rest of the windows in the sun
room.  From there we went to Wal-Mart’s and bought me a new wallet and Mae some
nylons.  It was snowing quite hard as we came home.  Mae prepared some dinner
and I tried to find something on TV but we finally turned it off.  Mae got to
the computer and was reading short stories that Quint had written.  I really
enjoyed the first one but I fell asleep during the second. </span></p>

me up and I slept most of the night in the recliner.  I woke about 5AM and had
a head ache from not wearing my c-pap.  It really does help when it works
right.  I went back to bed with Mae for a little while.  I had several things
that I worked on today, getting in touch with Davis School District, calling
John Price with some questions about the T-Zone vibrator, worked out a plan for
hanging our blinds and got one set of blinds hung.  I found out that I am still
on the Davis School District records as an employee.  If that is right I should
just have to get my medical records up to date and I can go to work.  I wrote
David, our Grandson, a short note this evening.  I also made some calls to find
out about renting a RV to go up to Alaska.  That will be quite expensive.  It
bed time so I had better close.  We stayed up and watched the movie
“Anastasia”.  It was a very good movie.</span></p>

enjoyed reading my scriptures.  After prayers I started this journal entry. 
Mae got at 7:30AM.  She is sure a wonderful wife and sweetheart.  How and why I
have such a special companion I do not know but just hope that I can be worthy
of her for all eternity.  I am amazed at the hope and love that I have because
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Sometimes I feel that my breast will just burst
with the feelings of love.  After breakfast I decided that I needed to find out
about our insurance standing as to me getting a sleep test for my State Medical
card for driving school bus.  After calling Kaiser Permanente, Social Security
and Medicare the conclusion was that we have no coverage except emergency care
until April 1<sup>st</sup>.  I spent most of the morning on the phone to find
that out.  I tried to hang more blinds in the sun room but didn’t get far when
we had to leave to go out to Chelci’s to see her and our new Great Grand
Daughter, Addison Mae.  Sandi met us there and we spent a couple of hours. 
Addison is sure a beautiful baby and Chelci is doing fine.  We then went out to
Brad and JaNae’s as they are celebrating all three children’s birthday on
Emma’s birthday, Kennedy’s birthday is on the 26<sup>th</sup> and Dawson’s
birthday is the 18<sup>th</sup>.  We stopped at Sandi’s for a few minutes to
pickup Parris and her things as we will be tending her for a week.  On the way
out to Chelci’s we did stop at the school bus compound and got a prescription
to get my physical examination.  We also stopped at Staple’s and buy ink
cartridges for our printer.  Both driving out and back we read from President
Monson’s book.  It was going on 10 PM when we got home.  I filled out this
entry and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

got a physical examination at Workers Care to get my health card to drive
School Buses.  I took the results back to the bus compound and turned them in. 
I need to get together with Sue Wagner for some review and some classes.  As
soon as Sue gives arranges for someone to check my driving abilities I can be
put on the payroll.  After lunch we took a 15 minute nap and then I worked all
afternoon on the blinds.  This evening I worked on my talk for Saturday
evening.  It was after 10PM when I finished this entry so we went to bed.  Mae
worked on the computer trying to get it working, checking on phone and internet
programs and changing her talk.  This evening she worked more on the house,
while I worked on my talk.  We decided to watch the movie “Legacy” on DVD
before going to bed.  It was mid-night before we went to bed.</span></p>

order to come back on board as a driver.  Mae decided that she would like to
put her talk on to a slide presentation.  She was able to find the program
Microsoft Presentations on the laptop and so we played around with it to where
we could build a presentation.  Mae worked on that most of the day.  I bought a
new water barrel at Macey’s grocery store but didn’t have time to get it
installed today.  I tilled the garden area and that took the rest of my time. 
After dinner this evening Mae and I went over to Jeff and Gale’s.  After the
children went to bed we played a game of Rook.  We left there at a reasonable
time but when we got home I worked on my talk until 1AM before going to bed.</span></p>

for us.  Mae and I spent most of the day working on Presentations for our talk
this evening.  We got it done just in time for Mae to give me a haircut and I
took a shower. With the pressure of getting ready we were a little on edge with
each other.  When we went over to the Stake center to set up and when I reached
for my glasses they were missing.  Mae went out to the car and found them on
the ground by the car.  They had the dinner first and then turned time to Mae
and I.  We turned on the computer and couldn’t find the presentation Icon.  Mae
finally found it in a different area.  Mae gave her presentation first and did a
marvels job.  I follow and did ok but I had difficulty holding the mike,
controlling the computer and keeping my place in my notes.  We received several
complements for our presentation.  We felt that the Lord truly helped us.  It
was 9PM when we got home.  We watched a DVD show before going to sleep.</span></p>

meet with Bishop Smith at 9:50AM.  We really had to hurry to get there.  Bishop
Smith asked us to accept the calling as Ward Family Specialist which we gladly
accepted.  It was our Ward Conference today and the meetings were very well
conducted.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner.  We ate with them and then I
took a nap.  We went up to David and Shauna’s and ate dinner with them this
evening.  We went with all the family for a ride up around Porterville trying
to find where Mae’s Grandfather’s home had been but things have changed so much
that we couldn’t tell for sure.  When we got back to the house we all played a
couple of hands of Rummy.  Connor was the winner this evening.  Before we

terminal where I met with Sue Wagner.  We went over the bus check and then I
drove the bus through the obstacle course driving the cross over, the
serpentine, the parallel parking and the dock parking.  We finished up about
11AM and I came home.  Mae was out raking the back yard when I got home. 
Comcast was here installing our inter-net and phone service.  After lunch Bob
and I went down to look at a new lawnmower.  It is quite expensive but I think
the more expensive mower is the one that we ought to get because of all the
mowing we do.  I had to stop at Comcast and bought a wireless router to hook up
the inter-net.  I worked the rest of the day installing a new bottom barrel on
my water storage system.  The bottom barrel had started to leak.  It was 7:30PM
before I got it finished.  I entered my journal entry and then worked with the
TV.  I couldn’t get it to work so Bob came down and soon had it working.  While
I made up some capsules I watched a movie “Man from Laramie”.  Mae sent a
letter to David in the M.T.C. and then she watched the last of the show with
me.</span></p>

office.  I am on the payroll as of 10:30AM today.  It was 12:45 PM before we
finished today.  Mae worked on her journal for a while today.  After lunch I
took a nap.  Later Mae and I went into Riverdale to Good Earth for a few item
and then to The Home Depot where we picked up the window for our door.  We
stopped at the grocery store for a few items.  After getting home we turned on
the CD player and lessoned to our book on disc of the Furry &amp; Light.  Mae
read her scriptures for today while I entered this journal entry.  We then went

had started lunch but the boys couldn’t take the time off today so she invited
Bob and Carroll down.  After lunch Grant and Stacy stopped by and Grant checked
the wiring of the DVD player to the TV and that was ok.  He said that we needed
to pick up a universal control to program the DVD to work on our TV.  This
evening Bob and I went Home Teaching to Casey’s and to Patriarch &amp; Sister
Johnston’s.  We visited for some time with the Johnston’s but it was a good
visit.  Mae picked up Sister Neiderhauser and attended the R.S. Birthday
party.  She got home just after Bob and I returned.  We lessoned to the last of

went Visiting Teaching this morning.  I removed the window from our front door
and replaced it with a glass with blinds between the glass pains.  After Mae
returned home she and Georgia went walking together so they could visit.  I
just finished the changing of the window when Mae returned.  We picked up the
car, then took some items to the D.I. and then returned a shirt to Penny’s. 
From there we went to Bountiful where we met Nick and Sandi.  We gave Parris
back to them and then went out to eat at Sizzler’s.  It was enjoyable to have
the time to visit with Nick and Sandi.  When we got home I remembered that Bob
and I had another Home Teaching visit to go to this evening.  We got over to
the Therman’s and had a god visit with them.  After returning home I entered

could get ready, eat breakfast and leave for the bus terminal.  At 9:30AM I met
with Janet Nance and went over payroll.  I then met with Lue from 10:30AM to
12:30PM for class room training.  Mae had lunch ready for me when I got home. 
After lunch Mae went to help serve the family of Glen Higley, whose Father
passed away.  This afternoon we went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and tended
their children while they went out for Mishelle’s birthday.  We played games
with them and had a good time.  Really the twins were very good.  We taught
Kylan and Ashley how to play Uno and they had a good time.  Kylan and I had
also played two games of Racko.  We came home and soon went to bed.</span></p>

cold to work outside so this afternoon while I was making up some capsules I
watched a show on TV and then at 5:30PM I watched the NCAA Basketball game that
BYU played and they won by a 23 point lead.   Following the game Mae and I

spoke for 3 to 5 minutes and then President Mitchel asked the High Council
members if they had any questions which a few of them did and so total we were
there 15 minutes.  When we got back home we ate breakfast then I took a short
nap before we went to our block program.  Bob and I went Home Teaching to
Sister Fallis’s and then came home.  Bob prepared a nice lunch and invited us
for that.  I took a longer nap this afternoon.  Mae prepared dinner for Scott’s
family at 5PM.  I helped her finish getting things ready.  Mae had a nice dinner
and we enjoyed having them.  Scott and Michelle brought both Mae and I a
birthday gift.  They gave Mae some jewelry &amp; hot pads Mishelle had made, and
me three books, The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren, No One Can Take Your
Place by Sheri Dew and 101 Amazing Things God Thinks About You by Bordon
Books.  Mae and I played Uno with Kylan and Ashley before they left.  We
enjoyed having them but I have to admit that we were tired when they left.  I
helped Mae straighten the house and then I entered this entry.  We stayed up
and watched “Am Affair to Remember” on Comcast Free Movies.  That is a good

get the TV in his bedroom hooked up to the Comcast box.  I had to call Comcast
in order to get the picture to come in.  I think that the lady on the phone did
some correction from that end because she had me turn everything off and then
back on and the picture came up.  Later Bob went with me to Jeff’s and helped
me load the barbeque into my pickup.  On the way we stopped at the post office
and mailed a picture to Merrill Dibble at South Valley Farm, a DVD to Elder and
Sister Shaw and a letter to Christensen &amp; Jensen</span></p>

mae talked me into coming back to bed for a little while and I slept another 45

out while I was having a bowl of cereal.  I met with Mishelle for about an hour
and then met with Roberta and with Janet.  When I got home I took a nap.  Jeff
came over and had lunch with us.  He used the T-Zone, ate lunch and we talked
him into taking a short nap before he returned to work.  I called Aunt Joy and
got the address for Dian and Keith Camilli in Canada.  I tried to call Shellie
and Roy but no one answered.  I wanted to find out their plans for this summer
so that I might call Dian and Keith to see if there was a time we might
schedule a few days at their place.  I spent about an hour bidding on bus trips.
 At 4PM Mae and I took Bob and Carroll over to Dee’s Repair to get their car. 
Mae and I drove to Kaysville to get my boots from Ray’s Shoe Repair where I had
new heels put on all three of my boots.  We then went to the Layton City park
and went for a walk.  We stopped on the way home and bought a Sub-Way for
dinner.  I took the key to the church and the list of volunteers over to Neal
Knutson, who is on the list for tonight.  Mae and I watched a show on Comcast.

5AM and went to the bathroom.  I wondered about being called for a bus run so
stayed up for a while and read my scriptures.  No call came so I went back to
bed for a while.  We got up a little later and started the day.  Mae prepared
waffles for breakfast and they were sure good.  I debated about what to do
today and because the weather was good I decided that I had better work in the
yard.  Bob came out and helped me.  We put up a fence around the garden area to
keep the chickens out of the garden.  I repaired the irrigation line after Mae
went to the store and bought some parts for me.  I got two rows of peas
planted.  I had to add 12 inches to the gate to the garden for one of the
chickens jumped upon the gate and then into the garden area.  I used the
rotovator and tilled around the fences of the back yard to keep the weeds down
along the fence line.  I put a new style in Jeff and Gail’s closet door.  Mae
worked outside most of the day and at 7PM I made her quite.  That was a good
thing for she had forgotten that she had told Jeff and Gail that we would be
over to play games.  We ate on the way and got there before 8PM.  After getting
the children to bed the four of us played a game of Rook.  The first hand Gail
went back.  The next two hands I won the bid and succeeded with both hands. 
The score was a plus 475 for Jeff and I and a minus 135 for Gail and Mae.  The
gals resigned that game and we played some Harts.  At 10PM we quit and came
home with Jeff winning that game.  I got on the computer and printed off a
field trip that I was awarded for next week.  I then entered this journal entry
and we went to bed.</span></p>

then lay in the recliner not wanting to wake Mae.  I got up again just after
5AM still concerned about the phone waking Mae if I got called in to sub., so I
stayed in the chair.  At 7AM I got up and read my scriptures, said my prayers
and got on the T-Zone.  Mae came in and had me crawl back in bed with her for a
few minutes.  When we got up I fixed egg omelets while Mae did her hair.  I got
on the computer for five minutes to bid for next week’s field trips but there
was only one page of trips posted now so I will wait until more are posted.  I
went outside and started rounding up my ice fishing equipment so that Mae and I
could go fishing in the morning.  I found everything except my gallon gas
container was missing the lid.  It had dirt inside the container so I will just
buy another.  It was getting dinner time so I came inside.  I took a short nap
while waiting for lunch.  Scott came over and ate with us.  Jeff was also going
to come but he had meetings that he had to attend.  After lunch Mae continued
to work on some information about her brother Hal so I started to clean the
stairs for her.  I got a call from Lanny telling me that Uncle Lee died this
morning at 6AM from a heart attack.  They are going to have a viewing and funeral
Saturday March 26th.  I ether called or tried to call Irven and Sandy, Cheryl
and Bob, Barbara and Dean, Roy and Linda, Rich and Lois and of course told Bob
and Carroll.  I also called Virginia and Neil Greggs.  At 2:25PM I got a call
from the bus shop asking if I could take a afternoon route which is scheduled
to leave the compound at 2:40PM.  I really hurried and got to the bus at 3:41PM
and took it for granite that everything had been checked out this morning.  I
had an assistant with me as it was a special Ed. run.  All went well and I got
home shortly after 5PM.  Mae had dinner ready shortly after I got home.  We
watched the last half of a BYU basket ball game and BYU lost in overtime.  Lois
called and had a clue as to where Lesley might be but I tried it and didn’t get
anywhere.  Mae continued to work on the information about Hal until after 9PM. 
I finished this entry and we soon went to bed.  Sandi called just before we
went to bed.  She asked if I know what they could do about a ceiling fan.  I am
afraid that they will just have to buy another one and I can go out and install
it.  Shellie called just after I went to sleep so I didn’t hear it ring.  Mae answered
it and was told that Kevis was on a scout trip and is reported lost.</span></p>

5:30AM with the news of Kevis.  She has sent text’s to all the family and is
calling temples to have his name put on the prayer rolls.  Mae has been up all
night so at 8 she went in to sleep.  David and Mike decided to go down.  Sandi
is going to meet them at Mike’s and will go with them.  Shellie called at
9:15AM and said that there is still no word.  Search and Rescue along with many
volunteer as well as Roy, Garret, Quint and others of the Seymore family are
all out looking for him.  David, Tyler, Jeff, Mike and Sandi all left this
morning to drive down to give support if nothing else.  Scott would have been
with them also but he had an auditor that he had to meet with today.  He is
planning on flying down tonight.  At 12:15pm Shellie called and said that the
helicopter had just found Kevis and all looked ok with Kevis.  We called Mike
and they turned around and came home.  They had got as far as Beaver.  This has
been quite a day.  There has been many prayers offered in behalf of Kevis and
his family and we are sure glad for the way things turned out.  Bob went to a
florist and ordered flowers for Uncle Lee’s funeral.  We are now planning on
going up to Teton for Uncle Lee’s funeral tomorrow.  In order to get Mae to lie
down and take a nap I went to bed with her.  We slept for a couple of hours.  We
had pizza for dinner and watched the last of a western on TV.  I called Roy and
Shellie at 7PM to find out how Kevis was and how they are doing.  They are all
ok and very grateful for the many prayers and to have them answered.  The
reason Kevis got separated from his partner was that they were playing a
“Capture the Flag” game and his partner got captured and put in jail.  Kevis
was trying to evade getting captured and went farther than he had thought and
suddenly realized that he didn’t know where he was and where to go.  That was
at 4PM and the rest of the boys came back to camp at 5PM and reported to the
leaders that they couldn’t find Kevis.  The leaders and boys searched for Kevis
until 8PM when they called the Bishop.  He in turn called the Sharif who started
a search party but they really had to wait until daylight before they could
really start the search.  Kevis spent a very cold night but everything is ok
now.  How grateful we are for the answer to many prayers!  Before going to
sleep we watched the show “Inn of The Seventh Happiness” one DVD.  It was
really a good movie.  As we closed the day with prayer we sure had prayers of
thanksgiving for the way this day turned out.</span></p>

stop at a Sub-Way in Pocatello for a sandwich for lunch.  It was good to be
with the Wilding family.  The funeral for Uncle Lee was very well planned.  I
was asked to dedicate the grave in place of Milt Wilding (Lee’s Brother).  Milt
was in the hospital receiving a pace maker.  I felt it an honor and a privilege
to be called on.  The funeral was beautifully put together and went over very
well.  Following the grave side ceremony we returned to the chapel for a very
nice lunching.  We enjoyed visiting with family members there.  Rich, Lois,
Janet and Joyce also came to support the family.  We enjoyed being with them. 
It was almost 8:30PM when we got home.  It was a good day and especially when
yesterday turned out so good.  Mae and I got a light super and studied on a
Sunday School lesson before going to bed about 11PM.</span></p>

got up shortly after.  We did some studding on our Sunday School Lesson before
getting ready for meetings.  We went to meetings early so that we could be set
apart for our new calling as Ward Family History Consultants.  After being set
apart we attended opening exercises for Primary and then taught the lesson in
the 11 &amp; 12 year old children.  We only had 4 children in our class.  They
were very attentive to the lesson and participated with questions and answers. 
During Fast &amp; Testimony meeting there was a lull so Mae went up and bore
her Testimony.  As normal she did a very good job of it.  She told of the
blessings our family received with Kevis getting lost.  This afternoon Mae
didn’t feel the best but still prepared dinner for Jeff’s family.  We had a
very enjoyable evening with them.  Besides visiting we played with the children
and that seemed special to them.  After they left this evening Mae and I
watched a movie on TV before going to bed.</span></p>

well but Mae woke up not feeling the best.  She offered to go ice fishing with
me today but I told her no.  The weather has been bad most of the day
fluctuating from rain, snow, hail and wind.  I had Mae sleep for a little while
a couple of times today.  I worked on the computer trying to get information so
that we can plan on some trips this summer.  I also ordered form W-4V from the
Social Security Office so that I can discontinue having taxes withholding from
my Social Security monthly check.  I got a E-mail off to my Son’s, Son-in-law’s
and Grandson’s inviting them to join me for General Priesthood Meeting and then
to go out to eat after.  Mae is still feeling quite bad so we just relaxed and
watched a movie on TV.  I called Roy and Linda to be sure that they had
received word that Kevis was located and all is good.  I also told them of
Uncle Lee’s funeral.  I have tried to contact Scott and even called at 10PM but
still did not get an answer.  </span></p>

a sub run at 5:15AM.  I had to hurry but all went well.  I took a High School
run from South Weber, then a Jr. High run from East Layton, followed by a
Elementary run back at South Weber.  When I got home Mae wasn’t feeling very
well.  She had been up most of the night.  I got myself something to eat and
then both of us laid down for a nap.  I slept about ½ hour but I don’t think
that Mae slept.  We had some lunch and I took the afternoon runs but I didn’t
have the Jr. High run.   This evening I fixed us some dinner and we ate while
we watched a show on TV.  Bob isn’t feeling well either so I asked Neil Knutson
to assist me in giving both Bob and Mae blessings.  I made this entry and then
went to bed.  </span></p>

fairly well but Mae still isn’t feeling well.  I prepared breakfast and did up
the dishes.  I got on the internet to look for campers and found several but am
not sure if that is the way we could go.  Mae and I watched several shows on TV
throughout the day and evening.  Bob brought us down some chicken &amp; noodles
that he had made.  They were very good.  We watched a show of the forgiveness
of the Amish and it gave me a lot to think about.  I can’t help feeling that it
will be quite a eye opening experience when we are able to go on to the other
side of the veil and have our minds opened to the understanding of God.  I got
on the internet and entered some bids for field trips for the week of April 11<sup>th</sup>
to 15<sup>th</sup>.</span></p>

didn’t wake until 7:30AM.  However Mae didn’t sleep very well and was up most
of the night.  I have tried to take care of her but I am quite worried about
her health.  This afternoon I was going to do some shopping but just after
going into Wal-Mart I got a call from the bus shop asking me to take an
afternoon run.  I really had to hurry and got to the first school just as the
rest of the busses were leaving.  I was able to complete the runs and when I
returned to the bus compound I had to fuel the bus and sweep it out.  It was a
spare bus but the last driver had not taken care of it the way he should have. 
It was 5:30PM when I got home.  Bob had prepared cooked cabbage and invited us
to eat with them.  I went up but Mae didn’t feel up to it so I brought her a
bowl down to her.  I did go to Wal-Mart and buy a few items that we needed. 
When I returned we watched a movie on DVD before going to bed.  I got Mae into
bed and then I entered this journal entry.  </span></p>
