<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 8AM.  Mae had been up a little while.  We visited about our family and
the problems they are having.  By the time we finished it had really put me in
a depressed mood.  Prayer and thinking about it didn’t help.  Mae also asked me
about going to S.L. on Tuesday to help Chelci out.  I got on the inter-net to
check by bids for the coming week and found that I didn’t have any.  I am not
sure why not, but will have to check that on Monday.  I fed the rabbits and
found that our black doe still hasn’t had kits.  I am not sure what is
happening there.  I went over to Irven and Sandy’s after lunch.  I shut of the
water to the outside taps and the Air-Conditioner.  I then covered the hallway
vent, drained covered the air-conditioner and shut off the outside water.  I
then did some figuring for Irven and Sandy on insulation for their
air-conditioner.  From their place I went shopping for some groceries for Mae. 
It was almost 5:30PM when I got home.  Mae has been tending Kylan and Ashley
for Scott and Mishelle today.  I filled in my journal and then got ready for
Stake Conference meeting this evening.  Scott and Mishelle came and got the
children before we went to the conference.  The meeting was very good this
evening and fairly well attended.  When we got home Mae worked on her pictures
on the computer and I watched a show on Comcast.  The sound and picture is not
in synchronization, so I called Comcast.  The girl tried to correct the problem
over the phone but was unsuccessful.  She finally decided that they would have
to send out a technician.  That would normally cost $28.00 for a call out but
for $.99 per month we can have a policy on our contract that will cover
technician call outs.  I talked to Bob and we added it to the contract, also
Bob had my name added to the contract so that I can make changes to the
contract with out Bob having to talk to them.  We reset some of the clocks for
the change in time as Daylight Savings Time goes off tonight, before we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3AM and took off my face mask.  I really didn’t go back to sleep although I
tried.  With the return to standard time zone we had an extra hour this
morning.  We were a little early for Stake Conference and set on the front
row.  The only problem with that is that we did get some cold breezes through
that area.  I took my suit coat off and put it around Mae’s shoulders.  The
talks and spirit of conference was great.  After conference Mae and I drove
over to the hospital and picked up Kylan and Ashley.  Scott and Mishelle was
over there to feed the babies.  When we got home Bob had dinner about ready. 
We were ready for it as both Mae and I Fasted today for the twins, Mishelle and
for Jeff and Gail.  I took a short nap this afternoon.  David and his family
came about 5:30PM for dinner.  I grilled chicken on the barbeque grill and Mae
got the rest of the meal ready.  Jeff came over about the time we were finished
eating and did have a little to eat.  We did have a game of Mormon Bridge
before they all left.  Scott and Mishelle came over and got their children
about 8PM.  The rest left before 9PM.  we got on the computer for a little
while.  I tried to find out some news on the power outage that David and Shauna
are experiencing at their home.  I couldn’t find out much for David.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
this morning but really didn’t have anything to get up for.  I prepared
breakfast while Mae was writing a letter to Garrett.  I also took a shower and
made the bed.  I just puttered around doing small jobs.  Mae had a dental
appointment at 11AM for a root canal.  I went over to the bus compound but
didn’t get much done except to let Roberta know that I am available.  I took a
nap after getting something for lunch.  Mae didn’t feel the best as the dentist
had trouble with her tooth and she will have to return a couple more times
before it will be repaired.  At 4PM Mae and I went over to Scott and Mishelle’s
while they went to the hospital.  Mae prepared dinner for them when they got
home.  I started putting a dress draw set together.  It took me all evening. 
we got home at 9:30PM and I finished today’s journal entry and we went to bed.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3AM and couldn’t get back to sleep so I went into the front room and went to
sleep in the recliner.  I had set the alarm for 5AM but when it went off I
turned it off and continued to sleep for another 20 minutes.  Mae got up and
helped me get away by 6:30AM.  I went to the Salt Lake Community Collage in
West Valley.  Chelci is taking her dental hygienist training there and needed
someone for a patient, I volunteered.  She worked on my mouth and teeth for
about 3 hours.  I will come back in January to have her clean my teeth.  When I
got home I got me something to eat.  Mae had called and had planned on being
home when I got there.  She called me and said that Jeff is having problems
again so we felt that she should go over to his house and be with him for a
while.  Mark came down and wanted me to check a DVD out that he has.  He
couldn’t get sound on his machine.  Ours worked ok.  Bob came down and had two
turkeys for me that he bought out to the base.  I did get a little to eat.  I
went over to the voting area and cast my vote.  <b><i>I did not vote for either
Republican or Democrat.</i></b>  I will not vote for the “best” of two evils. 
I am ashamed to omit that I was not very well informed on most of the items on
the balat.  I was going to go to Scott’s but I called and talked to Gail for a
few minutes.  I came back home as I had left my wallet home.  I tried to get
some information on my Family History but couldn’t get Roy or Barbara by
phone.   I did get a call from the bus dispatch asking me to take a run
tomorrow and one for Friday.  Mae and I went over to the Family History Center
where I worked on my grandfather Hill’s family group sheet.  We also found some
different or discrepancies in the Jonathan Browning wife’s.  this is the reason
I get confused with Family History.  We soon went to bed after getting home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4AM, to make a bus run.  I let Mae sleep and got myself off.  The rout went
well.  After getting home I ate a bowel of cereal and then I fed the rabbits. 
The black doe has now been 37 days since she was bread and she still haven’t
had a litter yet.  I am not sure what is happening.  I took a nap, ate lunch
and help Mae get things ready to go to Georgia’s to make apple sauce.  I made
an afternoon run.  I stopped at the store and ordered some pill boxes from the
pharmacy.  I called Mae to see when she will be home and she said that Scott
and Mishelle brought the twins home so she will stop and see them.  We watched
a show on TV this evening and so it was late when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was able to
sleep in until 4:30AM before going in to the bus compound.  Today I road on bus
91 to become acquainted with Lue’s route.  He will have other training duties
for the rest of November and December.  I will alternate the route with another
substitute driver.  Mae went in to Dr. Lee to have her blood pressure checked
so that Dr. Lee would renew her blood pressure prescription.  She then had an
appointment with Dr. Dickerson to have more work done on her teeth.  He worked
on her for 1 ½ hours and will still have to have her come back.  This evening
we went to Penny’s and ordered me some more jump suits and bought Mae some new
bras.  We then went over to Scott and Mishelle’s.  We sure enjoyed the twins. 
They are so small and tiny.  Ashley sure seems to love them but Kylan just
adores them.  He loves to hold them and help Mishelle care for them.  Mae was
able to find signs for the front lawn that says “It’s a Boy” and “It’s a
Girl”.  We put them in the front yard before we came home.  Mae was hungry, as
she didn’t eat much at dinner time as her teeth were to sore to chew.  I
stopped at a Kentucky Chicken’s and got her some chicken strips.  Mae had made
a special protein bar desert this afternoon so we had some when we got home. 
They are so good, that I can’t believe that I can actually eat them.  We were
late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke just
before 6AM so I went into the front room and lay in the recliner so I wouldn’t
wake Mae.  I fell asleep until Mae got up and kissed me.  That woke me with a
start.  We sure enjoy being together.  I prepared breakfast while Mae did her
hair.  Bob and Mark want me to help them get some manure for the garden.  We
had to buy a scoop shovel as we can’t find mine.  Mae met Georgia for lunch so
she was gone when I got back with the first pickup load of manure.  I just had
time to change clothes and get to the bus compound to make a bus route.  That
went well and I was back home before 3PM.  I got something to eat and then
helped Bob put a new battery in his pickup.  After Mae left Georgia she went to
the Creekside Elementary school and picked up Kylan and Ashley and took them
home.  She spent the evening over there helping Mishelle as much as she could
and gave Scott, Kylan and Ashley some time together.  She is quite the Mother
and Grandmother.  She is also a special wife and sweetheart.  Jeff came over to
help me with a computer problem but that was not to successful.  We did get to
talk but I have very mixed emotions about how that went.  I sure don’t know how
he thinks.  He is sure a unhappy and mixed up boy and I don’t know how or why. 
It was 9:30PM before Mae got home.  She is very tired with all she has done
today.  We just set and visited for an hour or more, and then I finished my
journal and we went to bed so Mae could rest.  I sure love that girl.  We are
sure in a stupor as to what to do for Jeff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4AM
and was afraid that if I went back to bed I would wake Mae, so I laid in the
recliner and went back to sleep there.  I woke again until shortly after 8AM.  By
the time we had breakfast and I got outside it was close to 10AM.  I fed the
rabbits, and then Mark and I went down to West Point and got two more loads of
manure and spread it on the garden.  Bob swept up a lot of the leaves that have
fallen in the yard and dumped then on the garden area also.  When we finished
we cleaned the truck out and I went in for some dinner.  After eating I slept
for 15 minutes and then went to United Rental and got a rotor-tiller.  I worked
fast and it took me a little over an hour to till the garden and turn under the
manure and leaves.  Bob was working on his pickup when I came back so I helped
him put it back together.  I was sure tired when I came in the house.  We went
over to the grocery store for a few items and came home and ate.  While Mae was
getting the food ready I entered this journal.  We stayed up late watching a
movie on DVD.  I guess eating late, staying up late the all the work I did today
just added up to be too much for my body and I had to sleep in the recliner
tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was able to
crawl back in bed and cuddle Mae up for a few minutes before getting up and
getting ready for church.  I went over to the chapel to help set up chairs and
found that I was the only one there.  The Elders had not set up their chair
assignment.  I couldn’t get the divider curtains to open and thought that
someone might have locked them.  I had a member of another Wards Bishopric try
the curtain lock and he got it to open.  Brother Higley came about then and
started helping with the chairs.  We finished at 8:50AM and I went home and got
Mae and then came back to our meetings.  I enjoyed the meetings and the
lessons.  In Sacrament meeting I felt that I would like to express my testimony
during the testimonial portion of the meeting.  Brother Mark McPhie was
conducting as Bishop was out of town today.  When he opened the testimony
portion of the meeting he covered about all I felt that I would like to
express.  Several other stood and bore their testimonies and then I went up.  I
am not sure that I was able to express myself the way I wanted and I also
forgot to express gratitude for the blessing I have been given, my eternal
companion.  After meetings Bob had dinner ready for us.  Mae and I later went
over to Scott and Mishelle’s.  I helped Scott carry the second dress drawers
upstairs.  Scott had assembled it yesterday.  We enjoyed holding the twins. 
They are doing great.  We then went to the McKay Dee hospital where we saw
Sister Larsen.  She and Brother Larsen still have big hopes the Sister Larsen
will get well.  Before leaving the hospital we checked on Ryan Knudsen.  He is
back in the ICU Ward.  Of course that stopped us from visiting him and his
parents had gone home for the evening.  as we went to leave the hospital a
nurse call to us and asked how long we have been married.  We told her that we
would be celebrating our 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary in June.  She then ask if
we always walk together holding hands.  When I said that we did, she asked if I
also opened the doors for my wife.  Again I told her that I did and she said
that she wanted one of them, pointing at me and adding, “But a little
younger.”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up real early and I was happy that I didn’t get a call to drive today.  after
breakfast David brought Connor for Mae to tend.  I took him out with me to feed
the rabbits.  The white doe had kits yesterday but the black rabbit has not.  I
called the rabbit farm where I bought the rabbits and she told me to put the
black back in with the buck to see if she was pregnant.  She was not pregnant and
the buck bread her again.  I guess we will try again with her.  It must have
rained hard during the night as there was a inch of water in the bucket this
morning.  Carroll said that she could hear water running over the rain gutter
last night.  I got up and checked and the rain gutter is full of leaves and
trash.  Bob and I worked the rest of the day cleaning the gutters out.  I came
in soaked and had to take a hot shower to warm up.  Mae went over to Scott and
Mishelle’s and helped with the children.  She didn’t get home until 10:30PM.  I
had fallen asleep in the recliner watching TV.  I filled out my journal and
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up at
6AM so she would be ready to leave at 8AM to have test taken at the Ogden
Women’s Center.  She stopped and got some bagels at the health store before
coming home.  I got up after 8AM for breakfast and then started on various
projects.  Those included cleaning up from washing the rain gutters yesterday,
feeding the rabbits and working on the electrical panel cover for upstairs.  A
man came to talk to Bob and Carroll about the Reverse Mortgage at 3PM.  I set
in on it as Bob has so much trouble hearing.  I found out that Bob and Carroll
are going to have me on the will to get the house after they both die.  With
the reverse program and Mae and I being over 62 years old, the home will be
easily transferred over to us.  That is quite a relief to hear as that has been
one of our greatest concerns about living here and investing time and money
into the home.  With this it is just investing into our own future.  Mae and I
went over to the Family History Center.  We spent our time working on our own
lines.  I guess that we are learning.  I did some searching of the maps for the
bus run that I was asked to make tomorrow.  Mark came down and visited about
the Ward Christmas Party.  When he left I finished with the bus run and then
entered this journal entry.  It was almost 11PM when I finished and we got
ready to go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I made a bus
run for bus 438 this morning.  When I checked the fluids I found that the
transmission was low.  The shop said it was just cold and I should check it
after it had warmed up.  I made the run and when I returned to the bus compound
I checked the transmission fluid again and found that it was very low.  I took
it up to the shop and asked them to check it.  I went to a Sub Bus Driver Round
Table meeting.  I did find out that when we stop at Rail Road Crossings we do
not have to put the transmission into natural.  Also we should us our hazard
lights when picking up Special Ed Students.  I got home just before noon and
Mae had lunch ready.  Jeff came over and ate with us but Scott couldn’t come
today.  At 1PM Jeff went back to work, Mae went over to get the children from
school for Scott and Mishelle, and I went back to the bus compound.  I checked
the bus and the mechanics had checked the moter oil level.  I had them check
the transmission and they found that it was 5 quarts low.  The afternoon run
went well.  I went to The Nut and Bolt Co. for some parts.  When I got home I
at a snack and then Bob and I went Home Teaching.  When we got home I worked on
my routes for tomorrow.  It was after 10PM when I filled in my journal so we
could go to sleep.  </span></p>

busy all day with the bus routes.  The morning in routes went as normal but the
afternoon routs were switched all around as the High School got out at 12:30 PM

bus home between the two afternoon runs.  This evening we watched a movie on
Comcast that was fair.</span></p>

building scenery props for the Ward Christmas party.  I took a nap and then Mae
and I had lunch before I went back for this afternoon runs with the bus.  I got
home about 3:30PM.  Mae had most every thing ready for us to leave for Idaho. 
Georgia and Becky road up to Idaho with us.  I took Mae, Georgia and Becky to
Troy and Melia’s where they will stay this evening.  I then went to Rich and
Lois’s for the evening.  We stayed up visiting until quite late before I went
to bed.  Rich and Lois went to bed first but Elise and I stayed up much later. We
discussed some of my political view points and of course they are only my
theories and feelings.  I entered my journal before going to bed.</span></p>

breakfast and then I went out side and looked at the deck and the problems they
are having.  Elise told me that she has sent a report to the Manufacturing
Department.  I have great droughts if the warranty will be honored.  I found a
piece of scrap that I will take home and try to find something that will
preserve the material.  I picked Mae up at 11:30AM and we went on to Firth
getting there in time for the viewing and funeral of Noma C. Tew.  The funeral
services were very good and the weather was a very nice fall day.  After the
services we stopped to visit some of the people that we had became acquainted
with during that brief two years we were there.  we then drove out to the home
sight that we had rented while there.  we stopped by the Snake River and
reminisced about the time we were there and questioned why things hadn’t work
out so we could have stayed there.  Some day maybe we will understand.  We came
back to Chubbuck and picked up Georgia and Becky at Malia’s and then drove on
home.  We got home at 7PM.  Mae and I relaxed and watched two shows on TV
before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up but I hurried and got to the church house just after 8AM.  Brother
Higley was there to help me as we set up the chairs for today’s meeting.  We
attended our meetings and enjoyed the spirit there.  When we came home Bob had
a nice dinner ready.  After dinner I fed my rabbits and then took a nap.  This
evening we went up to David and Shauna’s for dinner and to celebrate Emily’s
eight Birthday.  It was an enjoyable evening.  Shauna’s parents and Jeff were
also there.  After getting home I worked on my journal catching it up to date and
Mae looked at some E-mails.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
3:30AM and looked at the clock.  I thought that there was still time for the
bus dispatch to call me.  I went back to sleep and woke at 6:30AM and thought
that I was glad that I didn’t get called this morning.  Gail brought the
children at 8AM for Mae to tend today.  We got some breakfast, took Benji out
to help feed the rabbits and then I went chasing for various materials.  At 1PM
I stopped and got something to eat.  When I got home I started to install
clothes lines but only got the holes dug.  I needed power to drill some holes
in the pipes but the generator was out of gas.  I tried to get someone to help
me and really only got Mark out talking to me about the troubles he was having. 
I guess I wasn’t in a very good mood.  It was then time for Mae and I to go
over to help Mishelle with the children while Scott went with Jeff.  They went
out to eat and to talk.  I did stop at the store and get some items that were
on sale.  I think everyone is concerned about Jeff and wants to help him but
whether or not it will help is yet to be seen.  It was good to help Mishelle
with the babies.  It sure keeps her going but she is really cute with them.  It
was 11PM when we got home.  I filled out this journal entry before we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke before
4AM and hoped that I didn’t get a call.  When I again woke at 6:15AM I was excited
that I hadn’t got a call.  At 7:30AM Mishelle called me for the bus compound
and ask where I was.  I told her I was at home.  she said that I had a field
trip that I was supposed to be at the school by 7:15AM.  I guess they got
someone else to cover it.  I guess I just plain goofed but I didn’t realize
that I had been awarded a field trip.  We had breakfast and then Mae and I got
discussing our concerns over Jeff.  It had really brought us heavy hearts and
we have no ideas on what to do about it.  We are afraid that Jeff is planning
on taking his life about the first of the year but don’t know if that is just
other’s feelings that make us feel this way.  We sure hope that it doesn’t come
to this.  I did some work on Mae’s clothes lines, getting the poles set in
concrete.  I did get a call from Roberta asking me to make a run this
afternoon.  I didn’t dare not accept it, after my goof this morning.  The run
went well and I was home about 4:30PM.  Mae soon had dinner ready and after
eating we went to the Family History Center.  I worked for some time on the
duplicate records and before the night was finished I realized that I still had
50 pages of duplicate information.  I became quite frustrated that there is so
much duplication.  I left with my mind in a whirl.  We just got home and Bob
knocked on the wall and asked if we were home.  I guess my mind wasn’t in the
mood for that either.  This has been some day from start to finish.  Better
days ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:15AM to get ready for today’s bus run.  I was surprised when I turned the
light on in the front room as Mae was asleep in the recliner.  She had waken
earlier and couldn’t go back to sleep, so came out in the recliner and slept
there.  She went back into our bed and did go back to sleep.  My run went
well.  After getting home I serviced the car and the pickup before making the
afternoon run.  This evening Mae and I went to Tithing Settlement with Bishop
Smith.  We enjoyed our visit with him and he was very encouraging to us.  When
he asked us how things are going I told him it was Heaven and Hell at the same
time.  Hell is over our concerns for our sons and Heaven is with our twins,
Garrett service as a missionary and how things are working out with the house. 
Bishop counseled us not to blame ourselves for the problems that out children
are having.  He also counseled us to give Jeff unconditional love and know that
he has to make his own decisions.  He is sure a wonderful man and is sure
fulfilling the mantel of Bishop well.  Mae stayed for a Relief Society program
so I walked home.  I played a few games on the computer. I then took a shower
and got ready for bed.  Mae got home about 9PM.  Finished this journal entry
and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:15AM to make a bus run.  It went well but I was sure tired when I got home. 
I fed my rabbits and while I was doing that Mae prepared some breakfast for
me.  I then went to bed for a nap.  Mae went in to the dentist to have more
work done on her tooth.  It still didn’t go very well.  Mae got home just
before I had to go back for the afternoon run.  When I got home this afternoon
we got ready and went into the Ogden Temple and went through an endowment
session.  When I got home I had a message from Lois so I called her back.  The
company that produced the decking and railing sent someone out to look at the
deck.  They called Elise at work and told her they were coming out but they
said that she didn’t need to be there.  Rich and Lois were at the Temple so
they weren’t there either.  They want to wait and see what the company’s
response will be before they do any more.  I guess we will just wait and see. 
Mae isn’t feeling very good so we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:10AM thinking that it was after 6AM.  My bus runs went well today and the
students were much better today than they were yesterday.  When I got home I
got something to eat, then I filled our water jugs, added salt to the water
softener, filled the two extra water barrels and just kept busy with small odd
jobs.  Mae went out to dinner with Sandi for her Birthday so she was gone while
I was home.  because of early out today I had to leave at 1PM for my afternoon
run.  This evening Mae and prepared dinner and took it over to Jeff and
Gail’s.  Stewart and Masha came over and the six of us played games for a
while.  we were sure tired when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
visited this morning about our children.  It is really amazing that we have
such different children.  Six children and six different personalities.  They
are sure having trouble deciding on what to do for our 50<sup>th</sup> Wedding
Anniversary.  Mae suggested that we just call them all up and tell them that we
have decided to elope and leave then to do what ever they want to do.  I don’t
think that that is a bad idea.  Mae went over to the health store in Ogden to a
lecture on childhood vaccinations.  She then went over to Scott and Mishelle’s
to help them for a while.  I took care of my rabbits and worked on the cloths
lines.  I need some small cable clamps to finish the job.  I helped Mark get
some eye loops put up on the stage at the church house.  I then used some Old
English Furniture Polish and cleaned up some of the dark walnut trim in the
chapel.  These spots have bothered me every since we have lived in this Ward. 
I had to use my extension latter to get to the ceiling to clean up the problem
on the wood trim.  I will probably by the only one that will notice what I did
except for Mark who was there when I did it.  I got home in time to change into
some pants and a shirt so we could go out tonight.  Mae got home and had to
hurry to change.  We got over to Larry and Dian Steel’s at 4:40PM.  They were
ready when we got there.  We went to the Chuck-A-Rama in Bountiful and ate.  We
then went to Salt Lake where we attended the Bell’s Christmas performance.  It
was a nice program but I was quite tired.  The old benches in the Tabernacle
are still hard and Mae’s back was hurting by the time it was over.  It was late
when we got home so we showered and soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and got up at 6:30AM.  I had to hurry to get ready
and get a little breakfast before going to the church to set up chairs.  Mae
wasn’t ready when I came home to get her but we still made it to church on time. 
Bob invited us up for dinner.  He cooked a beef roast and also some chicken for
us.  I did have some beef.  After dinner Mae and I laid down and took a nap. 
Mark came down and woke us.  It was a good thing he did as Bob and I had a Home
Teaching appointment at 4PM.  After we got back home Mae and I had a little to
eat and then we went upstairs and played a game of Canasta.  It was a close
game until the final hand and then Mae and Carroll stopped us from getting on
the board.  We came down stairs and watched a DVD before going to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
1:30AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I finally got out of bed so I wouldn’t
disturb Mae.  I still wasn’t able to sleep in the recliner so I looked for a
movie to watch.  I watched a James Bond movie.  At 5 AM I tried to go back to
bed.  At 6AM Mae got up.  I slept a little before 9AM and then got up to go to
work.  While I was eating some breakfast David came to bring Conner for Mae to
tend.  We visited with him for over a hour.  I helped Bob and Carroll get some
papers ready and had Mark FAX then to the company that is making the new
Reverse Mortgage loan.  I help Mark with the assembling of some props for the
Ward Christmas program.  I also helped Mae get the Christmas decorations
brought from the shed to the house.  I got my rabbits fed and taken care of. 
Mae, Conner and I set down to eat lunch when I got a call from the bus terminal
asking me to make an afternoon run.  Before I got out of the bus compound I got
a call from Roberta.  She asked if I could do the AM and PM runs tomorrow.  I
said I would.  There goes my day off.  That took me until 4:30PM and then I
stopped at the Green’s Farm and Feed store and got some rabbit pellets and some
wire mesh.  I came home and ate some dinner.  I then went to The Home Depot and
bought some supplies to build more rabbits pens and to repair our snowmobile
trailer and a few tools.  When I got home Mae was busy decorating the house so
I helped her some and cut a turkey in half for us to take on our Moab trip.  We
are going to try cooking it in a Dutch oven for Thanksgiving.  I filled in my
journal and went to bed.  It has been a very busy day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I made the
morning runs and then came home.  I fed my rabbits and then put the wire on the
close lines.  I didn’t have time for any thing else but to leave for the
afternoon runs.  Mae and Jeff searched the inter-net for lodging in Moab but
found that there is a large 4-wheelre and bike convention that takes place in
Moab Every Thanksgiving so it would not be a good place for us to go to relax,
plus the lodging is scarce and very expensive.  This evening Mae and I went
over to Macey’s to buy some steak that bob said was on sale but we found out
that it doesn’t start until tomorrow.  We came home and watched s show on TV
before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae gave me a
hair cut before I took my morning shower.  After breakfast I went out and fed
the rabbits.  The new batch of kits are starting to jump all over and have
packed the fur all down.  They will soon be able to get out of the box and then
I will have to fix a place where the doe can get away from them part of the
time.  I had to call Mae and have her come out and look at them.  Mark came out
and needed some help.  He needed to use my hand stapler but he couldn’t find
it.  I had to look for some time to find where it had been put in the wrong
place.  Mae wanted me to get the Christmas tree decorated as I had told her
that we would do it last night, but then I was too tired so told her we could
do it this morning, so we watched a show instead.  She was disappointed that I
didn’t get it finished.  Mae got on the computer and through the internet tried
to find us a restraint to eat Thanksgiving dinner.  Many restraints are going
to be closed for Thanksgiving.  We went over to Jeff’s this afternoon and spent
the rest of the day.  We played games and then after putting the children down
we watched a movie.  We used my projector and set it up pointing to the vaulted
ceiling.  We then moved a mattress in and laid down to watch the picture on the
ceiling.  It has been a good day.</span></p>

slept in until 8AM.  I then got up and took a shower while Mae spent time with
the children.  Gail had gone to the gym at 6AM.  We prepared hot cakes for
breakfast for Mae and I.  Benji also wanted to eat with us although he had
already eaten with Jeff earlier.  Jeff showed me how to play Risk on his
computer.  After Gail returned and then took the children with her to her
mothers, Mae, Jeff and I played Rummy for a while.  At 2PM the three of us went
to the Cracker Barrel in Layton where we ate our Thanksgiving Dinner.  On the
way back to Jeff’s we bought some groceries and rented some DVD.  We played
games for a while and then watched the movies “Flight of the Phoenix” and “The
High and the Mighty”.  It was mid-night when Mae and I went to bed.  Jeff gave
out on us about 10PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
were up quite a while after turning the movies off, talking about our concerns
for Jeff and Gail.  This is really hard.  I woke at 5:55AM and was up for a
while.  I finally put my CPAP machine on and went back to sleep.   Mae got up
at 7:30AM.  I slept until after 8AM.  Jeff slept didn’t wake until after 9AM. 
we filed some breakfast, got the turkey in the oven and then while Mae got some
things ready for lunch this afternoon, Jeff and I played a game of Chess.  It
was close but I finally got the best of him.  We went out home about noon. 
First we stopped at home and checked the rabbits.  Bob had fed them earlier in
the day.  there was a small bunny dead outside of the on the ground.  In
checking with Bob he found it dead behind the kindling box.  It had got out and
got behind the box and couldn’t get out and got to cold.  I will have to watch
that problem.  We went to the church and got thing set up.  Before long our
family started to arrive.  We had a total of twenty four of us.  Sandi and her
family didn’t come out as several of them are still sick.  After eating several
of us played volley ball and other games.  It was about 8 when we finished up
and went home.  Mae, Jeff and I started a game of RISK, which we played until
11PM.  There was a show on TV that we quite the game to watch.  We will finish
the game tomorrow.  Jeff gave up and went to bed about mid-night but Mae and I
watched the end of it.  It was after 2AM when we got to bed.</span></p>

8AM and studied for a while.  Mae got up about 9AM and Jeff got up a little
before 11AM.  We had breakfast and then Bob came down to invite us to lunch. 
We held him off until 1PM.  During the mean time Jeff and I took care of the
rabbits.  The little ones are sure fun to watch.  During the mean time we
finished the game.  I was the first to lose and finally Jeff just surrendered
to Mae as she was sweeping the board.  Bob and Carroll invited us up for
lunch.  When we came back downstairs we watched the DVD “Big Jake” with John
Wayne.  Soon after that ended we went to Maddox’s in Brigham City for dinner. 
After eating we went to Crystal Springs in Honnyville, where we soaked in the
mineral pools.  Jeff and I went up the water slide.  Jeff kept telling me that
it was heated, but the clime was not and my feet were very cold when we reached
the top.  Jeff got on his pad and went down the tub.  I stepped into the water
and it was cold.  I said “Forget it!” and went back down the steps and hurried
for the hot pools.  We stayed there about 2 hours and came home.  Jeff and I
visited for a while, waiting for Mae to shower.  I took a shower before going
to bed.  This is sure hard to take, thinking that Jeff is seriously planning on
ending his life at the end of December.  </span></p>

6:30AM but I had forgot to put my day planner and eye glasses in the bathroom,
so I could only think of the problems and didn’t read my scriptures this
morning.  I fixed breakfast of egg omelets.   I had trouble keeping my mind on
what I was doing, while preparing breakfast.  After eating Jeff and I went out
to take care of the rabbits.  I let Jeff take two of the kits home for a few
days.  I let him take a feeder, a water bottle and some rabbit pellets.  We
started out with just one kit but when I saw it in the box by it’s self, I
suggested that he take two of them.  Mae and I went to church after Jeff left. 
I really had trouble with my emotions today in meetings.  Bob prepared dinner
for us when we got home.  After eating Mae and I took a nap.  When we woke we
took some dishes back to the kitchen at the church and then stopped and visited
with Sister Knutson.  We had noticed that she also had trouble with her
emotions during meetings today.  They are having a lot of challenge with the
health of their son Ryan.  When we came home I did some research on my Family
History.  I contacted Carla and with her help found the sealing dates of Bob
and Margaret to my Mother and to my Father.  It was almost 10PM when I finished
that, so we went to bed.</span></p>
