<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was
scheduled for training with Sue this morning but she had to cover dispatch and
so was not available to help me.  I therefore went to Bryce’s and worked.  I
was up in the attic for quite a while changing wiring and re-securing the
ceiling where we removed a wall.  It was 7:30PM when I quite and then picked up
my tools.  I also stopped and got natural gas.  It was 9 PM when I got home.  I
was hunger so I ate dinner even though it was so late.  I couldn’t go to sleep
after eating so we stayed up and watched a movie on Comcast.  It was an oldie
with Cary Grant made in 1939 “Only Angles Have Wings”.  It was mid-night when
we went to bed.  I was hurting and very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30AM and Mae did a little later and prepared breakfast.  I went into the bus
shop and trained with Sue and Lew until noon.  I got home at about the same
time that Jeff and Scott came over for lunch.  Mae had lunch ready and we
enjoyed the time with our boys.  Dr. Francis’s nurse called me and said that I
would have to have the testing Doctor fill out the Sleep Apnea report.  I lay
in the recliner and took a nap for almost two hours.  Mae has been busy with
Family History Training during her spare time.  I spent some time getting my
journal for February and March printed and in the hard copy binder.  I had to
change the ink cartages in the printer.  After I got up Mae and I went over to
Dr. Francis’s office and picked up the forms.  We then went to Wal-Mart and
bought some sun glasses for me.  We looked for a watch but they didn’t have one
with a large band on it.  We also bought some heavy marking pen.  We then went
up to Devin and Betsy’s for dinner and for their help with Family History and
also my computer.  It was almost 10 PM when we got home.  I filled out my
journal before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well as my mask kept leaking, then about 3:30 AM there was a loud
squeal coming from the fireplace.  One of the fans if not both are going out. 
I had to unplug the power to the unit.  I didn’t sleep very much the rest of
the night.  Mae was sure special this morning.  We had planned to go
snowmobiling today but with the fireplace problems I spent most of the day
working on it or trying to find the parts I needed.  I did get a e-mail off to
the company that manufactured the fans and this evening I got a reply saying
that the part I needed had been discontinued but replaced by another part.  It
also told me where I could order the fans.  Terry came over and visited with us
until 6PM.  It is good to visit with him.  They really don’t have much time to be
down this time.  I did a little studying on my bus drivers test.  We watched a
show on DVD this evening before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had set the
alarm for 6AM but I had forgot to turn the alarm on.  However I woke at 6:15AM
anyway.  Mae got up a little later and got breakfast.  I called and ordered the
fans for the fireplace.  I also called The Sleep Institute of Utah and was told
that I would have to have Dr. Francis make me an appointment to meet with their
Doctor to go over my previous test results and evaluate them.  He will then
decide whether or not he can sign the form for my CDL or whether more testing
will be necessary.  I went to the bus department and went on a training trip to
several of the school in the District.  I got home before noon.  Mae had dinner
about ready as she had invited Bryn and Samantha Dugan over for dinner and to
play some games.  We enjoyed the afternoon.  Mae and I went to Provo and
attended the Philippines Angeles Missionary Reunion, held at the Wilkinson
Center at BYU.  There was a good turn out and we enjoyed the evening.  It was
11:30PM before we returned home.  We were very tired but I made this entry
before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, April 05, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke quite
early but didn’t want to start going.  I removed my c-pap mask sometime early
but don’t remember when.  We were slow to get going.  David called and visited
with me for some time about a man that is claming medical knowledge that he
doesn’t have and is not qualified in.  David is quite upset about it but I
really didn’t have much advice for him.  Just after 9AM Mae remembered that she
wanted to go to a early morning sale at Kent’s Market.  We went over but there
was a huge crowd.  I felt that we should just leave as I wanted to watch the
opening of General Conference.  Mae insisted that we stay so reluctantly we
did.  We only got some chicken and potatoes and then tried to check out.  The
lines were long and I got upset that we had stayed.  I went out to the car to
try to get the conference on our car radio but it doesn’t work.  Mae was able
to get into a line that only allowed 2 or 3 items and so she got through the
line quicker.  We got home just as the opening prayer was being said.  During
the conference we packaged the chicken for storage in the freezer.  I also
filled capsules with Mannatech products as we are now out of filed capsules to
take daily.  The Conference Sessions were very good and we especially
appreciated the Salaam Assessable and the sustaining of the First Presidency
and other called Church Authorities.  At the end of the afternoon session Bob
had a nice pork steak dinner prepared for us.  Scott and I went to Priesthood
meeting at our Stake Center.  It was a very enjoyable session with Elder Cook
being the first speaker, then Bishop Burton and then one of the members of the
70’s.  After the intermediate hymn President Uchtdorf spoke followed by
President Eyring and then President Monson gave the concluding address.  It was
very good and I sure enjoyed having Scott attend with me.  I would sure like to
have David and Jeff back with us.  That is a real heart ache.  After the
session Scott &amp; I helped put up chairs and then we went over to the grocery
store and bought some ice cream.  We also stopped and got me a frozen yogurt. 
Mishelle and the children stayed at our place and visited with Grandma.  We
visited for a while before Scott and his family went home.  It’s been a great
day of conference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We enjoyed
sleeping in this morning and then arose for breakfast before the Sunday opening
session began.  Today has been so inspiring and special.  The Conference has
brought many tears of gratitude, feelings of concern for my children (two sons
especially), gratefulness for my testimony of our new Prophet and especially
for the fortifying to my own testimony.  I remarked to Mark my testimony that
those that have been called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are men that
you can look back at their lives and you can not find where they have ever
committed anything that we can criticize them for an improper act.  In between
the morning session and the afternoon session Bob and Carroll invited us to join
them and members of their family for a nice dinner.  It was a good experience
and an opportunity to renew association with their family.  We came downstairs
and I took a nap.  Karen Hyer called and asked if we were about there.  We were
to meet them at a Philippines Reunion in Salt Lake.  Mae had understood that it
was to start at 7PM but it was at 6PM.  We were late getting there so had to
sit in the Relief Society room as an over flow.  After the meeting they had a
short social and refreshments.  It was 9PM before we got home.  I filled out my
journal before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep the best last night but was able to get going.  I went into the school
district for training and spent the morning driving a bus through the test area
and maneuvering through various obstacles.  Before coming home I went over to Backyards
Inc. and bought a toy airplane that is a titer totter.  Mae had gone out to
dinner with Ione Adams and Carolyn Cue.  They were counselors to Mae in the
Primary Presidency, when we lived in the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup> Ward.  When
I got home I ate some lunch and then laid down for a nap.  I just got to sleep
when Bob called to see where I was.  I told him that I was taking a nap.  He
said that he was sorry for waking me and I told him that he hadn’t because I
had to get up to answer the phone.  I lay back down and slept for a little
while.  I then went upstairs to see what he wanted.  He asked if Mark and I
could give him a blessing.  However Mark wasn’t there then so I set down and
visited with Bob.  He had me put the little microphone on so he could hear me
talk.  Bob commented two or three times how nice it was for me to use the
microphone so he could hear me.  I don’t understand why Carroll won’t use it. 
Mae came home so I went back downstairs to be with her.  Bob then prepared some
supper and invited Mae and I up to eat.  Mae and I decided to go to the store
and buy some flowers and take to Sister McPhie.  Bob then called and I went
up.  Mark and I gave him a blessing.  When I went back down Mae and I decided
to deposit some checks into our account while we were at the store, so we got
them ready.  While doing that Tina Linderman called.  By the time we got to
McPhie’s it was getting late but they were still up so we stopped for a few
minutes.  Mae read from the Ensign while we were driving and we finished an
article about Elder Cook, a newly called member of the Quorum of the Twelve. 
We then spent several minutes discussing life and the concerns we are having
with David and Jeff and wondering WHY!  I filled out this journal entry and we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke just
before 7AM.  In reading my scriptures this morning I still have a depressed
feeling about some of our children.  Tears flowed quite easily during my
prayers of great concern.  I did some studying of bus regulations and called
Dr. Francis’s nurse concerning my CDL requirements but only got a recording.  I
went to a sub-driver meeting at 9:30AM and when that concluded I did some
training on the bus.  I got home shortly after noon.  Mae got us some lunch and
then I took a nap.  We got ready and went into the Ogden Temple where we did
initiatory endowments.  This was the first time that I have done initiatory
endowments since the First Presidency announced some changes to the ceremony. 
I quite like the changes and it was interesting to be told the doctrinal
direction for the ceremony.  We met Kevin Porter as we came into the foyer.  We
then went down to the cafeteria and ate dinner.  We stopped on the way home at
Wal-Mart and bought me a watch and a flash light for work.  We decided to watch
a movie on DVD before going to sleep tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, April 09, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I hadn’t set
the alarm last night and over slept this morning.  I was still on time for the
bus training.  Sue went with me and I went through the bus inspection and then
practiced driving the rest of the morning.  I got home for lunch with Mae,
Scott and Jeff.  We enjoyed the time to visit.  Mae had made quite a nice
dinner.  The boys joked about it being a dinner not a lunch but quickly added
that they weren’t complaining.  After they left I started to assemble the
airplane teeter totter but it was so cold outside that I gave up for now.  I
worked on reassembling the fire place.  I had two wires that I did not know
where they went and it took me a while to get that figured out.  The new fans
cost us $10.00 each and I did all the work so that wasn’t so bad.  I don’t know
what a repairman would have charged if we would have called on to repair the
fireplace.  After eating a light dinner Mae went to the county Meet the
Candidates meeting.  I went Home Teaching.  Bob still isn’t feeling well so I
had Mark go with me.  We were almost 1 ½ hours at the Johnston’s, so when we
got to Fallis’s I told Mark that we would make a quick visit here.  I had a
question to ask about Brother Farr’s Family History files and would just make a
quick reference about President Monson’s article in the Ensign.  Brother Fallis
wasn’t home so I didn’t think we would even be invited in.  Sister Fallis’s son
was there so Sister Fallis invited us in.  Another 1 ½ hour was spent there.  It
was 10PM when we got home.  I filled out my journal entry, ate a little and
then we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
5:30AM and was up for about an hour and then cuddled up with Mae for a little
while.  I went into the bus shop this morning and drove the bus for about 3
hours.  I went over to the vehicle inspection in Kaysville and got my pickup
inspected and registered.  I stopped and got natural gas on the way home.  Mae
had lunch ready when I got home.  We ate and then went shopping for Mae a
dress.  We ended up buying her a dress and a blouse.  We also bought a down
comforter and liner.  When we got home I helped Mae prepare potatoes to bake
and Mae made meat loaf.  I started to assemble the teeter totter airplane that
we bought the other day.  We ate with Bob, Carroll and Mark.  After dinner Mae
went to the Book Group and I went back to assembling the teeter totter.  I got
most of it assembled and was just at a point where I needed help when Mae came
home.  I was just commenting to her that she came just in time when I noticed
that the instructions said you need three adults for this step.  Just then Mark
came out so we put that step together and I quite for the night.  I will have
to finish it tomorrow when I get home.  I entered my journal and we soon went
to bed.  We put the down comforter on before going to bed.  Mae was so excited
to have the comforter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast I went to the bus shop.  Lue had me go out and pre-trip a bus and
when I went to enter the No Child Left alarm went off.  I reset that but then
the bus wouldn’t start.  As I was going back to the office, Lue came out.  I told
him that the bus wouldn’t start so we talked to the lead mechanic and he know
about it and said that it was out of service.  We had to take another bus. 
After pre-tripping that bus we took it out on the road.  Lue had me go through
crossing of rail road tracks and loading students.  We drove mainly around
Clinton and Sunset crossing the tracks and stopping for imaginary youth groups
so that I could practice the procedure of doing each several times.  When I got
back to the shop and parked the bus I was beat.  Mae fixed lunch when I got
home.  I then took a nap and then put the rest of the teeter tote together. 
Mark came out and helped me.  we then assembled Mae’s wagon.  This evening we
had Tina Linderman come over for dinner.  After eating I gave her a Priesthood
Blessing.  We then colored Easter eggs and visited.  Tina has some real self
esteem problems.  After Tina left we watched a movie on the movie channel.  We
watched “The Man from Left Field”.  It stared Burt Reynolds and was a very good
show.  I filled in my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
early to go to the Republican County Convention.  I also woke when the alarm
went off.  After eating breakfast Mae left.  I worked getting things ready for
our family to come today.  I was still mowing the lawn when Mike, Becky and the
girls came.  Mike helped me get the tables out.  Mark wanted to start on the
garden today so I helped him some.  The tires on the wheel barrel were flat so
I gave Mark some money had him go to town and buy a new tire.  We had all of
our boys and their family, except for David who had to work.  We were almost
through eating when Mae got here.  We had a lot of fun as we had the children
hunt for Easter Eggs.  I got a kick out of little Benji.  He is old enough to
really enjoy finding the eggs.  It was a good day but by 8PM I was very tired. 
I think we will soon go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went to the
church house and set up chairs before meetings.  I came back and got Mae for
Church.  Mae helped in the nursery today.  Fast and Testimony meeting was good,
Mae also bore her testimony.  Bob had dinner ready when we got home.  I took a
1 ½ hour nap after dinner.  Mae worked on PAF and then entered into my history
a Autobiography of mine that we had written several years ago.  I called
Brother Farr’s but he isn’t feeling very well so I just asked his Granddaughter
if they could get me three generations from him.  She said that they would.  I
called up to Strawberry Lodge to check on ice fishing.  They said the ice was
28 to 30” thick but there was a lot of slush on top of the ice.  That doesn’t
make very good fishing.  Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley came over.  We spent
the evening together visiting and playing with Kylan and Ashley.  Mae fixed a
light supper of fruit and toast.  We watched The Man from Left Field before
they went home.  I made this journal entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke still
disappointed that we couldn’t go ice fishing as the snow on the lake is too
soft.  I became more discouraged as I read the scriptures and thought about my
children, especially Sandi, David and Jeff.  Bob came downstairs to tell me
that his toilet is leaking.  Mae and I went over to the Ogden Family History
Center and took the first class in Legacy.  I left there feeling totally
confused and overwhelmed.  This class will also be held weekly for sometime. 
Mae was upset with me that I felt the pressure of attending weekly.  We stopped
and got a sandwich and then went to Brigham City to the Honeyville food
products and bought some cans of garden seed and some honey.  We then came back
to Smith and Edwards and bought a few items.  Mark was tilling the garden and
we checked out the slop of the ground trying to decide how to irrigate the
garden this year.  We may have to do some leveling of the ground first.  After
getting home I went to Durk’s and bought parts to fix Bob toilet.  Mae went to
get her prescriptions.  We ate dinner and then I fixed Bob’s toilet.  For
Family Home Evening we read next Sunday’s Priesthood/Relief Society lesson.  We
gave each other a foot massage, then I filled in my journal and we played a
game of Rummy before we went to bed.  Mae won the game in the last two hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went into
the bus shop and drove bus with Sue.  We drove around doing several rail road
track crossings.  We went back to the driving track to practice parallel
parking and other maneuvers but the Highway Patrol was there testing buses for
safety.  Sue had me take the bus we were driving and go through the check.  We
then parked the bus and went in to dispatch and got approval for me to drive a
bus in the morning on the rack by myself.  Sue, Lue and Alan will be in a
meeting and will not be able to help me tomorrow.  We also scheduled time with
Alan for me to take my CDL driving test on Friday.  I came home and got some
lunch.  Mae had gone to Salt Lake to take Sister Benla Read to see her daughter
who was in the University Hospital. There was a note for me to call Irven and
Sandy, so I did.  They said that Bryce wasn’t expecting me today and they
needed my help.  Come to find out Bryce was expecting me and their problem was
that they had forgot to close the bleed valve on their outside water when they
turned the water on.  I told them what to do and I still went up to Bryce’s.  I
worked from 1:30PM to 7:30PM sheet rocking and framing fur downs.  It was
8:30PM when I got home.  I watched the end of a show on T.V. with Mae.  I the
filled out my journal, and we went to bed.</span></p>

the bus shop planning to train by myself on the driving course, however things
changed and Sherrie and I trained together with Alan.  We used a stick shift 5
speed with dual axels.  That was quite a bit different.  I quite at 11:30AM and
went to Irven and Sandy’s and helped them get the water on to the front outside
faucet.  They also had a couple of other things they had questions about.  I
came home and ate lunch with Mae and Scott.  I went to Bryce and Deanna’s and worked
five hours.  I stopped on the way home and filled and got natural gas for my
truck.  I was very tired when I got so went to bed quite soon.</span></p>

Alan’s bus today on the obstacle course.  Lue came out and went with me for a
few minutes.  Alan came out and I stopped to see if he wanted his bus.  He said
“No” he came to see why I did answer the radio call.  I had the Master Switch
off.  He rode with me to park the bus and gave me a couple of words of advice
and asked me some questions that he may ask me tomorrow when he gives me the
CDL driving test.  I went to Irven and Sandy’s to take them some garden seeds
that Mae and I had bought for them.  From there I went to Durk’s Plumbing and
bought the parts I need for Bryce and Deanna’s.  I stopped at the grocery store
on the way home and picked up a few items for Mae and bought me some Sun
Screen.  Bob fixed dinner for all of us and we ate about 2PM.  We had two
packages that came today.  After eating we opened them.  One was my jump suits
I ordered from J.C. Penny’s and the other was the DVD editor we had ordered.  I
took a nap and planned on some study time after.  Mae wanted to show me the
picture files she has put together for me on the computer.  We spent some time
there.  Mark came down and had some questions about driving the lawn mower to
level the garden area.  I took him out and showed him what to do and how the
lawn mower worked.  I came back in and found that we had some concerns about
the DVD Player that we had not understood at the time we ordered it.  One was
the booklet indicated that only the warrantee in the booklet was valid, which
didn’t say that there was a 30 day trial and also that there was a yearly
membership each year.  I called the company and talked to Gus who said that we
did have the 30 trial period and yes there was a yearly membership but we got
the first year free.  We decided that we didn’t want the DVD Player so I packed
it back up.  At that time Irven and Sandy came to make wash soap with Mae.  Mae
also wanted me to set up the Sun Bake Oven.  After Irven and Sandy left I went
through some of the bus information giving it to Mae for practice.  I did
fairly well and so quite to relax the rest of the evening.  I filled out my
journal.  Mark then called and we visited for a while.  By the time I turn off
my computer it was 9:30PM.  We just said our prayers and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got ready
to go into the bus terminal but I couldn’t find my keys.  After looking in the
house I went out to check my truck to see if I had left them in it.  When I
came back Mae was on her knees in prayer and when she got up she went to the
recliner and felt down the back corner and found my keys.  That is not an
unusual thing for her to do.  I got to the bus terminal on time and went out
with Alan to take my CDL driving test.  The bus check was done in selected
segments and not in the order that we were trained.  This was somewhat
frustrating to me.  We then went to the optical course and that went pretty good. 
Next we went out on the highways.  It went well until we got on the freeway and
there I made my first err.  I was told to move into the center lane when I
could.  I looked at traffic coming up the left of me and there was one vehicle
at my rear bumper so I waited for him to pass.  I turned on my left turn signal
as a second care approached.  At first he sped up so I slowed a little to let
him pass, however he slowed to let me come in so I started to move over when he
speed up and turned into the far left lane and came around me.  That was
counted as an error on my driving.  I then took the Antelope exit and was told
to turn left and then to take the next left after the freeway entrance.  There
are two left turning lanes at that exit and I was thinking of the next left
turn so moved into the left turning lane.  That was an error, as busses are to
always use the right lane when there are two left turning lanes, and I know
that.  Later I was told to make a left turn and didn’t get into the left lane
in time so had to make a right turn and go around the block.  Although I missed
the turn and had to go around the block it wasn’t counted as an error.  The
problem came as I made my last right turn coming around the block a man started
to walk across the street.  It was a four lane highway and he had just started
so I had plenty of time and I made my turn.  That was error three and I failed
the driving test.  Alan said that I could return at 2:30PM for a second try or
I would have to wait until next Thursday.  I elected to return at 2:30PM.  I
came home and ate lunch, took a nap and returned.  This time I passed the
test.  Mae had gone to be with Kylan and Ashley this afternoon and evening. 
Scott and Mishelle had planed to go over night but Mishelle isn’t feeling very
well they will just stay at home and relax.  Mae will tend the children any way
to give them a break.  Also the children were so disappointed as they wanted to
stay with Grandma.  After getting home I went up stairs and visited with Bob
and Carroll.  I then went out back with Mark and checked the garden level and
decided that it is now good enough to plant.  Mark and I got visiting with Mike
next door for a while.  I put my transit away and came in the house.  I entered
my journal for today.  Bob called and visited for a few minutes and while we
were talking Mae and the children came home.  They had had a good time and now
wanted to watch some cartoons before going to bed.  Mae was tired and so when
she put the children to bed Mae wanted to go to bed also.  I made up some whey
but didn’t feel like going to bed.  I checked on Mae and she was asleep.  As to
not wake her I came back into the front room.  I turned on the TV and found the
movie, (2000 Leagues Under the Sea) on Comcast and watched that.  I slept in
the recliner tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until after 7AM.  I went to Bryce and Deanna’s and worked today.  Mae was going
to take the children to Dinosaur Park but Ashley was running a fever s she
called Scott and Mishelle and they came and got the children.  Ashley was very
unhappy that they had to go home.  I worked until 4:30 PM and then cleaned up
my tools and came home.  Kip called me while I was cleaning up and asked me if
I would like two rabbits.  They are getting rid of them so I will take them.  I
guess that helps me make the decision of raising rabbits for meat.  Mae wanted
to go into Weber State University to see a show at the Val A. Browning center. 
I was tired but cleaned up and we went.  The performance was put on by the
Ogden LDS Institute and was titled “This Is a Great Country” featuring Chorale,
Choralaires, &amp; Folk Dancers.  It was a very good program but I was hurting
quite a bit all evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept well
but neither of us wanted to get up when the alarm went off.  I was still
hurting but got up and went over and help set up chairs for church.  When I
came back we went to our meetings.  Bob and Carroll went to Sacrament meeting
but listened to the meeting from the fouler.  When we came home Bob had dinner
ready and we were invited up.  I took a nap this afternoon.  Mae worked on her
history, e-mails and etc.  When I got up I filled in yesterday’s journal entry
and started today.  as Mae was looking at her history she noted the in 1977 prices
of heating fuel, gas, along with every thing else was climbing fast and we felt
sure that if we didn’t have our food supply we were on shake ground.  That was
31 years ago and sure enough prices have continued to go up but the end has not
come yet.  Bob called and wanted us to come up and play a game of canasta with
him and Carroll.  We said that we would but then Gail called and said that she
had just got home, Benji was sick and had just thrown up and they heard
something in the basement.  Gail had gone to see what it was and found water
was running into the basement from the window. I told her that we would be
right over.  I grabbed my wet dry vacuum and we went over to their place.  when
I went downstairs I found the South East basement window well with about a foot
of water up the window and water coming in under the window.  I went outside
and found that water was flowing out of the sprinkler valve box.  Water was
about 3 inches deep for several feet around the valve box.  I tried to find a
shut off valve but could find none by the valve box.  I looked around for a
master valve but was not sure where it would be.  I went in to see if Gail knows
where it was but she had no idea where it would be.  I decided to call some one
so Gail got me the phone book.  In the front of their phone book was the Ward
list.  I called the Bishop how said he would have someone come over.  I went
back outside and looked in the front yard and found the valve box next to the
street.  I was able to shut the water off.  Just then a Brother Redman came to
help.  We took my shop vac and went down stairs.  We found that the water had run
into the floor drain only a few feet from where it was coming in.  Almost all
the storage items in that area were in plastic containers so there was no
damage to them.  Brother Redman helped me move items out of the way and then he
went left.  I had Mae call the Bishop and thank him and let him know that we
had everything under control.  I used the wet vac and cleaned up the remaining
water.  It was about 8Pm when we got home.  We played a game of Rummy and this
time I won.  We lessened to some talks on Family History while we played.  I wonder
what we should be doing in this calling.  I told Mae that I don’t feel that I
could any more unqualified for the job than if they ask me to coach the BYU
football team.  Mae has also been working on a file of all of the homes we have
lived in.  That has been quite fun.  It’s 11PM so we had better go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke about
7AM and left for Brigham City about 9AM.  I was able to get my CDL at the
Brigham licensing department.  We then went to the Family History center in
Ogden and took the 2<sup>nd</sup> class in Legacy.  After the class I had some
questions for the instructor so he spent another hour with us.  We next went to
Farmington and I turned in my employment papers.  We came on home and I called
Randy.  David called us and they want Mae to tend their children while Shauna
works at the McKay Dee hospital.  I have very mixed feelings about that.  I
took a nap for about an hour before we ate some dinner.  We went upstairs and
held a F.H.E. with Bob, Carroll and Mark, then Bob, Carroll, Mae and I played a
game of Canasta.  Mae and Carroll won.  Sandi called me and ask if I could cut
her some blocks of wood.  I will have to do that tomorrow afternoon or
Wednesday afternoon so we can take them out to her Thursday afternoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went into
the bus terminal and went out with Lue to drive the bus.  We went up Antelope
Dr. to the freeway, then to 12<sup>th</sup> St. in Ogden, East on 12<sup>th</sup>
St. where I had to cross railroad tracks and on up Ogden Cannon, then over
Trappers Loop and back down Weber Cannon to US 89, South to Hill Field road and
west back to the bus terminal.  It was almost noon when we got back.  I came
home for lunch and took a short nap.  I went into Dr. Lee at 2PM.  He said he
could fill out the report that the State wants and he did so after asking me a
few questions, then he had his nurse fax the form to the State and gave me a
copy for my records.  It was as simple as that and to think that I have been
trying to get that done through Dr. Francis for over four weeks.  I drove on
down to the Farmington bus terminal to find out where it is as I am going there
in the morning to drive students on another driver’s route.  I was glad that I
had because I had written down the directions on road wrong.  I came back and
stopped at Kips home and got two rabbits that he wanted to get rid of.  I then
went to Home Depot and bought materials to build rabbit hutches and some
material for a project for Sandi.  I stopped and bought some items for the
rabbits at a feed store, then got gas for my truck before coming home.  Gail
was here when I got home and stayed and ate dinner with us.  I help Mark with
the garden for a few minutes before quitting for the night.  I filled in this
journal entry and then went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and went to the Farmington bus terminal where I did a pre-trip inspection
on bus 497.  All went well except I could not find the control for the door.  I
thought of calling the shop but didn’t want to look stupid on the radio with
all the other bus drivers in the district lessoning.  When Karen Bennett, the
driver, came she pointed it out.  It was a black knob on the left hand panel
but was un-labeled.  The bus route was a Special Ed route so that surprised
me.  We only had three students that road the bus this morning.  I got to
experience picking up children at their home and using the wheelchair lift. 
After taking the children to the school and returning to the bus terminal I
came home.  I got started on Sandi’s project when Mae called me for lunch. 
Scott came over and ate lunch with us today, which we enjoyed.  Gail brought
Benji and Rachael over for Mae to tend this afternoon.  I had to go back for an
afternoon run at 1:50PM so I stopped at the Clearfield Family History Library
and visited with Brother Jackson about Brother Farr’s fills.  They are working
on them but they had expected to have help from our Ward.  They are finding
that 95% of the information is in the files.  I made it to the school in
Farmington in time to drive the run.  We returned the children to their homes
and then went to a school in Kaysville where we picked up two girls and their
nurse.  Both girls are in wheelchairs and are almost helpless.  We returned
them to their home in Bountiful.  We returned to the school in Farmington where
I had parked my pickup.  I fell as I was getting out of the bus but my pride
was hurt the worse.  When I got home we had little time before we had to leave
in order to get to the Ogden Temple for our Ward Temple night.  Bishop and
Sister Smith, Brother Higley, Mae and I were the only ones that made the
session.  After the session we went over to Farr’s Ice Cream with Bishop and
Sister Smith for a treat.  When we got home Mae realized that she had left her
purse by the table where we ate the ice cream.  She called on the phone and
they answered and located her purse and said they would have it for her to
pickup tomorrow.  I filled in this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in a
little later this morning.  After eating breakfast Mae went into Ogden to
Farr’s Ice Cream co. and got her purse.  I made some phone calls and lined up a
couple of bus routes that I can drive with the regular bus driver.  I got my
tools set up in Bob’s garage and then this afternoon Bob helped me and we cut
wooden blocks 2” X 2” X 1 ½”.  These blocks are for Sandi.  This evening Mae
and I drove out to Tooele to take the blocks to Sandi.  She is tending Chelci’s
baby as Chelci is in the hospital with kidney stones.  Chelci is feeling some
better this evening but has sure gone through a lot of pain with them.  It was
good to be Sandi and also JaNae and her children were there so we visited with
them also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had a Spec.
Ed. Run to go no this morning and was under the understanding that it was out
of the South terminal.  I left with extra time to get to the bus and pre-trip
it.  When I got to the lot I could not find parking row “H” or a bus #80.  I
ask a driver coming in and he was sure that I should be in the north lot.  I
got back in time to still make the run.  The driver was Sharon Northrop and
again this is a Special Ed. Route.  We had an assistant on the morning run but
I also came back and made the afternoon run.  Sharon let dispatch know that she
could be the assistant with me doing the driving so if they needed our
assistant to help somewhere else we could get by ok.  They did so this
afternoon there was just Sharon and I.  It went well and I enjoyed driving the
route.  I appreciated seeing these children for it helped me appreciate more my
blessings.  I also was amazed at the trials some people have.  This evening Mae
and I went to a dance at the Weber State University Ballroom.  The Band was
called the Junction City Band and they played many of the 50’s dance music.  We
danced for about two hours and then were tired so we came on home.  I sure
enjoy being with Mae.  I was in quite a bit of pain this evening, some from
dancing and I am not sure where the rest is coming from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then I talked to Scott by phone for a few minutes.  We left shortly after
10AM to go to Mike and Becky’s.  Mike went with me to Cabela’s sports store
where I bought some 20 GA. Shotgun shells, a gun case and looked for a spot
light but didn’t find what I wanted.  We enjoyed visit with the children. 
While Mike and I were gone, Mae went with Mattie to a soccer game that Mattie
played in.  Mae and I took Becky and Mike out for dinner as a Birthday gift for
Mike Birthday which is on Monday.  We went to Salt Lake to Macaroni Grill
restraint and had a wonderful meal.  We sure enjoyed visiting with Mike and Becky. 
When we got home I went out and talked with Mark about the garden.  When I came
in Bruce was here and he wanted to work on the computer to get the wireless
internet working.  He worked for a couple of hours and we think it is now
working.  Mae and I had planned on watching a movie before we went to bed but
it was to late so we gave each other hair cuts and showered and went to bed
about mid-night.</span></p>

alarm but forgot to turn it on so we over slept this morning.  When I got up I
had to hurry get ready and over to the church in order to set up chairs.  When
I got home we ate a quick breakfast and went to church.  For lunch we just
warmed up left over, I then took a nap.  Mae started dinner for this afternoon
as Jeff and Scott are bringing their families over about 5PM for dinner.  When
I got up I went over to Brother Error Farr’s and visited with him about his
Family History files that are over at the Clearfield Family History Center.  I
caught up my journal entries for the past three days as I have got behind.  Scott
was in a meeting and it lasted longer than they had planned so it was after
5:30PM when they got here.  Mae sure had a nice dinner.  We enjoyed the warm
afternoon and went out side for a while.  It was almost 9:30PM when Scott and
his family left.  I had thought that we would watch a movie in bed but we will
probably just go to sleep as I have to go into the bus terminal about 6:45 in
the morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM so that I could be at the bus terminal by 6:50AM.  I drove bus #26, Alan
Mollewhauer’s route with him riding with me.  We picked up Jr. High students
and took them to North Davis Jr. High and then picked up grade school students
and took them to Hill Field Elementary.  I then came home and Mae and I went
over to Gail’s where I gave her a Priesthood Blessing.  Gail had called me
early this morning before I started the bus run and asked if I could give her a
blessing.  There were many tears shed by Gail, Mae and I in concern for Jeff. 
Mae and I then went to the Family History Center in Ogden and though we were
late we did get in on part of the lesson.  We came home and ate some lunch and
I tried to take a short nap but my mind was too full of concerns to be able to
go to sleep.  I made the afternoon run and that went well.  Bob had started the
irrigation water system up after I had got home this morning and I had left the
window down in my pickup.  When I went to leave for the afternoon run my truck
seat was wet and I had to get some heavy bath tiles to set on until it dried
out.  I had to get gas for my truck before going home this afternoon.  Also Bob
forgot that the dog had broke several lines in the in the flower beds and when
I got home I had to tell him to shut them off until I could repair them.  This
evening I ate dinner and then went out back and started building the rabbit
hutches.  I also repaired the water lines in the flower beds.  It was after 8PM
when I came in and showered.  I then entered this journal entry before going to

the Farmington terminal and drove bus 487 with Darrel Burnson.  It was a Jr.
High run followed by a grade school run.  It went quite well and we were
finished by 9AM.  Darrel had a field trip to take today so he will just get
back in time to go to the school for the return runs.  I will not go with him. 
That is ok with me as I spent the rest of the day building the rabbit hutches.  Before
I got started Neil Knudsen called and asked if I would help him give his son a
blessing.  I was over there for about an hour.  Ryan is having trouble
breathing but they are unable to get an appointment with his Doctor.  They did
have a nurse call back and suggested that they go into the emergency entrance
of the hospital and they can then get him some help.  Ryan was still trying to
decide if he wants to do that or not when I left.  I quite at 6PM for dinner
and we relaxed the rest of the evening.</span></p>

get ready to go into work.  While I was shaving the phone rang and before I got
it Mae had answered it.  They said that it was the 911 operator and said that
some one on this phone had called 911 and hung up.  Mae explained that that
couldn’t be possible as we hadn’t called and there was no one else here.  The
operator said that their was two officers in our front yard and asked that she
go there and explain that everything was ok and we had not called.  When she
did they asked her to check on others in the house.  She checked Bob, Carroll
and Mark and they were all asleep.  We don’t know how the call came through on
our phone number.  I drove bus #486 both this morning and this afternoon.  In
between the morning and afternoon runs I came home for lunch.  Scott and Jeff
also came today.  Mae had made a very nice dinner.  I thought I could get some
things accomplished before I had to return for the next bus run but Bob called
and asked me to check a water leak in their kitchen.  I couldn’t find it but
set it up to dry out.  When I got home this afternoon Mae had a very nice
dinner prepared for the Elders.  That was an enjoyable time visiting with
them.  After taking the Elders home I worked on the water problem upstairs and
found that a supply line had cracked.  We had to go to Home Depot to get a new
supply line and also a few things for the rabbit hutches.  It didn’t take very
long to replace the supply line but the evening was about gone so made this
entry before we went to bed.  We had to play a game of solitary on the computer
before we shut it off and went to bed.</span></p>
