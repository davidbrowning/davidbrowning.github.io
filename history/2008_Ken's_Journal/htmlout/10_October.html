<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 3AM
and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I read a chapter in the Book of Mormon and
still didn’t feel sleepy so I watched a movie on Comcast.  I did go back to bed
at 6AM and slept until 8AM.  After breakfast David brought Conner for Mae to
tend.  She later picked up Tyler and Emily from school and took the three
children to Dinosaur Park in Ogden.  I made a bus run from noon to 4:30PM again
today.  Mae had got home just a little before I did and had dinner about ready. 
We ate and went over to the Clearfield Family History and started out training
to be workers there.  While we were there I found that Brother Pierce, the
director of the center, and I are related through the Browning.  I think that I
have a picture that shows his 3<sup>rd</sup> Great Grandmother and my 3<sup>rd</sup>
Great Grandfather are brother and sisters.  It was almost 9:30PM when we got
home.  I finished this entry and took a shower before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:15AM so that I could get to the bus compound and ready to ride on a morning
route.  I came home about 9:30AM and took care of things around the house.  I
went back for a afternoon run and this time I drove the bus.  After finishing
the run I went into Best Buy and bought a 4 year insurance on my GPS, a cover
for the GPS and a memory chip for the GPS.  Mae had dinner ready when I got
home.  She had expected Jeff and Gail to come over for dinner but Jeff had too
much to do at work and was late leaving.  Jeff just stopped by and we sent
dinner home with him.  I got my route entered into my GPS for tomorrow
morning.  We will see how it works on this run.  Bruce was here to visit his
parents and did some work on my computer this afternoon.  Mae got the bank
statement balanced this evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I made
another bus run today, getting home about 3:30PM.  I was tired but I set down
and started to figure my runs for next week.  I told the dispatch that I would
not be available to drive bus on Monday but by this evening all other days next
week have a run scheduled.  Mae took Kylan and Ashley to Dinosaur Park today. 
They got home about 5PM and we then went to Golden Corral where we met Scott
and Mishelle and had dinner.  Mae and I then went to the Val Browning Center at
Weber Collage to see a Ballet.  I fell asleep shortly after we got there and
later Mae asked that we leave because her hip was hurting.  We came home and
soon went to bed.  We decided to watch a movie and found the movie “Monkey
Business” staring Carry Grant.  It was good.  I sure love being with Mae.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until almost 8AM.  Mae gave me a hair cut and then we took showers.  I prepared
breakfast of fish and eggs.  Very good.  We sure enjoyed this mornings first session
of General Conference.  After the conference session finished I worked on my
desires for my funeral services.  Mark came down and visited for a few
minutes.  Mae went over to the nursery to exchange a plant.  I took care of my
rabbits and then continued to work on the computer for a while.  There was a
special program on TV about President Thomas Monson’s life and his callings
that was very good.  Mae came home just in time to lesson to the second session
of conference.  I popped a popper of corn and sure enjoyed that as we watched
and listened to the conference session.  I also filled some capsules with
Mannatech product as I enjoyed conference.  Scott and I attended the Priesthood
Session of General Conference and sure enjoyed the talks and the spirit that
was there.  After the meeting Scott and I went out to eat and enjoy the time
together.  When I took Scott home I went in with him and we assembled a new
recliner/rocker that was bought for Mishelle’s comfort when these twin babies
arrive.  I sure enjoyed this evening.  Mae was watching a movie when I got home
so I watched it with her.  It was a good show with little profanity but it did
show the world of Babylon. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8AM.  I prepared breakfast with the new omelet pan that Mae bought
yesterday.  We enjoyed watching General Conference today.  After the morning
session I had to call Scott and tell him to ignore my concerns about the
financial depression that we talked about last night.  After listening to the last
two talks this morning, I believe that we just need to follow the prophet and
do the best we can.  Mae cooked up some elk steaks that the bus assistance gave
me last week.  It was good to have some meat other than chicken and fish for a
change.  This afternoon I got the boat ready to go in the morning.  I worked on
a story and sent it to my family.  I also got things put together for in the
morning.  Mae worked on some Family History and got my lunch ready for
tomorrow.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and picked up Randy at 5AM.  we went up to Strawberry Reservoir fishing. 
Fishing was very slow this morning but picked up this afternoon.  We caught
several but as normal there had to release most of them.  We did bring three
fish home.  It was late when we got home so I soon went to bed as I have to go
early tomorrow for a field trip.  Mae was busy today getting things ready for
Christmas.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was at the
bus shop at 6AM to line things up for a field trip this morning.  I was able to
get to Viewmont High School just about 5 minutes before they were ready to load
the bus.  The reason for being late is that when I was ready to leave the
compound there was a buzzer on the bus that was going off.  I was unable to
find it so took the bus up and had a mechanic come out and check it.  It was a
emergency window alarm.  While I was waiting at UVU in Orem, Roberta called me
and wants me to do an afternoon run for a Jr. High and an Elementary.  I was
able to get back just in time for those runs.  By the time I cleaned the bus
and visited with Roberta concerning a field trip on Saturday, it was after 5PM
when I got home.  We ate and then went over to the Family History Center for
the evening.  We mainly worked on merging the Browning PAFF files we got from
Carla and Betsy.  When we got home I made some bids for next week and entered
my journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, October 08, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I made an
early morning run with a assistant to help me.  This was Alama who I have
worked with before.  She said that she know the route and didn’t need me to use
my GPS, but she got me lost about three times.  It was interesting how
independent a person can get.  She had help available but wouldn’t use it.  I
guess that is like a lot of us, we have a Heavenly Father that is waiting to
bless and help us but many will not look up.  The other thought that I had is
that this GPS is a man made Liahona but many can not except that our Father in
Heaven can’t help each individual person.  I got a short break between the
morning trip and the afternoon trip but was sure tired when I got home.  Mae
had dinner about ready and we took it over to Jeff and Gail’s where we ate and
then played games.  Jeff was sure on one this evening and made me feel like I
am sure a dumb bell.  When we came home I went right to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, October 09, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went into
the Dispatch just as a on call but I was soon asked to make a run.  A driver
just didn’t show up.  When I came home between runs Mae was gone to tend
children for Gail.  I fed the rabbits and took a short nap.  I got something to
eat and went back to take a field trip run.  I got home a little after 4PM. 
Mae still wasn’t home when I got there.  Before leaving the bus compound I was
asked to take a route tomorrow.  I thought I could get the routes entered into
my GPS while waiting for Mae but Bob came down and showed me some sales and
stayed and talked for some time.  That had me upset and when Mae did get home I
wasn’t in a very good mood.  That didn’t help things.  After dinner Mae had the
book group to go to so I went shopping with Bob and bought me some new boots. 
I did straighten a few things up before Mae got home.  I finished entering the
routes for tomorrow in the GPS and caught my journal up before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When I got up
I let Mae sleep in.  I made a bus run this morning to North Layton Jr. High and
to Mountain View elementary.  I came home for a while and took a nap. Mae was
gone, when I woke up, as she went out to lunch with Georgia today.  As we often
do, Mae had left me a little note.  I will enter that note at the end of this
entry.    She also did some shopping before returning home.  Before going back
to the bus shop I helped Mark get some of the vegetables harvested from our
garden.  It looks like with the frost last night and the expected frost tonight
our garden is finished for this year.  I made an afternoon run and got things
lined up for a field trip tomorrow.  I still beat Mae home.  Bob and I went
Home Teaching this evening and visited Brother Casey and Patriarch &amp; Sister
Johnston.  After I got home we went to bed and watched a movie on DVD, “For
Ever Young.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7:45AM.  I took a shower and got dressed.  Mae had got up a little
earlier than I did and had breakfast about ready.  After breakfast I went out
and fed my rabbits.  I then took a ladder over to our neighbors, Mike, and
picked two buckets of apples from his tree.  I got ready and left for the field
trip.  The school called and upped the leavening time by 45 minutes due to
weather and also the fact that there is a BYU home football game tonight.  We
are to transport the Davis High School Marching Band to Mountain View High
School in Orem.  I got over to the school 1<sup>st</sup> out of the five busses
but I didn’t know where the North bus loop was so a 2<sup>nd</sup> bus came and
he helped me get to the loading area.  The 4<sup>th</sup> bus was late as the
driver hadn’t gone in early enough and found that his bus was low on fuel.  He
had to go after fuel.  The 5<sup>th</sup> driver found that the bus that had
been assigned to him was not in the lot so he had to find another bus to
drive.  We were over 45 minutes late leaving the school.  The trip went well
and the kids were very good.  When we got there we were instructed to pull into
a very small parking lot.  After getting 4 of the 5 busses into the lot we were
told that they were moving us about 5 blocks away.  We just had to drive over
the curb to get out of the lot.  When we finally got to a grade school parking
lot and unloaded the youth, it was amazing to see the youth prepare for the
competition.  After the competition was over we reloaded and left for home.  As
it got dark some of the youth was making quite a bit of noise in the back of
the bus.  I finally turned the interior light and that calmed them down.  I was
also impressed with the fact that when the youth unloaded two youth remained on
the bus and picked up all the trash and left behind items.  It was after 8PM
when I got back to the bus compound.  I was tired when I got home but we stayed
up and watched a movie.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When we go up
this morning we found several inches of new snow.  I had to shovel snow and
then went over to the chapel to help set up chairs but they were all done.  I
came home and fed the rabbits.  We enjoyed the meetings today.  Bob cooked some
diner for us.  This afternoon we went up to David and Shauna’s where all the
family assembled for the afternoon.  It was a good afternoon and evening.  Terry
called this evening after we got home.  He is flying to Salt Lake Friday for a
special conference and would like to have seen us while he is in the area.  It
was good to talk to him for a few minutes anyway.  It was late when we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t get
a call from the bus dispatch so we slept in.  I didn’t get up until after 8AM. 
I cooked us egg omelets for breakfast but I burned it a little.  I still
haven’t got the hang of the new omelet pan.  After breakfast Mae had a dental
appointment.  While she was gone I fed the rabbits and then went over to
Fieldcrest Cabinet Co. and got a new set of hinges for the turn table cabinet
and also a cutting board.  I also had time to enter my bus time for the past
week.  Irven, Sandy and Bryce came over to get Irven’s truck.  They had to put
2 quarts of transmission oil in it before they could drive it.  Mae and I put
up apple sauce and dried some apples.  It was after 10PM when we finished and
cleaned up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and after getting up and showering I fixed breakfast while Mae bottled
tomatoes.  I went out and fed the rabbits.  Mae went to an appointment with
Charly Child.  I have a field trip this afternoon.  When I got to the bus
compound and looked for my assigned bus it wasn’t there.  I took another and
got to the school about 5 minutes before time to leave.  I took Syracuse High’s
J.V. football team to Fremont High School.  It was a good game and Syracuse won
21 to 10.  After returning I called Jeff and we met at the Layton Hill Mall
where I bought me some flip-flops to replace the ones that I bought while on
our mission.  We then went to a restraint and got something to eat so we could
talk.  I talked pretty straight to Jeff but I don’t think I got anywhere. 
After getting home I entered my time and mileage into the computer.  Mae came
home from the Family History Center and the two of us talked for a couple of
hours about Jeff and Gail.  I am not sure that the best thing for Gail would be
to separate form Jeff and maybe it would wake Jeff up.  It was mid-night before
we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got a call
from the bus dispatch this morning at 5:30AM asking me to make a run.  Mae got
up and got me some breakfast and I made the run ok.  When I returned I just had
time to drive to my appointment with Nancy and Fran.  Mae called and told me
that I needed to take my last readings and a list of things to get while at
Nancy’s.  I drove home and got the things but was a little late getting to my
appointment.  My tests looked very good and I was told that I could now eat a
little red meat but preferably not grain fed meat.  When I got home I did take
a nap before going on the afternoon run.  I tried to fuel the bus before the
run but couldn’t the fuel card.  When the assistant go on the bus and I told
her she found the card in another place that it is normally kept.  I tried
again but the pump would only give me 5 gal. of fuel.  The run went well and I
got back to the compound a little early so I tried again to fuel the bus and
was able to get 116 gal. in this time.  I got home qand Mae wasn’t quite ready
to leave for Orem.  We called Mike on the cell phone and told him we would meet
them at the game.  He gave us directions how to get to Pleasant Grove High school. 
As we were driving on the freeway several driver disregarded the laws for the
HOV lane.  Just before reaching the Pleasant Grove exit a fellow crossed into
the HOV lane over double solid lines and then cut back to the regular lanes.  A
Utah Highway Patrol officer saw him and pulled him over.  That made my day.  Although
the Pleasant Grove team won the game 17 to 0 over American Fork, David made a
great sack in the first of the game and he got a lot of play time.  Sandi,
Nick, JaNae and her children also came to the game.  We stayed the night at
Mike and Becky’s so we can tend the children the next two days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night as I woke at 2:30AM worrying about Jeff.  I did get
back in bed at 5AM but still didn’t sleep very peacefully.  We got up shortly
after 8AM and after eating breakfast Mike and Becky left for Park City.  Before
breakfast David played on his guitar and the piano.  He is very talented in
several areas.  Mae played games with the little girls while I did up the
dishes and caught up my journal.  I took a nap this afternoon.  Page went baby
sitting this afternoon and evening.  David went bowling with his friends but
when they got there they found out that they would have a long wait so they went
to a movie instead.  This afternoon Mae, Jessie, Mattie and I went to the Provo
Mall where I got new grams on my glasses.  I broke the frame while on the bus
route yesterday.  While I was getting my glasses repaired, Mae and the girls
road on the elevator and escalators.  As we were trying to find the mall, a
pickup got in the wrong lane to the left side of me.  He pulled out right in
front of me and I had to slam on my brakes to miss him.  There was a Highway
Patrol officer just to my right side and he pulled the pickup over to sight
him.  On the way home we stopped at the grocery store for a few items.  When
Page got home and Mae had put the little girls to bed, Mae, Page and I played
some card games.  Mae and I watched a show on TV before going to sleep.</span></p>

about 8AM but I slept until 9AM.  After I ate some breakfast, Mae, Mattie, Jessie
and I played a game of Old Pig.  I then worked on my journal.  Mae, Mattie,
Jessie and I walked to the school where Mattie and Jessie attend and played on
the swings and gym sets they have there.  This afternoon Mae, Page, David and I
played cards until Page left with a friend and her family to stay the weekend
in a cabin at Park City.  David had to work this evening.  Mae and I took Mattie
and Jessie to a movie “Wallie”.  We couldn’t find seat together so Mae and
Jessie set together and Mattie and I set almost to the front.  We had not been
there very long when Mattie decided that she needed to go to the bathroom.  I
took her out.  We hadn’t got back to our seats when she decided that she didn’t
feel good.  I took her back to Mae and she set on Mae’s lap and watched the
rest of the movie.  It was almost 9PM when we got home.  Mae read the girls
stories and put them to bed.  We went up stairs and watched a show on TV. 
There wasn’t much to watch so we saw an animation show “Malon”.  We watched it
mainly waiting for David to get home.  I stayed up writing on this journal

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
late but when I got up Mae had breakfast about ready.  David was going to play
a video game on their big screen TV but the TV isn’t working.  Mae said that
she and the girls were watching a show yesterday and the screen went black. 
David said that it happened the same way a few months ago and the repair man
found that the main light had burned out.  He feels that is the same thing this
time.  David went out and mowed the lawns and trimmed.  He told us that he did
it so that it would cushion the blow for Mike when he tells Mike that the TV is
out.  Tayler Page went with a friend and her family to the Park City Area to
stay in a cabin over the weekend.  David, Mattie, Jessie, Mae and I went
bowling this afternoon.  I seems that this is the only time that we go bowling
is when we are with Mikes family of Shellie’s family.  When Mike and Becky came
home, David told his mother about the TV and she suggested that they wait to
tell Mike until Mike had a chance to take a nap.  Things didn’t go the best on
their trip as the hot tub in their room didn’t work, the first morning the maid
woke them early, and the second morning a construction crew woke them early
with some remodeling of the apartment next door.  The hot tub did not get
repaired while they were there.  When they checked out, Mike told the clerk of
the problems and she said that she was sorry but the only thing she could do is
to reduce the cost by twenty dollars.  Mike didn’t feel that that was very much
compensation, but will have to call the manager on Monday.  Well, Becky’s
suggestion didn’t work as Mattie blurted out to her dad that the TV was
broken.  Mike did go upstairs and took a nap.  We visited with Becky for a
while before coming home.  We got home at 7PM and turned on a TV program on
Hallmark.  We watched two shows, during which time Mae gave me a hair cut.  We
then took showers and went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well and woke early.  We got up about 7AM and I was late getting to
the church to set up chairs but did help Brother Higley finish up.  We attended
meetings and enjoyed them.  Mae went to go home during Sunday School but saw
Bishop Smith in the hall and ask if she might visit with him.  She told me that
she visited with him about the concerns we are having about Jeff.  Both Mae and
I had fasted with those concerns this morning.  Bob soon had dinner ready when
we got home from church.  After eating we came downstairs and took a nap.  When
I woke I remembered that I hadn’t fed the rabbits this morning so I took care
of them.  This afternoon Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley came over for dinner
and to visit this evening.  Mishelle is sure miserable but she keeps smiling. 
Bob and I went over to Fallis’s this evening and finished our Home Teaching. 
It was after 1030PM when we went to bed tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
3AM and didn’t sleep much after that and got up at 5:15AM to get ready to go to
the bus compound.  The run this morning went well.  I took a nap after I got
home.  I then went out and moved the water line and rolled up the hoses that
are out in the garden area.  I hung the water line on the fence so that it will
be protected from damage during the fall cleanup and the winter.  This after noon
runs also went well but I had to take another bus as the backup lights were not
working on the regular bus and the shop was unable to get them repaired in
between this morning and afternoon runs.  This evening I made a modification to
the white doe’s pellet feeder as she keeps digging the pellets out and they are
lost.  I raised the feeder about 3 inches to see if that might help.  Mae had a
sister that she needed to visit in order to complete her Visiting Teaching this
month so she did that this evening.  I got on the computer and tried to enter
some more time but Janet does not have the information entered on her side
yet.  Bishop Smith and his sister came over and picked some grapes this
evening.  He came in and visited for a few minutes with Mae and I.  We then ate
dinner and watched the movie “Emma” before going to sleep.  That was a very
enjoyable movie and so refreshing to have not questionable or objectionable
parts.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up
early to be ready for the bus run but when I got to the bus compound the bus
for the route was still in being repaired.  I went to get the bus that I was to
use as a substitute but it was missing.  I had to go back to dispatch and took
another bus.  With all that changing I was running a little late so was in a
hurry.  As I pulled up to the first stop and was loading youth I saw another
bus coming up the road behind me.  I questioned it for a minute but then pulled
to the next stop.  As those students were loading I heard a driver call
dispatch asking why another bus was picking up his students.  I guess the other
driver only took off one day but since I had most of the students loaded they
had me complete the Jr. High run and then come back to the compound.  I then
stayed and attended a sub-drivers round table meeting.  During the meeting, Sue
who was conducting the meeting, commented that she would be glad to have
someone sweep her bus, so before I left is swept out her bus and left 36 cents
on the drivers seat that I had found on the floor while sweeping.  I came home
and checked the rabbits, which Mae had already feed.  Mae had a dentist
appointment this afternoon.  I sprayed the garden with Round-up to kill the
weeds.  I planted Mae’s bush and sprayed the fence lines.  I next started
cutting a cover out for the electrical panel upstairs.  By then Mae was home
and had dinner ready.  We ate and went to the Family History Center.  While
there I worked on the Hill lines and got a lot of information down loaded. 
There is lots of duplicates, so I worked on some of those and then I started
looking at Granddad and Grandma Hill’s family record and found a lot of missing
information.  We ran out of time and had to close up for the night.  When we
got home I worked on my journal.  I guess we had better get to bed because I
might get a call to drive in the morning.  I do have a field trip for tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I am not
quite sure about this morning.  I believe I just worked around the house.  I
repaired the rabbit pen by reattaching the roof to the buck’s pen.  It has been
setting on top every since the pen got blown over and broke the top off.  I
didn’t get much more accomplished when it was time to eat and take a field
trip.  I took Syracuse cross country team to a state track meet at Sugar House
Park in Salt Lake.  It was a little after 7PM when I got back home.  Mae was
over visiting with Jeff this evening.  I watched the movie, “Cimarron”.  It was
a good movie.  Mae got home just before it finished.  After the movie we talked
until almost mid-night, before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got a call
at 5:30AM asking me to make a bus run.  Mae prepared me some breakfast and I
made the morning run.  I then attended a Defensive Driving class from 9:30AM to
12:30PM.  I came home and got some lunch and then went back and took a
afternoon bus run.  I took children home from Layton High School first.  When I
went to Layton the bus loop was closed but I didn’t realize that until I had
got inside the parking lot.  I had a lot of problems getting the bus back out
and around to the West Side parking lot to load the students.  After that run I
went to Davis Central Jr. High and took students home from there.  we had just
got onto Main street when I could smell smoke.  I am sure it was pot.  I pulled
the bus over to a safe place and stopped.  By that time all students in the bus
denied everything.  I took them on home and then went to Lincoln Elementary and
took students from there.  There was a young boy that must be “ADHD” because he
was sure hyper and caused quite a disturbance.  I had to stop the bus twice to
settle him down.  I was glad when I finished this run.  I had to go into the
bus shop and report the problems so I was late getting home.  Mae has been
tending Benji and Rachel today.  She also told me that Mishelle is about ready
to have these twins.  We may not be able to go to Park City next week.  Bob
called and said that there was a good show on Hall Mark so we watched that. 
The name of the show was “Crossroads”, and it was very good.  I tried to catch
my journal up to date and had some questions about what I did yesterday.  That
is getting bad when I miss one day and have a hard time remembering what I did
that day.  It was after 10PM before we started to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had a class
at 9:30AM until 12:30PM.  I came home long enough to have some lunch and then
went back to the bus compound and took a Field trip.  I took some children from
Sunset Elementary to a corn maze in Syracuse.  It went well.  Mae was gone to
meet Sandi and Nick in Bountiful, where she got Paris, Sandi’s dog, from them
for us to tend for a few days.  They are going up to Park City for a few days
and will be back on Tuesday.  The plans are that we will go up on Tuesday and
give Paris to them, and then we will stay in the condo until Friday morning. 
Things may change with the expecting of these twins of Scott and Mishelle’s.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning and then got up and got things put together to go fishing.  We
went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and got Kylan and Ashley and took them with
us.  It was about 1:30PM before we got on the lake and by 2:30PM we had our
fish.  I had rigid up three poles and at one time we had fish on all three at
the same time.  When we first got on the water it was windy and Ashley was
nerves of the boat rocking but when we started catching fish she forgot all
about it and really enjoyed it.  Mae drove the boat most of the time and I was
just busy trying to bate poles, net fish and help Ashley real in a couple.  We
got several pictures so that was good.  After we had limited out we boated for
a while.  Kylan enjoyed driving the boat.  I just had the boat at a slow speed
when I let him drive and he sure had fun doing donuts and hitting the boats own
wake.   The kids sure had fun and of course that made it fun for Grandma and
Grandpa.   It was late in the afternoon when we got home.  we called Scott on
the way home and found that he had taken Mishelle into the hospital.  We
stopped and got the children’s close and took them to our place.  We will keep
them for a few days.  Scott called and said that they are going to keep
Mishelle in the hospital tonight.  I visited with Bob and Mark about repairing
the rooter tiller and the thoughts of raising chickens.  The rooter tiller
would cost over $800.00 to repair it and I figure that we would have at least
$2,000.00 to get started with chickens.  I am afraid that those costs will be
mine if we do them and right now I don’t know if it would be the wise thing to
do.  I cleaned the fish and fillet them.  It was very late when we got to bed
and I was very tire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
6:30AM but when I went to read my scriptures, my palm said that the time change
took place this morning.  That meant that I was up an hour to early.  I got on
the inter-net and checked and daylight saving time still is in effect until
November.  Oh well! I was just hoping to go back to sleep for an hour.  I went
over to the church and helped set up chairs.  When I got home Mae told me that
Scott called and asked if I could join him and Mishelle’s Father to give
Mishelle a blessing.  I went right over to the hospital and the three of us
gave her a blessing.  I stayed for a little while until the Dr. came and started
her with pain medication.  Wasn’t any thing more that I could do so I came
home.  We went to Sacrament meeting taking the children with us.  Bob prepared
dinner for us of baked chicken.  I took a nap this afternoon while Mae and the
children went walking at the park.  Jim Frazer called after 3PM and we visited
for a while.  I worked on my journal getting it caught up to date.  Boy! I
shore forget from one day to the next if I wait to fill in my journal.  I
helped Mae get some fish cooked for dinner.  Scott called us to let us know
that Mishelle gave natural birth to twins at 4:09PM and that mother and babies
are doing well.  The boy was born first weighting 5lb 15oz and the girl second
weighting 5lb 8oz.  They both have dark hair and are doing well.  That is great
news!  This evening we took Kylan and Ashley over to the hospital to see their
mom and dad.  We stopped first at their home and picked up a few items and took
the clothes that Mae had washed back.  We got my pickup so that I will have it
tomorrow.  As the babies are a month early they are in NICU for a few days, so
Kylan and Ashley were not able to go in to see the twins.  Scott was able to
take Mae and I down and after washing we were able to go in and see the
babies.  They are both looking so good and so fully developed.  We were able to
take some pictures and visit with the nurse in charge of them.  Mishelle is
doing quite well but her legs are still num.  When we left the hospital we
drove down to the bus compound and I went to bus 499 that I drove yesterday and
found my clip board.  We came home and got the children to bed.  I finished my
journal entries before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David brought
Conner for Mae to tend this morning.  After feeding the rabbits (the children
helped me, they love to do that), I took my boat over to Dick’s Boats and had
them winterize it.  After dropping it off, I went to the tool rental and rented
a Rota-tiller.  It took me almost 2 hours to till the garden area.  Mae had
lunch ready when I returned home.  I took a nap and then went back and got my
boat.  I stopped at Macey’s and bought a few items for Mae and then went to the
Good Earth Health Store and bought some food there.  Riverdale Road was really
a mess with the construction.  I got home just in time to eat some dinner and
then we took Kylan and Ashely over to the hospital to see their Mother and
Father.  David had come earlier to pick up Connor.  Mae played games with the
grandchildren &amp; took them to the park during the day.  It was late when we
got home so we put the children to bed and then cleaned up and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got a call
at 5:10 AM this morning by the bus dispatch, asking if I could make a run but I
turned it down.  I helped Mae with breakfast, fed the rabbits and then we got
things packed to go.  We got over to the hospital at 11AM but Jackie and Dennis
were late.  We took the children to the nursery where Scott and Mishelle were
able to bring the babies to the window and show them to Kylan and Ashley.  The
children were thrilled.  We left Kylan and Ashley with Dennis and Jackie for
them to tend.  We took Scott and Mishelle’s car to their place and left it.  We
stopped at Sub-Way in Kaysville and got a salad for each of us.  it was 1:30PM
before we got to Park City.  We spent the afternoon with Sandi, Nick, Brad,
JaNae and their children, looking around the Condo and playing games.  Nick and
I played a game of Giant Chess.  They left for home about 5PM.  We enjoyed grilling
chicken breast for our dinner.  We decided to watch a DVD this evening but was
unable to get the machine to run.  We called Sandi and Nick but when we still
couldn’t get it to work we called the desk.  They finally sent a repairman up
and when he couldn’t get it to work he turned the screen around and found that
it had been hooked up wrong.  We started to watch one DVD but the language was
terrible so we shut it off and watched another.  The movie was “The Man of
Fire” with Densil Washington and though it was quite violent, the language was
much better and the plot was good.  We sure enjoyed the evening together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then went out looking for some place to eat.  I had my mind set on an omelet
but we couldn’t find a café that was open in Park City.  We drove out of town
and saw a sigh advertising a café ahead.  It was a fast food joint at a service
station.  When we went to order they wouldn’t serve breakfast after 11AM.  The
girl irritated me with her attitude and dress so we just left.  We tried to
find a Dinner that Larry and Dian Steel told us of last Sunday.  By then it was
late and I was very hungry so we stopped at a grocery store in Kamas where we
bought some fried chicken and some salads and ate there.  We then bought some
other groceries.  As we checked out we asked the clerk about the Dinner and she
told us where it was.  We drove there just to find it and then drove on up to
Smith and Morehouse reservoir and camp grounds.  We were very excited to find
the area and think that maybe we will come back next summer for a few days.  We
came back to the condo where I entered my journal and we took a nap.  This
afternoon we went swimming, enjoyed the hot tubs, played table tennis (which
Mae won), and played a couple of games of Fox and Geese, (which I won 2 out of
3).  I grilled steak while Mae got the rest of the meal ready.  After eating we
watched two DVDs, “This is The Army” and “Walk the Line”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then had breakfast.  After cleaning up we went for a walk around the
condominiums and ski shops and then walked downtown.  We then went hot tubing
and swimming.  We then came back to the room and showered.  I took a nap while
Mae did her hair.  We came down to the Ogden Temple and attended the 5:45PM Stake
endowment session.  After the session we stopped at the Chuck Wagon and had
dinner.  It was 10:30PM before we got back to the condo so we put on a DVD and
watched that.  Mae fell asleep during the show so she didn’t see much of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
late and then took a bath in the double tub.  The front desk called at 11AM, to
remind us that we were to check out at 10AM.  We thought that it was noon for
the checkout.  We hurried and packed up.  It was funny because I packed the bath
room items and Mae packed the bedroom things.  Mae wasn’t finished with the
bathroom things so had to re-open those items and then I found that Mae had
packed all my clothes and I wasn’t completely dressed.  We laughed about that. 
We were out before noon.  We went through some of the Factory Outlet stores but
was not happy at what we found there.  We stopped at Hoggle Zoo and spent the
afternoon going through it.  The weather was cloudy but very pleasant.  We next
stopped at the Deseret Industries in Center Ville and found much better
selection at less cost than at the outlet stores in Park City.  When we got
home we watched a movie on DVD before going to bed.</span></p>
