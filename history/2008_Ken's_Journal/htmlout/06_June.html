<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, June 01, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke and
got up at 6:45AM and read my scriptures meditating about Faith, Hope and
Charity along with the Blessing of Rachael Lynn today.  How I pray that I can
be lead in the prayer that I give.  My Fasting today will sure be along those
desires.  David’s family will not be there as they are out of town.  I gathered
from Tyler that this is a fishing trip that they will be to.  I fear that it is
an excuse so that David will not be present when his other two brothers join the
circle for the Blessing.  Oh how wish, hope and pray that some how David and
Jeff can somehow be touched.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The weather
was so nice that we walked to our church house.  We attended our meetings and
enjoyed them.  After getting home I went outside and fed the rabbits.  The
white and brown rabbit is pulling fur and making a nest.  She should have kits
before long.  I don’t think the black rabbit took.  When I came back I noticed
that the dog had dug in the flower bed and made quite a mess.  It really upset me
and I do not like the feelings I have about the dog and the attitude that
Carroll seems to have about it.  After cleaning up the mess I came inside and
tried to take a nap.  I rested but was so upset over the dog that I didn’t
sleep.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went over
to Jeff and Gail’s about 2PM and had time to set up the table and chairs before
we went to the church.  There were two babies to be blessed today.  I had been
asked by Gail to give the blessing of Rachael Lynn and that really pleased me. 
I felt impressed that I should keep the Blessing simple and so did.  After Gail
told me that Jeff was concerned that I would give a detailed long Blessing, but
was very pleased with the prayer.  Those that stood in the circle were -   member
of the bishopric, two Brother-in-laws, Mike, Scott, friend, Ben, Trent and
myself.  After the meeting we all went to Jeff and Gail’s and had a nice lunch
in the back yard.  After everyone else left Mae and I stayed and played games
with Jeff and Gail.  We did so poorly in Rook that we called it a tie and
changed games.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mike showed
me his GPS and showed me how it works.  He let me try it for a few days to
decide if I should buy one to help me drive the bus routs.  We used it as we
came home this evening.  I think it will work ok.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, June 02, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then while I got dressed Mae fixed breakfast.  I fed the rabbits and then
finished loading some trash on Bob’s pickup.  Mark and I took it up to the
dumps and unloaded it.  I then took Mae into the Oral Surgeon to have a tooth
extracted.  We visited with him with our concerns about the work still
recommended on Mae’s teeth or whether she should have them removed and replaced
with dentures.  After examining her teeth, he strongly recommended that she not
go with dentures but save her teeth as long as possible.   He was able to
remove the one tooth with out much difficulty and all of the tooth came out
intact.  After bringing Mae back home I went to the pharmacy and filled a
prescription for pain medication and one for infection.  I also filled my
prescription for another month is starting.  I replaced the sprinkler that I
cut off when mowing the lawn on Saturday.  Bob came out and asked me to look at
his kitchen floor as it is swelling but I cannot find water getting into it.  I
went over to Georgia and Rick’s and checked out the form for pouring concrete
tomorrow.  They look pretty good but will take a little more concrete than I
expected.  I got all my tools loaded up for tomorrow.  I bought Mae a milk
shake for supper and then I got some turkey and some potato salad for my
supper.  We watched a show on Comcast and I made this entry before we went to
bed.  Mae seems to be filling fairly good as we retire tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, June 03, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got away
about 7AM and stopped at The Home Depot and bought me some concrete boots as I
have been unable to find mine.  I went to Save More Concrete where I purchased
1 ½ yards of concrete in a mixing barrel trailer.  I got to Rick and Georgia’s
about 9AM.  Mae had found my boots and so took them over to Rick and
Georgia’s.  I had her return the pair I had bought this morning.  Rick had a
young man from his Singles Ward come and help us wheel the concrete.  I showed
Georgia how to operate the concrete barrel so she could unload the concrete.  After
getting the concrete laid I had Rick return the trailer.  I tried to get a
Fresno trial but when I returned with it the concrete was to far set and I had
to trial it by hand.  I finished up the concrete about noon and then Rick and I
measured for the next pour.  I came home and ate and then lay down and took a
nap.  Mae tended Benji today.  Mae is feeling very good after the tooth
extraction yesterday.  We are sure thankful for that.  I washed the tent
trailer this evening.  While eating dinner we watched a movie on TV.  Mae got
on the inter-net.  I took a shower and prepared for bed and then entered this
entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, June 04, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and spent sometime in the recliner.  It was a rainy
morning which lasted all day so that put a damper on things.  Scott and Jeff
came over for lunch.  I worked with Mike’s GPS trying to decide if it will work
for my bus routes.  I had to go into the bus terminal to get some information
that I hadn’t recorded for the two field trips I took last week.  Mike, David,
Mattie and Jesse came up this evening.  Becky and Page will be going up to
Jackson, Wyoming with Becky’s Mother and sisters.  Mattie and Jessie will stay
with us until Becky come home on Saturday.  Mae had dinner ready when they got
here.  Bob and I went home Teaching to Patriarch and Sister Johnston this
evening.  Mike and David stayed until I got home from Home Teaching.  They then
moved the rabbit pen over to the West Side where I have the buck’s pen.  Mae
took a picture of the three of us and it is quite a stepping stone picture with
age being the short end.  Mae read the girls a story before putting them to
bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, June 05, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6 and read more in my study manual but then crawled back in bed and cuddled
with Mae.  The girls were quiet when they got up.  Mae was busy with them most
of the day, but she seemed to have had fun being with them.  I repaired another
sprinkler head that I mowed off the other day.  I went to Dallen Green’s and
bought some clover seed, a spreader and some rabbit pellets.  I then went down
the street from our house and cut some alfalfa for the rabbits.  I tilled the
old garden spot again, had Bob rack it down with the lawnmower pulling our
harrow and then I planted it with a mixture of clover and alfalfa seed.  I used
some corrugated metal and covered the roofs of the rabbit pens.  Bob cooked
dinner for us and after eating I put my tools away.  I had came in and set down
to relax when Sister Fallis called to see if we were coming Home Teaching this
evening.  I had forgotten and so had Bob, but we quickly changed and went.  We
did enjoy visiting with Brother and Sister Fallis and gave them a lesson.  They
then asked us to give Brother Fallis a blessing as he is going into the Doctors
to consult about cancer problems.  We also saw the Casey’s for our normal
doorstep visit.  I don’t know if we are doing any good but we are at least
saying hi to the each month.  When we got home I filled in my journal entry for
the day.  Mae read a story to the girls before she put them to bed.  I have got
to go to work early in the morning so we need to get to bed early also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, June 06, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early to go to Rick and Georgia’s to make another concrete pour.  It went well
and I finished about noon.  They paid me $300 for the work I did which was more
than I ask for.  Mae took Mattie and Jessie and also Kylan and Ashley to
Dinosaur Park in Ogden.  When I got home Bruce was about to leave.  He had came
to visit his parents but they were gone to Dr. appointments.  I invited him in
and I warmed some stew and had salad.  We visited for quite a while before Bob
and Carroll returned and he went upstairs to visit with them.  I laid down for
a nap, then Bob came down for some reason and woke me.  I felt like I had just
gone back to sleep when Mae and the children came bursting in and woke me with
a start.  Mae and the children didn’t get back until almost 5PM.  Bob brought home
made spagitti down for our dinner.  I think that is what he woke me to inform
me that he was making it.  Shellie called Mae today and said that Garrett had
received his Mission Call and they would call us this evening at 8PM when
Garrett opened the letter and we could hear where he is called to serve.  They
did call at 8PM and Garrett read the call.  He is called to serve in the
Washington Kennewick Mission and will report to the Provo Missionary Training
Center on August 20<sup>th</sup>, the day after his 19<sup>th</sup> Birthday. 
He sounded very excited about the call.  We asked them to let us know when he
will be speaking as well as when he will be set apart.  We will try to be there
for these special events.  I filled out my journal and then took a shower and
had Mae give me a hair cut before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, June 07, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
7 AM but Mae was already up.  I was afraid that she hadn’t slept but found out
that she had just got up before I did.  I was busy most of the day with just
odd jobs.  I did get my trailer hitch repaired, some things ready to go camping
and I went over to Fallis’s and rotivated their garden again.  Mike came and
got the little girls about 3PM.  They have been fun to have here but it has
kept Mae going.  We went shopping for groceries with most of it being for next
week.  Time sure went fast today.  I had got the recorder working and recorded
a John Wayne movie.  We went to bed and watched the movie but the recording had
gone to long and we missed the last of the show.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, June 08, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
6:30AM so I could do some more studying on the Priesthood lesson.  I changed my
approach to the lesson and was not quite sure if I was ready to give it or
not.  I went over to the chapel at 8:15AM to set up chairs but most of it was
completed when I got there.  The lesson went well and I felt good about it. 
Scott and his family came over and had lunch with us.  he brought the
children’s bikes over with them.  We removed the training wheels from Ashley’s
bike and Scott helped her learn how to ride with out their aid.  Mishelle was
quite tired so we let her take a nap while we spent time with the children. 
This evening Bob, Mae and I stopped and got Irven and Sandy and we went to S.L.
where we attended the Baptismal of Robert Bottom.  Cheryl was sure excited for
this to happen.  It was great to see Bob’s determination to change his life
when he started taking the missionary lessons.  I think they will set goals now
to have their marriage sealed in the Temple as soon as they can.  After getting
home we ate some dinner.  I got a call from Patriarch Johnston asking if I
could help him give his wife a Priesthood Blessing.  I quickly put on my tie
and jacket and went over.  Sister Johnston is having high blood pressure so
they are concerned about that.  I filled in this entry and we went to bed.  We
decided to watch a DVD before going to sleep.  It was almost mid-night when it
got over and we went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, June 09, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and hadn’t been up very long when Bob came down to tell us that the weather
report doesn’t look good for the rest of the week.  I had Bob make some waffles
for breakfast.  It took us all morning to get packed up and ready to go.  When
I hooked the trailers together I found that the plug had been bent.  I couldn’t
get the right signal light to work but we left anyway.  We went into Ogden to
buy a pressure cooker but they didn’t have the one we wanted.  It was 3PM when
we got to East Cannon and then we had trouble finding a camp space as they were
reserved for the weekend.  We got camp set up and I cooked Dutch oven chicken
for dinner.  David, Shauna and the children came and ate with us and visited
for a while before David and Shauna went home.  The children stayed over night
with us.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, June 10, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6:15AM having a dream that there was a wind and our folding camp trash can blow
away.  I got ready to go fishing.  Tyler and Emily woke and wanted to go also. 
Mae fixed us a quick breakfast and we went down to the lake.  Emily caught the
first fish and the second.  Tyler and I each caught one but mine was a smaller
one so we let it lose and kept another that Tyler caught.  I called Mae and had
she and Conner come down.  We took the fish that we had caught back to the camp
trailer and then went out again.  It was quite windy so we went to the west
side of the lake.  Emily again caught the first fish.  I drove the boat while
the others fished.  After loosing two or three Mae had me help Conner fish and
we caught a couple while Tyler and Emily caught the rest of our eight fish.  I
had Mae go get the truck and trailer and she did a perfect job of backing the
trailer into the lake.  We came back to camp and cleaned the fish and put eight
of them in the freezer.  We flayed and cooked up the four and had them with
fried potatoes for lunch.  After eating we washed up the dishes and put things
away.  I took a nap and then we drove to David and Shauna’s to take the
children home.  In order to get all of us in the pickup, Mae rode in the back. 
as we drove down I told the kids of how when I was about Tyler’s age my mother
was driving our pickup over Jackson pass and we had picked up a hitchhiker on
the Wyoming side of the pass and took him to Victor.  After telling them that
story they asked for another story so I told them the experience of going to
the auctions with Dad and the time we took started to take the bull to the
auction.  That lasted until we got to David’s.   Mae stayed and went to the
ball game that Tyler played in.  I went back down the valley and got some
natural gas for the truck, several items at home that we forgot and I stopped
at The Home Depot and bought some nuts and bolts.  When I got to David’s they
were eating dinner.  After eating we visited and Mae had been talked into
staying there tonight.  As I thought about it I was concerned about our
equipment that was up there and we decided to go back to camp.  We were
concerned as to whether we would get there by 10PM when the gates are closed
but we got there just in time.  We stayed up until 2AM playing rook, knock and
taking showers.  I had forgot to take my stomach pill this morning and so had
to set up in the recliner to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was cold
and was snowing this morning so we just stayed in bed until almost noon.  We
finally got up and got some breakfast even though it should have been lunch. 
Mae is such a wonderful wife and sweetheart and so good to me.  I did some
repairs to the boat trailer.  Mae had decided that she would stay at the camp
and let me go fishing.  She then reconsidered and went with me and was going to
read in the boat.  I caught a fish right after we started on the lake and Mae
reconsidered and decided that maybe she should also fish.  We had a good time
and it ended up Mae kept 5 fish and I only kept 3 fish.  We wiped the boat down
after bring it off the lake.  When we got to camp I cleaned the fish and sealed
them for the freezer.  Mae made a shrimp and macaroni salad for tomorrow. 
Randy and Judy will be coming up sometime in the morning and then in the
evening Jeff, Gail, Benji and Rachel will come up and stay over night and fish
with us Friday morning.  We played a game of Rack-o of which Mae started out
way ahead but then it turned around and I won.  We went to bed about 10:30 this
evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The furnace
ran out of gas early this morning but it was warm enough that we just turned
the furnace off and cuddled up and slept until after 6:30AM.  This morning is a
beautiful clear sun shinning day.  We had a nice breakfast and got things ready
for when Randy and Judy comes.  I sure have a beautiful wife that is so neat to
be with.  I called Randy about 8AM to see what time they would get to the
lake.  Randy had slept in and they were just about ready to leave.  We gave
them a little longer and then we took the boat down and got it launched.  We
went out for a while before they got there.  I mainly kept lines baited, netted
fish and drove the boat.  Judy caught the most fish but both Mae and Randy
caught limits.  Randy was hurting from the operation but it was good for him to
get out and have some fun.  Shortly after they left I drove down to Morgan and
bought a tank of propane.  As I was driving down the canon, Jeff and Gail
passed me going up to camp.  When I returned to camp, we ate dinner.  We put
the children down to sleep and we played some games.  It was mid-night when we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 6AM
but Jeff slept until almost 7AM.  I walked up to the restrooms and then hooked
up the boat.  Jeff got up and he and I went out fishing for a little while. 
Mae called me when she had breakfast about ready and we came back in.  After
breakfast, we all went for a boat ride.  Benji was not quite sure if he liked
the boat ride or not.  We came back about 11AM and packed up camp.  Jeff and
Gail took our trailer down the canon with them to save us from having to pull
both the trailer and the boat.  Mae and I went back out fishing this afternoon
and in three hours we caught both limits.  We cleaned the boat after taking it
off the lake.  We were very tired when we got home but had to unpack some
things.  When I let the tail gate down of the pickup it wouldn’t go all the way
down.  When I checked for the reason why I found that our camera was laying on
the bumper.  How it got there we did not remember.  We mainly did the basics
and let the rest go until tomorrow.  It was sure nice to come home to a clean
house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8:30AM and then got up in time for fish breakfast with Bob, Carroll and
Mark.  I took up a pan of fish last night to Bob if he would cook them up this
morning.  We finished cleaning up and putting things away.  I took care of the
rabbits.  We had to return the sprinkler that we bought last week and get
another.  We bought me some sandals and Mae some shoes.  We went in to Ogden to
find Mae a dress but couldn’t find anything that we even considered.  We picked
up the trailer from Jeff’s on the way.  After walking through the New Gate Mall
I was sure disgusted with the immodesty and tattoos that was so prevalent among
the customers in the mall and the immodest styles and sloppy clothing that is
displayed by the mechanics in the stores.  We left with out finding anything
that we even considered purchasing.  We came home and got ready to leave
again.  We picked up Scott and then drove up to a chapel in Fruit Heights where
we left our car.  David had picked up Jeff at the park-n-ride at the mouth of
Weber Canon and then picked us up.  This was we car pooled to the Sizzler in
Sager House where we met Mike and Sandi for dinner.  The kids took Mae and I
out for a Fathers Day gift.  It was a lot of fun to be with our children.  All
of our children were there except for Shellie.  After eating we went for a walk
in a near by park.  We then set on the lawn and visited about Mae and my 50th
Wedding Anniversary next year.  It was late when we got home but it was a very
special evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
later than normal this morning.  I got a call from Brother Higley letting me
know that I did not have to come over to set up chairs.  Mae wasn’t feeling
very well but got up and we went to our block meetings.  Bob and Carroll
invited us up for dinner after Church.  I visited with Mark while Mae cleaned
up from dinner.  I tried to write in my journal but was too sleepy.  Mae and I
finally took a nap.  When we got up I wrote on my journal and some more
history.  Mae worked on the inter-net.  Bob called and invited us to play
Canasta this evening.  We went up and played until after 11PM when Bob and I
finally won them.  It was a close game.  Mae and I then came back downstairs
and worked on our computers.  I did catch up my journal entries.  I also got
some history add to.  Bob called and asked if we would like to play a game of
Canasta so we went upstairs.  To nights game was close but in the end Bob and I

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and were late eating breakfast.  I worked on the computer for a while getting
files on our rabbits set up and records updated.  I adjusted some of the
sprinkler stations so that we got a more even coverage.  I still have one head
that I think we need to move.  I got more things put away from last week’s
trip.  We did some planning for a trip to Idaho.  Bob and I went down 1300
North to where the main power lines cross and there we cut down some hay that
is growing on city property out side the fence line of a field.  The owner came
down and talked to us but was ok with us cutting the hay.  We laid it out in a
wind row to dry.  I talked to Bob’s home owner insurance co. about the floor
problem upstairs to get an appraiser to check it our.  I took Brother Farr’s
Family History Records back to his house.  Mae and I went to Lagoon this
evening to be with Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley for Kylan’s Birthday.  We
just enjoyed being with them and didn’t ride any of the rides.  We did go into
the musical show that is put on nightly.  It was after 10:30PM when we got
home.  I filled in my journal while Mae showered.  We were tired tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but went back to bed and slept until almost 9AM.  Mae had got up and was ready
when David brought the children at 8AM.  She took the children into Ogden and
they went to the Dinosaur Park.  The stayed there until 2PM and then Mae met
Shauna at the mouth of Weber Canon and she took them home.  I went to Home
Depot and bought material to build a fence around the flower garden to keep the
dog out of it.  I took the rain gutter down that is over the walkway and
reinstalled it so that it wouldn’t drip water on the walk way.  Mae had got
home before I finished with the rain gutter.  I talked with the insurance co.
and the adjuster and the company that will come to give a bid on the repairs
for upstairs.  This evening we watched a couple of shows on TV.  As we did Mae
balanced the bank statement and I capsulated my Mannatech product as we were
out of capsules product.  It was 11:30PM when we finished up and I made this
entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I seem to
keep busy today but am not sure where the time went.  I looked on the internet
trying to find New Zealand White rabbits but didn’t have much luck.  I started
on the fences for the flower beds but we decided to change the design.  I hope
this works.  I did quite until almost 9PM.  Mae prepared lunch for the boys but
Scott couldn’t come.  We enjoyed having Jeff come over.  This evening Mae went
to a Relief Society Program.  I had Mae give me a hair cut and then I took a
shower before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about 4:30AM
so laid in the recliner and dosed for a couple of hours more.  We went into the
Ogden Temple this morning and when we went into the Chapel we set next to Tom
and Sherolyn Egelund.  We have been trying to find time to meet them at the
Temple for some time but this wasn’t planned.  After the session we went out to
lunch at the Chuck-A-Rama and sure enjoyed visiting and being with them.  This
is the first time that we have met Sherolyn.  We came home and were so tired
that we laid down for a hour nap.  I got some things taken care of out side and
then it was time to go over to Benji’s Birthday Party.  It was just cake and
ice cream with Gail’s mother, Gail’s sister Melody and her daughter, Brandi
with Noland joining a little later, and Mae and I.  It was a nice time. We came
home and got a few things ready for in the morning and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6AM but by the time we had breakfast, fed the rabbits and packed it was 10AM
before we left home.  we stopped in Roy at the fruit stand and bought a few
items, then we stopped in Brigham City and filled up with natural gas and
checked the tires, so each stop adds to time.  With fueling in Brigham City we
were able to get past Blackfoot on natural gas.  We stopped in Idaho Falls where
I bought a fishing license.  That was more expensive than I thought it would
be!  We also found a Sub-Way and bought a sandwich for lunch.  We made another
stop in Swan Valley to get Mae an ice cream cone.  It was after 4PM when we got
to Victor.  We drove to Mike Harris camp ground and found that the only water
is still a hand pump, so we drove back to Victor and bought some mosquito
repellant for the mosquitoes are terrible up there.  We also filled the water
tank on the trailer.  I realized that I had forgotten the keys to the camp
trailer when we left home.  I had to bend one of the locks when we got back to
camp, in order set the trailer up.  It was a beautiful evening and after eating
dinner we went for a walk.  We played some games before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
fairly well but both of us were concerned for the bear notices posted around
the camping area.  The furnace ran most of the night and emptied the one gas
tank.  After breakfast we called Shellie to wish her a Happy Birthday.  I made yesterday’s
journal entry because we have to run the generator for 120 V power and it si to
noisy to run in the evening.  We went to Victor and bought a new cane of
propane.  It is cheaper here than it is in Utah.  We then went out to Craig and
Carla’s.  Most of Rich and Lois’s family were there, Nola came but she isn’t
doing very well.  Craig and Carla had made Dutch oven chicken and hash browns
and everyone else brought the trimmings for a very nice dinner.  This afternoon
we visited, worked some on Family History and played Mormon Bridge.  We came
back to our tent trailer about 10PM and soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
fixed a light breakfast.  We took showers and then I filled the reserve tank
back up.  It is slow as the water pump just has a faucet that pours out if you
hold up a valve.  Therefore you hold the valve with one hand and pump with the
other.  At least ¼th of the water misses the hole in my water jug.  Church
started at 11AM and we got there about 20 to.  We enjoyed the meetings and them
after we went to Craig and Carla’s.  They had a nice dinner for all the
family.  After dinner we just visited and watched pictures that Elise had put
together of Rich and Lois’s life.  I went into town and bought a couple of
fishing items.  I was not able to find anyone that sold worms.  I went back and
borrowed a shovel for Craig and tried digging some but couldn’t find any.  When
Mae and I came back to our camp we went down by the creek and dug a few but
they are small.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
this morning and went fishing.  I tried by the creek here at the camp but
didn’t have any luck.  I then went to the head of the Teton River but didn’t
have any luck there either.  Many parts of the river are closed to privet lands
and due to the piped irrigation many of the streams have changed.  I gave up
and came back to our camp at 8:30AM.  I fell first thing this morning and hurt
my left little finger.  It has swollen and turning color as the day goes on.  We
went over to Craig and Carla’s about 1PM and visited with Rich and Lois.  Most
of the others had gone on a hike and got home about 4PM.  We went over to Swan
Valley where I went fishing at the spillway of the dam.  I caught one nice fish
that was 16 to 17 inches long but it was slow.  It was about 10PM when we got
back to our camp.  We soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 6AM and were busy packing and getting things ready to leave.  We had fish
and eggs for breakfast.  After getting most things ready we took showers but I
put back on everyday clothes for putting the tent trailer down.  It was 10:30AM
when we left the camp grounds and went to Rexburg.  We found a service station
and filled up with gas plus I had to add some coolant and a new windshield
wiper.  I also used the restrooms to change to my good clothes.  We got to the
Temple and went on the 12:45PM session with Rich and Lois.  Almost all of their
children were also on the session.  Also Linda came and so did Nola.  Nola has
been with the family for most of the activities this weekend.  After the Temple
session we went to a restraint and ate lunch with all the family.  We then left
for home, stopping in Pocatello at the Maverick to get a frozen yogurt.  It was
almost 10PM when we got home.  We unloaded what was necessary and then watched
a movie before going to sleep.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
out of bed until 9AM.  Mae was busy all day getting clothes washed and putting
things away.  I had to put the camping gear away and take the trailer to the
sewer dump.  I closed my account that I used for handyman work.  I had to
repair the gas valve on the camp trailer.  Before quitting for the day Bob and
I finished building and then spray painted the trellis fencing.  We got on the
inter-net and did some searching for airline tickets so that we can fly to
Arizona and back in August.  That will be cheaper than driving with the present
costs of fuel.  I filled out my journal and took a shower before going to bed. 
Mae got on the inner-net and tried to purchase air-line tickets for us to fly
to Arizona round trip.  She couldn’t get it set up and it was already past
11:30PM so she held off until tomorrow.  It was after mid-night when I got to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4AM so I could get to Randy’s by 6AM.  Mae had stayed up last night and made me
a lunch and set every thing out for breakfast when I got up.  Randy was ready,
when I got there and we drove up to East Cannon, getting there at 7:30AM. 
Fishing was slow but by 1:30PM we had our limits and came in.  We had to stop
and buy ice to put on the fish to keep them as we came home.  When I took Randy
home I gave him 4 fish.  Judy wasn’t sure she wanted them as she would have to
clean them.  I cleaned them for her.  Normally we would clean then at the lake
but the cleaning station is shut down for repairs.  When I got home I then
cleaned the four fish I kept.  We decided to take them to Bob so he could cook
them for us for breakfast tomorrow.  I was sure tired tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Neither Mae nor
I slept the best last night but we got up early so we could eat breakfast with
Bob and Carroll as Bob cooked the fish with biscuits and onion rings.  Mae took
Sister Vica Germer to the Family History Center.  I stayed home and worked
around the house and yard.  I figured some materials to do some addition to the
sprinkler system.  I also got talking to Mike next door.  Bob and I got the
fencing put up.  I then went with Bob and Carroll to pick out the flooring for
their kitchen.  When we came back Bob had me stop at China Knight and he bought
lunch.  Mae had returned and then went out Visiting Teaching.  I adjusted the
back gate before Mae got home.  after she got home we washed the car and
pickup.  I took a 15 minute nap before we went up to the Stake Camp for a Ward
Social.  We invited Karren and Joanne Von Niederhauser to ride with us to the
social.  It was a good social.  Some stayed the night but we came on home.  We
enjoyed being with the Von Niederhauser’s this evening.  It was late when I
finished my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

4:20AM and went into the front room and slept the rest of the night in the
recliner.  Mae made French toast and heated up left-over fish from yesterday. 
I took care of the rabbits and then chopped the hay I had wind rowed to dry
last week.  I started on digging a trench to add another sprinkler to the
yard.  Bob prepared liver and onions for lunch and of course cooked some
chicken for Mae.  After lunch I took a nap and then finished adding the
sprinkler head.  We hope that it will cover a area that is turning brown.  I
had Bob mow some of the back while I put the trailer away.  I also started up
the snowmobiles and warmed them up.  I added a gas additive to both machines to
help keep the gas.  Mae and I took showers and went to a production at the Roy
High School of The White Star.  Rick and Georgia’s granddaughter, Morgan Tew,
was one of the actors in the play.  She did very well and we enjoyed the
production.  It was late when we got home.  I filled in this entry before we
went to bed.  I was very tired and hurting when we went to bed.</span></p>

7AM but was still very tired.  I got dressed, went out and fed the rabbits and
then went over to the church and helped set up chairs.  My legs were hurting
quite badly when I came back home so before going to Church I took some
Tylenol.  Being it is the fifth Sunday the Priesthood met with the Relief
Society for a special lesson.  About half was through I begin to really hurt. 
After the class closed I came home and went back to bed.  Mae woke me at
12:30PM for dinner.  I feel some better but my legs still hurt.  After dinner
Mae lay down and took a nap.  I worked on my journal and history for quite a
while today.  Mae and I took time to go to the Johnston’s to see how they are
feeling.  Mae said we should keep it short but when we left over an hour later
I told her that she can now see why Bob and I are so long when we visit them. 
They are wonderful people and I do enjoy visiting with them.  I think Sister
Johnston enjoyed having Mae there so they could visit while Patriarch Johnston
and I reminisced.  Time went by quickly and it was after 10PM before we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The alarm
went off at 6AM but we slept in a little longer.  Shauna brought the children
at 8AM for Mae to tend today.  we were just eating breakfast.  We took the
children out and I showed them the baby rabbit and let them pet the others. 
Mae worked with the children and had then weed some of the garden.  Mae took
the children to the Hill Aerospace Museum.  They really had a good time there. 
I changed front brake pads on Bob’s car for him.  I got on the inter-net and on
<a href="http://www.ksl.com/">www.ksl.com</a> found a lady in Ephraim that is
selling New Zealand White rabbits.  She will bring me a buck and two does on
Saturday the 5<sup>th</sup> of July.  I will have to go to Draper to get them
from her.  Now I will have to build more pens.  I did some searching for Down
Riggers for my boat.  Bob and I went to Smith &amp; Edward’s and looked at the
Down Riggers they have.  I would like to buy an electric operated one but they
are about $500 for one and the manual would cost less than ½ of the electric. 
I decided that I would hold off and think about it.  Sandi called me and said
that Nick would pay for one downrigger.  We are considering just installing one
as I found that you can use two poles on one downrigger.  We were late getting
to bed this evening.  we watched a Doris Day movie before going to sleep.  The
Comcast channel would not work so we had to call in and they will send a
repairman out tomorrow.</span></p>
