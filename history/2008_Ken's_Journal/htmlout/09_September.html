<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                In as much as
today is a holiday we had planned to go fishing but because of bad weather we
stayed home.  We stayed in bed and watched a movie on Comcast “All That Heaven
Allows”.  It was a pretty good movie except I have a hard time watching Rock
Hudson in any movie after knowing the kind of person he was.  It was noon when
we got up and ate breakfast.  This afternoon we cleaned up the yard from the
mess the wind storm left.  I also tried to get the lawnmower working but I was
unsuccessful with that.  We had super and watched “Murder She Wrote” and again
it was a pour excuse for a show.  When I got on my computer to enter my
journal, Mae got on her computer to check her emails.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
just had my bio-cleanse drink and left for the bus run.  This mornings run went
well except I had to leave with out Brandon as he was late coming out of his
house.  When I got back to the bus shop I let dispatch know.  I was also told
that I would make a mid-day return but later was called at home and told that
it was covered by someone else.  Mae and I started sorting out things that we
had stored in the large shed.  Many items we either through away, or set them
aside to be given to the D.I.  After I returned from my afternoon run we also
did more cleaning outside.  This evening we watched Freedom Rally held in Minneapolis. 
We mainly wanted to hear Ron Paul’s speech.  It was very good.  I only wish
that he was still running for office of President of the U.S.A.  I fear that
our country is headed for real problems.  I tried to get on the Davis County
web sight but the home page has been changed and I couldn’t get on to enter my
time card information.  Mae went over to the store for a few items.  I took a
shower and shaved before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4AM
and couldn’t go back to sleep.  We had a Pre-School run that we started picking
up this morning but we were ½ hr late getting to Ellison Park Elementary.  I
spent some time in the office checking on some of the children that we did not
find at home this morning.  When I got home I fed the rabbits and helped Mae
pick tomatoes, cucumbers and corn from the garden.  Mae is tending Connor today
for Shauna.  This afternoon we also had Pre-School children on a afternoon run
to take home.  We had trouble finding the route and was over ½ hr late
finishing the rout and getting back to the bus compound.  I then had to fill
the bus with fuel.  When I got home Mae was in the middle of putting up stewed
tomatoes so I got in and helped her.  We did stope for something to eat and
then finished them.  Irven and Sandy came over and got some vegetables from the
garden.  Sandy wanted to know if I would repair their shower and bathroom for
them.  Mae told her that I couldn’t do remodeling anymore.  I had to smile.  I
will try to help them with a (Snowie Car) if Bryce will do the welding of the
frame.  Mae and I finished the tomatoes and then I worked on my bus routes and
filled out my journal entry before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I again woke
at 4AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  My bus runs went well today.  I took
time to get on the computer and enter all my time connected to the bus job. 
After getting home we went down to Albertson’s and bought a roasted chicken and
took it to the Ward Summer social held at the park.  They had hamburgers and
hot dogs as the main dish so that is why we got a chicken.  It was a nice
activity and we enjoyed visiting with many there.  After getting home from the
social I entered my journal entry for today.  I took a shower before going to
bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I took my bus
route this morning to bring the children to school but an assistant will have
to take the afternoon run.  When I got home we got ready and went to the
wedding of Lindsey Tew and Justin Calder.  They were sealed and married in the
Bountiful Temple.  The ceremony as always was very impressive and the sealer
gave some excellent counsel and advice as to the sacred covenants they are
entering into.  I liked the reminder that it was for me.  After the ceremony
there was pictures taken and then a lunching, which we were invited to
participate in.  There wasn’t much at the breakfast that we could eat except
some salad plain.  I did get a sort nap between the Temple and the lunching and
then again between the lunching and the reception.  Mike and Becky did make it
to the reception as well as Jeff and Gail and Scott and Mishelle.  I was sure
tired when we got home but we stayed up and watched a show on Comcast before
going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, September 06, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up very early but I did make it over to Scott and Mishelle’s where I laid tile flooring
in their bathroom.  Scott helped me quite a bit by cutting tile for me.  Kylan
also help by running tiles back and forth as I gave measurements and Scott cut
the tile.  The floor took 23 pieces of 12” X 12” tiles and out of that number
all but 11 pieces had to have at least one or more cuts.  I was very tired when
I got home.  Mae had a nice dinner ready for me when I got home.  She had made
a pasta salad that was very good, the pasta was made with rice flour.   I
showered and we went to bed but we did watch a shoe on Comcast before we went
to sleep.  After the show Mae stayed up and took a shower and washed her hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, September 07, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae let me
sleep until 7:30 AM so we had to hurry in order to get to church.  I am quite
stiff and sore from kneeling while flooring yesterday.  The lessons were very
enjoyable and I really enjoyed our Fast and Testimony meeting.  There were
three babies to be blessed and so there were many visitors.  I was impressed
with the amount of love and support that was shown by family and friends.  Mae
gave her testimony today and did well.  We had set to the back of the chapel,
so it was a long walk for her to go the front.  Bob prepared dinner for us and
cooked chicken in rice flower just for Mae and me.  After coming back
downstairs from dinner and visiting with Mark, I took a nap.  Later Mae and I
went upstairs and played a game of Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  On the last
hand Irven and Sandy came over.  Bob and I won the Canasta game.  Then all of
us played a game of Mormon Bridge and Irven won that.  Mae and I then came downstairs
and went to bed.  Mae isn’t feeling the best tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I rode with
Dee today to show him the rout.  After the morning run, Dee asked if I could
ride tomorrow with him.  I went into the office and asked Roberta and she gave
me permission.  When I got home after the morning run I went out to feed my
rabbits.  While out there Mike, our neighbor to the West, and I got talking
over the fence.  One thing led to another and I was able to bear my testimony
of having the Lord’s direct intervention and personal direction to me.  I think
it went well and Mike felt good at my feelings.  Maybe it will help Mike.  Bob
and I took his pickup up to the county dumps with the trash we have put in it
during the past two or three weeks.  I returned home with just enough time to
quickly make a protein drink and then go to the bus compound.  I rode with Dee
again this afternoon.  When I got home I got some tools ready for Scott and
then I got ready to go out to eat with Randy and Judy.  Mae had been with
Georgia most of the mid day to help her celebrate Georgia’s Birthday today. 
she got home just in time to go with Randy and Judy.  Randy and Judy are on the
same diet that Mae and I are on.  We discussed our diets and what each had
found we can add to the diet.  It was a very enjoyable evening.  We had planed
to come back to our home and play games but Randy and Judy needed to go visit
an Aunt whose husband has recently died.  When Mae and I came home I worked on
this journal entry while Mae read aloud our Priesthood, Relief Society lesson
for this coming Sunday.  We played a couple of hands of Solitaire before going
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very good last night but went in and rode on the bus route one more day
with Dee.  I talked with Roberta and she already has me lined up for a sub run
on Friday.  I also let her know that I would be fishing next Monday and then we
will be gone from the 18<sup>th</sup> thru the 23<sup>rd</sup> of September. 
In between the bus runs I went to Scott and Mishelle’s and grouted the bathroom
floor.  I told Scott that $100.00 would be fine for my work.  I did some work
on my personal history and then Brother Thompson came as our Home Teacher, so
we went upstairs and visited there a while.  After his visit Mae and I came
downstairs and worked on the computer for a while before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until almost 8AM.  I went into a meeting for Sub. Bus Driver at 10AM.  The
meeting lasted longer than normal.  I left and took some items to the Deseret
Industries in Layton.  I was going to get some material at The Home Depot but
ran out of time.  I got home and was still able to eat lunch with Mae, Scott
and Jeff.  I went back to the bus compound at 1PM.  I was to take Davis High School
Girls Tennis Teem to a game in Ogden but it was canceled due to rain.  I
started for the bus compound but got a call asking if I could help with another
run.  I went to Fairfield Jr. High and took children home.  I then went to
White Horse Elementary and then took children home from there.  I got home
after 6PM this evening.  Mae was canning tomatoes so I helped her for a while,
then we ate dinner and Bob and I went Home Teaching.  We were only able to
visit with the Johnston’s this evening.  I did some research on the computer to
find a map of Weber High School for my field trip tomorrow.  I then filled in
this entry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, September 11, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6AM as Gail is bringing their children over for Mae to tend.  Gail is working
as a substitute teacher today.  I prepared an omelet for breakfast.  After
eating I fed the rabbits, figured the materials for a new rabbit pen and then
entered my bus times on the computer.  It makes it nice that I can enter time
on-line.  I started work on plans for Sandi’s gazebo but are having trouble
getting a hexagon design.  I went into the bus compound and drove bus for
Northridge High Jr. Varsity Football team.  They played Weber High at Weber. 
Weber won 19-0 so the team was pretty quiet coming home.  I had to fuel and
sweep the bus when I got back to the compound.  It was 7:30PM when I got home. 
Mae was gone to the R.S. Book Group and got home at 9PM.  I had just finished
watching a show on Hallmark when she came home.  We soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went into
the bus compound at 6AM and drove the bus for a sub-driver that has to take off
this afternoon.  He had me drive route but my GPS helped me the most.  I
stopped after the morning run and bought more supplies for our rabbit <i>farm.</i> 
I hope we soon start seeing a return in our investment as now all we see is
expenses.  This afternoon my run went fairly well but again I really depended
on my GPS.  Soon after I got home David and Shauna brought their children for
us to tend for a little while.  Shauna’s brother and Sister-in-law will tend
the children this evening.  while Mae enjoyed the children this evening I took
a short nap.  We took them to their aunt and uncles at 7:30PM.  we stopped and
bought some chicken which we brought home and ate some of it while we watched a
movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
just before 6AM in order to get over to the Ogden Regional Family History
Center Conference &amp; Symposium.  It was held at the Weber University Stake
Center.  By the time we got there the chapel was full and most of the overflow
area into the cultural hall.  The keynote address was given by Donald Keyes of
the First Quorum and was very good.  We attended classes all day and by the
time it finished and although it was very good, I was completely exhausted. 
When we got home I felt like I just had to quite and unwind.  We watched a show
on Comcast but when that finished Mae felt that she had wasted enough time.  I
don’t know how it made me feel but I felt hurt.  I filled our water jugs,
filled in this entry and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, September 14, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and was still quite depressed this morning.  I did
talk to Mae, asking what I had done last night that had upset her.  She said
she wasn’t upset with me and didn’t mean to make me feel bad.  I fed the
rabbits and then went over to help set up chairs at the church house.  When I
got there I found that it was already done, so I came home and got Mae for
meetings.  Meetings were very good and had a special spirit there.  Brother
Rogers, Brother Mitchell and Bishop Steadman, our previous Bishopric, were the
speakers in Sacrament meeting and they each did a very good job.  In Priesthood
Quorum meeting I was asked to report on the Ogden Regional Family History
Center Conference &amp; Symposium.  I hadn’t prepared for that but it went well
except I took too much of Brother Thompson’s time for his lesson.  We wanted to
make a quick stop at Brother and Sister Steel’s as they had came out to
meetings but we missed speaking to them.  We ended up being there about and
hour.  Mae made a quick lunch for us when we got home.  I got on the computer
and started my journal entry and also used the internet to get information
about Zion and Fish Lake.  Mae and I both lay down and took a nap.  We then
drove over to Ogden where I filled my pickup with gas and natural gas so that
it was ready to go tomorrow.  When we got home I hooked the boat onto the
pickup so it is ready to go in the morning also.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Randy and I
went up to East Canon Reservoir fishing this morning.  We were there before the
sun came up so took our time getting on the lake.  We were off the lake by 9AM
with our limits.  I got home by noon so it gave me time for doing other
things.  I did get a short nap but was called by the bus compound and asked if
I would take a run tomorrow.  We worked the time out so I could take the run. 
This evening we went up to Kim and Jeanenne’s where we met with Bryce, Deanna,
Georgia and Rick.  Kin and Jeanenne had salmon and snapper cooked and the rest
of us brought the rest of the meal.  It was a good evening being with Mae’s
siblings.  It was late when we got home so I went right to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
made a morning bus run getting home after 8:30AM.  I have a very good assistant
on this route.  As soon as I got home Mae and I went over to an appointment
with Nancy and Fran.  That went well and my readings are looking very good.  I
will still remain on the diet but can add a little popcorn back into my food. 
That was great news.  We had invited Scott and Jeff over for lunch.  Jeff
couldn’t make it but Scott came over.  We sure enjoyed having him here.  I took
a nap and then made the afternoon run.  It was after 5PM when I got home from
that run.  After eating some dinner I went out and raked the hay into
windrows.  Mae has been packing all afternoon.  I filled capsules this
evening.  Gail called and asked if we had heard from Jeff?  Mae had talked to
him for a few minutes about 1PM.  He said that he was having problems at work
and couldn’t make it today.  We talked to Gail two or three times more this
evening.  Jeff had came to Gail’s mothers about 2PM as Gail was there putting
up salsa.  He had a migraine and wasn’t feeling well.  Gail asked him if he
needed to lie down in a dark room but he said that he had tried that and it
didn’t help.  He then left to return to work, but never returned to work.  At
8PM Gail called to see if Jeff had came to our place.  It’s now 10:25 PM and no
one knows where he might be.  Gail had her brother-in-law call the police and
report that Jeff is missing.  We are all just praying for him and hope that he
is found ok.  David actually got in his car and went looking for Jeff.  Of
course he didn’t know just where to look.  Mae gave me a hair cut before we go
to be.  Neither Mae nor I were unable to go to sleep when we went to bed.  I
finally got up and came into the front room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                At 3:30 AM we
got a call from Scott that Jeff was home.  At 4:30 AM Jeff sent us a text
message telling us that he was sorry to have caused so much worry but he was
now home.  I think we got some sleep after that.  There has been a lot of time
on our knees through the night.  We are still not sure just what course we are
going to take with our plans for our trip.  I took care of some things and Bob
wanted me to install a hand rail in the bathroom so I did that.  Mae has been
on the phone most of the day.  We have been on the phone with all of our children
through out the day.  David and I talked and decided that we need to meet with
Jeff, so Scott, David and I went to Jeff’s this evening.  It went well and we
were able to talk very openly as to the problems.  We concluded that David
would take Jeff into a Doctor in the morning.  Mae and I would go up to David’s
and get Tyler and Emily off to school and then would take Connor home with us
so we could still get things done there.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Things went
as planned and we enjoyed being with Tyler and Emily until they went to
school.  We also enjoyed having Conner with us.  It was afternoon when Jeff
called and it was decided that we would still go to Zion Canon.  The morning
had gone well for David and Jeff and they were able to get medical attention
and the Doctor determined that it would be ok for Jeff to go to Zion’s with
us.  Jeff had to promise that he would not try anything like this again and
would come back into him next week.  It was 5PM before we got ready to leave
and Jeff and Gail we a little later leaving.  We stopped in Salt Lake to get
natural gas and while there I noticed that the left trailer tire was about to
blow.  We changed it while there.  We had to make several stops for gas as the
pressure is low at all the stations because of the high demand for natural
gas.  It was mid-night when we got to Cedar City and Jeff and Gail were now
close behind us.  We visited with them by phone and determined that we would
get a motel in Cedar and sleep there tonight.  We stayed at a Motel 6 as all
other motels seemed to be full.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept much
better at the motel and after getting up we stopped for breakfast.  It was
almost 11AM when we got to Zion.  We set up camp and enjoyed the rest of the
day relaxing.  We went into town and got Gail and Jeff a ice cream cone.  It
was a very relaxing afternoon although it was uncomfortably warm.  After eating
this evening Jeff and I set up the computer and projector so we could watch a
movie.  It was a fun day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
5:55am and went to the restroom.  I read my scriptures before I went to wake
the rest.  I found that Mae had been up several times so we decided that we
would wait until later to go hiking.  I went back to bed for a while and then
we got up for breakfast.  After the children had naps we got ready to go
hiking.  We took the shuttle bus to the upper river walk and from there we
walked to the narrows.  It was a good afternoon with us getting home or back to
our camp site about 3:30PM.  I started the fire for Dutch oven.  That turned
out very good.  We started to play a game of rook but after four hands we were
both in the hole.  We went to bed but I couldn’t got to sleep so I went out
side and watched the stars most of the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and after breakfast Mae and Gail went to Sacrament meeting.  I stayed home with
Jeff hopping that we could talk more but Jeff didn’t seem to be in the mood
today.  After Mae and Gail got back we prepared lunch and then Jeff and Gail
packed up and left.   This afternoon Mae and I took the shuttle to Zion’s lodge
and took the trail up to the three emerald pools.  It was a very pleasant walk
getting a little hard for Mae before we reached the top pool but very rewarding. 
Mae questioned if we were right in taking that hike on the Sabbath.  I don’t
know!  This evening we were going to relax and watch a DVD before going to
bed.  We started but got several calls that took the feelings out of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and I would have spent the day in bed but first I got a call from the school
bus needing help.  Then Mae felt that we were wasting time so should get up. 
Sandy called and suggested that we not go to Fish Lake.  After thinking and
praying about it I think we should pack up and go home.  Mae now feels opposite
to that, so at this point I am not sure what to do.  Mae again changed her mind
and we packed up and headed for home.  We again had trouble finding stations
that had enough natural gas pressure to give us very much gas.  We stopped in
American Fork and gave Mattie a Birthday present and visited for a few
minutes.  It was mid-night when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 6
AM and found that Mae was sleeping in the front room in the recliner.  I
finally got up at 8AM and Mae soon got up also.  Mae woke up with a sore throat
this morning.  There is a lot of frustrations with this situation and every one
seems to have their opinions, I am just confused.  We took our trailer over to
Jeff and Gail’s and will stay over there for a while.  We did get the trailer
set up in the West side of the driveway.  Mae took care of Benji and Rachael
while Gail took Jeff into the Doctor.  Jeff seems quite depressed this
afternoon.  After getting things set up I worked on my computer to get some
instructions on how to use a projector in connection with our laptop.  Scott
has need for these instructions so I will type them up and add them to my own
file for future use.  Mae prepared dinner for all of this evening and we ate in
the house.  After dinner Mae and I went back home to unload some things that we
will not need at Jeff and Gail’s and to get some other things that we do need. 
When we returned to their home I finished the instructions and made this
journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were woke
early this morning with the wind blowing hard, then we heard construction crews
start with heavy equipment about 5AM.  There was a continuation of noises of
equipment, cement trucks delivering loads of cement and garbage trucks
collecting garbage.  Gail left at 5:30AM to go to the gym to exercise but we
weren’t sure that it wasn’t Jeff going someplace so Mae went into the house and
found that Jeff was still in bed asleep.  Jeff did go into work with Gail
taking him to work and then she had other things that she took care of.  Gail
also went into the same Doctor that Jeff is going to and then she attended the
Temple.  Mae tended the children and cooked dinner.  I went shopping for some items
and stopped at home to see that Bob had taken care of my rabbits.  This evening
I went over Sportsman Warehouse and bought some things for fishing tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
went to the Chevron station on 21<sup>st</sup> street where I filled up with
gas and natural gas.  I picked up my boat and met Nick at the K-Mart parking
lot at the head of Daniels Canon.  I got there at 6:30AM but Nick didn’t get
there until 6:45AM.  we had a good day fishing and didn’t quite until almost
7PM.  We had caught 24 fish with most of the being 18 to 21” long and we had to
release those.  We did catch three that we were able to keep.  We stopped at
Sub-Way in Heber City and I got a chicken salad to eat.  On the way home Nick
found out that the fellow that he was going to go fishing tomorrow with,
couldn’t go tomorrow so we talked it over and decided that we would go fishing
again tomorrow.  I called Mae and she was ok with that decision so Nick called
Sandi and she was also ok with it. We also stopped at the service station on
Redwood Road and North Temple and got fuel for the pickup.  It was almost
mid-night when I got to bed.  I stayed at our home.  Mae had tended the
children most of the day while Gail and Jeff went to work.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I again got
up early and went over to Jeff and Gail’s.  Mae had made me a lunch for today. 
I went back to the same service station that I had gone to last night as they
had good natural gas pressure.  Nick and I again met at the mouth of Daniels
Canon and again Nick was late getting there.  We had another good day of
fishing but again had to let most of the fish go.  I really don’t like fishing
that way since I found out that 75 to 90 percent of the fish die even when you
try to be careful when you release them.  Today we caught 26 fish and were able
to keep 4 fish.  We guest that in the two days we caught somewhere around 100
lb of fish.  We got home earlier and tonight Mae was home.  She doesn’t feel
very well, so we soon went to bed.  She had again tended the children while
Jeff and Gail both worked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae woke
about 6:30AM but I didn’t wake until almost 9:30AM.  Bob had breakfast ready
for us when we got up.  I had taken him up fish for breakfast.  We put things
away today, that we have been using for the past couple of weeks.  Mae doesn’t
feel very well but still keeps going.  I cleaned the boat up and washed it
down.  I had to buy a new sprayer as the one we have had quite working.  It was
under warranty for one year so I guess that is the best we can expect.  I also
washed our distiller and changed the filter on it.  We went to bed and watched
the movie “My side of the mountain”.  It was ok but not the show we thought it
was going to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
got ready while Mae prepared some breakfast.  I went over to the church and
found that the chairs have already been setup.  We attended Priesthood, Relief
Society and Sunday school but then came home and took a nap.  At 1:30PM we went
out to the Stansberry Ward where we attended Sacrament meeting there.  We
enjoyed the meeting but especially enjoyed Chelci singing “How Great Thou
Art”.  It was a beautiful arrangement and Chelci did an excellent vocal solo. 
After the meeting Chelci and Steve invited Sandi, Nick, Mae and I to their home
and they served us a very enjoyable dinner.  We left there about 6:30PM and had
to stop for gas before coming home.  I took the garbage out after getting
home.  I worked on my journal and history while Mae got on the internet.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
the recliner most of the night due to waking with worry over our sons.  When I
finally did go to sleep I slept until almost 9AM.  I got a call to make a bus
run at 2PM but when I was about to start the bus another sub driver said he had
been called to make that run.  It was a double call out so I got paid 2 hours
for the call out.  The only problem is that I forgot and left my GPS on the
bus.  I went in and had dispatch call the bus driver and ask him to bring it in
when he returned.  At that time another bus driver needed an assistant so they
asked me to make that run with him.  I got the call out pay because it was more
that the assistance pay.  Oh well that is what you call experience.  Mae
prepared a nice dinner this evening.  I spent time on the computer trying to
find the map for a afternoon run I have Tuesday and Wednesday and after finding
the rout I called the bus driver and found that the route sheets are wrong and
the assistant knows the route.  After eating dinner we were going to read the
next Priesthood / Relief Society lesson but Mark informed me that one of the
rabbits was out.  I used the fishing net to capture the white doe.  Mark got
talking to me about the future, so that took some time.  We read the lesson and
then Mae and I played a game of Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Mae and Carroll
won after a long game.  It is late but we shouldn’t have to get up to early
tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up.  After eating and taking care of the rabbits I had Mark go with me
and we went over to Jeff’s and brought the tent trailer back.  I then had to
hurry to drive a bus route.  The route serviced three schools so it was a long
trip.  We had trouble with the wheelchair lift working although the bus is one
of the newest buses that the District has.  We also had some problems with some
of the students.  These are special Ed children an they have various problems. 
It was almost 5:30PM when I got home.  I unloaded the pickup, then Bob and I
went over to Casey’s to make a quick H.T. visit there.  I was very tired and
hungry when I got home but Mae showed me a water problem in the front bedroom
so I had to repair that and vacuum up the water out of the carpet.  We watched
a show on TV before going to bed.</span></p>
