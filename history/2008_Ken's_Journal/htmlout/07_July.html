<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8AM and so was slow getting going.  When I fed the rabbits I found that
the black doe had killed her kit.  I guess I was wrong in letting the children
pet it for when the kit tried to suckle she bit it.  I know better than letting
anyone touch their kits but I had handled it so I thought it would be ok.  I
was wrong!  I cut down some of the weeds in the back yard.  I took care of a
few other small jobs and then after lunch Bob and I went into Sportsman’s Warehouse
and I purchased an electric downrigger.  When we got home I was going to
quickly install it but the repairman came on the Comcast problem and repaired
that.  It also took longer to install the downrigger that I had anticipated, so
we didn’t have time this evening to try it out.  After dinner Mae &amp; I went
out and put the boat away.  Mike, next door came over and we talked for over an
hour.  I filled out my journal and it was time to go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When we got
started this morning Mae and I moved the bed in the small bedroom and stored
cases of wheat and rice under it.  I had to add 1 ½” blocks under the legs of
the bed in order for the boxes to fit under it.  Mae was going to take Sister
Reed and her daughter to Salt Lake.  That will take her the rest of the day.  Bob
and I decided to take the boat up to East Cannon and try out the downrigger.  Scott
came over for lunch.  After he left I got the boat ready to go.   The wires on
the back of the electrical connection broke loose and shorted out, blowing the
fuse.  It took over an hour to repair it.  Mae found out that the trip to Salt
Lake was canceled, so I asked her if she would to go with Bob and me.  She said
that she had too much to do to go but a few minutes later she came out and said
she would go.  We went up to the reservoir and had a good time catching three
limits before we came home.  The downrigger worked fine but it will take a
little practice to get use to it.  It was late when we got home and then Mae
insisted that we clean up the boat before Sandy, Nick and Nick’s mother goes
with me tomorrow.  I had to bring up a light in order to see as we cleaned the
boat.  Mae is quite a gal and I am so lucky to have her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:15AM and got ready to go fishing.  Sandi, Nick and Nick’s mother met me at
the Park-N-Ride lot at the mouth of Weber Cannon shortly after 6AM.  It was
about 7:30AM when we got on the lake.  We had a good day of fishing and by 1PM
we had four limits.  I think that Sandi caught the most but we all shared in
the fun.  I had everyone come to our place and we cleaned the fish.  I got Bob
to mix up some biscuits and he baked fish while we baked the biscuits and
potatoes.  It made a good dinner and we all enjoyed it.  S set down and Mae
rubbed my and I fell asleep.  When I woke up we watched a make over of The Red
River on the Hall Mark channel.  I caught my journal up to date during the
intermissions.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early in order to go to Jeff and Gail’s.  They invited us for breakfast along
with several other friends they have near them.  We took our two picnic tables
over and some grills.  The power in their garage wouldn’t handle the grills and
kept tripping the circuit breakers.  Noland brought some long extension cords
and we plugged into some circuits in the house.  It was a simple breakfast and
we enjoyed meeting more of their friends.  We left there and went up to Morgan
to watch Tyler play baseball.  Tyler is a pretty good player and their team won
1<sup>st</sup> place again this year.  We came back home and took a nap.  I
slept pretty well but Mae only slept for about 1 hour.  We did some work around
the yard and then we went to Layton to the bowery and watched a concert.  Scott,
Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley also came to the concert.  Following the concert was
a fireworks display.  It was a very enjoyable evening.   It was almost
mid-night when we got home.  I filled in this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
the recliner as I had eaten too much junk food yesterday.  We got up and were
ready when Bob called us for breakfast at 8:45AM.  He made biscuits and gravy
for us.  I then did 2 or 3 honey dos for Mae and then went out and butchered
the buck and the brown and white doe.  Mae and I then drove to Sandy, Ut where
I purchased a New Zealand buck and two does from Diane Taylor.  This afternoon
I remodeled the duplex rabbit pen by cutting out the flooring and installing
wire mesh. I then put the new buck in where I had the buck that I butchered and
the new does in the one that I had the brown and white doe.  I will have to
build some more pens before these new rabbits are ready for breeding.  Mae went
shopping for groceries plus she gave Bob and I haircuts this afternoon.  This
evening we went to Jeff and Gail’s to play games and to watch a movie.  I had
mixed feelings as I know that we will be very late getting home.  Tomorrow will
be Fast Sunday and this mean that we will not be able to start our Fast this
evening.  It was also later starting than had been planed so there wasn’t time
for games.  The show that Jeff played was also a PG-13 and I really didn’t
enjoy the show.  He had originally said that we were watching a cartoon movie
but then for some reason Jeff changed his mind and put this one on.  Mae got up
and went into the house and talked to Gail.  With us bringing our projector I
couldn’t see any way to leave.  I told Mae that I would like to avoid this
situation in the future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was hard
to get up this morning but I did make it in time to help set up chairs and had
time to feed my rabbits before going to meetings.  I got sleepy during Sunday school
but was able to stay awake and enjoy Fast and Testimony meeting.  I was
especially glad to see Patriarch and Sister Johnston feeling well enough to
attend.  When we got home Bob had a nice dinner ready for us.  After dinner I
took a nap and then worked on my journal.  At 6PM we went upstairs and played a
game of Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Mae and Carroll started off great and
were far ahead in the first two hands.  Bob and I then came back but at the
last hand Mae and Carroll still beat Bob and I by about 150 points.  When we
came back downstairs we worked on computers.  Mae helped me edit another of my
stories and we e-mailed it to our family.  I finished this entry and we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
started with Mom’s list of things needed to do today.  I spent most of the
morning working on those items and then this afternoon I repaired our water
storage tanks.  We expected Shellie and the boys about 7PM but it was almost
10PM when they got here.  We visited until almost mid-night before we went to
bed.  I was surprising to me to see how much Quint has grown since we were at
their place the first of the year.  It is good to have them here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, July 08, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Due to the
fact that we didn’t get to bed until after 2AM, no one was ready to get up very
early.  I was the first up, at 7:30AM and went out side and fed the rabbits. 
It was after 11AM before Shellie, Garrett, Mae and I left for the Salt Lake
Temple.  When we got to Salt Lake we found that the Temple is closed for
renovation.  We went over to the Distribution Center and bought Garrett some
garments.  We also bought a picture of the First Presidency with a nice frame. 
We then went to the Bountiful Temple and went through a session there.  Mae and
I were asked to be session witness.  We went to Chuck-A-Rama and had dinner. 
We then went to the Jordan River Temple.  We met Chelci and Steve at the Temple
and went through a session there.  The session was held especially for the deaf
and that made it especially interesting to see what it took in order for those
that are deaf to participate in the program.  After the session we took some
pictures before coming home.  We were all tired and soon started for bed, but
it was still after mid-night when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had to get
everyone up in time for breakfast as Bob made biscuits and gravy for us. 
Shellie and the boys went to Layton Park where they met with some of their
friends that have moved up from Arizona.  They spent most of the day with
them.  Bryce from Alpine Restoration came by but Bob had gone.  He will come
back about 1PM.  When Bob came home I told him that we needed the papers and
the check from the insurance co. to decide what the cost will be for repairing
the floor.  He could not find where he had put them.  I don’t believe I have
ever seen Bob so upset or depressed as he was over misplacing those papers. 
Carroll was going to Salt Lake and when she went to the car she looked for the
papers.  She found them in the car and Bob was so relieved.  Mark and I went to
the Church farm and used the canner there and canned some whey.  I got back at 1PM
but Bryce called and said that he would be later.  I took a nap this
afternoon.  When Bryce came we got prices figured out and gave Alpine the go
for repairing the kitchen floor.  Shellie and the boys got home about 6:30PM. 
Mae had dinner ready but I had to go with Bob Home Teaching at 7PM.  We didn’t
find the Casey’s home this evening.  We were about an hour with our visit to
the Johnston’s.  We were able to also visit with the Fallis’s this evening.  I
had worked on the computer today and with Comcast’s help was able to get the
internet working on my lap-top.  I couldn’t get the desk top computer to
connect to the wireless connection but was able to get the lap-top to connect
to the enter-net and get the e-mail to work.  Garrett tried to find the problem
but Bob and Carroll had gone to bed and we didn’t want to disturb them by going
up to work on the units up there.  We decided to continue in the morning.  It
was mid-night when I went to bed but Mae and Shellie stayed up until 3AM
talking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6AM and studied for a while and then went back to bed at 7AM.  I slept
until 10AM before I got up.  Mae had got up at 7AM so she didn’t get much
sleep.  Shellie got up and went to Georgia’s by 10AM.  After breakfast and
feeding the rabbits, Garrett and I worked on the computers.  We were able to
get the internet working on both of our computers and then we worked on Mark’s
computer and got it working on the wire less internet also.  Mae and the boys
played a game of Fishn-opoly a game that Shellie’s family gave me for Fathers
Day.  It is about like Monopoly.  We went to the Air-Force Museum but we got
there just as it was being closed for the day.  We went to Sportsman Warehouse
and bought fishing licenses for the boys and I will take them fishing in the
morning.  We then went over to Scott’s and visited with them.  The boys got to
play on their flight assimilator and other computer games.  We enjoyed visiting
with Scott and Mishelle.  While there Garrett and I helped Scott move a freezer
into the basement.  When we got home Mark called me out to the rabbit pens and
showed me the one doe that we had bought the other day and it had died.  He
felt bad and was worried that maybe it was caused by the weed spray that he
applied yesterday but I don’t think so.  I noticed that the rabbit wasn’t
acting very well this morning when I fed them.  I took the boat and truck over
to Clearfield and fueled them so they are ready to go tomorrow.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
3:45AM and read my scriptures.  I let Mae sleep in and I got breakfast ready
for the boys before I woke them.  We left about 6:30AM and went to East Canon
Reservoir.  We caught fish shortly after starting to fish.  Garrett and Kevis
caught the first couple of fish.  Quint seem to catch them but he would loss
them before getting them to the boat.  I finally had Garrett trade Quint poles
but it didn’t help because Garrett then caught the fish on the new pole.  I
helped Jase catch a couple of fish and then while I was helping net someone else’s
fish Jase caught one himself and reeled it in.  Quint finally caught three fish
so we all had a good time.  We loaded up the boat and came back to the Air
Force Museum and spent a couple of hours seeing the planes there.  When we got
home I cleaned the fish and put eight of them in the freezer and took the other
eight of them up stairs for Bob to cook for breakfast in the morning.  We got
something to eat and then watched two western shows on Hall Mark channel.  We
read a chapter of the Book of Mormon during the commercials.  I filled out this
journal entry before going to bed.  I also played a game on the computer before
turning it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
did some studding and then got going to get breakfast and clean up for when the
family came.  Mae and Shellie didn’t get home until after 11AM.  We had some of
Bob and Carroll’s family, all of Irven and Sandi’s family and most of our
family that came for a family reunion and lunch.  Cheryl and Bob and three of
their grand children also came.  We set up some canvases for a shady area to
eat under.  Everyone brought pot luck and Bob, Carroll, Irven, Sandy, Mae and I
furnished fried chicken.  It was a wonderful afternoon of visiting and getting
reacquainted.  Our family stayed after everyone else left and we enjoyed the
rest of the afternoon and evening.  We grilled hamburgers and hot dogs this
evening and along with the other leftovers had plenty to eat.  We set up a
sheet for a screen and watched a movie.  Although Mike, Becky, Mattie and
Jessie went home, David and Taylor stayed and watched the show and stayed the
night.  We had the floors covered with children but all slept well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM so I could be ready for Stake General Priesthood meeting this morning at
7AM.  when we first got to the chapel, there wasn’t many there but then it
filled up pretty good.  When I got home Shellie and the boys were still getting
ready for church.  After meetings today we just had leftovers for lunch and even
a lighter dinner this evening.  I took a nap as well as Mae and Shellie.  This
evening after eating dinner we went over to visit Jeff and Gail.  We played
yard games and visited for a while.  It was late when we got home and then I
filled in two days of journal entries.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up.  Shellie isn’t feeling the best today so I took Garrett, Quint and
Kevis to East Canon Reservoir boating.  We rented a ski board and I pulled
Garrett for quite a while.  Quint and Kevis didn’t want to go out so I tried
it.  I did get up but only for a few feet each time.  Kevis decided to go out
and he did very good and skied for quite a while although he wouldn’t try doing
much except to stay in the boat wake.  I went out a second time and as I
started up I got a cramp in my left leg and had to quit.  Garrett went out
again and he is really good.  He tries lots of fancy things so of course falls
often but he is good.  We then took the board back and got out the Great Big
Mabel.  We had a lot of fun on that and stayed on the lake until late.  We got
home after 7PM.  Mae had dinner ready when we got there.  We watched a movie on
the Comcast movies that was cute with some good morals taught.  It was
mid-night when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Shellie was
up early but the rest didn’t get going until after she had breakfast ready.  I
am quit sore and have several areas that are hurting.  I don’t know if it was
trying to ski yesterday or not or if I have eaten something that is causing
it.  Mae, Shellie and the boy’s went to Lagoon but I stayed home and rested.  I
did put some items away out in the shed.  I took my boots over to have them
repaired and got there at 5:45PM but the store was locked up even though the
hours showed that it was open until 6PM.  I filled the pickup and boat up with
gas and it took $100.00 to fill them both.  I put the boat away and the float
tub.  I watched a movie taken from a true incident with changes for protection
and it really showed some of the evils of our government to protect some of our
big business that are in foreign country’s.  Mae, Shellie and the boy’s didn’t
get home from Lagoon until after 11PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  It was about 11:10AM when Shellie, Garrett, Mae and I left for
the Salt Lake Temple.  We got there just 5 minutes late for the noon session so
had to wait until the 1PM session.  Mae and I were asked to be the company
witnesses on this session.  We really enjoyed the session and after we stopped at
the Chuck-A-Rama and had dinner again.  We got home and I took a ½ hour nap and
then Shellie, Mae and I went back to the Salt Lake Airport to get Roy.  We got
there just about the same time that he did.  We came back home and watched a
movie on Comcast that was pretty good.  It was after 11PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

early to prepare breakfast for Shellie and her family before they and Mae go to
the water park in Provo.  I have a problem and said something that upset Mae.  Mae
and all the rest left about 9:30AM.  I went upstairs and started removing the
damaged flooring and underlayment in the wash room.  Before we quit for the day
we picked up materials at Lowe’s.  I warmed up some supper and ate while
watching Texas Ranger.  A western movie then played which I watched.  I then
changed the channel to AMC and watched Jaw’s 2.  </span></p>

Shellie and her family up to the gate to Timpanogus Cave where they met Sandi
and Scott’s family.  Mae then came home while the rest of them hiked to the

washroom.  This evening Mae and I watched a DVD that Shellie had rented.  It
was ok I guess.  </span></p>

and felt like sleeping in but we got up and drove out to the Erda Airport where
we watched Scott, David, Jeff, Shellie, Roy and Garrett go up in an airplane
and sky dive out.  All of them were thrilled with the experience and all landed
safely.  We then went to Sandi and Nick’s where we grilled dinner and then
played games.  We had almost all of our family out there and it was good to be
together.  Mae and I came home this evening.  This morning before we left for
Erda, I realized that my cell phone was missing.  I couldn’t find it before we
left but this evening as I thought about it I decided that I would check an
area where I had done some building yesterday.  I was able to find it where it
had fallen out of my pocket.  We were about to call it a day when Robin Walker
and Kyson came by.  Kyson asked if I would give him a blessing as he is going
into the Army Reserve along with some other stresses of life and felt like he
needed a Priesthood Blessing.  I asked Mark to assist me and we gave him a
blessing through the Priesthood that we hold.  Mae is typing some thoughts for
a R.S. lesson in the morning before she will be ready to go to bed.  Mae gave
me a hair cut and I took a shower before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke before
3AM and got up for just a few minutes.  Although I went back to bed I couldn’t
get to sleep.  I remembered that the water was running on the back trees so I
got dressed enough that I went out back and shut it off.  If it is on when the
sprinklers come on the lawn there is too much pressure lost and the sprinklers
do a pour job of watering the lawn.  I went back to bed and heard the clock
chime for four AM but went to sleep after that.  The alarm woke me at 6AM but
we didn’t get up until 6:30AM.  My feet and legs are hurting this morning so I
am moving quite slow.  I did go to the chapel and help set up chairs.  When I
got home I fed the rabbits and then went in to eat but there wasn’t enough time
so I just had a piece of toast and a glass of whey.  Meetings were very good
but my legs and feet got worse as time went on.  We ate lunch with just the two
of us and it really seemed good for the quietness and peace.   This evening Bob
and I went over to Brother and Sister Fallis’s as Brother Fallis is going to go
into the hospital tomorrow for an operation.  We gave Harrell a blessing.  
While we were out we also stopped by the Casey’s to visit them.  They were home
this time.  I got on the inter-net and looked up Dyflugan.  In doing so we
found a web site that we could find out how to control this yeast problem that
I have.  We spent some time looking for it and getting it off the computer. 
When we did get it, I was disappointed as there was very little new that we
didn’t already know.  We went to bed and watched a show on DVD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
but Mae got up at shortly after 8AM.  I am quite depressed about my legs and
feet.  I really don’t want to go back on the strict diet and the added
nurturance that it will take to replace what I can’t get out of the diet.  I
didn’t get very much done except feed my rabbits.  This afternoon I went over
to Irven and Sandy’s and looked at their problem.  It looks like it is coming
from their master bedroom bath.  The shower is deteriorating and starting to
leak.  I suggested that they call their insurance company and see if they will
cover most of the repairs.  The restoration repairman came today and replaced Bob
and Carroll’s flooring today.  This evening I watched some TV.  Mae balanced
our Bank Statement this evening and took a shower before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
late this morning.  Bob came down and woke us at 10AM.  Mark spent a couple of
hours trying to help me determine what medications and food will be good for
me.  I just don’t know how reliable his abilities are.  He said that the Cox
Raw Honey that we have is ok for me to use.  Also the one brand of wheat bread
is ok for me.  This afternoon and evening, with the help of Bob and Mark, we
cut the first cutting of my hay.  It is just coming into blossom and I am
afraid that it will be in full bloom before we get back form Sandi’s.  Sandi
was operated on this afternoon and they fused 4 disks in her neck.  I hope that
it was the right thing to do.  Brother Thompson came Home Teaching this
evening.  I asked him to give me a blessing.  Bob and Mark assisted with it. 
We also gave Carroll a blessing.  I am having a lot of pain that I am sure that
it is the same thing that I have been fighting for over 20 years.  Carroll’s
problem is with the swelling in her legs.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5:30AM in order to get away to Salt Lake to pickup Sandi from the hospital.  I
fed the rabbits and packed the car.  Mae prepared some scrambled eggs and put
on toast so that we could eat them on the way.  We got there at 8:30AM and as
we came into Sandi’s room the Physicians Assistant was just starting to talk to
Sandi.  Sandi told us that it was 8:00 last night that they were able to get
her into the room.  Nick called a little later and said the same thing and he
was quite upset about that.  The PA told us that she could leave when she
wanted to but that she had no need to hurry because hospital staff had been so
late getting her into a room.  The Doctor soon came in to visit with Sandi and
told her about the same things as the PA.  When he went to leave the nurse had
just came in the room and when the Dr. told Sandi that she could leave when
ever she felt up to it the nurse spoke up and said that she was there to help
her.  After the Dr. left the room I told the nurse that Sandi wanted to rest a
little longer before leaving.  The nurse then left the room.  Mae and Sandi
then took a nap while I watched the traffic out side.  It was interesting to
see the commuter train and the buses come and go.  Less than an hour had passed
when another nurse came in and spoke to Sandi which woke her up and told her
she would help her get ready to leave if she was ready.  There was no question
that the staff wanted Sandi to leave.  Mae helped Sandi get dressed and we
left.  We stopped at Chelci’s so that Chelci could come out and give her mother
a kiss.  We then stopped at the Maverick station in Tooele and bought the three
of us some yogurt.  That really tasted good to Sandi.  We took her home and
took care of the rest of the day.  JaNae and her children stopped over for a
while.  Chelci came over and then went to the store to get some things for
Sandi.  Mae prepared dinner for this evening when Nick got home from work.  I
helped her by filleting trout and cooking them.  This evening we watched a
movie that Chelci got for us.  It was the “Four White Feathers”.  Part way
through the show we stopped it so that Nick and I could go outside and spray
some hornet nests.  Sandi also asked if I would give her a Priesthood Blessing,
which I did, then Sandi and Nick went to bed.  Mae and I stayed up and watched
the end of the show.  It was a good movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Nick got up
and left for work about 3AM.  I woke later and just quietly checked and Sandi
was asleep.  The medication that I am taking, for a cleans is working, but I
was able to soon go back to sleep.  Mae got up about 7:30AM., but I went back
to sleep and sleep quite late.  When I got up Mae had fixed oat meal cereal for
breakfast.  I used the honey that Mark had said was ok for me to use but soon I
had quite a lot of pain through out my body.  I think I will lay off all sweets
for a while.  We watched the Salt Lake 24<sup>th</sup> of July Pioneer Parade
on TV.  Sandi and I went back to bed for a while, after the parade was over. 
When I got up I shaved and took a bath in the whirl pool tub and that helped me
feel some better.  I feel quite discouraged with this problem that I am having
as I am not sure just who to get help and advice from.  Mae had dinner ready
when Nick got home from work at 6PM.  The four of us played two games of
Marbles and Sandi and Mae won both of them.  Nick and I took a break and went
outside and sprayed four hornet nets.  I love to see those things die.  After we
came back in and finished the game.  We then started another game of Run’s and
Bunch’s, but Sandi got tired and went to bed.  Nick, Mae and I finished the
game and Nick won.  We then went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7:30AM and Mae had been up for a while before that.  For breakfast Mae made egg
omelets in a sack.  Those worked out well.  It was an easy day just trying to
help care for Sandi but she is quite independent.  We saw pitchers of the
surgery and we just hope it works out for Sandi’s best good.  I did a couple of
small jobs for Nick and Sandy to help them out.  This evening we played marbles
again and again Mae and Sandi won two games in a row.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
again prepared breakfast.   I fillet some trout and fried them while Mae
prepared hash brown potatoes and fried summer squash.  After cleaning up Mae
told me that Sandi would like us to go home as she is feeling quite a lot
better and she can relax more if we aren’t here.  We packed our things and left
for home.  Nick wanted us to stop at Home Depot with him and look at a
generator and a air compressor.  We then left for home but Mae remembered some
things that we had left at Sandi’s so we had to go back.  It was about 5PM when
we got home. We got a call from Roy this evening.  Both he and Linda have Sugar
Diabetes but they are only taking insulin shots and eating what they want. 
When we told him that Bob is really watching his food intake, Roy just said
that we all die one way as another.  My feet are hurting this evening.  After
unpacking we watched “The Wild Bunch” on TV before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My legs and
feet are really hurting this morning.  Mae went upstairs and borrowed some
crutches from Bob to help me walk.  Bob went out and fed my rabbits for me.  I
stayed down all day.  Mae attended meetings this morning.  Bob and Carroll
invited us up for dinner.  Bob prepared fried chicken and fried my piece with
out flowering it.  I watched the Tabernacle Choir and The Spoken Word as well
as other devotional on BYUTV.  Mae called and checked on Sandi and she is doing
fair.  This evening we watched the rebroadcast of the Tabernacle Choir and The
Osmond’s.  That was very enjoyable.  I caught up the last couple of days in my
journal this evening.  Bob and Mark went out and covered my hay with tarps as
they heard that Tooele County is expecting thunder storms this evening.  I am
not sure just what I should do or who I should see about the pain I am
experiencing.  Mae called and talked to Jennie but they are doing some
remodeling so she isn’t seeing anyone for over a month.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and noticed that the pressure pump was not running on the irrigation water.  We
had to turn it on by hand as there is not enough pressure in the line to let it
turn on.  We went back to bed and rubbed each others feet.  Using the crutches
I am able to walk around.  Mae talked to Nancy Litchford and she feels that it
is our apple cider vinegar, honey and cayenne pepper that has caused my pain to
return.  I spent a lot of time working on the computers and the inter-net
getting maps for Flaming Gorge and also reservations for Zion’s Cannon.  We
decided that we can’t afford to go to Washington to go fishing this year.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 3AM
and after laying there for almost an hour I got up.  I took some Tylenol and
turned on a show on Comcast.  Bob fed my rabbits for me this morning.  I did go
out and turn my hay and put the water on the garden.  I took a short nap and
then we went into South Ogden to meet with Nancy Litchford and Fran Morris.  To
me that was a very depressing visit.  For the next three weeks my diet is very
limited.  We stopped at a Health Food Store and Mae went in to buy some of the
things that I can have.  I waited outside in the car until I got to hot.  After
I was in the store for a few minutes, one of the owners (I guess) brought me a
cook book for me to look at.  She said that she had been talking to Mae and
showed her the book.  Mae wanted me to look through it before we bought it.  I
spent the next few minutes going through the recipes and I only found 2 that
didn’t have at least 1, 2 or more ingredients in them that I can not have. 
Then on the way home as Mae read the literature we found out that included in
the <b>don’t list</b> is pop-corn.  We also decided that we should cancel out
trip with Rick and Georgia.  What a discouraging thing this has turned out to
be.  Mae went over to the grocery store and bought some things that I can eat
but she had to look hard to find anything.  This evening we watched a show on
TV before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and was up for a while.  I read another chapter of the Book Of Mormon and then
went back to bed and cuddled Mae up but then she got up, so I slept until
8:30.  Meals are a puzzle for us to figure out with all the things I can’t
eat.  It really keeps Mae thinking, trying to figure meals.  I worked on the
yard pump trying to get the safety switch to work on the low water pressure
that we get.  It works on 12 LB PSI and often we are below that in the morning
hours.  If the switch doesn’t trip then the pump will not turn on so the lawn
isn’t getting enough water.  I am concerned about bypassing the switch for if
there was no water when the pump came on it would burn up the pump.  Mark came
out side just as I finished up and we set and visited for a while.  After lunch
I went out and stacked my hay in the shed.  Bob came out and helped me.  I
turned the water on the garden this afternoon and also put some side dressing
of 16-16-16 fertilizer on most of the rows of vegetables.  This evening I
entered my journal while Mae worked to make menu that we can eat.  I then did
some work on my stories to prepare some more to send to our family.  By the
time I finished it was 1:30PM so we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well and I woke about 3AM.  By 4AM I got up and took some Tylenol. 
I lay in the recliner but still didn’t sleep much.  I heard the clock on each
hour.  I took a shower shortly after 7AM and then Mae and I lay back in bed for
a while.  Mae got up to answer the phone at 8AM but I tried to sleep, getting
up about noon with Bob needing help reinstalling his cabinet.  They are putting
a micro-wave above their range.  Mae and I went over to Dr. Bennett’s and got
treatments.  We then stopped at Home Depot for some electrical parts for Bob
and at the shoe shop to get my boots that they repaired.  We also stopped at
Willie’s care wash to clean the car.  Last stop was at the gas station to fill
the car.  I did some work on my personal history and my journal.  This evening we
watched the show “Hatchi” with John Wayne on DVD before going to sleep.</span></p>
