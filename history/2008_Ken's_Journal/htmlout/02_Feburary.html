<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  Our phone rang shortly after we were up and when Mae answered
the call, it was President Olauson of the Denmark Mission.  He was inquiring to
see if we would be willing to serve in the Denmark mission.  He said that this
was not a call but if we would be willing that he could make such
arrangements.  After breakfast I went out and helped Bob clean of the sidewalks
and driveways.  It had snowed about 3 inches during the night.  Mae started
taking down Christmas decorations.  After I finished with the snow I removed
the front door and cut it off so that the seal would fit better.  I then helped
Mae pack the Christmas decorations and with Bob’s help took them out to the
storage shed.  We tried to use Bob’s pickup but without tire chains we couldn’t
drive in the snow.  This evening Mae and I watched a show on Hallmark that was
cute.  We tried to find another movie to watch but couldn’t find anything that
we wanted to watch.  It was bed time anyway.  The phone call this morning from
President Olauson has been heavy on my mind through out the day.  We are very
concerned about our family, along with the calling I have been given as a
Family History Consultant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, February 02, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke this
morning with the concern of arranging time for the funeral services of
President Gordon Bitner Hinckley.  We turned to BYU channel 21 and followed
their programming of President Hinckley funeral.  Channel 21 carried the
funeral and also tributes to President Hinckley through out the day.  We really
enjoyed the review but I also thought of my own family.  I remember of Mike
telling me that I wanted my children to be better than I am.  That is true and
I think most fathers has that feeling but I guess that is not an option of
President Hinckley’s family.  I cried when President Hinckley’s daughter said
that when she first became a new mother she wondered how she could instill a
testimony in her children’s life.  She then realized from the example of her
Parents that all you have to do was to live that example.  I cried within
myself.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob cooked a
cabbage dish and invited us up for dinner about 2:30 PM.  I called Shellie to
see if I had left my electric razor at their place.  She found it under the
bathroom sink.  I also ask her if they had watched the Funeral of President
Hinckley.  She said that they hadn’t because media in Arizona wouldn’t
broadcast it and it was to much bother to go to the Stake Center to see it on
closed broadcast.  Her reply really discouraged me.  Mae and I went shopping
for some groceries.  The price of groceries has really gone up in price.  After
we got home Scott called me to ask me a question about their furnace.  Before
we hung up I ask him if he watched the funeral and he replied that he had see
parts but he had been busy with Church work most of the day.  I felt quite
depressed.  This evening Mae and I went upstairs and played Canasta with Bob
and Carroll.  Bob and I won tonight but it was a close game.<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, February 03, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I set the
alarm for 6:45 AM and it worked out about right in having time to get ready and
attend church.  I still feel quite discouraged with my family and concerned
about the phone call yesterday morning.  I snowed hard during the early morning
hours.  After Priesthood meeting Brother Higgley visited with me about giving a
lesson on the first Sunday of March on Family History.  We visited for a
while.  When we got home from church Bob invited us up for dinner.  As we were
visiting after eating Brother Higgley came with his four wheeler and plowed our
driveway.  I put on my heavy clothes and went out to help.  Bob came out and I
thought we were about done so I ask Bob to get his keys so we could move his
car.  When I looked again Bob had fallen and was laying on the ground.  A man
that I did not know came to help and Mike from next door came over.  Bob had
hurt his leg and we are not sure just how bad it is.  We had to pick Bob up and
put him in the back seat of the car.  Carroll came out and we took Bob into the
hospital.  The Doctors at the hospital think Bob has torn some ligaments in his
left leg and want him to go to a specialist on Wednesday.  It was just after 2
PM when we got to the hospital and it was 6:30 PM when we brought him back
home.  I had told Bishop Smith that we would make a donation to the Boy Scouts
so I took the check over to his home this evening.  He asked how we were doing
and I told him of our phone call yesterday morning.  We visited for a while and
it was good to talk to him.  Mae and I had a sandwich for super and then went
upstairs and visited with Bob and Carroll.  I called Roy and Linda to see how
they are doing and to let them know that Bob had hurt his leg.  I also called
to let Irven and Sandy know.  I filled out my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, February 04, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I hadn’t
taken my one prescription pill yesterday and we also ate late so I couldn’t lay
down to sleep.  I slept in the recliner but didn’t sleep very well last night. 
I got up about 6 AM and was up until 7 AM.  I did get my scriptures read.  I
laid back down at 7 and slept until 9 AM.  I got up and prepared breakfast of
fish, biscuits and hash browns for Bob, Carroll, Mark Mae and I.  Bob is not
very strong and so have to have help getting out of his chair.  I have told him
he needs to exercise in order us his crouches but he doesn’t really try.  Irven
and Sandy came over and got Mae and they went out campaigning for Ron Paul. 
They didn’t get back until 5 PM.  I worked outside most of the day clearing away
snow, packing a road so we could get the snowmobiles in the back yard when
Sandi brings them this evening.  I also cleaned up some unused items from the
back sheds.  I will take them to the D.I.  Mae cooked enough stir-fry for Bob,
Carroll and Mark as well as for Sandi, Mae and myself.  After we ate I went
outside and tried to get the snowmobile trailer to back into the shed but I got
stuck with Sandi’s truck.  I figured that with four wheel drive it could go
through the snow but it wouldn’t.  I had to disconnect the trailer and pull it
out of the way with my truck and then get Sandi’s truck out.  It was after 10
PM before Sandi left for home.  Sandi returned the snowmobiles because Nick
doesn’t seem to want to use them, Logan rides then but doesn’t help take care
of them or help with the gas he uses.  Other friends and family wants to ride
them but doesn’t offer to help with them or offer to pay for gas, so Sandi just
brought them back to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were woke
by Bob needing help to get up.  That is really a job.  Mae fixed breakfast and
we sent some up for Bob.  Carroll and Mark had already fixed them something. 
We worked on various projects through out the day.  We balanced our
statements.  I made an appointment with Dr. Lee for a physical examination.  I
want to go back to Dr. Lee for my regular physician.  I have been trying to get
Dr. Jensen to renew my prescription but haven’t got it done yet.  I made some
calls and I think I am going to change providers of my c-pack.  I also called
Standard Optical so we can go back in and get our glasses.  Mae needs new ones
and I need to have mine changed.  I visited with David and we are thinking of
setting the snowmobiles up for all the family to share in the use and cost.  I
worked for about an hour getting the snowmobiles put in the shed.  Mae and I
watched a show on Hallmark this evening.  Bob called and I had to go up and
help him into the bathroom.  It was all Mark and I could do to get him back
into the chair in the front room.  I am afraid that he is getting weaker.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, February 06, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3:30 AM and was up for a few minutes.  I was afraid that if I went back to bed
I would wake Mae so I went into the front room and set in the recliner.  I did
go to sleep for a while but woke about 6 AM.  At 6:30 I could hear movement
upstairs so I went up.  Mark had changed the channel on the TV and now we
couldn’t get any reception.  Bob called Comcast but they couldn’t get us
through the problem so he made an appointment for a technician to come out
tomorrow.  I then called Grant and he helped me through the problem so I called
Comcast back and canceled the service call.  With Marks help we got Bob into
the bathroom and then got him in the shower.  It was 8:30 or later when I got
back downstairs.  I helped Mae prepare breakfast for her, Bob and myself.  After
eating I cleaned the walks and driveway from the light snow fall we got early
this morning.  When I came in I set down and went to sleep for almost an hour. 
Jeff came over on his lunch and ate with us.  We sure enjoyed having him with
us.  Mark and I got Bob into the car and I took him and Carroll over to the
Doctor in Ogden.  We were there most of the afternoon.  It was almost 6 PM when
we got home.  Mae had stew waiting for us for dinner when we got home.  It was
sure good.  Mae has been on the computer most of the evening.  we found that we
have a movie that we have not viewed or returned so we haven’t received any new
movies while we were in Arizona.  I think we will watch the movie before we go
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and then I woke up at 4:50 AM and got up to help get
Bob to the hospital.  Grant came over and took Bob and Carroll in to the McKay
Dee Hospital.  Grant, Mark and I gave Bob a blessing before they left for the
hospital.  I went into Dr. Jensen and he gave me a prescription for the
Protonix and he set an appointment for me to go to the hospital for a
Colonoscopy and he will also take care of my hemorrhoids at the same time.  I
then went over to the Deseret industries and took some old beds and a few other
items.  I then had an appointment with Dr. Gary Lee for a physical.  He wants
me to come back for a blood work up after the operation with Dr. Jensen.  I took
the snowmobiles up to David’s and we went snowmobiling.  I think we did more
work pulling the snowmobiles out of the snow that we did riding them.  We went
into the house to warm up and visited for quite a while.  It was 8:30 PM when I
got home.  Mae didn’t get home until almost 9 PM from her book group.  I filled
in my journal and we went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7 AM.  We then prepared breakfast and got ready to go snowmobiling with
Scott and his family.  We took my ice fishing tent and heater with us.  We went
up to Maniway and thought that we could set the tent up on the reservoir so
that we could also do some ice fishing.  When we got there we found that the
snow on the lake was very wet and no one was on the lake fishing.  We found
that the snow was so wet that we also could not drive the snowmobiles on the
lake.  We went up to the South side of town and there enjoyed snowmobiling in a
field.  I set the tent up and with the heater in the tent we were able to keep
warm when we were not on the snowmobiles.  I got Mishelle right on the
snowmobile and showed her how to drive it.  She did very good and really
enjoyed it.  At first Kylan and Ashley only road with an adult but I took Kilan
out with me and let him drive.  Before long, Kylan was driving by himself.  We
had lunches with us and so stayed until after 4 PM.  Scott and I took the
snowmobiles up the mountain and sure had a nice drive.  The trail was quite
rough due to the moguls caused by many snowmobiles but we made it ok.  We found
some good hills to play a round on.  We saw two moose that looked as though
they had been possibly been chased by other snowmobiles, for they were laying
down looking quite tired.  We left them along and went to another area.  After
a little while we went back to the tent where Mae, Mishelle and the children
were.  Mishelle and Kylan road the snowmobiles around while Scott and I got the
tent folded down and packed in the truck.  We loaded every thing up and came
home.  David and Shauna went to a concert in Salt Lake so we tended the
children for them.  We watch a show on TV, Mae also played games with the
children and David and I played a game of checkers.  We put the children down
to sleep and they will stay over night with us.  I filled in this entry before
we went to bed very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
shortly after 4 AM and after being up for a while went back to bed and slept
another couple of hours.  I got up just before David and Shauna came to get
their children.  Mae prepared a nice breakfast for all of us.  After David and
Shauna left I helped Mae do the dishes and make some whey.  We then got ready
and drove up to Morgan to watch Tyler play basketball.  We took the snowmobiles
with us.  After the game we went to David and Shauna’s home but we decided that
the snow was to wet to try snowmobiling.  We ate lunch there and after just
visited.  I talked to David about buying gold and silver.  I think that is what
we should do with some of our currency that we have on hand.  We came home in
time to shower and get ready for the meeting this evening.  it is a World Wide
Training for all adults 18 and over.  It was a very good meeting and there was
a fair attendance but a long ways short for what should have been there.  After
the meeting we went out to eat and then bought a few items from the grocery
store.  We thought that we were going to get to bed before 10PM but David
called me and he and I talked until after mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well and was awake shortly after 4AM.  I am very concerned at
David’s attitude towards the Church.  It seems to me that he is confused
between the teachings of the Church and the actions of some Church members.  I
can sure see how Satan can put a twist on truth.  Mae got up and was concerned
about me not sleeping longer but by then it was time to get up anyway.  We
attended our block and I especially enjoyed the spirit that was present today. 
Mae had leftovers from last night for lunch today.  I went upstairs and told
Mark that I thought that he had done a very good job teaching the Gospel
Doctrine class today.  Mae and I then went up to the MacKay Dee hospital to see
Bob.  He is doing some better but he is also a hard patient to handle.  We came
home and Mae started preparing dinner for Scott’s and Jeff’s and their families. 
Mae cooked fried chicken and mashed potatoes.  We enjoyed dinner and then after
clearing up the dishes Jeff took Scott, Mae and I for a ride in their new car. 
We then played games and visited.  It was almost 9:30PM when they left and we
got the house cleaned up.  We went to bed and turned on the on demand channel. 
We watched an old Gene Audrey movie before going to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up very early this morning.  It was almost 9:30AM.  I cooked fish and hash
browns for breakfast.  I spent most of the day making a list of things we need
to do and making appointments.  I took the car into a shop and got a new
windshield installed.  Just before I took the car in to be repaired, Bob called
and said that Carroll had been with him but because he didn’t like the food
they brought him at the hospital she had left to get him something to eat.  It
had been an hour since she had left and he couldn’t find her.  After getting
the car fixed we called Bob and Carroll still hadn’t returned.  Sherrie called
Mark to tell him that Carroll was in the Emergency Entrance of the hospital
because of a fall.  Mae and I went into Ogden to the hospital.  Carroll hadn’t
been brought out to the emergency room to a room by the time we got there.  We
went down to see Bob and then we had a nurse take Bob in a wheelchair to
Carroll’s room.  Carroll’s face really looked bad.  She had a cut that they had
to take three stitches in to close it up, her right eye, right cheek and jaw
are black and blue.  Her left thumb was cut quite deep and they had it bandaged
to restrain the bleeding.  The hospital staff were very concerned about her and
were trying to give all the comfort and care to her as they could.  We were
there until after 8 PM.  Bob was taken back to his room.  Mae and I drove out
to Denny’s on 12<sup>th</sup> street where Carroll had gone to get the food. 
there we found Carroll’s car and drove it home.  We had also brought Carroll’s
personal items home from the hospital.  They were all full of blood so Mae
washed and cleaned them up.  I called David to let him know why we hadn’t come
up to their place this evening.  I had talked to him earlier and thought that
we might go to his place so we could use his high speed internet.  I also
called Mike to ask him about the laws governing fire arms.  It is after 11PM so
we will go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and spent most of the day calling about appointments.  We went to Layton to
Durk’s plumbing and returned some parts and then to Harvest Bakery and bought
some bread.  We then went to Standard Optical and ordered our eye glasses. 
Next we went to Nut &amp; Bolt store and got some bolts that I can hang a CD
player that Shellie gave to Mae.  we then went to Penny’s in Riverdale and
exchanged the pajamas and coveralls that Mae had given me for Christmas.  From
there we went up to the hospital and visited Carroll.  Sister Thompson was
there visiting with Carroll.  We had to keep an appointment with Prexair
medical equipment and I think that I will get my CPAP equipment form them. 
They let me take a new mask to try.  We had returned home after as Mae had an
appointment with her Visiting Teachers.  Jeff called us asking us tend Benjamin
while he went to the hospital with Gail.  She has gone into labor.  It was
after 11PM when Gail gave birth to a baby girl.  They will name her Rachel
Lynn.  She weight 11 lb and was 19 inches long.  Both Mother and Daughter are
doing well.  We stayed at Jeff and Gail’s last night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Benji woke us
about 7 AM.  Jeff came home about 11AM to eat and shower.  We then went back to
the hospital with Jeff and Benji to see little Rachel and Gail.  Benji seemed
to enjoy Rachel and gave he some hugs.  He was cute.  We took him home and put
him down for a nap but he didn’t sleep long.  When he got up he was very
cross.  A snow storm came about noon and got quite bad.  We finally took Benji
to our place and he really settled down and Mae spent most of her time playing
with him.  I went Home Teaching and visited Isaac Casey and Patriarch and
Sister Johnstun, when I got home Mae was lying on the bed with Benji.  I
thought that she was asleep but I could tell that Benji was still awake so I
just went into the kitchen and got me something to eat.  I worked on my journal
to catch it up.  Mae finally came in and said that she was just laying with
Benji to get him to go to sleep.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did sleep
in and got up with Benji about 7:30AM.  Benji didn’t sleep the best but he is
cute.  He mainly wants Mae to hold him. I prepared breakfast for us this
morning.  Before I got involved in my planned projects, the phone rang and
Carroll said that they were releasing her today.  Mark and I went into the
hospital and brought Carroll back home.  She is still very weak.  Mae prepared
a nice dinner that we took over to Jeff and Gail’s.  We got to their place at
4:45PM and they had just got there before us.  while the dinner was cooking I
shoveled off over half of their driveway.  When I came in Jeff put on a movie
called “Star Dust”.  It was quite interesting but also quite fantastic.  Gail
and little Rachel are doing pretty good.  We left about 8:15PM and went to Bed,
Bath and Beyond to look at comforters.  They are more expensive at Bed Bath and
Beyond than what we looked at, at Penney’s.  We will consider it tonight and
make a decision in the morning.  We had just got home when Mark came down and
said that Carroll had gone into the bathroom and had been there for some time. 
Mae went up and checked on her and she was having trouble being to weak to
stand.  Her legs wouldn’t hold her and she fell.  Mae called me and we were
able to get her into her bed and settled down for the evening.  We gave her a bell
to ring in case she needs any help during the night.  Mark and I anointed and
gave her a Priesthood blessing.  Bob called just after we got back downstairs
and is quite concerned about Carroll.  I filled in my journal and we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Carroll did
not wake us during the night but when Mae went upstairs this morning Carroll
had got up during the night and did ok.  We prepared breakfast and took some up
to Carroll.  Sherrie called me and ask how her Mother was.  I did tell her that
I would suggest that she and her siblings get together and discuss the
situation and find out where important papers and documents are.  I spent some
time looking back on my journals to find when I first got my CPAP.  I got it on
April 10, 2007.  I mounted Mae’s CD player and radio under the upper kitchen
cabinet.  I made up some capsules with Mannatech product and then took a short
nap.  Mae and I went over to her Beauty shop for Mae to get her hair colored. 
I went with her to learn how it was done.  We can buy the coloring and save
quite a bit if I color her hair for her.  When we came home Mae gave me a hair
cut and then we got ready to go out.  My pajamas and coveralls came from J.C.
Penny’s in the mail today.  Mark, Irven and Sandy’s son, called to tell us that
he would be coming over to stay this evening.  we had forgot that he was going
to do that.  Tonight will be ok but Sunday night will be a problem as we are
expecting Mike’s family to come to stay over Sunday night.  Mae and I went out
to eat at the Little Orient and then went to the Sweetheart Dance in
Kaysville.  It is sponsored by the three Kaysville Stakes.  They had the Davis
High School band there and they played some pretty good music.  We enjoyed the
dance but we can’t keep going like we use to do.  It was a little after 11PM
when we got home, very tired.  Mark hasn’t came over yet and it is almost
mid-night.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mark came
just as we were ready to go to bed.  We talked to him for a few minutes, anyway
Mae did because I about went to sleep on the couch.  It was 8AM when I got up. 
Mae had got up a few minutes earlier.  Mark had already got up and was going to
go see Sarah when Mae talked to him for a minute before he left.  Time went
fast and soon we had to go to S.L. so that we could attend the Baptism of
Alivia Brooklyn DeVisor, Cheryl’s granddaughter.  Cheryl had called us and ask
if I would give a talk and if Mae would give a prayer.  I have thought about it
several times but was knot sure which talk she wanted me to give.  I felt
impressed to plan on giving a talk on the Holy Ghost but when we got there I
looked at the program and I was scheduled to speak about Baptism.  In Mae’s
opening prayer she ask that the speakers might be guided and I certainly felt
the guidance of the Holy Ghost as I gave my remarks.  The program and
ordinances went very well.  We found out that Bob, Cheryl’s husband also wants
to be baptized as soon as he can.  It is amazing as to what is happening with
that family.  We also had the privilege of driving Alivia’s primary teacher
from the chapel to her home and visit with her.  She has felt so impressed that
she needed to give Alivia  special attention.  She did not know that Alivia
mother, Sarah, had died until today at the Baptism.   We stopped at Bob and
Cheryl’s home for a few minutes to visit.  While there we met Cheryl’s sister
Janet.  Janet is Dean’s daughter from his second marrage.  It has been a
special experience.  We stopped at Scott and Mishelle’s for a few minutes on the
way home to help them with the installation of a dishwasher.  When we got home
we ate lunch and Mae prepared dinner.  I gave her a little help.  We did stop
on the way home to get some groceries and Mae’s prescription.  We took diner up
stairs and ate there so that Mark and Carroll could eat with us.  Mae had
invited Sarah and Mark to come to dinner.  After eating and cleaning up the
table Mae, Sarah, Mark (Irven and Sandy’s son) and Mark Hulet and I played two
games of “Mormon Bridge”.  It has been a very good day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up in
time to go to the chapel at 8:10AM and help setup chairs.  I was back home with
enough time to read the Priesthood lesson.  We attended the regular block
meeting.  We had some lunch after returning home and then we took Mark and
Carroll into Ogden to visit Bob at the rehabilitation center.  He is doing
quite a bit better.  This afternoon Mike and his family came up to have dinner
with us and to spend the evening.  After dinner we played some games and visited. 
Before they left Mattie was running a fever and not feeling very well.  Mark
again came over to sleep this evening.  Mae and I watched a show on DVD titled
“Evelyn”.  It was taken from a true event that took place in the 1830 in
Ireland.  It was very good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
although I had got up and read from the scriptures and did my exercises. 
Maggie Klass called at 9:15AM to see if I had forgotten to go to her home at
9AM.  I hurried and got ready while Mae made me some breakfast to eat on the
way.  After looking at the stair railing she wanted replaced I suggested that
she call a company that specializes in railing.  I went to Dr. Jensen’s office
and gave them my insurance card for their records.  I also checked about the procedures
they will be doing on Wednesday.  I went to Valley Medical Equipment and talked
to them about our billing for my CPAP with the change we made to Altus
Insurance Co.  I then went to Winegar’s grocery store for some groceries,
medication and water softener salt.  While eating lunch we turned on the TV and
watched the show “Pollyanna”.  I then took a short nap.  Sister Knudsen brought
dinner over this evening.  She had made enough for Mark, Carroll, Mae and I and
it was very good.  Mae and I then went over to Georgia and Rick’s where I
checked out their storage shed.  Rick had built it originally as a tree house
and then turned it into a storage shed.  The tree is deteriorating and the
ground is settling and the building is about to collapse.  We will have to put
a foundation under it and lower the structure down.  Georgia, Rick, Mae and I
then played some games.  Lynsey and her boyfriend Justin joined us for a game
of Mormon Bridge.  We had an enjoyable evening.  It was 10PM when we left for
home.  I filled in my journal and started the cleansing procedure before going
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up at
3:30AM with this medication I am taking in preparation for a Colonoscopy Test
tomorrow.  I did go back to bed about 4:30AM and slept until almost 9AM.  I
worked on our taxes, ordered covers for our snowmobiles and got a letter
written to Roger Tabbilos in the Philippines.  The rest of the day was busy
with the preparation.  It has not been a pleasant experience.  Mae and I
watched The Little House on the Prairie on TV this afternoon.  Mae also went
Visiting Teaching again this afternoon trying to catch a Sister that is
inactive.  The Sister wasn’t home when she went for, but she was able to give
her son a ride to the church house for Young Men’s activity.  This evening we
watched a movie before going to bed.</span></p>

12:30AM but then was able to go back to bed and slept until the alarm went off
at 5:30AM.  We got up and got  ready to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the
hospital at 8:15AM and were soon taken in to fill out paperwork.  We were then
taken to a room where I changed into a hospital goon, had the nurse check my
vital signs and started an IV.  It was 9:30AM when they took me into the
operating room.  I was soon put to sleep and didn’t know anything else until
they wheeled me back into our room.  We got home from the hospital about
11:30AM.  I just rested for a while.  Mae prepared us some lunch and that sure
tasted good after fasting since yesterday.  I did go outside and put the
registration stickers on the snowmobiles.  I ordered covers for the snowmobiles
as the old ones have worn out and ripped apart.  I worked on our tax
information for a while this afternoon.  Mae cooked dinner for Carroll, Mark,
herself and I.  After dinner, Mae got on the computer, so I turned the TV on
and we watched a couple of shows on the Hallmark channel.  Mae would work on
the computer during commercial breaks.  I entered this days journal entry and
we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 3AM
but soon went back to bed.  We slept in until 7AM and then got started.  I
prepared breakfast as Mae was busy with other things.  We got some things
started on our new callings but we had several interruptions.  I printed of
some of my journal entries and got them added to my printed copies.  We had
planned to go to the Family History Center in Clearfield but other things
continually came up and we didn’t get there.  I took a pan, some hot pads and a
thank you card to the Knudsen’s for the dinner they brought over the other
night.  While there we visited for a while.  In the afternoon we drove up to
Morgan to Jeanenne’s where Jeanenne gave Mae some directions and some ointment
that Mae wants to try to remove a mole on her breast.  When we came back we
went over to the safety and emission test center in Kaysville and had them
check our car.  We have a brake cylinder that is leaking so will have to get it
fixed and return again.  This evening I worked on tax papers, added to my
personal history, tried to visit the Falis’s about Home Teaching but they
weren’t home and I watched a show on TV.  Mae went to a Relief Society
Humanitarian meeting.  It was after 10PM when we started for bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke quite
early and couldn’t go back to sleep for a while so when I did Mae let me sleep
in.  I then slept until 9AM before I got up.  Mae had breakfast about ready. 
After eating I went to work on tax papers.  I spent most of the day on them and
about have them ready.  This evening Mae and I went to the Stake Sweetheart
Dance.  It was well attended and the music was pretty good so all ages enjoyed
it.  We danced for over 1 ½ hours when we got tired and went home.  We stopped
at Maverick and get frozen yogurts and filled the car with gas.  We are going
to bed and watch a movie on DVD.  Mae called Quinte and Roy and wished them a
Happy Birthday, while I entered this journal entry.  We watched a show on DVD
that Jeff and Gail let us borrow.  The name of the show is “Eight Below” an it
is an exultant story and very worth watching.  It was after mid-night when we
got to sleep.</span></p>

Rachel for Gail while she goes into the school to do some preparation work for
the substitute teacher that is taking her class while she is off with the
baby.  Jeff went with some friends to clime Mount Ben Lomand to scatter the
cremated remains of a friend that had died.  Mae was over there most of the
day.  I worked on taxes until 2PM and then took Carroll over to Ogden to see
Bob.  When I came home I continued with the taxes until I became completely exhausted. 
Mae prepared dinner and I put the papers up for now and we ate.  I filled the
water jugs up with water and made this entry.   I then wrote in my personal

6:30AM so I could go over to the church house and help set up chairs for
today’s meetings.  I returned back home to get Mae for church.  After the
block, Mae stayed to sing with the choir.  I walked home although it was
raining quite hard.  I was socked when I got home.  Mae came home right after I
got home as the choir practice was canceled due to not having a pianist there
today.  After changing into dry clothes, Mae and I ate some lunch and then
began preparing for dinner.  I laid down in the recliner and took a short nap
and then made up a score sheet for Mormon Bridge.  I also made some corrections
to a letter to our family concerning our snowmobiles.  David’s family came for
dinner at 5PM and after dinner we cleaned up the table and played some games. 
David and his family stayed until after 8PM but then left as it is school in
the morning.  I made some modifications to the snowmobile letter and sent it by
e-mail to our family.  I then filled in my journal for today.  We played a few
games on the computer before we went to bed.  </span></p>

7AM and got ready to go to Dr. Lee’s to have a blood work up.  On the way home
I stopped at Allco Auto Parts and got a new brake cylinder for the left rear
wheel and some new windshield wipers for the car.   I also stopped in
Clearfield at Dick’s and picked up the covers for the snowmobiles.  After
getting home I ate some breakfast and then put the covers on the snowmobiles. 
Mae and I went to the grocery store and to the book store.  I then went to work
on the car and repaired the brakes.  Mike called and is at Weber University and
is going to stop by.  I took the car to Kaysville and got the car re-inspected
and the licensing.  Mike came and took Mae and I out to dinner at the Red
Lobster for a Birthday gift for me.  we had a very enjoyable evening being with
Mike.  He left about 8PM and Carroll called right after he left to see if we
would take her into see Bob.  We did and got home about 10:30PM.  Bob enjoyed
having us come in and especially having us bring Carroll in.  I filled in my
journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

about 7AM and went into the Ogden Temple.  It was 12:30 PM when we returned
home.  Mae and I were asked to be company witnesses on the session that we went
through with.  I met Gary Nelson as I was leaving the dressing room and he was
just going on a session.  We visited for a few minutes.  It was a very
enjoyable morning.  We had some lunch and then I got started on Income Taxes. 
Gary stopped by about 4:20PM and visited until 5PM but he had another
appointment after 5PM.  I continued to work on taxes with some interruptions. 
Mae made dinner for Carroll, Mark and us.  Carroll had a nice Birthday card for
me at dinner time.  I went to the store for some items.  Mark went with me and
we walked over to Fallis’s but they weren’t home.  Mae helped me find an outage
in my tax accounting so they are now ready to go over to Mr. Sorenson.  I
called Scott to get help with my computer that we could stop the screen from
going to sleep.  We made some changes and then I put on a DVD to see if it
would work.  Well! We watched the movie “Facing the Giants”.  The movie was
great and the screen didn’t sleep either.  It was after 11:30 when we went to
bed.</span></p>

little longer.  We were busy getting breakfast and getting things packed to
leave.  It was after 10AM when we left the house.  We stopped at Standard
Optical and got our glasses.  They got us in on a good promotion but by the time
we got the glasses it cost us over $300 a set.  So much for a good deal.  We
picked up some items at the health store and got gas in Ogden on 21<sup>st</sup>
street.  Mae read most of the way and we ate a light lunch while traveling.  It
was about 1PM when we got to Lave.  After getting into our room we took a
couple of mineral bath and watched a couple of shows.  Sandi and Nick got here
at 10:35PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up in
time to set in the hot mineral tub before starting breakfast.  We cooked
breakfast of sausage, hash browns and eggs and had Sandi and Nick eat with us. 
We packed up and went to Soda Springs and then North but after traveling almost
10 miles stopped and asked where Trail Creek Lodge was.  It was back about 9
miles.  We had passed the road.  We found it ok when we returned and then
traveled about 6 miles east to the lodge.  We were excited with the lodge.  The
owners mother, Pat, made us feel so welcome, showed us our rooms and told us
that the snowmobile was ready for us about 2 miles south at a warming hut.  We
found everything ready and were soon on the snowmobiles.  The trail was freshly
groomed and there was plenty of valleys and hills for us to play on.  This was
Nick’s first time at driving a snowmobile so we started out careful.    The
snowmobile that we rented was a two passenger machine and Mae road with me on
it.  I decided to clime one hill so Mae got off and I went up it and came back
down.  Sandi then went up and when she returned I talked Mae into riding with
me.  About ½ ways up the hill, the machine tipped in some soft snow and we
rolled over.  No one was hurt and we just had to work a little to get the
machine turned back right side up.  I had Mae drive as we started back up the
groomed trail.  Sandi took the lead and she went up on the side hill so Nick
followed her.  I guess Mae figured if Nick could do it so could she.  However
she let up on the throttle and the machine rolled over.  Again we had to work
to get it right side up again.  The next hill we climbed Nick got stuck so I
went back and helped him get it out.  Sandi go quite cocky about the fact that
every one had got stuck except her.  Just a few minutes later Sandi and I had
to turn the machines around and Sandi sunk her machine into the deep snow and I
had to pull her out.  We got back at her for her earlier comments.  We had a
great time and traveled until we had come to the Cash County line.  We then
turned around and returned to the warming hut where we ate our lunch.  We
decided to call it a day and loaded up the machines.  We returned to the lodge
and there popped corn and played games.  We ended up watching a show that Sandi
had brought.  It was fair but a few times the Lords name was used in vain.  It
was after min-night when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
getting up in time to have breakfast about 9:30AM.  The lodge prepared us
breakfast of sausage, scrambled eggs, hash brown potatoes and toast.  We also
were served orange juice and jam with our toast.  After eating we packed our
belonging and checked out.  The cost of staying at the lodge, renting the
snowmobile which included breakfast, any winter clothing we needed and the fuel
for the snowmobile was less than what we paid for the one night stay at the
motel in Lava.  We took our snowmobiles to the warming hut and unloaded them. 
Two of us went out on the snowmobiles while two stayed and played games in the
warming hut.  Sandi and I went out first.  I had wanted Mae and Sandi to go out
as I wanted to visit with Nick; however Mae suggested the other arrangement so
that Sandi and I could have fun on the machines.  We did enjoy it and was out
for a while.  When we came back Mae and I went out for a while.  Mae had
trouble when we got off the groomed trail so she stayed on the trail and I went
off into the fresh areas.  Nick and Sandi went out for a while.  Mae and I
played some games while they were gone.  When they came back I got the trailer
ready to load up.  Sandi then cut up the hill so I followed after her.  We
played around for a little while before loading the machines.  We stopped at
the lodge to be sure we had settled up and then started for home.  we stopped
in Soda Springs and filled the machines with fuel and got some frozen yogurts. 
We then drove to Madox’s in Brigham City where Sandi and Nick treated us to
dinner for my Birthday present.  We sure enjoyed eating and visiting with Sandi
and Nick.  We then traveled on towards home.  Mae and I turned off at 21<sup>st</sup>
Street but Sandi and Nick went on.  We filled up with gas and natural gas
although the natural gas wasn’t working very good so we only got about ½ a tank
of natural gas.  It was 9PM when we got home and much later when we got to bed.</span></p>
