<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  I prepared breakfast.  We finished bringing things in from the
truck and putting them away.  Sandi called to tell us about Chelci.  She has
running a high fever Friday evening and at mid-night Steve took her to the
hospital.  Steve’s Mother came over to tend Nathan and at 5AM Sandi went over
and took over tending Nathan.  After Sandi called us Mae called all the family
to let them know and asked them to remember Chelci and Nathan in our Fast and prayers. 
David talked to me and asked what I wanted for a Birthday Gift.  I said I was
happy with going out to eat with them.  He said they had the final basketball
of the team that Tyler plays on and David coaches this afternoon.  We decided
to go to the game so quickly left.  We got there just as the 2<sup>nd</sup>
quarter was ready to start.  It was a very good game and although the other
team was often ahead at the end they were tied and had to play an overtime.  In
the overtime Tyler’s team won the game.  It was a very fun game to watch.  We
then went to David and Shauna’s and then but to eat for my Birthday.  It was a
good time being with David’s family.  When we got home Sherrie had taken her
mother into Ogden and they brought Bob home.  He wasn’t going to stay in the
rehabilitation center any longer.  We went upstairs and visited for a while.  Mark
and I gave Bob a blessing.  This evening I watched a movie on cable and filled
capsules while Mae worked on the inter-net trying to answer e-mails.  Mae gave
me a hair cut and I took a shower before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
went over to the chapel and helped set up chairs.  Mae was about ready when I
came home.  After the block ended Mae stayed for choir practice.  I walked home
and got the potatoes on to cook.  When Mae got home we finished making dinner
and took it upstairs so Bob, Carroll and Mark could join us.  This afternoon we
went over to Jeff and Gail’s and took dinner to them.  We enjoyed playing with
Benji and holding little Rachael.  She is sure a pretty little thing.  We
played games with Jeff and Gail after they put the children down to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and woke quite early.  Mae tried to get me to go
back to sleep but I got up about 8AM.  I cooked pancakes for breakfast but
Carroll had already got something else and Bob didn’t want pancakes.  Mark had
three of them.  Mae took Carroll shopping out to the base.  I build a platform
to raise Bob’s chair up four inches.  I them went over to Standard Optical to
have my glasses rebuilt.  I just couldn’t handle the way they distorted my
vision.  Bob prepared a nice lunch of chicken and noodles.  I took a half hour
nap and then I went over to Scott and Mishelle’s where Scott helped me remove
their tub surround and replace the tub faucet.  Mae went with me and played
with Kylan and Ashley.  I hadn’t planned on replacing the faucet so I was very
glad that I brought my tool trailer over with us.  It was after 10PM before I
got it finished.  I have several projects to get done but they will have to
wait a little longer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I took the
large drawer out of the cupboard to see why it wasn’t closing part of the time
so I added some screws to the track and tightened others up.  After breakfast
we got ready and went to the Salt Lake Temple and went through a session. 
After the session we ate at the cafeteria.  We then went out to 39<sup>th</sup>
South where we bought $3,000 worth to circulated silver coins.  We then stopped
at a restaurant supply on 300 W and bought some new silver ware and some
drinking glasses.  After getting home I went over to Sorenson’s Tax service to
take our 2007 income tax information so we can get our tax papers filled.  This
evening we watched the movie “From Here to Eternity”.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, March 05, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob prepared
breakfast of biscuits and gravy this morning.  He was sure tired after doing
that.  After breakfast I went to Randy and Judy’s and discussed changing the
stairs that goes from the kitchen to the family room into a ramp.  There will
be some alterations necessary to accomplish that but I believe it will work. 
Scott came over and ate lunch with Mae and I got home just as he was about to
leave.  I ate and took a nap.  I then called the Davis County School district
and checked on being a bus driver.  I was told to go to the District Office and
fill out a application and have a security check.  I then went to the Drivers
License department and got a drivers history.  I have an appointment for an
interview tomorrow.  I went to Brother Dee Frankcom’s home and checked his
garage door opener as it hasn’t been working very well lately.  I found that
the main drive gear has stripped the teeth.  I am afraid that he will need a
new opener.  Sherrie brought dinner over for Bob, Carroll, Mark, Mae and I this
evening.  I had moved every thing that was on the floor in the wash room out so
Mae could clean in there.  We found that water is leaking somewhere from
upstairs.  We found that I had knocked the drain hose from the water filter
system out of the drain when I put the drain cleaner in the pipes the other
day.  I am glad that was all and that we found it.  It was Bob and Carroll that
thought of it.  We got the washroom cleaned and put back together again.  Mae worked
on it until after 9PM.  I helped her with some of the heavy things but there
isn’t enough room for two to work in there at the same time.  In between
helping Mae and catching up my journal I played a few games on the computer.  I
downloaded the pictures from the camera and backed up my palm before we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, March 06, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had
someone call Mae’s phone at 3:45AM and wake us up.  Neither of us was able to
go back to sleep after that.  We got up at 6AM and I showered and got ready to
go to the doctor’s appointment at 8:30AM.  Dr. Jensen went over the results of
the colonoscopy I had a couple of weeks ago.  Because there was several polyp
removed he wants to reschedule another colonoscopy in a year.  We stopped at
Winegar’s to get my prescription refilled and for a few items.  I went to an
interview at the Davis County School Bus maintenance and main office for an
interview and a physical testing.  I came home and had some lunch and then took
a short nap.  I went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and reassembled the tub and
shower valves.  I also worked on their water softener getting it to go through
a regeneration cycle.  I came home and ate dinner and watched a show on TV. 
Bob asked Mark and I to give him another blessing.  I think he is related to
Margaret in more ways than one.  It was after 10PM when I made this entry.  Mae
is still on the inter-net answering e-mail. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, March 07, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
4:15AM from my mask and was up for a few minutes.  I went into the front room
so that I didn’t wake Mae and did go to sleep in the recliner.  I woke just
before 8AM.  Mae was already up.  I got a call from Brother Fallis concerning
Brother Farr and the Family History that he has been working on.  Brother Farr
has 6 or 7 double drawer file cabinets with over 5,000 family group sheets
completed in them.  Brother Farr is concerned that he may die before these
sheets of information can be entered into the Church Family History data. 
After talking to Brother Fallis I tried to call Bishop Steadman as he works on
the team that is programming the new Family Search.  He is out of town until
tonight late so I will have to talk to him tomorrow. We next tried find out
from our Clearfield Family History Center about Brother Farr’s records and they
gave me a number to call in Salt Lake, who transferred me to some one else who
transferred me to some one else and the transferred me to another person who
suggested that I call our local Family History Center.  That made a complete
circle.  We decided to work on training for our calling today, so Mae tried to
get registered as a Ward Family History Consultant.  We couldn’t get it to work
until we had made a couple of calls and several tries at registering her.  After
getting Mae registered we tried to get online but it wouldn’t except our pass
work.  I spent some time on the phone with the Family History center and we
finally concluded that the Inter-net connection will not work on a dial up
link.  We did some research as to how to get High Speed and after talking to
Mike and Scott we called Comcast and signed up with them.  Mae got some clam
chowder made for lunch while I was on the phones.  I visited with Bob and Mark
about some history off my Grandmother Hill and Mark found a history written by
her.  Mae thinks that we have a copy of that history but I don’t remember it. 
Mark let me keep it to make a copy for my self.  Randy and Judy stopped by as I
wanted to show them the ramp I made for Bob and Carroll.  Their ramp will be
just a little steeper than Bob’s.  They will decide if they want to proceed. 
Scott and Mishelle took us into the Salomon Center in Ogden where we ate and
then watched the surfing area and the ski flying area.  It is quite amazing at
what they have.  It was 8:30PM when we got home.  we are quite tired so will
got to bed early tonight.  I have a slight cold so can use the sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3:15AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I finally got up and lay in the recliner
but still didn’t sleep much.  I decided to get my robe so I could work on the
computer but Mae was awake and talked me into cuddling and sleeping a little
longer.  I don’t think Mae went to sleep but I did for a little while.  I went
up to David’s and met them.  From there David and I drove in my pickup to Monte
Crystal. Shauna and the children followed us.  Up there we went snowmobiling
for about 3 hours.  It was really nice and we had fun.  With David and I riding
together it gave us some good talk time and we continued it when I took him
home.  I can say this much he is a good debater.  When I got home I had Mae
come out and help me and we put the snowmobiles in the shed.  We were going to
fix dinner for Bob, Carroll and Mark but Bruce and Micheline were there so we
waited a few minutes but then when I went up Irven and Sandy were there.  We
finally heated up the clam chowder for Bob, Carroll, Mark, Sandy and Irven and
heated some casserole for Mae and I.  After eating we visited.  The women
visited in the kitchen and the men watched the BYU vs TCU basketball game.  Mae
and I set Bob and Carroll’s clocks ahead for daylight saving time and then went
downstairs and reset our clocks ahead, made whey, and got ready for bed.  I
also filled in this journal entry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up with
the alarm and had slept well last night.  I had to hurry to get to the church
at 8:15AM to help set up chairs.  Brother Higley was the only one that was
there when I got there.  Mark came before we had finished setting up the chairs
and help finish the job.  I went home and had some breakfast.  Mae is fasting
this morning being concerned with the mole on her breast.  It still is not
ready to remove and it may be that she black save came off to early.  Jeanenne
is trying to do some research with a Doctor as to what needs to be done.  My
thoughts, concerns and prayers have been with David today.  I felt a special
spirit or a special interest in the meetings through out the block today.  Mae
attended the choir practice after church and I waited.  When Mae was finished
we were invited into the Bishop’s office to be set apart in our callings as
Ward Family History Coordinators.  Mae was set apart by Brother Therman and in
his prayer he especially gave attention to Mae’s health.  I thought that it was
interesting.  Bishop Steve Smith set me apart and I have a special place in my
heart for him.  Bob and Carroll had a nice roast dinner prepared when we got
home and Mark had set the table.  After dinner I went with Brother Fallis to
visit Brother Farr.  Brother Farr is almost 89 years old and in very pour
health.  He has compiled 5,000 to 6,000 Family Group Sheets and is very
concerned as to how to preserve the information.  We talked to him about the
new Family History program and explained that it might not be available for
another year.  We told him that we would look into other options and get back
to him.  We visited with him for over an hour.  We then came back and gave the
Sacrament to Bob and Carroll in as much as they are unable to get out to
church.  We also administered to Carroll.  Brother Fallis sealed the anointing
and gave the Blessing.  When I came downstairs Mae was working on her personal
history.  I called Jeff to see if he was interested in buying into the
Snowmobiles or not.  They don’t feel it is something they want to do now.  I
tried to call Scott but didn’t get an answer.  I called to talk to David but he
was asleep taking a nap.  I then laid down in the recliner and took a nap.  Mae
woke me from my nap with a call from David.  He and I talked for some time.  I
guess I forgot about time and talked longer than I had thought to David.  When
I hung up I realized that Mae had wanted to attend a Fireside in Clearfield but
we were too late by then.  After eating some supper, I worked on my journal. 
Mae has spent most of the afternoon working on her history.  I was able to call
Scott this evening and visit with him.  He said that his talk that he has been
concerned over went fair.  We talked about the Snowmobiles and he is still
trying to decide.  They are concerned about getting food supply.  I told him
that if it was between getting food supply or the snowmobiles he should not get
the snowmobiles.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM so that I could get to the School Bus Training class at 7:30AM.  Mae hadn’t
slept very well so I let her sleep in.  Class was interesting and very
informative.  It was 12:45PM before I was finished with the drug testing and
was able to come home.  Mae was not there as she had met with Jackie to go
walking and for lunch.  She then went up to Kim and Jeanenne’s where Jeanenne
checked the mole on her breast and said that it was looking as it should.  That
was a relief for her.  I took a nap after getting some lunch.  I went up and
visited with Bob for a few minutes.  Comcast came this morning and install high
speed internet service to the house.  They could not do direct wire to our
computer so they told Mae, Mark and Bob what had to be done.  It was quite
funny as while I was visiting with Bob he told me that the installer had to
come back with a router to finish the installation.  Bob took it that he was
talking about a carpenter router and passed that information to me.  I couldn’t
understand why they would use a router to drill holes.  When we all got
together and discussed what the situation was, it was a computer signal router
and it would make the connection to our computers, wireless.  Mae had prepared
Lazona for dinner and we got a kick out of the new language that is spoken in
today’s world.  Mae and I went over to Sorenson’s and picked up our tax
papers.  We then stopped at Wal-Mart and bought the router and two receivers
for our two computers.  I filled out my journal before we went to bed.  We
watched a movie on DVD before going to sleep</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t get
up until 5:30AM and so Mae got up and got my breakfast ready for me.  Class
went well this morning.  When I got home I filled out some forms and ate
lunch.  Mae fixed lunch and after eating I took a nap.  I started on some
personal history but then Mae needed some help getting dinner ready so I helped
her.  Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley came over for dinner and then Scott
helped us install the router and cards so that we could use the high speed
internet.  It took him all evening and we still have problems with my laptop
connecting.  They left just before 10PM for home.  I finished this entry and we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up at
5AM and was ready to leave by 6:30AM so I lay down in the recliner until 7AM. 
Class went well and we were out at noon.  I now need to study for my CDL
examination.  I stopped and got natural gas in my pickup.  Scott and Jeff were
just getting in their cars when I got home.  I did get to say hi to them and
give them a hug before they went back to work.  After eating I took a nap.  I
then showered and changed and we went to the Ogden Temple.  They needed patrons
at the Sealing office so we went up and helped with the Sealing’s of couples
and also of daughters to parents.  We stopped on the way home at Warreners
driv-in and got something to eat.  As soon as we got home I changed white
shirts and went Home Teaching.  Fallis’s had called Mae and told her that they
would come over to visit Bob and Carroll and we could have a lesson then for
Home Teaching.  They hadn’t come by 6:45PM so I called them but got no answer. 
They didn’t show by 7PM so Mark went with me and we visited the Casey’s and the
Johnston’s.  When we got back home we checked with Bob and Carroll and the
Fallis’s had never shown up.  Mike called to tell us that he had been given a
new job.  He will be the Principle of a Jr. High School.  He had hoped for
either a Elementary or a High School and to make it worse one of his assistants
had worked with him before and they hadn’t got along then.  I am sure that Mike
can handle it ok.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but when I got up Mae woke and went into the living room and got into the
recliner.  I checked on her and decided to let her sleep there for a while.  I
went back to bed for a while.  I didn’t have much scheduled for today so I
installed shelf holders in Marks closet.  Mae did quite a bit of studying for
the Book Group this evening.  I helped prepare lunch and after lunch Mae went
Visiting Teaching.  I took a nap and then did some studying for the CDL test. 
This evening Mae went to the Book Club.  I watched a show on TV.  When Mae got
home we watched another TV show before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
so laid back down in the recliner.  I had school bus training this morning so
had to be there by 9:30AM.  We were assigned trainers and went out today and
just road in a bus to each of the High Schools and were shown where the stops
were at each school.  We were back to the transportation office by noon and
were released for the day.  Sandi called me and asked if we could tend Paris
for her this weekend.  She is going to fly to Phoenix and be with Shellie.  She
also asked if I could meet her at the airport parking and get Paris.  I drove
up to Mary’s Health store and got some capsules and vinegar before going home. 
Mae fixed us some lunch and after eating I took a short nap.  We had a representative
from Comcast call at 2PM to give us some orientation on the internet.  I had to
leave for Salt Lake so Mae had to take the call.  I got to the Park N Jet at
2;45PM and Sandi got there with in 10 minutes.  Mae prepared dinner for all of
us.  after dinner we got things ready to have Irven, Sandy, Bryce and Deanna
come over.  We played our marble game and then Mexican Train Dominos.  It was a
good evening to have them here to visit and relax.  It was mid-night before we
got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My CPAP mask
vibrated several times during the night but didn’t wake me totally.  It did
wake Mae about 6AM so she got up and laid in the recliner but didn’t sleep.  We
were slow at getting started.  I talked to David who is thinking of getting a
by-fuel pickup.  I also talked to Mike about coming to his place next Friday to
install a new water heater and a new water softener.  I also tried to get my
inter-net connection to work on my computer but got discouraged with it.  We
went to see Bryce &amp; Deanna’s home in Willard.  It is quite nice but needs
quite a bit of painting and fix up.  I made a few suggestions as what might be
done.  We got back home at 2:30PM and Bob had dinner ready for us.  I took a
nap after eating.  Mae and I got on the internet and did a little studding on
Family History Consultants responsibilities.  At 6PM Mae and I went to the
Stake High Priest banquette and social.  We stayed for a few minutes and helped
clean up.  After getting home I filled out my journal entry and then we tried
to find a show to watch.  This was unsuccessful and we ended up shutting the TV
of and going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early so I could help set up chairs at the church house but when I got there
all chairs were set up.  I came home and did some studding of the lesson manual
and ate some breakfast.  We then attended the regular block meetings.  I was to
meet with Bishop Steadman after meetings but he had to go home with sick
children.  Later I called him and we reset the time to 2PM at our place.  We
had brought food home last night from the High Priest banquet that was extra. 
Bob warmed things up and we ate dinner upstairs.  Bishop Steadman came over at
2 and we talked about Brother Farr’s Family History files and Bishop Steadman
is going to try to find someone to help with our questions.  I took a short nap
this afternoon.  Mae and I worked on Family History Training together.  We did
fairly well until one of the “What if” questions gave us an example of a Sister
asking us how to use the Family Search to add historical information to the
file.  I said “You have got to be kidding me” and the two of us busted up
laughing until we could do no more.  That kind of a question is way out side of
our league.  I filled out my journal and we quite for the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
slept very well last night and I woke early so slept the rest of the night in
the recliner.  I got up early to get ready to go in for training.  Mae got up
at 8AM and prepared me some breakfast.  Bryce called and asked if he could
borrow my chain saw.  I had told him that I had one when we were at their place
on Saturday.  I went out and brought it in so he could stop and get it from
Mae.  I didn’t accomplish very much today except see where I am in my
training.  After leaving the Bus offices I came home and got some lunch.  I
then went to the Layton WorkMed office and got a physical examination.  That
took me until after 4PM.  I then went into PRAXAIR where I met with Ned and had
him check my CPAP machine and I got a new face mask.  When I got home, Bob had
dinner ready so we went upstairs and ate.  When we finished and came downstairs
I updated some of my records and then we started on another Family History
training session.  Before we finished Bryce came to get my chain saw as he
hadn’t had time to get it earlier.  That took over an hour.  It was after
9:30PM when we finished the lesson so I filled in my journal and we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up until 7AM but with Mae’s help I made it to the bus terminal before 9:30AM. 
A round table discussion was held with all sub-bus drivers in the district.  It
was very interesting as with a few general announcements the meeting was opened
to the drivers to express concerns and problems.  It was a good experience and
also an eye opener.  I was then taken through a pre-drive inspection which was
very interesting and informative.  We ate lunch when I got home.  I spent quite
a lot of time trying to find out who is to make out the report for my sleep
apnea.  I did become quite frustrated as I tried to get the information with
the telephone systems.  It is hard to get to a real person to talk to and then
the system shut me off.  I believe it should be Dr. Jensen so I took the report
over to his office and left it with the reception deck.  I did some studying on
the CDL manual.  I helped Bob and Mark also came down and visited for a while. 
I checked with Randy and he is still on for ice fishing on Friday.  Mae and I
watched a show on Comcast before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6:30AM so Mae could get up to Jennie’s by 9:30AM.  I worked on my CDL manual,
went to Discount Tires and bought a new set of tires for my pickup.  I also
picked up my glasses at Standard Optical.  From there I went to Sportsman’s
Warehouse and bought Mae’s and mine fishing license.  Mae had returned and
Sandi was also there when I got back.  Scott and Jeff came over for lunch.  It
was nice to have the three children here to visit with.  Sandi was here until
almost 2PM before she left.  We enjoyed her dog but it is nice to have it
gone.  I took a nap and then worked on my CDL manual again.  About 5PM I went
out back and got my ice fishing equipment loaded into the pickup.  Bob cooked
liver and onions for dinner.  He also cooked Mae some chicken.  They were very
good and we sure enjoyed them.  Mae went to choir practice at 6:30PM.  I worked
on my journal.  after choir practice Brother and Sister Fallis stopped by Bob’s
so that Bob might also visit with them in our Home Teaching visit.  Mae came
upstairs also.  After a short informal visit I gave some thoughts about the testimonies
of the Prophets and the exemplary lives they have all lived.  It was a good
visit.  Bob closed the visit with prayer.  When we returned downstairs I added
more to my personal history and finished today’s entry in my journal.  Mae made
me some sandwiches for tomorrow.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30AM and got ready to go fishing with Randy.  I was down to his place by
6:30.  We got to Heber and it was snowing lightly.  As we started up the summit
the snow came harder and before long we came to a stop because of semis
stopping to chain up.  We reached the summit probably averaging 15 MPH.  When
we turned of the main highway to Strawberry reservoir we found the road was
starting to blow over.  We turned around and came back as we felt it was to
much risk to go further with me being the only one that could see.  It was
after noon when I got home.  Mae had taken Sister Lavern Larson to her Doctors
appointment and returned before I did but then she took Carroll over to get
their dog at the dog grooming shop.  We ate lunch and then I took a short nap. 
Randy and I had talked of some work he needed done and considered trading work
for their 2005 Cadillac which they are going to sell anyway.  Mae went with me
into Ogden to get some prices for roofing for Randy.  We also went to Durk’s
plumbing and picked up a water heater and a water softener for Mike’s home.  We
went down and took a test drive in Randy and Judy’s car but will think about
it.  As we started for Ogden Mae said something to me and I responded wrong and
that set some tension between us.  Sometimes life is hard.  We ate a late
dinner so stayed up a while.  We did some research on the cost of auto
insurance, taxes, licensing besides the added cost for parts and we fairly well
came to the conclusion that we can’t afford a Cadillac.  It would also be a lot
of hours to work off that kind of cost.  We will sleep on it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and got ready to go to Mike’s.  I stopped at United Rental and rented a
furniture dolly to move the equipment up and down the basement stairs.  As we
were traveling I called Randy and told him that we wouldn’t be taking the car. 
I just didn’t feel that we should obligate ourselves to that amount of money.  When
we got there all of the family was gone so we let our self in by the use of the
garage door opener.  Things went quite well and by 2PM I had both the water
softener and the water heater changed.  Mike had stopped in just after we got
started to see how I was doing.  When Becky got home she started dinner.  We
are sure impressed with Becky as our daughter-in-law.  She is a perfect wife
for Mike, a great mother to her children and seems to be good at all her
duties.  After dinner this evening Mike took his family and Mae and I to see
his school that he will be the principle at.  When we entered the building the
current principle met us and introduced us to some of the staff that was
there.  They were having a night dance for the Jr. High students.  The
principle then gave us a tour of the building.  It left me complete amazed at
the facilities that the youth now have in which to gain an education.  I
couldn’t help comparing it with the buildings I had.  Wow what a change.  We
stayed over night at Mike and Becky’s so when we got back to their place and
Becky got the little girls to bed, we played a game of marbles with Mike and
Mom, Page and Becky, David and I as teams.  Mike and Mae won the game.</span></p>

nice breakfast for us this morning of waffles, yogurt, whipped cream and fresh
strawberries.  After breakfast Becky took Mattie and Jessie to an Easter Egg
hunt.  We left for home so Mae could get to a special Stake Relief Society
program.  I returned the dolly to United Rental and while there looked at a
High Lift fork lift.  I then went up to Rick and Georgia’s and went over my
thoughts of moving their tree house.  I then came back to Durk’s Plumbing and
paid the bill for Mikes water softener and water heater.  While there I went
over to Diamond Rental and checked their High Lift.  They have larger ones but
they are also wider and that may be a problem to get it into Rick and Georgia’s
back yard.  I got natural gas in the pickup and then came home.  Mae was home
when I got there.  I ate lunch as Mae had already eaten at the Relief Society
program and then I took a two hour nap.  We then spent some time setting up on
a new e-mail provider.  We went out to eat at Chuck-A-Rama and then came home
and watched the movie “The Boy That Can Fly”.  We enjoyed it but were late
getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early so I could help set up chairs at the church.  No one else came to help. 
When I got home Mae asked me if there were others that helped me and I told her
that there was three of us.  she said good and then I said “there was Me,
Myself and I”.  I got a dish of cereal and then hurried to get to church on
time.  All the meetings were excellent and especially Sacrament meeting.  The
Primary children sang a song and then the Ward Choir sang “God So Loved the
World”.  Sister Claudia Thompson and Brother Mark Hulet were asked to bare
their testimonies of Christ.  Both of them did excellent.  Claudia covered more
on her feelings of the music that has been written about our Savior, Mark told
of his personal feeling of the Savior.  Mark had written his testimony and I
asked him if he would give me a copy of it. He said he would and I will add
that to this entry.  The choir then sang “He Is Risen!”.  Bishop Smith then
gave his testimony of the Savior and it was very exciting to me.  I ask Sister
Smith if he had written it out and she said that she thought he had and she
would get me a copy.  If I get his talk I will also add it to this entry. 
Sister Thompson hadn’t written her testimony down.  I visited with Bishop
Steadman a couple of times today and 1<sup>st</sup> he told me that the new
Family History program has major problems and is not working.  He has not found
a solution to Brother Farr’s data that we are trying to preserve.  I asked him
if he could try to find a department or building or person that I might contact
in Church Head Quarters that I might personally go down to visit.  He will try
to check when he gets to work in the morning and give me a call.  Bob had
dinner ready for us when we got home from church.  It was sure good.  Brother
Fallis brought me one of the folders out of over 5,000 folders of Brother
Farr’s family history records, so that I might take it to Salt Lake to try to
find out how and what to do with his family history fills.  I took a nap after
dinner.  When I woke up I started to catch up my journal.  I also worked with
Mae on our families records.  I worked on my personal history file for over two
hours until we got ready for bed at 11PM.  Mae got a call from Jeff this
afternoon and he is sure depressed.  This has sure got us worried as to how to
help him.  Mae did get him to agree to try some pills that she got from
Jennie.  We are sure concerned for him and for Gail and the children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I
have a testimony born of the Spirit, that our Father in Heaven lives, and that
His son Jesus Christ lives at His right hand, both are resurrected glorified
beings, assisted by the Holy Ghost, a person of spirit.  We refer to them as
the Godhead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I
testify Our Father's Great Plan of Happiness was taught in pre-mortality to His
spirit children, of which I was one.  I was privileged to be born when the
gospel of Jesus Christ was on this earth in it's fullness, born in this
Promised Land of freedom, and blessed with a family of goodly parents and
siblings, all who honor their covenants with the Lord.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I
testify our Father in Heaven's Great Plan of Happiness is designed to save all
children He created, and gives each one opportunity to accept or reject it,
either in this life or in the post mortal world to come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>With
faith I testify that at the center of Father's Plan is Jesus Christ, His first
born spirit offspring, who volunteered before the foundation of this world to
be the sacrificial lamb for the <u>miraculous infinite atonement</u>.  He
atoned<u> </u>for the sins of all our Father's children on the many worlds He
created and made Our Father's Plan successful.  <u>When the Father said</u> <b>&quot;<u>Whom
shall I send</u>?&quot;</b>  Jesus answered <b>&quot;<u>Here am I, send me</u>.&quot;</b> 
Because of the great love Father in Heaven has for each of his children, He
permitted Jesus Christ, who was to be His only begotten Son in the flesh, a
Pre-mortal God, the Great Jehovah, sinless and perfect, to condescend (descend)
below all things on earth, below all evil, <u>to experience the consequence,
the punishment, of the combined sins of all people God has created</u> in all
worlds He has made.  Hence, the atonement of Jesus Christ is infinite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Our
Father in Heaven allowed His Son, Jesus Christ, to suffer alone in the Garden
of Gethsemane, except sending an angel, believed to be Gabriel, to comfort Him.
In D&amp;C Sec.19 Jesus describes his intense suffering in His own words;
&quot;Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble
because of pain, and bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and
spirit---and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink.&quot;  In
this Garden He cried out <u>&quot;O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me, Nevertheless</u>, <b><u>not as I will, but as thou wilt</u></b>.<b>&quot;</b>
His sacrifice was completed by crucifixion, a most cruel, vicious, and painful
punishment, nailed to a cross, in public humiliation by the most wicked and
conspiring men in the most wicked world of the millions God has created.  (From
Mediation and Atonement by President John Taylor) Jesus Christ came to earth to
do the will of the Father and His most significant and final words from the
cross were &quot;<b><u>Father, it is finished</u></b><u>, <b>thy will is done</b></u>.&quot;
(Inspired Translation of the Bible)  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I
can testify in full faith and sincerity that Jesus Christ lived on earth, died
for our sins to redeem us from the Fall of Adam and from our own fall as we
have all sinned and broken the laws of God.  He died for the purpose of
bringing our sin account to zero, therefore, to make us <u>just</u>, and by
shedding His blood cleansed, purified, and sanctified us to be worthy to live
in the Celestial Kingdom with God and our families.  All prophets, beginning
with Adam and to the present, have born this testimony of Jesus Christ; many
sealed it with a martyr's blood.  The testimonies of these noble men, including
our living prophet, are evidence for my faith and testimony.  As I listen,
read, and study, the Spirit testifies to me the truth of their testimonies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I
know through the confirming influence of the Holy Ghost, by feelings and
sensations, that He has been a near companion much of my life.  I believe He
knows my heart seeks to be right with God, in spite of my weaknesses and
mistakes, and by repentance, the principle of progress, He knows I strive to do
better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I
have recorded many personal and sacred accounts of the Spirit of the Lord's
communications with me; healing me at age 4 years, after my father's blessing
promised I would live when the doctor said I would be dead in the morning; protecting
me from death or serious injury in severe accidents; the spirit speaking in a
firm audible voice which shook me, saying &quot;<b><u>Don't</u></b>&quot; when
I made an unwise decision that would have altered my whole life.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Many
other sacred recorded personal experiences convince me God is real, He lives,
He is the father of my spirit.  I have a testimony Jesus Christ, is the Son of
God, also a God, came to earth to redeem me from physical death and spiritual
death by His voluntary sacrifice for my sins, as he did for all others.  I know
that Jesus Christ was resurrected from the dead, a miraculous event we honor
and celebrate today, and opened the way for me and all Father's children to
receive a perfect resurrected body in the form of our spirit.  We are all first
generation spirit offspring of a perfect Father and Mother in Heaven.  The
Church of Jesus Christ of former days and of Latter Day Saints is the one and
only true Church of Jesus Christ ever to exist on this earth and in eternity,
and President Thomas S. Monson is God's prophet for His church at this time.  I
so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t
sleep very well last night so I let Mae sleep longer.  I was up at 7:15AM and
after trying to think of the items I need to take care of I decided to fast
this morning.  I went to Salt Lake to the Family History center at the Joseph
Smith Center.  From there I was suggested to go to the Family History Library. 
There I talked to the supervisor of the center. He gave me the phone number of
Sister Carolyn Bellomy who is the Director over the Church Family History
department.  I called her but she wasn’t in her office.  I left her a message
and she later returned the call.  Sister Bellomy told me that they couldn’t
accept Brother Farr’s files unless they were transcribed onto the computer. 
They neither had the time or manpower to enter the information.  Un less this
information is digitized they cannot accept information.  She gave me the
number of Brother Brown at the Church Historical Department, saying that
because of the relationship to President Kimball they might be interested in
the files.  But when I called Brother Brown said that they could not accept
these files either.  Mae tended Jeff and Gail’s children, Benji and Rachel
Lynn, this afternoon while Gail attended a special class for the school.  They
are sure special children.  When Gail came to get the children we had a visit
with her and she is sure concerned about Jeff.  When Gail went to leave Benji
didn’t want to go.  Grandma spoiled him to much while he was here.  Gail asked
him if he wanted to go see Daddy and he immediately decided to go.  Oh that
Jeff could just realize what he has!  I was some time working out the Comcast
billing for this month.  Before I ended up I also signed up for another phone
line for us and we will cancel our service with Qwest.  That will save us $15 a
month on our phone bill and will give us unlimited long distance calling
anywhere in the U.S.  I did some studding for my CDL test.  I talked to Carla
about suggestions of what to do with Brother Farr’s files.  She had some
suggestions that we can consider.  I also talked to Betsy about the problem and
she suggested that we get a top loading scanner and scan the files.  This
sounds like a very good suggestion.  I will have to visit with Brother Higgley
and our Bishop with the information I know have.    We got a e-mail from Larry
and Dian Steel telling us that they are going to leave the Church because they
feel that there is to many clicks in our ward and they don’t feel accepted
here.  Mae tried to send them a reply and also invited then to come over Friday
evening.  I guess we will see how that goes over. I finished my journal entry
and then we went to bed quite late.  After getting into bed both Mae and I had
problems with out legs jumping.  We had to get up and get some aspirins before
we could go to sleep.</span></p>

before the alarm went off at 6AM.  I had Mae go back to sleep which she did
waking at 7:30AM and fixing me some breakfast.  I really enjoyed reading the
scriptures this morning from 3 Nephi 11.  What a special account of the Savior
coming to the Americas after his resurrection.  I went to Bryce and Deanna’s
new home and helped Bryce by installing Haring Bone braces in what open floor
joists I could and using decking screws to secure the floor to the joists.  I
also helped him remove some fur downs from their kitchen ceiling.  I had to get
up in the attic to secure framing to hang sheetrock to.  For lunch Wendy
invited us there for some hamburgers that she cooked for us.  They were very
good.  I worked until 6 PM before gathering up tools and going home.  Because
of working so late I did not get home in time to attend the Republican Caucus
meeting with Mae.  She attended and was asked to be a county delegate.  I
showered and then lay down to take a nap.  Betsy called and wants us to come to
their place on April 2<sup>nd</sup> for dinner and they will show us how the
scanner they have works.  After talking to her I did take a ½ hour nap.  Mae
got home just as I started to study for my CDL test.  I stopped studying at
10PM and made this journal entry.  I am sure tired tonight.</span></p>

some fish up to Bob so he could cook the up for all of us.  He made biscuits to
go with them.  We didn’t eat until 9:30AM so Mae could sleep as much as
possible.  I studied before breakfast and also after breakfast for my driving test. 
Scott and Jeff came over for lunch so that was enjoyable having them to visit
for a few minutes.  I studied after lunch and went to Brigham City about 3PM
and took the test.  I passed the 1st and 2<sup>nd</sup> section of the test
with out any trouble but the 3<sup>rd</sup> section I only got 75% right and I
had to have over 75% to pass.  I decided to return tomorrow for a retake as I
wouldn’t have any time to study before taking the test over again.  I was going
to stop at Bryce’s but then changed my mind.  I was glad that I did because I
forgot that we were going to the Temple this evening.  Mae drove into the
Temple so I could study on the way.  We got there a little early and went
through the 6:45PM session.  Brother Higgley was the only one from our Ward
that we saw.  Brother and Sister Brown were on the next session.  Not a very
good turn out from our Ward tonight.  We came home and had something to eat.  I
stayed up and entered this entry and studied for the retake in the morning.</span></p>

district and he wants me to come in for more training.  I came home and changed
clothes and went in.  I worked with Allen this morning and then I went home and
ate some lunch.  This afternoon I came back and went with Allen on his
afternoon runs.  We went to the North Layton Jr. High and took those children
and the went to grade school east of Hill Air Force Base and got children there
and took them home.  I came on home and helped Mae get supper ready.  We took
it upstairs for Bob, Carroll and Mark to eat with us.  When we came downstairs
where we played a couple of games on the computers and watched a movie before
going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:15AM so I could be ready to be at the School Bus area to go on a bus rout
with Alan.  When we finished the run and returned to the bus terminal, Sherrie,
another trainee joined us and we went through the Pre-Trip inspection.  We then
washed the bus and went out on the driving track.  Sherrie drove on the track
and tried to Parallel Park and did fair.  Alan had me take over and pull out. 
I was caught off guard as I put the bus into drive at the force of pull engine
has on the bus.  I also got my foot partially over the gas pedal as I stepped
on the brake peddle so that gave me even more power.  After realizing that, I
did better as I took the bus to its parking space.  After lunch I took a nap. 
Mae went over to Sister Dilly’s and helped her with her children while she
moved to a house on H.A.F.B.  I went to the store for a few items and a head of
cabbage for Bob.  He cooked a cabbage casserole for dinner.  After eating Mae
and I went over to Jeff and Gail’s where we tended Benji and Rachel while Jeff
and Gail went out to eat and to a movie.  Mae played with Benji until she put
him down to bed.  I watched TV while also studying and taking a test for the
School District.  It was almost mid-night when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
went to Bryce’s and worked for him today.  I spent most of the day adding
herring bone bracing to the floor joist in areas of the basement that are not
finished and then screwing down the flooring upstairs.  Mae went up to Cailee
Walker’s baptismal this morning.  Scott and Kylan were here when I came home. 
Scott had borrowed Bob’s pickup and taken trash away.  They had just finished
and we visiting with Mae when I came home.  I showered and took a nap.  Mae
prepared dinner for Bob, Carroll, Mae and I this evening.  Billie and Maggie
Klass came over this evening and we played three games of marbles.  The men vs.
the women.  Billie and I won the first and third game.  It was almost 11PM when
Billie and Maggie left but it was good to get together with them again. 
Morning will come early tomorrow.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went over
to set up chairs this morning and they were already set up.  I didn’t find out
who are when they were done.  We attended the regular block program.  This
afternoon we went up to David and Shauna’s for dinner and spent the evening
with them.  It was late when we returned and I was tired so we just went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                There was no
one available at the school district for training today so I decided to go to
Bryce and Deanna’s and work on their house.  I worked about 7 hours today.  This
evening we went to Georgia and Rick’s where all of Mae’s siblings gathered. 
Terry, Angela and Brandon came down as Wednesday Brandon will enter the Mission
Home.  Most of Georgia and Rick’s children also came.  We ate dinner and
visited.  It was very good to get together with all of them.</span></p>
