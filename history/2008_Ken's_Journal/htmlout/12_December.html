<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4AM to make my bus run.  I was ready to go just a little early so I worked on
my journal.  I bent over to load the printer with pre-punched paper and as I
did my back went into a spasiam.  Mae helped me and rubbed my back with
Thera-Gesic.  I was able to make my run and after I went over to Dr. Bennet and
got a treatment.  I called Mae to let her know that I was going to get a
treatment.  Mae had gone over to Scott’s to help Mishelle.  She informed me
that Jeff had called Scott this morning and informed him that he was in
Southern Utah.  He did not take his cell phone with him.  We also found out
that he had asked Gail to come home to stay last night but Gail placed some
demands on coming home.  After Gail left Jeff went up to David’s and spent the
evening.  Mae and I felt good at having Gail call and alert the Utah Highway
Patrol.  I fear that the only thing we can hope for is in prayer.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got Bob to
take me over to Jeff’s so that we could get the kits that I let Jeff take
yesterday.  I wasn’t sure that the mother rabbit would take them back but we
worked with her for a few minutes and she accepted them.  I had Bob apply some
more Thera-Gesic before I went on my afternoon run.  When I returned from the
run I went over to JB’s and filled up on gas and natural gas.  I checked on the
rabbits and everything seems to be ok.  I called Mae and she is busy helping at
Scott and Mishelle’s.  She will be late getting home.  I cooked the 2<sup>nd</sup>
half of the turkey this evening.  I caught my journal up and watched a couple
of shows on TV.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got home
just before 9PM.  A few minutes later Scott called and said that Jeff had just
called him and he is on the way home.  Mae called Gail and told her.  Mae tried
to talk to Gail but finally gave the phone to me.  I tried to tell Gail that we
were advised by or bishop that we have to love unconditional.  Gail doesn’t see
that she is putting conditions on her love.   I sure don’t know the answers but
I know that neither of them can continue the way things are going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I took my
morning bus run and all went well.  The seat in the bus is very comfortable and
seems to support my back well.  I just have to be careful bending.  When I got
back to the compound I went to Randy’s and got him.  He went with me to his
daughters and helped her give me a massage.  I was there a couple of hours, so
felt that I should give her at least $30.00 for her time.  I did go out and to
take care of the rabbits.  Mae had fed them but the white doe and kits are going
through feed pretty fast.  I got some lunch and took a short nap before going
on the afternoon run.  When I got home I put the boat and camp trailer away.  I
also moved the material that I bought the other day into the canapé to keep
them out of the weather.  Mae had super ready and then we went over to the
Family History Center.  I guess that I learned that I built my Family History
Wrong when I merged the file from Betsey into the down load from the IGI file. 
I think it will be best to start over again.  When we got home I got on the Bus
Web Sight and put in several bids for extra trips for next week.  My back is
still hurting quite bad when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When I got up
this morning my back is still hurting.  As I was reading my scriptures this
morning I thought about the counsel of Mosiah concerning riches and helping the
poor.  I wonder if we are doing enough or do we fit in the “Those that would
like to help but doesn’t have enough”?  I also thought of all the things that
are waiting for me to do and the bids I put in for last night.  I reopened the
bus web site and canceled all my bids.  I think I am hurting to bad and have too
much to do right now.  Mae got up and helped me get off to work.  The run went
well but my back sure is tight.  After getting back for the run I laid on the
Chee machine and then on the inverter table.  Mae fed the rabbits for me.  I
called and visited with Lois for a few minutes.  Just before I hung up with
her, Roy called and we visited for a little while.  He would like me to E-mail
him some family pictures.  Scott and Jeff came over for lunch and we enjoyed
having them.  Mae and I went for a short walk.  I took a anti-inflammatory pill
that we got from the Philippines to see if it would help relieve my back pain.   I
made my run ok but my back still hurts me.  on the way home I stopped at Wal
Mart and bought Mae a poinsettia for Christmas.  Mae was talking to Shellie and
Roy when I came in so I went out and fed my rabbits.  When Mae finished talking
to Shellie and Roy she started to prepare dinner.  She had something else that
she needed to do first, so I decided that I would get the turkey out of the
refrigerator and trim it up.  Just then a knock came at the door and it was
Gary Nelson and his date Della.  We stopped what we were doing and started
visiting with them.  I thought that they must have been in the area and just
stopped by.  Then Mae said that we could go out to eat and then come back to
play games.  I got my day planner out and looked for the schedule when we were
to get to gather with them.  I have it in my planner for Jan. 3<sup>rd</sup>. 
Gary and I had miss-communicated and I was a month different.  We put the food
back in the refrigerator and went to Chuck-A-Rama to eat.  We really enjoyed
the evening with them.  We will try for another date to play games.  It was 9PM
when we got home.  I filled out the last of this entry and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                As I was
reading this morning I felt strongly impressed that it would be best for Jeff
and Gail if they were to get a divorce.  This marriage doesn’t seem to be
working out for either of them.  I tried to talk to Gail the other night but I
only upset her and I dought if she will talk to me again.  She doesn’t feel
that any of these problems has anything to do with her.  I have found that when
it comes to marriage or marriage problems that it takes two people.  I guess
that I should just keep my thoughts to myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I made my bus
runs today but that is about all that I really accomplished.  Mae went over to
Scott and Mishelle’s to help them out this afternoon.  She got home after 7PM. 
We watched a show on TV that was fair.  Mark came down and discussed a problem
with the props for the play that will be put on this Saturday.  I hope I helped
him but I think he is worrying to much about it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This morning
the High School Students go in to school two hours late, so I was planning on
sleeping in a little longer, but at 4AM my right foot and calf cramped and I
had to get up and walk it out.  After making my morning runs, Bob took me over
to Dr. Toon’s and I got an adjustment.  It really seems to help.  Mae went out
to eat with Georgia for lunch.  I worked on my journal, ate lunch and took a
nap before my afternoon run.  The afternoon run went well.  Mae did some other
errorns after being with Georgia.  When she came home we ate some dinner and
left for Scott and Mishelle’s.  We stopped at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and ordered
a 35 mm slide canner to transfer our slides to digital computer pictures.  We
also stopped at Alco auto parts and I bought some lights for the back of my
pickup.  We got to Scott’s about 6PM and Scott and Mishelle soon left for a
company Christmas party.  They returned about 8:30PM.  They had had a good time
and we enjoyed tending the children.  I was tired when we got home so we son
went to bed.  I woke up before mid-night and didn’t sleep very well the rest of
the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
8AM.  After breakfast I went out and took care of the rabbits.  I then started
work on building a new set of rabbit pens.  Bob came out and helped me.  Mae
attended a basketball game of Kylan’s.  Jeff called me on his way to Jackson
Wyoming.  He is going to visit Gail’s Sister and her husband.  He slipped with
“Possibly for the last time.”  He wanted to tell me that Gail wasn’t still
upset at what I said to her the other night.  When Mae got home we changed and
went up to David and Shauna’s ward building, where we attended the Baptismal of
Emily.  After the Baptismal we went to David and Shauna’s where we ate a
lunching that David and Shauna had prepared.  Of course we had to take our
special diet.  Several from Shauna’s family came as well as Mike’s family,
Sandi and Nick (who brought JaNae’s children), Scott and Kylan and Mae and I. 
It was nice but I didn’t feel very good.  When we got home I changed into my
pajamas and did my journal before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
shortly after mid-night.  I was up for a little while and then laid in the
recliner.  I soon went to sleep and slept the rest of the night.  It was after
7AM when I woke and got up.  I hurried and showered and got ready for
meetings.  I went over to the church to help set up chairs but they were
already set up, probably done last night after the Ward Christmas Party.  I
quickly returned home and fed the rabbits.  When Mae got ready we went to our
meetings.  I didn’t feel the best during our meetings due to a cold and my back
hurt.  I fed my rabbits again when we got home.  Bob and Carroll invited us up
for dinner.  Bob made a very nice dinner of deep beep fried chicken.  After
eating I came down stairs and set in the recliner and soon went to sleep.  Mae
stayed up and visited with Bob and Carroll.  She came down after I woke.  I
went out and checked on the rabbits, feeding them more.  We watched a Christmas
show on Hall Mark.  I checked on the e-mail to be sure that I wasn’t awarded
any field trips this next week.  I have tried to reach Dale Evans to see if he
would cover next weeks bus runs but he hasn’t replied to my phone messages.  It
looks like I will have to make the runs on Monday and Tuesday.  Mae called her
Aunt and visited with her for a while.  I filled out my journal and then at 6PM
we watched the 1<sup>st</sup> Presidency’s Christmas Devotional.  After the
devotional we got on the chee machine and while doing that we listened to a
talk given by Elder Nelson.  I was very tired and went to bed.  Mae stayed up
and worked on e-mails and studied about depression, trying to under stand what
Jeff is going through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
1:01AM and got up for a few minutes.  I couldn’t get back to sleep so set in
the recliner.  There I slept off and on through the rest of the night.  I got
up at 4:30AM so I could make a bus run.  It snowed lightly today so it was to
cold to have done anything outside.  I guess it was a good day to have the bus
runs.  When I came home after the morning run, I slept for about 1 ½ hrs.  I
then took a shower and shaved.  Mae tended Connor today for David and Shauna. 
When David brought Conner down, he told Mae that he had a talk with Jeff and
found out that Jeff and Gail are going to get a divorce.  Jeff is then planning
to take a couple of months off and try to get back to his self.  Jeff told
David that his Bosses in the company has visited with him and expressed there
disappointment in his leaving and are willing to have him return if he wants
and are willing to give him good recommendations if that is the way he would
like it.  Jeff said that there might also be other possibilities with the
company and a division in Mexico.  Jeff also told David that he isn’t going to
end his life.  That is the best news that we have heard for some time.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I made my
afternoon runs and then filled my pickup with natural gas before coming home. 
Mae had dinner about ready so we hurried and put up some Christmas light
outside.  While Mae finished getting dinner ready, I installed a door bell for
us.  I filled out my journal entry and then we watched a DVD movie before going
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke after
mid-night and ended up in the recliner.  When the alarm went off Mae came in
and woke me with a kiss, on the forehead of course as I am still fighting a
cold.  My morning run went well and when I got home I had some breakfast, then
fed the rabbits and then came in and went to sleep.   Mae tended Benji and
Rachel for Gail and Jeff today as Gail had to work.  She enjoys spending
personal time with the children when she tends them.  While the children were
taking their naps Mae worked on the computer scanning pictures.  I made my
afternoon run but I wasn’t feeling the best when I got home.  This evening Mae
went to the Family History Center with out me as I wasn’t feeling very well.  I
watched a show on Hall Mark and then when Mae got home we watched a second
show.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept until
7AM and had just enough time to get ready, eat and go to a sub-bus drivers
round table.  Mae had invited Jeff and Scott over for dinner but Scott wasn’t
able to make it.  After eating Jeff wanted to help with the rabbit pen.  He
worked with Bob and I for a couple of hours before going back to work.  I didn’t
get the pens quite finished when it got too cold to work out side longer.  I
took a nap and then we ate dinner.  We went to Morgan where we attended a violin
recital in which Emily participated.  We enjoyed it and while there we saw the
Hawk’s who use to live in our Ward in Layton.  Their children have really grown
since the last we saw them.  We stopped and visited with David and his family
for a few minutes before coming on home.  Connor had to show us how he slides
down the stairs on his stomach, coming down feet first.  We got quite a laugh
out of that.  I filled in my journal and we went to bed about 10PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke a
couple of times and on the second time I came into the front room and lay in
the recliner.  Mae came in and woke me at 7:30AM.  After breakfast I worked on
the computer trying to get the slide scanner to work.  It’s not working for
me.  I worked on the rabbit pens again today.  Again it got to cold before I
was able to finish them.  I came in and changed clothes.  Scott came to get a
casserole that Mae had made for them.  He was supposed to bring the laundry
over but he forgot it this morning, when he left for work.  Scott tried to help
me get the slide scanner working but it still doesn’t work.  I will try to load
it on the desk top computer but Mae has gone Visiting Teaching and has some
other programs running on that computer.  I will have to wait until she
returns.  When Mae came home she fixed some super for us.  She had a second
visit later this evening.  I watched a Christmas snow on TV.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After some
breakfast I went outside and fed the rabbits.  I found that the black doe has a
litter of kits last night.  There was one kit out side the nest and had died
from exposure.  I haven’t counted the rest but could see movement under the
fur.  I worked all morning on the rabbit pen and got it finished about the time
Jeff came over.  Bruce had also stopped to see his parents.  He had taken
Micheline to the airport as she went to Arizona to visit her sister.  With Jeff
and Bruce’s help we moved the new pen to the west side of the yard and
positioned along the fence with the other pens.  We then moved the white kits
into the new pens.  This afternoon I started work on the snowmobile trailer. 
It was after 7PM when I finished up and went in.  I changed and Mae and I went
over to the High Priest social.  We didn’t go in time for dinner as there
wasn’t any thing that we could eat.  We did enjoy the program.  I was put on by
Cassie Gallegos and the Young Men President of the Mentally Handicap.  Cassie
sang and he narrated the program.  They also had one of the members bear his
testimony.  It was a very inspirational program and left us very humbled.  When
I got home and the cold had come out for the day of working out side, most of
my joints seem to hurt.   We had something to eat and because I had to stay up
for a while after eating we watched a movie on TV.  Mae kept busy preparing for
the “Grandma’s Christmas party”.  it was mid-night before we went to bed.</span></p>

8AM and started the day.  it was snowing so I took care of the rabbits and
finished putting tools away from yesterdays project.  Grand children came
shortly after 10AM.  When I finished outside I went in and tried to help Mae. 
She wanted me to print off some pictures of the children and I spent several
hours trying but became mostly frustrated.  It’s been a long day, so I took Mae
out to eat at Sizzler.  On the way home I drove over to Roy and we saw the
Christmas lights around the city offices.  We drove around several other
residential areas also and enjoyed the lighting.  I worked on my computer
removing the program for the 35 mm slide converter.  It won’t work on my laptop
and the images are very clear on our desk top.  We then took showers and went
to bed.</span></p>

5:45AM in order to get to Stake High Priest Quorum meeting.  Bob, Mark and I
road together in Bob’s car.  After the meeting Mark and I stayed and help put
up chairs for the block meeting but Bob went on home.  I walked home after
getting the chairs up.  When I got there I could see that some one had came to
our door.  Bob was in the house and asked where Mae was.  I walked to the
bedroom to see if she was there.  She wasn’t there so I tried to call her on
her phone but the phone was there in the house.  I looked at the cupboard to
see if there was a note there and there wasn’t.  My first thought was “Has
something happened to Jeff?”  Just then Mae came in from feeding the rabbits. 
It was a relief to see her.  We attended the regular block program and enjoyed
that.  Bob and Carroll invited us up for dinner.  Bob tries hard to prepare
food that we can eat.  I went out and fed and watered the rabbits and then came
in and laid my head on Mae’s lap and took a nap.  At 4PM Bob and I went Home
Teaching.  We were able to visit all of our families.  Scott and his family
came over and had dinner with Mae at 5PM.  I ate when I returned later.  It was
nice to visit with Scott and Mishelle and enjoy the children.  The twins are
growing so fast that it is surprising each time we see them.  I visited with
Bishop Knutson on the phone for a few minutes this evening.  I filled out my
journal entry and then we went to bed to watch a Christmas movie on DVD.  </span></p>

his car out of the garage so I could work on the trailer in there.  bob moved
it out and that is where I worked.  This afternoon Bob and I went over to check
on a insurance change in the house.  We also found that we are double covered
on our rental insurance so I dropped that coverage.  I worked until 7PM getting
the trailer finished.  When I came in we watched a show on TV and then went to
bed.  I was very tired and hurt in most of my joints.  </span></p>

think I was depressed but there was a lot of hart ache that I felt.  When Mae
got up I suggested that we got to the Temple.  I fed the rabbits and cleaned of
the side walk while Mae went to the hospital for a blood test.  I came in and
showered and we went to the Ogden Temple.  When we left the Temple we went to
the Chuck-A-Rama and had lunch.  After eating we stopped at the health store
and bought several things.  We went to Scott’s to get some dirty clothes to do
up for them.  I shoveled their drive way and sidewalk off.  We went over to the
school and got Kylan and brought him home.  we got to see Scott for just a few
minutes.  It was fun to see the twins and hold them for a few minutes.  We went
over to Mervin’s and looked at some clothes.  We found a few items that we
bought for Mae and for a needy family on the Ward Christmas Tree.  We stopped
at Maddox’s Chicken and got some chicken to eat on the way home.  We had to
hurry to get to the Family History Center and then we were late.  I erased my
PAF file that I have been working on and started over again.  I am not sure
that I understand the purpose of having so many files but when I try to explain
my feelings to Mae it just causes problems.  I filled in my journal and we went
to bed.  Mae started some washing going for Scott and Mishelle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I never got
up until 8AM.  That put me behind on doing things.  I made the bed this
morning.  Mae made French toast for breakfast and then added a piece of toast
and two eggs for me.  Boy was I full.  Mae has been doing laundry for Mishell
most of the morning.  I loaded the snowmobiles onto the trailer.  Of course I
had to run them around for a few minutes before loading them.  Jeff came over
and ate lunch with us.  We enjoyed having him.  I went over to Bowmen &amp;
Kemp and bought some expanded metal to put on the ramp to the snowmobile
trailer.  I decided that I would like to go snowmobiling tomorrow.  I called
Jeff to see if there was any chance of him going, but he doesn’t feel that he
can.  I next called Bryce and he will go with me.  This evening Mae attended a
Relief Society program.  I down loaded pictures, from our computer to thumb
drives, to give to each of our children for Christmas.  While doing that I
watched a show on TV.  I filled out this journal entry and we went to bed after
10PM.  Well we changed our minds and I gave Mae a haircut as she will be
getting a perminate tomorrow.</span></p>

started the day.  Mae fixed breakfast, I fed the rabbits.  I then got things
ready to go snowmobiling with Bryce at 10AM.  We went up to Monte Kristo and
had a great day.  it was good to be with Bryce and just had fun.  There was
just enough snow to make it a good day.  The machines both ran well.  I talked
to Jeff after I let Bryce off.  He is quite sure that he will be transferred to
Greenville Ohio.  I sure hope that this will work out for both Jeff and Gail. 
I believe that for Jeff’s mental condition he has got to find a way out of his
present situation.  Mae got her hair done this afternoon and it looks very nice. 
We watched a Christmas movie on TV before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
a good time but the morning went fast.  The weather was quite bad and when we
left for Salt Lake the snow had made roads slippery.  We were to be at the
Jorden River Temple by 1:30PM but it was 2PM when I let Mae off at the front
doors.  I then parked the pickup in the west parking lot as we had brought the
snowmobiles with us.  I thought that Mae could probably make it to the Sealing
ceremony but doubted that I could.  When I checked in at the front desk I asked
them the time and it was after 2PM.  I said that I had probably missed a
wedding ceremony and would just have to wait.  After checking my recommend the
Brother told me to check with the Sisters in the next room.  They rushed me to
hang up my coat and remove my shoes and I was taken up to the Sealing room. 
There was one other husband that was a couple of minutes later than I.  the
Sealer gave some very appropriate advise and council before Ceiling Kristy Lynn
Tew and ________ as husband and wife for time and all eternity.  Even though it
was snowing outside there was still some pictures taken afterwards.  From the
Temple we went to a church house on Redwood Road and 125<sup>th</sup> South
where we enjoyed a Wedding Lunching.  Mae and I decided not to stay in Salt
Lake for the reception but we drove out to Sandi and Nick’s where we stayed the
night.  The road going up to their house was snow packed and as I started up it
a car in front of us stopped and blocked the road.  When I stopped I was stuck
and had to put the tire chains on to go again.  We enjoyed the evening with
Sandi and Nick.  We played a game of Marbles as we watched a Christmas show.  I
am not quite shore how but Nick and I won by one play.</span></p>

and then got up and prepared breakfast of biscuits and gravy along with eggs. 
JaNae and Brad along with their children came, as well as Chelci, Steve and Nathan. 
It was a enjoyable morning.  Mike and his family came after noon.  I took Page
and David out on the snowmobiles and taught them how to drive them.  I then let
them drive around by them self for a while.  Jeff came out later and I took him
out, pulling him on his snow board.  He did very well and really enjoyed it. 
About 5PM we had a family dinner.  By then David and his family had arrived. 
After eating we had a Christmas program.  Sandi had asked that we center the
program around the Nativity.  Various members of the family took parts of those
that were involved in the Birth of Christ and told of their view points
surrounding the great event, while others participated with songs and musical
numbers.  It really turned out very well and was a much more spiritual program
than when we had just gave the Nativity story from the Bible.  About 8PM Santa
Claus came and gave out gifts to all the family.  We had a great day being
together as a family.</span></p>

this morning.  Mae and I prepared breakfast while Sandi was preparing her
lesson for YW that she will teach today.  After breakfast Jeff and I were going
to load the snowmobiles on to the trailer.  When we started them up we decided
to go for a short ride.  It ended up that when we were told the canon gate, we
thought was closed, is opened to snowmobiles and four wheelers.  We started up
the canon and ended up going to the top.  We didn’t realize how long we had
been and when we got back to the house we found out that Mae and Sandi had
already gone to church.  We packed the pickup and then Jeff left to go home.  I
put a sweet potatoes and some squash in to bake.  I set down to read but soon
fell asleep.  Mae and Sandi came home just as some of Sandi’s friends came to
wish her a Merry Christmas.  Before they left Home Teachers came.  We ate after
they left and then Mae and I left for home.  We stopped at Gail’s Mother’s
home.  Jeff was there and we played a table game with Gail’s family.  We took
Jeff home after the game and then came on home.  It’s been a long day.</span></p>

but couldn’t.  I finally got up and work on the computer.  I got some of my
journal caught up and tried to get the slide scanner to work.  I contacted the
VuPoint Company and found out how to get the slides to transfer to JPG images
instead of TIF images.  The transfer is some better but still not as clear as
the slides.  Mae tended David and Shauna’s children today.  I had them go out
with me to care for the rabbits.  Mae and I took them to the park where we
played on the hill.  I am amazed at how well all of them can slide on the sky
board.  I tried and fell twice before reaching the bottom of a small hill.  I
cleared the drive and walks twice today of snow.  I also put chains on the
pickup and got it out of the back yard where I left it last night.  This
evening after dinner Mae and I relaxed and watched a movie.</span></p>

snow blower and went to the church and cleaned the sidewalks there.  Today is
the first day that the High Priest are responsible to clean the walks.  Bishop
Knutsen also came over and shoveled the steps and small side walks.  After
lunch I ran several errorns.  Scott brought Kylan and Ashley over and Mae took
them across the street to the park and let them slay ride on the hills.  She
also went down a couple of times with them.  When I got back home we ate some
dinner and then took the children into Ogden to see the Christmas lights at the
musicale park.  We also drove around the Roy City park to show them the tree
lights there.  We stopped at McDonald’s and bought them a hamburger and French
fries before taking them home.  We stopped and visited with Scott and Mishelle
for a few minutes and then came home and watched the movie “A Christmas
Carroll” before going to bed.</span></p>

up until 8AM.  Mae had got up a few minutes earlier.  Just before we were ready
to eat breakfast Bob asked it I could come up as a lady from the loan co. had
some mortgage papers for them to sign on the new house loan.  They will get
another $27,000 on a reverse mortgage loan.  That should give us plenty to
remodel the deck into a sunroom.  Mae has been busy getting things ready to go
to David and Shauna’s this evening and then to Scott’s, Jeff’s and Mike’s
tomorrow.  It was just after 3PM when we put things in the car and left for
David’s.  We enjoyed the evening at Dave and Shauna’s.  Jeff also came up this
evening.  For dinner this evening we fondue chicken, beef and shrimp.  Shauna
also had made up some vegetables that she had steamed and seasoned.  It was a
very good meal.  About 9PM David had the children go to bed and then we started
getting the Christmas gifts out and Shauna arranged them around the tree.  It
was after 11PM when Mae and I went to bed.  Jeff stayed up working on a letter
to Gail as a Christmas gift.  It really seems strange to see how those two act
when we know that they are separating.  </span></p>

stairs to the bathroom there but she slipped part way down the stairs and slid
on down to the main floor.  We were afraid that she may have broken something
or seriously hurt her, but other than being a little stiff she seems to be ok. 
We had an enjoyable time exchanging gifts and after that Shauna and Mae
prepared a nice breakfast.  David and I cleaned the snow from the driveway
before breakfast.  Jeff left after breakfast so he could spend Christmas day
with his family.  Mae and I left around 10AM and came home.  I checked the
rabbits and found that one of the new kits had jumped out of the nest but was
ok when I put him back.  We took gifts over to Gail, Benji and Rachael and
stayed and visited for a little while.  Scott called us and said that Kylan had
woke at 2AM sick to his stomas and had been sick the rest of the morning.  We
went over to their place, just long enough to leave them their gifts but Mae
didn’t even go into the house.  We then drove to Mike and Becky’s where we
spent the rest of the day.  Mike and Becky had prepared a nice evening dinner. 
We played some games before going to bed.  Page slept on the couch and let Mae
and I have her room.</span></p>

slept in until about 8AM.  Mike had got up a little earlier and was out
cleaning side walks and driveways from the snow that fell last night.  He sure
enjoys the snow blower that I gave him last year.  Mae and I took showers
before breakfast.  It was a relaxing day with Mike and Becky.  In as much as
Mattie and Jessie did not get to come to Grandma’s Grandchildren Christmas
party Mae brought games, fish pond items and prizes and had a party with Mattie
and Jessie.  They got a Wii for Christmas and all the family seems to really enjoy
it.  Mike even got Mae and I playing it for a few minutes.  Mike, Becky, Mae
and I went shopping at Cosco where we bought a few things.  It is surprising
how fast a few things can add up to over $200.  It was about 4:20 PM when Mae
and I left Mike’s.  We went to the Chuck-A-Rama on 6900 S and South State
Street where we med and had dinner with Sandi and Nick.  We brought Sandi’s
dog, Pairs, home with us as Sandi and Nick are going to meet Shellie and Roy in
Sadona, Arizona and spend 3 or 4 days there.  I unpacked the car as Mae put
things away.  I checked on the rabbits and changed their water bottles, the
other ones were frozen.  I caught my journal up while Mae finished straitening
things up.  We went to bed around 10 or 10:30PM.</span></p>

Mae’s back is hurting her so we lay in bed for a little while.  After breakfast
I fed my rabbits, shoveled the walks, went to the church and checked to see if
the walks there were clear, trimmed Mae’s rose bush down and repaired the snow
blower.  It took me over an hour to unthaw the lock on my tool trailer before I
could repair the snow blower.  After lunch I took a hour nap.  Mae and I then
went to Penny’s to exchange the gifts that Bob and Carroll had given us.  I got
a shirt and tie, the tie is great but the shirt is too small.  Mae was given a
blouse but the blouse was too large.  We were able to exchange then for the
correct sizes.  While there we bought me a new pair of winter gloves.  We also
bought some gifts for Mae’s Birthday which is tomorrow.  I got her two blouses
and a pair of slacks.  We went over to Scott and Mishelle’s but they weren’t
home.  We contacted them on their cel phone and they said that they would soon
be home.  We went to the Little Orient to eat but while there, Scott called and
asked us to order them some take out and asked if we could get out order on
take out and eat with them.  We did and it was a very enjoyable dinner at Scott
and Mishelle’s.  Scott showed me his model airplane that he and Kylan got for
Christmas.  We enjoyed holding the twins for a few minutes.  Mae’s back is
hurting her quite a bit tonight.  We came home and I took care of my rabbits. 
I then filled in my journal before we got ready and went to bed.  While I was
filling in my journal, Mae got on the e-mail and read a wonderful letter from
Garrett.  He is sure enjoying his mission calling.</span></p>

snow last night I went back to bed for a little while.  I fed my rabbits and
then went to the church to set up chairs.  This will be the last time this year
that we will have to do that as next week we change to the 11AM schedule.  When
I came back Mae had a little breakfast ready.  Bryce called while I was eating
and talked for a while.  That made us late for church.  Bob and Carroll invited
us for dinner with them.  I took a nap after we came back down stairs.  I got
on the computer and tried to clear up a picture of Maria Wood Robinson for
Mae.  I then checked on my rabbits and took out the garbage to the curb for pickup
tomorrow.  Mae fixed us a light meal and then we went to bed and watched a DVD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After a
normal morning and getting my rabbits taken care of I repaired the ramp to the
snowmobile trailer.  I added 12 inches of pressed metal to each side of the
ramp so that the skis would not go through the ramp cross bars.  When I took
the one snowmobile off the trailer and put it back on I saw that the right ski
was broken. Bob came down and asked if we wanted to bring one of their
recliners down stairs and use it instead of buying a new one.  We did that and
then took the old one to the D.I. this afternoon.   After lunch I took the
snowmobiles with me and stopped at Dick’s.  I had them look at it and he said
that the ski broke due to age and sun rot.  I ordered a new set of skis.  I
then went to the D.I. and then over to Home Depot and got the material to
remodel the closet in our front bedroom.  On the way home I filled the truck
and both snowmobiles up with gas.  Mae had things ready to take dinner to
Jeff’s and eat with him.  We played games after eating.  Before we came home I
helped Jeff with some caulking around his cabinets.  Jeff is really struggling
with life and I feel so bad that I can’t do more to help him.  After we got
home we decided that we would watch a DVD movie “Rooster Cogburn and the Lady”
staring John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn.  It was after 1AM when we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae had been
busy all day with house work and washing clothes.  She also went over to Dr.

fall down David’s stairs but I guess it will just take a little time to get
over the bruses.</span></p>

10AM before we ate breakfast.  I took care of the rabbits and then started on
the remodeling of the closet in the front bedroom.  I also put some coat
hangers in the storage room to hang our coats on.  I did take a short nap after
lunch.  It was after 7PM when I cleaned up my tools for the night.  Mae has
been busy with house work and entering our receipts into quicken.  I did call
PraxAir to check on a bill that the insurance co. is not paying.  They sent the

K-Mart in Bountiful, where she met with Sandi.  She took Paris back to Sandi
and then the two of them visited for a while.  I worked on the closet in the
front bedroom until it was time to get ready to go to Irven’s.  I hurried and
fed my rabbits.  Mae got things ready to go while I changed clothes.  Bob,
Carroll, Mark, Mae and I went over to Irven and Sandy’s, where we ate a nice
dinner and then played games.  After eating we played a game.  Bob, Carroll and
Mark then went home.  The rest of played a game of Harts.  Just before
mid-night we went downstairs and watched the New Year come in.  We gave up on
the game and let Mae be the winner.  It was a fun evening but we still remember
the Dances that we used to attend on New Years Eve and still miss those.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I thought I
might write a little summery of 2008 before finishing this month’s journal. 
This past year has gone by fast as they all seem to be doing as we grow older. 
I remember asking Dad Jensen if time just kept moving faster, to which he
answered that it did.  Then he had his stroke and one day when we were visiting
he called me to his side and asked if I remembered asking him about time.  I
told him that I did and he said, “Well it does continue to go faster as one
gets older, until it stops and then you will wish that it would speed up again”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This year has
had many experiences both good and bad.  We have now been home from our mission
almost four years.  Except for the death of our Son-In-Law Terry, those days
were just great.  The greatest sorrow since returning home is to find out that
two of our sons have lost their testimonies of the truthfulness of the Gospel
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  That has weighed very heavy on both Mae
and I.  Many, many prayers and tears have been shed over that and we are still
very concerned about that.  This summer Jeff has become so discouraged with
life that he tried to end it.  We feel that divine intervention stopped the
success of that decision.  He and Gail are now separated and Jeff put in for a
transfer, with the company that he works for, and will go to Greenville Ohio in
January.  We will miss him but feel that this is the best decision for now.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Another trial
this year has been with my health.  The last of July and the first of August, I
begin to have great pain and discomfort in my body and especially in my legs. 
For almost 20 years I have had a health issue that I have been able to control
through diet.  When ever I have started in pain I could think of what I have
been eating that I shouldn’t and make adjustments.  With this, I just couldn’t
think of what I was eating that would be the cause of the pain.  The pain
became so intense that I started using crouches to walk with to relieve
discomfort.  I finally made an appointment with Nancy Litchford and went into
her.  She and Fran Morris have teemed up together and visit with people at the
Harvest Moon Health store.  When we went in and talked to Nancy she first asked
me what I was eating that I had not been eating before.  Mae and I have been
taking a 8 oz. glass of water with a teaspoon of non-processed honey, a
teaspoon of apple cider vinegar (with Mother) and three shakes of cayenne
pepper, each morning.  This is a remedy recommended by Uncle Wayne to keep
healthy.  During the 10 months that we have taken this remedy we have not had
so much as the sniffles.  When we told Nancy this, she just looked at me and
said “da, Ken.  You know that your body will not tolerate that kind of sugar
intake. The honey has been building up in your body over those 10 months, plus
the vinegar is a by-product of yeast.”  Mae’s health had also been
deteriorating, she has yeast overgrowth too, so we are both back on my very
strict diet.  The main problem is that we are people persons and it is
difficult to be with others and have to explain our diet.  We do count it a
blessing that we can control our problems with diet.  We know several that are
having much greater problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                On the
brighter side of things, this year has brought us a new Grand-Daughter by Gail
and Jeff, named Rachel Lynn Browning, a Great-Grand-Daughter by JaNae and Brad
name of Emma Jean Caries and Mishelle and Scott blessed us with twin
Grand-Children, a boy named Kaden and a girl named Kaitlyn Browning.  I had the
privilege of blessing Rachel and Emma Jean.  The twins have not been blessed
yet.  That now brings our family to 6 children, 19 Grand-Children and 5
Great-Grand-Children.  We feel that they are all GREAT!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                In February
we took a short vacation with Sandi and Nike to the Trail Creek Lodge in Soda
Springs, Idaho snowmobiling.  We enjoyed it so much that we have planned on doing
it again in 2009.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                In April, Kip
Michalles gave me a buck and a doe and that got me into the rabbit raising
business.  So far we have put out quite a lot of money and time with very
little return.  We hope that next year works out better.  We are also thinking
of raising chickens and hope that the out lay is not too great.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did take
several fishing trips this year.  Our snowmobiles have been fun but they are expensive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We took a
trip to Zion National Park with Jeff, Gail and the children that was sure fun. 
We also took a trip to Flaming Gorge with Nick and Sandi.  All my children had
gone together and bought me a guided fishing tour on Flaming Gorge.  Nick also
purchased one for him self.  It was a good experience but I only had one strike
and missed and Nick caught three beautiful fish.  The other disappointment was
that the guide made us sign a form stating that we would release all the fish. 
We just got to take pictures and then kiss them goodbye.  It was a fun trip and
we saw some beautiful country.</span></p>
