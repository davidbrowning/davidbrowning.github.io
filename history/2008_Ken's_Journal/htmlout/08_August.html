<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up for
a few minutes and read my scriptures.  Mae then got up and I went back to bed
and slept until 9:30AM.  Mae had breakfast ready when I got up.  Bob had moved
the lawns and Mae had trimmed about half of the yard.  I was hurting so I took
a pain pill and it really helped me.  After breakfast I started work on Bob and
Carroll’s micro-wave oven and then reinstalled the cabinet above the desk.  I
didn’t work very fast but got it done.  This evening we watched a couple of
shows on TV while Mae did some ironing.  I then did some work on my history and
after having Mae do some editing for me sent another couple of stories to my
family.  It was almost mid-night when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, August 02, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke with quite
a bit of pain.  Today the pain pill did not do much for me.  I took care of my
rabbits and got some things ready for our trip on Monday.  We attended the
Baptismal service for Kylan Scott Browning at 2PM.  I was asked to give the
invocation and Mae was asked to give a talk.  It was also an honor to be a
witness of my Grandson’s Baptism.  Scott performed the ordinance and also
Confirmed Kylan a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder Day Saints.  Mishelle
had done a lot of preparation for this event.  They held a lunching after the
services and Mishelle had again decorated the table and gone to a lot of effort
to make today special for Kylan.  I couldn’t help comparing these preparations
to the day that I was baptized.  It was two or three months my Birthday that I
was Baptized as it was forgotten about.  My Primary teacher is the one that
arranged and took me to the Stake Center in Driggs where I was baptized with
several other youth.  None of my family attended and the next day Uncle Albert confirmed
me during Fast and Testimony meeting.  Again I do not remember of any of my
family being there.  I hope Kylan will remember this special day held for him. 
On the way home, Mae and I stopped at Irven and Sandy’s.  Mae went on to the
Store and I adjusted Irven and Sandy’s air conditioner.  After we got home I
started on the computer.  Bob called and said there was a good movie on
channel, “Princes Dearia”.   We just started watching it when Irven and Sandy
came over.  Sandy wanted to talk to me about building a new snowie cart, for
them.  I told her it first depended on my health and then we could look at it. 
I did watch the show and talked to her during the commercials.  After the show,
I worked on this journal entry while Mae did more preparations for tomorrow and
Monday.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t feel
very good this morning but we got up and left for Stockton shortly after 9AM. 
Mae went out and fed my rabbits this morning.  We stopped at Scott’s and had
Kylan and Ashley ride with us.  We were early so it gave us time to speak to
Bishop Hogan before the meeting.  It was a special privilege to bless Emma
Jean.  During the Testimony portion both Mae and I bore our testimonies.  After
meeting we went to JaNae and Brad’s where we had lunch and visited.  After
everyone else left Mae and I went for a ride with Brad.  He took us around the
area and showed us a lot that he wants to buy if he can sell his house.  It
would put him a little higher on the hill and he wants to build a little
different home.  I think we were both tired when we got home.  I know that I
was.  Mae got us something to eat and then got some things ready for tomorrow. 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We set the
alarm for 6AM but had a hard time getting up.  I think if Mae had not made the
bed I would have gone back to bed.  After breakfast we started packing for the
trip.  Mark gave me a hand outside with the trailers and packing things out. 
That sure helped me.  I don’t think I am in quite as much pain to day as I have
been.  It was after noon when we got away from the house.  We stopped at a
Sub-Way and got Mae a sandwich and me a salad.  We had to get natural gas and
then we went over to Sportsman Warehouse and bought some boots for Mae to use
if we use the float tubs.  We had to detour through South Weber due to road
construction on Riverdale.  It was 2PM when we actually got on the road.  We
stopped in Evanston and filled with natural gas there.  It was 6PM when we got
to the camp at Flaming Gorge.  We realized that we had forgotten some items so
I called Bob and had him get them for us and put them with our boat so when
Sandi and Nick got the boat they would bring those items also.  We got the tent
trailer fairly well set up and organized this evening.  The batteries, on the
trailer, were low so we had to run the generator.  Maybe they are getting old. 
I filled in today’s journal entry and worked a little on my personal history
before we turned the generator of and went to bed.  We set out and watched the
stars for a while but were so tired it was hard to get up and go in to bed. 
The temperature was very mild and easy to sleep with out covers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, August 05, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                During the
night the temperature dropped and we had to cover up a little.  We woke about
6AM and soon got up.  I went to the showers and not only showered but washed
the jump suite that I wore yesterday.  Mae had forgotten to bring me very many
changes.  Sandi and Nick didn’t get here until later so about 10:30AM we ate
breakfast and then cleaned up.  Mae is reading her scriptures now so I am
working on the computer for a while.  After Sandi and Nick got settled we
played the game of Mexican Dominoes and Mae won that.   This afternoon we went
out fishing but only caught one fish and Sandi caught it.  It was quite small
so she let it loose.  Before going to bed we played a game of Marbles, and Nick
and I won.  This broke a three game loosing series.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, August 06, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I set the
alarm to wake at 4AM but then after I had shut it off, I was not sure if it had
gone of or if I had been dreaming that it went of.  When I got outside to and
turned on the flash light on it was only 3:15PM.  I had woke with a dream.  I
did go back to sleep for a hour.  Nick and I left to go fishing at 6:15AM and
it took us about 1 ½ hours to get to Lucerne Valley Marina.  We fished until
after noon and caught only one fish each.  We looked into moving our camp sight
to the Lucerne area but we didn’t like the campground.  When we got back to our
camp it was raining.  We set up a shelter over the fire pit and with charcoal
briquettes I cooked a Dutch oven dinner of vegetables and rabbit.  It turned
out well.  Nick, Sandi, Mae and I played a came of marbles and this time Nick
and I won.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, August 07, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Nick and I
had to be at the Marina outside of Manila by 6:30 AM, so we had to get up
early.  We met Jim Williams there and he was our guide for a fishing trip to
fish for lake trout.  He furnished all the equipment and took us out.  This was
my Christmas gift form my family this last Christmas.  Jim instructed us on how
to stand, how to hold the pole and what to look for in a strike.  Jim had the
equipment and know just how to use it.  Jim said that we would fish the Lusern
Bay and when we got to the area that he selected, Jim searched for the fish
using a sonar fish finder.  He started out with Jigging with a white rabbit
skin lour.  By watching the sonar, Jim could see our lour drop and would tell
us when to stop the drop and then we would slowly and evenly reel back up.  We
had fished for a couple of hours before Nick caught the first fish.  A while
later with out any strikes Jim had us switch techniques and we drug a lour on
the bottom of the lake.  Nick caught a fish on that technique and I had one
hit.  About 12:30 we switched back to jigging and about 1PM Nick caught a third
fish.  We fished until 2PM and quite.  I was very disappointed that I didn’t
catch anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When we got
back to camp it was raining.  We set up a canopy over the fire pit and Dutch
oven some chicken and rabbit along with lots of vegetables.  I also wrapped
some sweet potatoes in tin foil with butter and seasoning and cooked them on
the top of the Dutch oven.  It was very good.  We played games before going to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After breakfast
this morning we took the boat out for a ride and then did some fishing.  We caught
a few fish, let one loose and lost one large one when it tangled in the down
rigger cable.  We anchored the boat for a while and Mae and Sandy went in
swimming.  Mae didn’t bring my swimming suite because last night I said that I
didn’t think we would want to swim with it being so rainy.  However this
morning was quite hot, so swimming felt good.  I finally went in skinny dipping
on the opposite side of the boat.  After cooling off we went back to camp and
started packing.  The weather changed and it started raining shortly after we
got back.  We flayed and cooked the fish and ate and finished packing in the
rain.  We left about 3:30PM but stopped for gas and gifts before going on
home.  We stopped in Evanston for gas and something to eat before going on
home.  it was after 10PM when we got home.  Nick and Sandi arrived there before
we did because I had to stop for natural gas.  When Nick tried to get the boat
through the gate it was on to much of an angle so he didn’t dare to go futher
so waited for me to get there.  it was probably 10:30PM before Nick and Sandi
left for home.  Nick has to leave for work by 3AM.  It was a late night before
we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 5AM
and couldn’t go back to so when Mae got up at 8AM she had me lay back down.  I
slept for a little while.  We spent the day unpacking from our Flaming gorge
trip and repacking for our trip to Arizona.  Bob help me unpack and put away
camping items, the boat and the camp trailer.  We had to set up the trailer and
let it dry out before putting it away.  I caught my journal up this evening and
then we went to the store for toiletries to travel with.  Mae gave me a hair
cut and I showered before we went to bed.  We had planned on going to bed about
8PM but it was after 11PM before we made it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4:15AM in order to be ready to leave by 6AM.  Bob drove us to the airport.  We
used the curbside check-in so we were able to walk straight down to the gate
area with a stop at security.  That went ok but it still bothers me that we are
loosing our freedoms because or government’s incapability’s.  We flew with
Delta flight 4005 leaving SLC at 8:39AM and arriving at Phoenix shortly after
9AM.  Shellie was there to pick us up and take us to their place.  I lay down
in the recliner and soon went to sleep.  Mae woke me for breakfast.  We then
attended Church in their new Ward.  It was just divided last week so there was
very few positions that were staffed.  Temporary instructors had been asked to
fill in and the Block went well.  This afternoon we all went into the pool to
cool off.  The water was 92 degrees but just getting wet cooled us off.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and took a shower.  We didn’t get going until the boys had gone to school. 
Shellie had found weevil in many places in the house.  Shellie had been asked
to help with props for a youth program and she made some drums from some cans
and leather a Sister in the Ward had brought over to her.  The cans were in a
garbage bag when they were brought to Shellie and she just stored them in her
pantry.  The cans had not been cleaned out properly and Shellie found that they
had weevil in them and it spread through out her pantry and were spreading into
the house.  We spent most of the day helping to clean out the pantry and wipe
down every shelf.  We went through all the storage and discarded those items that
were infected with weevil and cleaned the rest.  Shellie was informed that
Windex glass cleaner would kill the weevil so we wiped everything down with
Windex.  What a job!  Mae and I took time to go grocery shopping to get some
things for us to eat on out diet.  I did take a short nap this afternoon.  This
evening I put on the DVD with the story of “The Dairy of Ann Frank”.  It was a
story of some Jews that hid out in Holland during the 2<sup>nd</sup> World
War.  The remained hidden until a short time before the war ended but all of
them except one was killed or died in German prison camps before the war ended.
 I played six games of solitary on the computer before I quite to get ready for
bed.  The reason for so many was that the first five beat me before I really
got started.  We were late getting to bed.  My feet and legs are hurting quite
a bit today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6 and was up for a while reading my scriptures.  I went back to bed and slept
for more than a hour.  Shellie is still cleaning to get rid of the weevil.  Mae
is baking cookies for Garrett’s open house this weekend.  I did some planning
to build some scenery frames for Shellie.  I then worked on my computer for a
while.  Mae and Shellie went shopping so while they were gone I watch the movie
“House Boat” with Gary Grant and Sophia Loren.  We tried adding three blocks of
ice to the pool to cool it off a little and I think it did help some.  We swam
and relaxed in the pool before dinner.  Roy grilled salmon while Shellie and
Mae prepared the trimmings.  We ate out by the pool and enjoyed a nice
evening.  After dinner I played a game of solitary on the computer and then
Shellie, Jase and I played a fishing game before Jase went to bed.  Shellie,
Roy, Mae and I watched the House Boat before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6AM and read for a while before taking a shower.  I then lay back down
and went to sleep until 10:45 when Mae woke me for some breakfast.  My feet are
hurting quite a bit today.  I have a hard time not becoming discouraged.  I
tried to save some rice but as I got into the sack I found more weevils.  We
have sure discarded a loot of food trying to get ride of the weevil.  I drove
down to a church and checked the doors to see the maximum size we can make the
backdrop for Shellie.  Roy bought the materials to build the frames to hold
Shellie’s backdrop, so I have worked on that today.  This evening we also watch
the movie “Support Your Local Sheriff”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
earlier this morning so that we could take the scenery over to the Stake Center
and set it up.  We were over there until lunch time so on the way home we
stopped at Sub-Way and ate lunch.  I took a nap this afternoon.  Mae and
Shellie baked more cookies for the open house.  After dinner this evening Garrett,
Roy and Shellie had appointments to meet with their Bishop.  The Bishop just
wanted to have one last interview with Garrett but for Shellie he called her to
be a teacher in the Relief Society.  Shellie was pleased with that calling.  We
read scriptures with the family and then Shellie had them all go to bed. 
Shellie and I vent out side and had a game of chess with their large set.  It
made it quite interesting to walk around on the board.  The game was quite
intense but in the end I won.  When we came in Roy and Mae were watching a show
on TV so I set down to watch the end of it with them.  Garrett then came home
with friends so we turned it off and when to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6 AM and after reading my scriptures, I showered and shaved and then went back
to bed for an hour.  Shellie is very concerned about the weevil that is in her
house.  She has cleaned and thrown out a lot of product that still has weevil
in it.  I did some checking about the control of the weevil and found that heat
and freezing of product does little to clean up the problem.  I got on the
inter-net and found some products that are made to control weevil but before I
ordered them the Exterminator that Shellie has contracted for pest control came
and he feels that he can control them.  I am glad that I didn’t place the order
but I did print some information that I gave to Shellie so that if this company
doesn’t control them she can look at a second product.  Mae and I played a game
of Rummy and Mae won.  I watched a DVD that I had seen before.  Mae took Kevis
over to spend some time with him.  Mae fixed the items for a chef salad and I
bought a couple of pizzas for dinner.  Shellie, Kevis, Mae and I played a game
after we ate dinner.  I gave Mae a hair cut this afternoon.  Mae and I went
swimming before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This morning
when I woke I was in general pain.  It is not an unlivable pain but very
uncomfortable.  Shellie found lots more weevils in the house this morning.  It
is really upsetting to her.  I spent sometime on the internet trying to find a
solution for the problem.  Being that I am not aquatinted with the business in
Arizona I tried to call Steve Regan Company in Salt Lake but they are closed on
Saturdays.  I next tried to call Wade Bitner but his phone has been temporarily
disconnected.  I then called Vern Pankratz but he was out so he called me back
in a few minutes.  It was good to talk to him.  He told me that Wade and his
wife are in Nauvoo on a mission.  He did not have a suggestion to solve the
weevil problem but he said that he would try to contact someone else and then
would get back to me.  I called Bob to give him our airline flight information
for Monday.  He said that I can not leave the house again.  His garage door is
not working and the hot water heater went out the other day and he had to pay
some one to install a new one.  Shellie and I went to Costco this afternoon for
some groceries.  On the way we stopped at a Bug &amp; Weed store and bought
some spray that should kill the weevil.  When we got home Shellie started
packing everything in the pantries and moving it out.  Mae and I helped her. 
We then sprayed around all the base boards and all the shelves in the
pantries.  We finished about the time we had to leave for the plays that Quint
and Kevis were involved with all day.  The sound system was very poor and so we
really didn’t enjoy the plays.  Mae and I brought the boys home while Roy and
Shellie stayed to help remove the props.  When we got home we opened all the
windows and turned on the ceiling fans to air the house out from the bug bombs
that was set in the house.  When we got home Mae and the boys started putting
things away.  I set down for a minute and the next thing I know Mae was getting
me to go to bed.  Mae didn’t come to bed until 12:30AM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7:15AM and Shellie was already up and going.  As soon as I got showered and
dressed I went in and helped her.  After breakfast Mae and I helped her in food
preparation.  Roy seems to have other things to do over helping his wife, but
as David told me “Fathers never think there is a man good enough for his
daughters.  We left for church a little early so we could get a seat in the
front of the chapel.  Garrett gave a very good talk only he was cut a little
short on his time.  We enjoyed the meetings.  When we came home we started
right in to prepare for guest to come.  I am not sure that the open house is in
keeping with the instructions given to us by our Prophets.  We sure had a lot
of food prepared but we had a lot of people come to show support for Garrett
and Shellie and Roy.  At 8PM the Stake Presidency and the Bishop came to the
house.  The Stake President first had a final interview with Garrett.  He then
had a meeting with all the family.  He had Grandma Browning open the meeting
with prayer.  He then asked Grandpa Browning to bare his testimony, followed by
one of his counselors, their Bishop, then from Shellie and followed by Roy. 
The Stake President then had Garrett come forward and had his counselors, the
Bishop, Roy and I join him as he ordained Garrett an Elder called to serve in
the Kennewick Washington Mission.  I gave Garrett a very special blessing in
the prayer.  It was a very special evening.  After the Stake Presidency and
Bishop left we still had some food to put away.  It was late by the time we

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7AM and got our things packed up to go home.  After getting some
breakfast, Shellie drove us to the airport.  We flew Delta from Phoenix to Salt
Lake leaving at 12:40PM and Getting to S.L. about 3PM.  Bob and Carroll picked
us up at the S.L. Airport and brought us home.  It is sure nice to get home. 
The Comcast system is down and the repairman was to be here by 5PM but we
called at 6PM and he won’t make it until 7PM but it is now 7:30PM and no one has
come yet.  We watched a DVD on the Clergies as well as almost all our Founding
For Fathers and their belief in Jesus Christ.  About 8PM the repairman came a
repaired our Comcast connections.  It seems that some one had gone past the
power pole in the front of the house and cut the cable leading to the house. 
We finished watching our DVD and then went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I for up at
5:45AM and started getting ready to attend a In-service Training Class for the
School District that is mandatory for all School Bus Drivers to take on a
yearly basics.  It lasted all day.  When I got home Veldon and Patsy Seymore
had gotten to our place.  They were released form their Mission Service
yesterday and wanted to go with us to get Garrett form the Air Port.  Mae made
a nice salmon dinner this evening.  Veldon and I then went outside and got
their RV set up for tonight.  Veldon, Patsy, Mae and I drove to the S.L.
Airport and picked up Garrett at 8PM.  We brought him here at our place for the
evening and will take him to the M.T.C. tomorrow morning.  It was a good
evening visiting with Patsy and Veldon this evening.  We didn’t get to bed until
11PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had to get
going this morning so we could take Garrett to the MTC in Provo.   Mae and I
prepared breakfast of omelets and muffins.  We left shortly after 9 AM and got
to the MTC before 11AM.  I don’t know when Garrett had started this time of
reading the Book of Mormon but as we drove he was reading the last four pages
of it to finish his goal of reading the Bock of Mormon one more time before
entering the MTC.  I sure feel a great feeling of pride for this young man who
is prepared to serve our Lord.  We had time to take pictures before going in
for the orientation.  The meeting was special and at the conclusion it was both
joyous and sad to have Garrett leave.  I think he will sure be a great
missionary.  On the way home we stopped and had lunch at the Chuck-A-Rama in
Bountiful.  We then stopped at some friends of Patsy and Veldon’s that lived in
Kaysville.  When we got home Patsy and Veldon went to their motor home and took
a nap while Mae and I lay in our bed and took a nap.  This evening the four of
us played games, ate some salad for dinner and visited.  It was after mid-night
before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up until after 8AM but it felt good to sleep in.  I fed the rabbits and brought
the water bottles to wash them.  Bob and Mark helped me level the rabbit pens
and put them back against the fence to stop them from blowing over again.  Mae
fixed a nice breakfast for and we visited for a while with Veldon and Patsy
while we ate.  Veldon and I moved their RV over so I could get my boat out. 
They will leave the RV here for a day or two and just return here to sleep.  I
helped Bob set up his shad tents and figure what we need more for them.  He and
I took my boat down to Randy’s and left it there and then went to Nuts &amp;
Bolts and got some parts.  We also went over to the Chevron on 21<sup>st</sup>
street and filled my truck with natural gas.  Mae had gone Visiting Teaching
today.  When I got back we fixed some lunch and then I set in the chair and
took a nap.  Bob and I worked on his garage door opener but I think the opener
is broken.  This evening Mae and I watched a show on TV before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
3:15AM and was down to Randy’s about 5AM.  We went up to Strawberry reservoir
fishing.  Fishing was slow today and I caught three that were keepers and Randy
caught one that we kept.  David called me and asked how I was doing.  When I
told him that I was fishing he asked how it was and just then a fish hit so I
had to call him back.  I got a call form the bus shop asking if I could start
driving Monday and I said I could.  We left the reservoir at 1:30PM but due to
an accident on the highway and highway construction it took us about 45 minutes
to get to the summit.  That normally is less than a 10 minute drive.  We did
get down to the bus shop in time for me to get my route sheets.  I then stopped
and filled the truck and boat with gas before taking Randy home.  Veldon and
Patsy still have their RV in the driveway so I left my boat at Brother and
Sister Fallis’s, in their back yard.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  I
then took a shower and cleaned us while Mae cleaned up the dishes.  We then
watched a DVD before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were later
getting up.  We fixed some breakfast of baked fish and invited Patsy and Veldon
to eat wit us.  After breakfast I helped Veldon get his RV and car hooked up so
they could leave for home.  I had fed my rabbits before breakfast.  Mae left
for a wedding shower for Lindsey Tew.  I made some calls about the bus route
for Monday.  Bob asked if I could get our children’s addresses for Sherrie so
she could sent them wedding invitations.  I got those addresses from our
Christmas card list.  That way I could print them for them. Bob had me take he
and Carroll to Ogden to buy Cherrie a gas range for their wedding gift.  We
then took it down to Sherrie’s house and I helped install it.  I came home and
had just walked in the house when Sister Fallis called and said that they had a
secondary water line break and water was running into their basement.  I went
down to their place and showed them where to shut the water off.  They said
they could take care of it from there.  I went over to Best Buy in Riverdale
and bought a GPS system.  I then went over to the Clearfield Job Center to see
if I could find the bus I am to drive on Monday but the gates were closed and I
haven’t been given a gas card for it yet so I couldn’t get in.  I worked with
my GPS for a while trying to load my bus route but didn’t get it right so went
home and worked on it a while.  Mae came home and we ate some dinner.  We then
got ready and went to a Wedding reception for Rachel Stevenson.  It was a very
nice reception and we enjoyed visiting with several people that we know there. 
I filled in my journal and played some solitary on the computer before going to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
was at the Church at 8AM and helped set up chairs.  When I got home Mark was
trying to set the timer on the sprinkler system.  He is concerned because the
sprinklers get his car wet.  I don’t know how to help him but he was setting
the timer wrong.  Mae and I walked to meeting.  The meetings went well.  We had
some lunch and then I tried to set my GPS but only became frustrated.  I
finally went into Best Buy and got help.  When I got back home I worked with it
longer.  David and his family stopped by so David helped me for a while.  They
stayed and we enjoyed visiting for a while.  They left about shortly after
7PM.  Mae then went with me and we tried to drive the route.  The GPS didn’t
work very well and went off several times.  We finally put each address in
separately and made it through most of them but came up with some hard places
to get the bus into with out backing and that worries me.  One address we could
not find and another I think is a wrong address.  It was 10:45PM before I quite
and will have to check it out in the morning with Dispatch.  I just hope for
the best tomorrow. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up
shortly after 4AM so I could get to the bus shop.  The route went well although
we got lost on one stop.  In between morning run and the afternoon run I helped
Mae make tomato juice, ate lunch, fed the rabbits and took a 15 minute nap. 
The after noon run also went well with less confusion than this morning.  I
brought my boat back from the Fallis’s.  we watched a couple of shows o TV
before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae talked me
into sleeping in until 4:30AM this morning so I really had to hurry to get to
the bus this morning.  Of course I got reading my scriptures this morning and
didn’t realize the time going by.  Mae jumped up and fixed me some breakfast so
things worked out ok.  The bus run went very well this morning.  When I got
back to the bus lot I washed the bus and then went through the inside and
washed all the windows along with some other areas that really needed
cleaning.  My bus looks much better when I left.  When I got home Mae had
already fed my rabbits, so I just went out and checked them and gave them some
apples that had fallen from the trees.  I picked some vegetables from the
garden and came in and fried some summer squash for lunch.  After eating lunch
I took a nap for an hour.  Mae needed to take her pressure cookers to
Farmington to have them checked so she took me over to the bus compound.  She
then went on to Farmington and did the things that she wanted and then met me
back at the bus compound when I finished the route.  We got to the school in good
time but the one girl did not come out, nor was there a teacher out there.  My
assistant went into the school but could not find help.  We called into the
dispatch and they called the school and finally were told that the mother had
picked her up after school.  On a regular route we could have just left when
our time to leave was up but with Special Ed students you can’t do that.  We
lost over 20 minutes because of that.  Mae was waiting for me when I got back. 
We called Nancy and let her know that we would be late for our appointment. 
After I was checked by Fran I left and went to the Family History Center. 
However I didn’t get much done there because they couldn’t find their records
of us taking the Legacy class in April.  I went back and got Mae and we came on
home.  I studied the lesson out of the Ensign and Bob and I went Home
Teaching.  It was after 9PM when we got home.  I finished this journal and we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
4:15AM and had to hurry to be ready for my bus run.  I did get some reading
done before getting ready.  I am sure enjoying the study of the scriptures.  I
am continually amazed at the simplicity of the Gospel and the Plan of
Salvation.  It just makes common sense while nothing else holds water.  The runs
went well today.  I did get a short nap about noon but was awaken by a phone
call from the District asking me to come back down to get a retake of my
picture for my employee I.D. badge.  I went right down and was almost late
getting back for my afternoon run.  I came home right after finishing my run
and checking in with the shop on a couple of things.  I showered and got
dressed as did Mae so we could go into the Family History Center in Ogden and
this time was able to get the Legacy hand book.  We left there and went to the
Ogden Temple and went through the 7PM endowment session. Although I was tired I
really enjoyed the session.  I found my self meditating as to the purposes and
meanings of the ceremony and really appreciated that opportunity.  As we
prepared to leave the Temple I thought about my family and took the time to
enter each of them onto the prayer roll.  It was 9:30PM when we got home and
soon went to bed after filling out my journal entry for today.  As I lay down
again my mind went to my family.  Oh the concerns and worries and wonders if we
taught them right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4AM
still with concerns for each of our children and then to add to that I have one
student on the bus that I am afraid may be a problem.  How to handle it?  On
our rout this morning I took the time at the pickup of Matthew Williams to get
of the bus and visit with Matt.  I ask him; “Where does a 2,000 lb gorilla
sleep?”  When he didn’t know I replied; “Any where he wants.”  I then explained
that my job as a bus driver is to get the children to and from school safely. 
I explained the size of a school bus and the distance it takes to stop that bus
at 30 MPH.  Yesterday because he and Brandon was horse playing and I look in
the mirrors to see what was going on at the same time the traffic light changed
yellow, I had to apply the brakes hard to stop.  Then a second time I had to
call into the shop and while talking there, Pat my assistant said something to
me and between the two things at the same time, I stopped just a second short
of making a turn.  This made the turn much more difficult to complete the
turn.  I was trying to empress on him the need for the students to remain
reassembly orderly so that as the bus driver I could give my attention to
handling the bus.  Well that seemed to help going to school but this after noon
as we came into the bus loading lot we could see Matt hitting Brandon with his
book bag.  Pat called Matt down about doing that.  That seemed to set it off
and Matt became quite mouthy to everything Pat would say.  Pat finally asks me
to pull the bus over, which I did as soon as I could do so safely.  We had to
set there several minutes waiting for Matt to calm down.  At one point, Matt
slammed his fist into the window.  When things settled down somewhat, we
continued on.  When we got to the stop for Matt, Pat got of the bus and talked
to Matt’s Mother.  His mother recommended that we write Matt up and turn it
into the Principle.  Pat said that she would write it up this evening and I
could read and sign it in the morning.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae was gone
shopping, to a chiropractors appointment and to have her hair done, so she was
gone all afternoon and evening.  I spent a lot of time trying to get maps and
directions for my next weeks bus runs.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My assistant
Pam, didn’t get the incident report filled out and this morning Matt was very
humble so we will let it waite with just a verbal warning.  The run went well
as did the afternoon run.  I did take a nap when I got home.  I helped Mae put
up tomato juice before my afternoon run.  Mae was about ready when I got home
and we drove to Mike and Becky’s so that we can watch David play football this
evening.  Because we are over 65 years old we were able to get in the game free. 
David did get to play quite often but there are only three players that are not
seniors.  It was good to see him play but the team is not the best or at least
didn’t play well tonight.  I felt that the quarterback had very bad passing
ability with the exception of the one pass into the end zone and because of the
ability of the receiver American Fork made a touch down.  When we got back to
Mike’s home, Mike, Becky, Mae and I played a game of Rook.  Mike and I won that
game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 6 AM and came on home.  Mike got up early as he had to help his
Father-In-Law move a table.  Jeff and Gail brought their children over and Mae
tended them while Jeff and Gail did something together.  Jeff has been working
long hours for several days now so it gave them an out.  Rich and Lois came and
stayed with us today.  We sure enjoyed being with them.  This afternoon we
attended Sherry’s wedding.  It was nice and we just hope they will be able to
have a good marriage.  When we came back home Rich, Lois, Mae and I played more
Mormon Bridge.  We also played a game of Knock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
7AM and got up.  I went into the sunroom to read my scriptures and noticed that
the yard was a mess of broken branches and leaves.  The wind must have blown
quite hard last night.  I then noticed that the rabbit pens were blown over.  I
had to get Mark and Bob to give me a hand to tip them up again.  The rabbits
were ok.  Mae and I stayed home from church.  We cooked fish and eggs for
breakfast.  Bob prepared dinner for all of us at noon.  Rich, Lois, Mae and I
went to church at Devin and Betsy’s ward as their son Josh spoke prior to his
mission call and their daughter Deviny spoke at her return from Twang Mission. 
Both did very well but you can sure see the difference in a pre-missionary and
a returning missionary.  We came home and got a dinner ready for shortly after
we got home Scott’s family came over and a little later Jeff family came.  We
had them for dinner and sure enjoyed being together with them.  Scott went out
with me and we tied the rabbit pens to the fence to stop them from being blown
over again.  It rained the rest of the evening.  After eating we played a game
of Mormon Bridge before all our family went to their homes.  I loaned Jeff our
projector as he and Scott wanted to use it tonight.  Mae and I watched a DVD on
our TV in our bedroom before going to bed.</span></p>
