<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After we got
up I got on the computer and tried to enter my time.  I had to call Janet about
3 times to finally get it entered correctly.  I worked on the rabbit pens most
of the morning in Bob’s garage.  It was to cold to work outside on them.  It
snowed for a while this morning.  Mae went to the Family History Center in
Clearfield and worked on Brother Farr’s records.  At noon she and Georgia went
out to lunch.  I went in to work and drove a Special Ed. Bus this afternoon. 
We had planned on going to the Temple at 5PM but Bob and Carroll bought a new
love seat and I had to help get it in the house.  We made the later session so
was still able to go on one of our Stake assigned sessions.  We took Mark with
us this evening.  I was tired this evening but really don’t want to go to bed. 
I got to work at Bryce’s tomorrow so I had better get some rest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had planned
on going to Bryce and Deanna’s this morning but decided that I had to get the
rabbit pens finished.  I worked on them this morning and got the pens finished
except for putting on some roofing which I will do later.  With Mark’s help we
took the pens to the back and put the rabbits in them.  I ate dinner with Mae
and then went to Bryce’s and worked until late.  Even though it was late when I
got home we stayed up and watched a John Wayne movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t get
to Bryce’s until 11AM as I planned on some irrigation changes for the garden
and ordered the parts for Mark to pick up today.  The sheetrock mud wasn’t
completely dry so I worked on getting the back door installed and some
electrical rewired.  I came home and had to hurry to get ready for our evening
Stake Conference meeting.  After the meeting I took Mae out to eat at the Hello
China.  We came home and was going to watch a movie but I couldn’t get the
Comcast to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went out
and feed the rabbits and then came in and prepared breakfast of French toast. 
We attended the 10AM to 12 noon session of Stake Conference.  It was held at
our building and came to by satellite broadcast.  Elder Gerald Lund of the
Seventies conducted the meeting and was the first speaker.  The Primary General
President was the next speaker, followed by Elder Bitner spoke and the
concluding speaker was President Iring.  They were all excellent talks and I
especially enjoyed President Iring’s talk about Prophets.  We had a light lunch
and then I took a nap.  We went over to Jeff and Gail’s, taking dinner and all
the makings.  David and his family joined us.  Noland family joined us after
dinner.  We had a good time visiting.  It was 8:30PM when we got home.  I wrote
some in my personal history before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7:15AM and then I got up and got ready to go into the bus terminal for
some Special Education Training.  That finished at 11:30AM so I thought I would
be able to get to Bryce’s a little early today.  However Mark caught me and
discussed the garden for a few minutes.  When I hooked the trailer up the left
turn signal light did not work.  I found that the light was burned out but I
had to replace the whole light as it was a sealed unit.  Anyway it was 2:30PM
before I got to Bryce’s.  I worked until 7PM and came home.  I took a shower
and then we watched an old John Wayne movie before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I really
didn’t want to get up but finally did and after eating breakfast went to class
at the bus terminal.  After class I made an appointment with for my final
interview before I can start driving as a substitute.  When I got home Mae and
Sandy had dinner cooking in the sun oven.  This is the first time we have used
the sun oven and it worked pretty good.  After eating dinner I went over to the
Health Clinic and got a new medical card for driving with a CDL.  This card
will have to be updated each year.  I then filled my truck with natural gas
before returning home.  I started digging a trench to run a water line to the
garden area.  Brother Bodily called me and asked if I could install handicap
bars in Sister Virginia Johnston’s shower this evening.  Mae and I went over
and visited with Brother Higley concerning Brother Farr’s Family History
records.  We decided that we will work out a system to number the file folders
and have volunteers help verify the information against the Ancestral File.  We
then came back home and I got some tools and we went back to Sister Johnston’s
and I installed the bars.  Today haws been a busy day and I didn’t get all that
I wanted to do done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went into
the bus terminal and took my last class on Special Education training.  After
the class I met with Mishelle and she checked all my requirements and took me
to Roberta who lined me up with Babe for an afternoon rout on Monday.  I got
home for lunch.  Scott was there but Jeff was working a little longer so he
didn’t get here in time to eat with us.  Mae is tending Benji and Rachel this
afternoon.  I took my boat into Peterson Marina to have then service it for
summer.  I went to Bryce’s getting there at 2:45PM.  I worked until 7:45PM
getting the sheet rocking finished and the locks set for the back door.  I
showered and then was going to watch a show on Comcast but I got a call to make
a bus run tomorrow.  I filled out this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke with a
dream that I had over slept and was late for this morning’s bus run.  I went
into the bathroom and felt that I was still ok on time so I read my
scriptures.  I then looked at my watch and I was already late leaving.  I
rushed into the kitchen and looked at the clocks.  It was 1:30AM and I realized
that I was looking at my watch upside down.  I went back to bed but woke at
4:30AM.  I got up and got ready and drove almost to the bus compound when I
realized that I was 1 hour early so I returned home and slept in the recliner
for a ½ hour.  When I got to the compound I went to the dispatch and got a trip
sheet.  I was told that I should take bus 359 as bus 462 was down.  I went to
the parking lot and both busses were there.  one of the drivers asked if I
needed help and he said that I should take #359 so I pre-checked the bus and
waited for my assistant to show.  When she was late getting there I called the
dispatch and the asked me why I was on bus #359 and I told them that was the
bus I was told to take.  They said I should be on bus #462 so I went there and
the assistant was waiting so we got off.  The run went well and we got to
school about 10 minutes late.  After I got home I entered my payroll
information and then went outside and worked on the water line to the garden. 
I did get a short nap before I went back for the afternoon run.  Mae went to
the Family History Center and worked on Brother Farr’s Family History.  She got
home to get me off to work.  It is a good thing that she did as when I fell
asleep I really went out.  This afternoon run went very well but it really
surprised me to the distances we had to travel to return some children to their
homes.  I went from the bus compound into Peterson Marina and got my boat.  On
the way home I stopped at Gibby’s Floral and ordered flowers for Mae for
Mothers Day.  I also went over to J.B.’s and filled the truck and boat with gas
so Randy and I can leave early in the morning to go fishing.  Mae went to the
book group this evening.  Bob and Carroll invited me for dinner.  After dinner
I cleaned up the boat and installed the new mower blades on to the lawn mower. 
When I came in the house I entered my payroll for today’s time and finished
this entry.  We soon went to bed as I will be getting up early to go fishing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early so that Randy and I could go fishing.  We took my boat and went up to
East Canyon Reservoir, getting on the lake about 7:30AM.  We had a good time
and both caught our limit by 9:30AM.  It started to rain just as we came into
the dock.  I was home by 12:30PM and cleaned the fish.  Mae was at the Family
History Center when I got home.  Bob invited me up for some Lazona for lunch. 
I then came downstairs and took a nap.  This evening Mae and I went over to
Rick and Georgia’s where I cut up a tree stump for Rick.  Rick gave me the
siding, off of their shed that they took down, for me to side our shed.  He and
I then did some planning on a concrete slab for a new storage shed for them. 
Mae and Georgia bought some Sub-Way sandwiches for dinner and then we played a
game of Rummy.  It was midnight when Mae and I got home. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and when I woke I remembered that I was to go to the chapel and help clean it
up.  Brother Higley called to see if I was going to help.  I went over and
there was only Brother Higley, Mark and Brother Graham there.  I started
helping and Brother Graham then had to go to a program in that his
Grand-daughter was in.  After we finished up I came home and help Mae set up for
our family to come to.  We had all of our family with the exceptions of Shellie
and Roy’s family of course, then there was Mike’s David as he had to work,
Shauna and Conner as Conner had his tonsils removed yesterday.  Mishelle also
had to stay home as she came down with a migraine headache.   JaNae and Brad
also brought their air jumping house and set it up.  The children had a great
time playing in it.  They also used it to play Annie High Over which Scott leading
the children in that game.  Every one brought food and Mike brought several
pizzas that they bought from Costco’s on the way up.  It was a wonderful day of
spending a good time with our family.  Everyone helped clean up before they
left but we were very tired and ready for bed when they all left.  Mae received
several books and gifts from our children and their companions.  I bought her a
dress a couple of weeks ago and I had a nice bouquet of flowers delivered to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up in
time to go to the Church and help set up the chairs.  Again it was the same
four that cleaned the building yesterday.  Because of the Regional Conference
last week we had Fast Sunday today.  Bob prepared dinner for us and invited us
up.  This afternoon we put on the DVD of “The Sound of Music” that Becky gave
Mae yesterday.  Scott and Mishelle and the children came over for a few minutes
so Mishelle could give Mae a gift.  Mishelle still isn’t feeling the best but a
little better that she was yesterday.  This evening Shellie called Mae to wish
her a Happy Mothers Day.  I worked on my life stories for a couple of hours.  I
quit at 9:45PM and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
went into the bus terminal and road Babe the driver of bus #411.  We had a Jr.
High pickup and a Elementary pickup.  After the morning run I came home and we
went to our class at the Family History Center in Ogden.  We came home and I
took a nap before going in and making the afternoon run on my own.  I tried to
fill the bus with fuel but I couldn’t get the pump to work.  I finally went
with out refueling until I returned.  The only problem I had on the run is that
I passed the one turn as the street sign was in such a location that I didn’t
see it until it was too late to turn.  One of the students made the comment
that I was an old man and I guess he is right.  This evening we read the
Priesthood, Relief Society lesson for next week and then watched a show on TV. 
We started to watch a second show on Comcast but the language got rough so I
turned it off.  I filled out my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went into
the bus shop for a meeting that was scheduled for substitute bus drivers and
when I got there I was told that it had been canceled because of the great
amount of drivers that are needed during these last few days of school.  While
I was there I put in some bids for field trip runs.  I came home and added a
few more bids.  Mae and I went to the Davis County Animal Control center in
Fruit Heights and bought a buck rabbit.  They charged us $15.00 for the one we
picked.  We stopped on the way and priced a numbering stamp and bought some
stickers for the control we need on Brother Farr’s Family History File
folders.  I got a call from the School bus shop asking if I could take an
afternoon run today and also cover the routs tomorrow.  I agreed to do it.  Bob
prepared a cabbage casserole for lunch.  I made the bus run and then went over
to Macy’s and bought two bags of Morning Moo milk.  Mae had dinner ready when I
returned home.  At 7PM we went to the church house and taught some volunteers
how to check the files of Brother Farr’s.  Well! Mark went with us and Glenn
Higley met us at the chapel.  The four of us worked 2 ½ hours on ten files
finding errors.  Mae will now take them back to the Clearfield library and
enter the corrections.  It was after 10PM when we got to bed.</span></p>

heads and made some plans to build a stand for the pen that Kip gave me when he
gave me the rabbits.  Scott and Jeff came over for lunch with us and we sure
enjoyed that.  I took a short nap before I went back for the afternoon run. 
When I got home I built the frame to hold the rabbit pen and we will keep the
buck in it.  Bob and I went Home Teaching this evening and were able to visit
all of our families.  I entered my time and filled out my journal entry for
today.  We are going to watch a movie on DVD before going to bed tonight.</span></p>

I was doing for them finished.  This evening when I got home Mae had a nice
dinner ready.  While we ate we watched a show on Hallmark.  We had seen most of
it before but enjoyed it again.  I got a call form the dispatch and they want
me to drive tomorrow.  I will be serving Clearfield High, Syracuse Jr. High and
Sam Springs Elementary.  I have never been to these schools not alone these
routs.  Oh well, new experiences.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was a good
experience driving this morning.  I about missed the first student and he ran
to catch me.  he also helped me with the rest of the rout.  After dropping the
High School students at Clearfield High I started to get the students for
Syracuse Jr. High.  I passed Antelope drive realizing that I should have turned
when I came to a R.R. crossing on an illegal for school bus’s to cross. 
However I couldn’t turn or back up so I crossed.  I called the shop and was
told to go up further were I could go around a block and then when I came back
just before the crossing I should turn left and could go thru a new
sub-division.  However if I had continued another block south and then turned
west I would have been where I needed to be any way.  As it was I went back to
Antelope, turned west and then turned one light to soon and got myself into
another sub-division that I had to turn around in.  in following the rout sheet
I found that W. Gentile Street was detoured to where it block my rout to pickup
a student.  I called dispatch and Mishelle told me that it has been blocked for
several months.  I just told her that it didn’t say anything about it on my
rout sheet and how was I to pickup the student.  Another driver broke in and
said they would let the bus through so I went down but the student wasn’t at
the stop so I had to leave anyway.  That cost me a few extra minutes.  I made
it to the 2nd pickup and then had a student direct me with the rest.  I then
picked up the grade school students and had s student help me there also.  I
was only five minutes late at the end of the run.  I came home and got myself
some lunch.  Mae took Kylan and Ashley to Dinosaur Park in Ogden.  My afternoon
run went much better than this mornings run.  I got some things ready to go to
Sandi and Nick’s when Mae returns.  Mae got here about 5:30PM and we loaded
every thing and then took Kylan and Ashley home.  Scott and Mishelle told us
that they had gone into the Doctor who took an ultra sound and found that they
are going to have twins.  I think both Scott and Mishelle are in shock.  We
didn’t get to Sandi and Nick’s until 6:30PM.  JaNae was there with her children
and Chelci and Steve were there with their baby.  It was neat that they wanted
to be there if Mae and I were coming out.  Nick had prepared spaghetti sauce
and Sandi finished the dinner up.  After eating we stayed up and played a game
that Chelci and Steve taught us.  it was a very enjoyable evening.  </span></p>

JaNae’s.  When we got back I cooked buiscuts and gravy and also trout.  Nick
had a bale game he had to referee this morning.  I helped Sandi adjust their
lawn sprinklers.  We also talked over some ideas of their back yard.  It was
late when we left for home.  We stopped and got a Sub-Way sandwich for lunch
that we ate on the way home.  We also stopped in Salt Lake and filled the
pickup with natural gas.  Mae trimmed the lawn when we got home.  I lay down
and took a short nap.  This evening we played a game of canasta whit Bob and
Carroll.  Bob and I were in head and looked like we would win but the last hand
Mae and Carroll really skunked us.  I think that is 2 or 3 times they have
beaten us in a roll.  Mae gave me a hair cut, I then caught my journal up and
we took showers before going to bed late.</span></p>

for dinner.  He cooked some roast beef, potatoes and cauliflower for dinner.  I
took a nap this afternoon and was awaken by a telephone call from Jim Frazier. 
He just wanted to talk to us.  I called Sister June Mecham in Firth Idaho and
visited with her concerning the Family History records of Brother Farr.  I had
found her name on one of his sheets as the submitting the record to the
Ancestral File.  She did not know of Brother Farr or any relationship to the
Farr’s or the Kimble’s.  I enjoyed visiting with her for a few minutes anyway. 
We were going to go to Brother Farr’s and visit with him but I called first and
his daughter said that he is sick.  We will make it another time.  I spent some
time working on a score sheet and rules for the game that Chelci and Steve
taught us Friday evening.  Irven and Sandy came over and spent the evening with
us.  We ate a light super and then played the new game Bunches and Runs.  After
they went home I worked on more stories and today’s journal entry before we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
5 AM wondering if the school was going to call me.  I tried but just tossed. 
Mae had a dental appointment at 9AM so I got up also.  I worked at Irven and
Sandy’s installing their new dish washer.  Before leaving I got their AC ready
to use.  Mae went into her appointment and found out that she needs over $3,000
worth of work done.  She came home quite discouraged over it.  She and I went
into see Sister Johnston at the rehabilitative center.  She is doing quite well
and may be home by the end of the week.  When we came home I got on the
computer and tried to find out a bus schedule for my field trip run tomorrow. 
I finally went into the bus terminal and had them print it out.  The day has
sure gone by fast and I had hoped for time to take a nap but I think that is
out.  I played a couple of games on the computer before we went to bed.  Mae
called RaNae Barney and visited with her a few minutes.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up in
time for me to eat and go to the bus terminal by 8AM.  When I did the pre-trip
inspection I found that the bus hadn’t been services on it schedule but was
about 1200 miles over schedule.  I checked with the shop foreman.  He came out
and looked at the bus and decided that I should take it on the field trip and
would bring it in for service when I returned.  I took the 6<sup>th</sup> grade
classes from Oak Hills Elementary, in Bountiful, to Orem where they went to a
park for lunch and then to the Orem Mall to see a display about Leonardo Deviance. 
It was a good experience for my first Field Trip.  When I got home Mae went
Visiting Teaching while I took a nap.  Irven and Sandy took us out to eat at
the Souper Salad in Riverdale for my pay for installing their dish washer
yesterday.  We worked on our computers for a little while and I called Roy and
visited with him for a few minutes and before long it was time to got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This morning
we got up in time for me to get to the bus terminal at 8AM.  I was scheduled to
drive bus #366 on a field trip.  When I looked for the bus it was not there.  I
went to dispatch and was told to take #365.  I got it pre-tripped and warmed up
when a bus driver stopped and ask what I was going to do with #365.  When I
told her she said that she was scheduled to take it on a field trip in 5
minutes.  We called dispatch and I was reassigned to bus #363 so I had to do a
fast pre-inspection and go.  I was running late but made it to Mountain View
Elementary just before the students came out of the school.  Bus #363 was
lacking power so it was all I could do to get 64 MPH out of it.  There were two
buses taking this field trip so I was to follow bus #16.  This morning there
was question as to who was the supervising leader on my bus and no one had a
map as to where we were going.  The trip was to Wheeler Farm and the driver of
#16 said to take the South exit of I-215 and go east to Exit 9. Bus #16 was
faster and left before I did.  I don’t think I ever did see #16 again going
down.  When I got of I-15 and on to I-215 I ask for help from a teacher.  She
said that she thought that we took Exit 9 but was not sure if I was to go north
or south from there.  I started south when we saw #16 going north so I quickly
changed directions and followed it.  The next intersection I saw #16 turn east
so I followed.  As I did one of the parents said they saw a sign that said
Wheeler Farm to the west.  To late so I followed #16 who stopped at a traffic
signal.  I had about 3 cars between us and as the light changed #16 pulled into
a parking lot.  Before I got through the light it changed again and I decided
that I was not going to follow #16 but find some where else to go around the
block and come back.  That was a wise decision as #16 got himself in to a dead
end and had trouble getting out.  When we came back a teacher told me to turn
at a sign that said Wheeler Farm but it was a wrong turn.  It was a parking lot
for an apartment complex.  I had a mother get off the bus and guide me as I
backed the bus to turn around.  The next right turn got us to where we were
going.  It had been raining most to the time this morning but it let up shortly
after we got to the farm.  I waited at the bus and while waiting I swept the
bus out.  It was very dirty so I was a while cleaning it.  The return trip went
very well and we got back ok.  After returning the bus I went shopping for some
Alfa Alfa seed and some salt wheels for the rabbits.  I then went to Home Depot
and got a sheet of chip board.  I was tired when I got home.  I was surprised
that Mae was home when I got there as I thought that she would be at David and
Shauna’s tending children.  She told me that David decided to take a day off
and be with his children.  Mae fixed some dinner and then I took a nap.  Mae
had a Home Making meeting this evening.  I watched a John Wayne movie and
cleaned my fishing poles so they would be ready for Friday.  Nike and I will go
fishing Friday if the weather is good but from the weather report it doesn’t
look to good.  Mae will be going up to tend David’s children tomorrow so she
went to bed early.  I stayed us and made this journal entry and I think I will
watch a show on TV.  I stayed up and watched Charades with Carrie Grant and
Audry Hepburn until mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
5AM and found that Mae was already up.  She woke about 4 and couldn’t sleep so
she got up.  She went up to David and Shauna’s to tend the children today.  I
went out and helped Mark rap the tomato plants so they wouldn’t freeze.  I seem
to have been busy all day but I don’t feel that I really accomplished that
much.  I got a letter for the School District that my medical card was about to
expire so I took the card over to Mishelle and got that corrected.  I also
learned how to get my Field Trip sheets printed off.  I stopped at Irven and
Sandy’s to give them $10 of their money back for the flowers for the graves at
Driggs as Mark will not be going up with Barbara.  They had me keep it for the
work I did for them.  I have tried to get on the internet and find out more
about shuttling RV’s but didn’t have much success.  I did get my watch replaced
at Wal-Mark because it filled with water while I was adjusting Sandi’s
sprinkler system last Saturday.  Mae got home about 6PM and stopped on her way
and bought some dinner.  After we ate we went up stairs where Brother Thompson
came to make his Home Teaching Visit.  We do enjoy having him come.  We then
watched the last of a show that was on Hall Mark channel.  Mae and I then came
downstairs.  We were going to watch a movie but I couldn’t get Comcast to work
on our bedroom set again so we just went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke quite
discouraged just thinking of how things are going.  Mae tried to cheer me up
but before long I had her discouraged also.  She got up as she is going to meet
Pat Bradfield in Provo and spend some time with her.  After reading my
scriptures I decided that I would go to the Temple this morning.  I helped Mae
put windshield washer in her car and then fed the rabbits.  Bob came out and
told me that Comcast would be here shortly so I decided to wait for them.  I
got some breakfast and did a few things around the house.  It was after 12:30PM
before Comcast came but I was glad that I waited for we got it fixed and also
got them to rewire the hook-up for the VHS so we can record shows.  When that
was finished I called Mae and she was on her way home so I took a nap and then
when she got here we went together to the temple.  I really felt the Spirit
with me during the session and was especially glad that Mae was with me.  We
went to Best Buy and got a lot more capacity added to the RAM on my lap top
computer.  It works much better now.  We decided to get something to eat so we
went to Apple Bee’s and ate.  When we got home we decided to watch a movie and
I chose “The Greatest Story Ever Told” but I forgot to check how long it was. 
It lasted 3 ½ hours so we didn’t get to sleep until 2:30 AM.  it was a very
good movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David called
us at 8 AM to see if we wanted everyone to come to their place after we
decorated the graves today.  Mae made several calls and it looks like that is
what we are going to do.  I helped Bob grease and change the oil in the
lawnmower.  I also helped Mark with the garden and Mae had me get things ready
to go to the cemetery.  When we got to the cemetery Kim was there.  David and
his family had already been there and went up to the Porterville Cemetery. 
They soon came back but during the mean time Rick, Georgia, Lindsey and Justin,
Lindsey’s fiancé got there.  A little later Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley
came.  After visiting a little while there we were all invited to go to David
and Shauna’s place.  Jeff brought Benji and came up.  David brought out hot dogs,
sausages and hamburgers and we grilled them.  Mae and others brought potato
salad, other salads and deserts.  After eating most everyone climbed the hill
behind David’s.  Mishelle didn’t because of her condition with pregnancy and I
stayed back because I couldn’t find my hat and my legs were also hurting.  I
think not being able to find my hat was more of an excuse than anything.  Before
coming home Mae and I went over to Jim and Jeanenne’s and had Kim show us some
of his pictures of the trip that he and Mysha just returned from.  It was late
when I we got home.  I tried to get my computer up but it was coming up with to
many errors and I was hurting to bad so I went to bed.  Mae stayed up and took
her shower before she came to bed.</span></p>

hurting but got up and went over and helped set up chairs at the church.  Mae
had some breakfast ready when I got back.  We ate and attended our meetings. 
After getting home Mae prepared a light lunch.  I worked on my computer and
caught this entry up.  I tried to call Brother Farr but only got a recording. 
Later today Bishop called and said that Brother Farr passed away today.  I took
a nap this afternoon.  Jeff came over about 3:30PM.  He had gone into work
trying to get some things caught up.  He and I started a game of chess but he
felt tight so we went out back and pitched a game of horse shoes.  We played
for quite a while but he finally won me by one point.  Gail and the children
arrived shortly after we finished the game.  We never did get back to playing
our chess game.  I believe that I had the best position on him.  Mae made a
nice dinner for us.  After eating, Mae and Gail stood Jeff and I in a game of
Rook.  We finally called the game at the end of one round and it left Gail and
Mae winning by 10 points.  They took the children home to put them to bed. 
Irven and Sandy came down and visited for a couple of hours.  We went in with
them and bought a half a box of paper at $2.50 per rim which is about ½ price
from what they had been able to find.  We cleaned up and I finished this entry
before we went to bed.</span></p>

early concerned about Jeff and Gail.  I woke with a better understanding of
their problems but not knowing how to help.  I went back to be and slept for a
little longer.  I prepared breakfast while Mae started washing and house work. 
After she mopped our floors she went upstairs and mopped their floors.  I
covered the pen that we have the buck in to get him out of the weather.  It
rained off and on all day.  I had planed to rotavate a garden spot for Sister
Fallis but the weather prevented that.  I worked on the chain saws getting the
one new saw put together and found that the one that I had let Bryce use has a
blade that is completely dull.  Mae and I planned on studding this evening for
our Family Home Evening but Bob called and asked me to help him administer to
Carroll.  Bob asked me to seal the anointing and in doing so I could not give
her a blessing of renewed health.  I don’t know if it was my weakness or if it
wasn’t to be.  They then decided to take her to the hospital but she didn’t
have the strength to walk to the car.  I tried to get her to the car with the
use of a walker but she was to week.  We tried to find a wheel chair but were
unable to.  Bishop Smith came over and he and I picked up the chair with
Carroll in it and carried her to the car.  Bob drove her to the McKay Dee
Hospital.  Mae spent another hour upstairs cleaning cupboards and straightening
up.  Mae also worked on Family History for a while today.</span></p>

moved our tent trailer out of the covering but found that the trailer had a
flat tire.  I removed the tire and had Bob take it to Big O’s before he went
over to see Carroll.  Mark and I went to Sister Olsen’s and started removing
some trees.  Bishop Knudsen came over and helped us with the project.  We quite
at noon for lunch and I went home and ate dinner with Scott and Mae.  Jeff was
busy at work and couldn’t take the time for lunch.  After lunch Scott had left I
took a nap and then went back on the project.  We worked until after 4PM and
then Mark and I stacked the wood that we had cut up into firewood.  Mae cleaned
Bob and Carroll’s house today, trimmed the yard, fixed lunch, went over and got
my chain saw from the repair shop, and was blowing the side walks of when I
came home.  I suggested that we call for a home delivery for dinner but Mae had
it about ready.  We turned on the TV and watched the last of a Texas Ranger
show and then watched a Mystery Woman series.  Mae fell asleep before it
finished.  I entered this entry and took a shower before we went to bed.</span></p>

graders from Syracuse Jr. High to Lagoon.  There were 8 buses to taking all the
students.  Before we left the school Roberta called me and asks if I could just
drop off my load and return so that I could take another route this afternoon. 
Many of the youth will stay and come back with other later this evening so we
will not need 8 busses to return the students anyway.  I came home and ate
lunch with Mae.  While home I did some searching on Goggle Earth for route
maps.  Mae has been busy doing house work both upstairs and downstairs this
morning.  She went over to the Clearfield Family History Center and got Brother
Farr’s files.  She also took the tire to our camp trailer to the shop to have
it repaired.  I got over to the shop at 1:37 PM for the bus routs.  I started
with Northridge High and then North Layton Jr. High and finished with Mountain
View Elementary.  I returned to the yard at 412 PM.  When I got home I changed
clothes and helped Mark take Bob pickup up to the Dumps and unload it.  I had
to hurry to change when I got home so that Mae and I could go to the viewing
for Brother Farr.  We went to the Lindquist Mortuary in Clearfield but no one
was there.  I guess the best we can say is that we tried.  I got the boat ready
to go in the morning and then came in.  Mae got on the computer and did some on
Family History.  I got this entry typed and we went to bed.</span></p>

parking lot at the mouth of Weber canyon.  We went to David’s and got Tyler and
then went to East Canyon reservoir.  We had very good luck and all of us caught
fish.  Tyler caught the first one and also caught the largest one.  We released
quite a few fish just so we could continue fishing for a while longer.  We left
the lake before noon.  We stopped at the gate and I bought a season pass. 
Tyler took two fish and Nick had me take the rest.  He said that we could
invite then out for breakfast one of these days.  After getting home I went to
Sister Fallis’s and rotovated her garden spot.  I then went to Sister Olsen’s
and helped Mark, Karin and Glen load the tree branches onto a trailer and tie
them down.  I was sure tired when I quite for the day.  Mae and I watched a
