<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were at
Roy and Shellie’s in Chandler Arizona to wish the New Year in.  After we
welcomed in the New Year I worked on my journal for a few minutes.  I then
played three games of Solitary, loosing the first but winning the next two. 
While I was getting ready to go to bed Mae played a couple of games.  I think
that Shellie and Roy stayed up and watched a movie.  Just as Mae and I were
going to bed I had a very strong pain go through my right arm.  It seem to be
in the bones of my fore arm, wrist and hand.  It lasted only a few minutes but
sure hurt.  I was able to go to sleep and slept all night.  It may have been
caused by the carbonated non-alcoholic apple juice that we drank to welcome in
the New Year.  Mae woke me at 9 AM when she cuddled up to me.  She is such a
beautiful and special wife.  I could just stay in her arms.  We got up and I
read my scriptures.  As I studied Alma 30 I did a lot of reflecting as to my
life and the raising of our children.  I am sure that Lehi often wondered what
he did wrong in the raising of his two sons or did he do any thing wrong.  I
know that we each have our free agency but it is sure hard to see your own
children make bad choices.  Shellie got breakfast for all of us.  Shellie and Roy
told the family that they wanted all of us to have a fun day.  It was decided
that we would go to Amazing Jake’s Food and Fun.  We got there about 11 AM and
spent the rest of the day there.  There was a lot to do and we all started with
the Lazar Shot and was able to go in just as a family.  Each has a lazar gun
and a vest that registers each time you shot someone else or you get shot.  It
was quite a lot of fun.  We played miniature golf, the boys road the go carts,
we all road the bumper cars.  We had all we could eat.  The food was ok and
especially the boys liked the pizza.  It was dark when we came home.  All but
Jase then stayed up to watch a DVD, The Guardian.  It was quite and exciting
movie and left you with a lot to think about.  Much of the story takes place in
Kodak Alaska.  I remembered of how close we came to moving to Kodak.  I am sure
that would have been a bad move.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 7 AM and used the bathroom, read my scriptures, showered and shaved.  Mae
was then up so we stayed up.  Roy had to go to work today.  Garrett also went
to work this morning.  Jase was up but the rest of the boys slept in.  I worked
on the computer at different times during the day.  Shellie wanted to get
Christmas put away so we all helped.  I played a couple of games of solitary
during the day.  I called Bob to see how they are doing.  They seem to be doing
ok.  Bob said that Carroll is felling much better.  Mae and I decided that for
my Birthday that we will go to Lava for two nights and stay at The Home motel. 
I called and made reservations for the 27<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th </sup>February. 
I called Darren at Love’s Heating and Air Conditioners with some questions
about their proposal for Randy’s home.  I have several questions to talk to
Randy and Judy about their house plans and what they want.  I will have to call
him tomorrow.  After reading the scriptures as a family, this evening Roy
wanted to watch a show.  We started to watch it with them but the language got
to us and the valance was also bad.  Mae and I finally left.  I filled in this
journal entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
6:30 AM and read my scriptures but went back to bed and cuddled Mae in my arms
and went back to sleep.  I woke later with Mae gone and when I looked at the
clock it was 10:20 AM.  I got up and had breakfast with the family.  I started
on my computer but Shellie was in the computer room with me and we got
visiting.  I realized some things that I did when we were raising our family
that I goofed in.  Mae and I discussed some of those areas and I sure get a
sinking feeling.  I wonder if I made right choices when we moved so much.  I
guess I will never know during this life time.  I sure don’t envy those raising
families now.  I fear that Shellie’s biggest draw back is her husband.  I see
very little concern about his children from him.  I don’t feel that I can say
much because the last time I did it back fired on me.  I don’t feel very
comfortable around Roy and feel that I am always on the look out for saying
something wrong.  I called Randy and told him that I had some items that I
needed to visit with he and Judy about on his house plans.  I asked him to call
me back on Shellie’s house phone so that we could visit.  They have
grandchildren at home now so it will be later.  I worked on my history for
quite a while today but there is much more to do.  Mae and Shellie went
shopping and was gone most of the afternoon.  Mae brought me back a frozen
yogurt when they returned.  Randy didn’t call me back today.  This evening we
watched a show entitled “Sea Biscuit”.   Although it was a good movie it still
had a language problem that is offensive.  I said that it was a good movie, but
it really wasn’t because no matter the story and plot when it uses the Lords
name or the Name of God or has a seine that you have to fast forward because of
sex then it is not a movie to watch and this show has all of these in it.  I
fear that almost all movies produced now are of such poor quality.  Roy and
Shellie try to select good movies, they won’t watch the standard TV programs
because if it is not the show then it is the advertisements.  The boys like to
play the DVD games but I fear that these are very harmful to the mind because
of the great valance and action speed.  Satan certainly is destroying most
entertainment one way or another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was after
mid-night when we got to bed.  Both Mae and I woke shortly after 4 AM to use
the bathroom but then could not go back to sleep.  I finally got up and went
into the family room and slept in the recliner so we would not disturb each
other.  I slept until 8 AM and Mae was able to sleep until after 9 AM.  I read
my scriptures and worked on my journal.  Mae and Shellie were going shopping
and they wanted me to go with them as they were going to stop at the place
where they get a VIBE treatment.  It was after 5 PM when we returned home.  For
me I am not sure the day vas very productive.  I was able to take a short nap
before dinner and then we hurried to get to the Temple.  I really enjoyed the
session although I had a lot of pain tonight.  I guess that it was the Lasagna
that affected me but I am not sure.  After the Temple session we tried to make
it to a shop that serves frozen yogurt but was just a few minutes late and they
were already closing.  We came home and a movie was put on.  It did have some
profanity but it was a good story.  The movie was taken from a true story. 
After the movie we got talking about why kids make the choices that they do. 
Shellie told of how she was a looser in 7<sup>th</sup> &amp; 8<sup>th</sup>
grades in Grantsville.  I guess there is a lot I don’t understand about life.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It’s almost 2
AM and we are just getting ready for bed.  This is out of hand!  It was 9:30 AM
when we got up this morning.  By the time we got through with breakfast it was
11 AM.  Mae and I are very concerned with the shows that we are watching.  That
one last night opened our eyes to the evils that are literally destroying the
youth but at the same time the language was certainly not what we should be
exposed to.  I guess this is the normal in our schools today.  I wonder how even
a few can with stand theses evils.  We are also concerned with the job that
David (Mike son) is applying for in Alaska.  I called and talked to Mike and
found that if he gets the job it will be working for the brother to Mike’s
boss.  He is a Bishop and requires all that works for him to attend Church
meetings every Sunday.  We felt much better to hear that kind of news rather
than the image that I remember when I worked there in Alaska.  I called David
and Shauna but they weren’t home so I just left a message.  I called Jeff and
visited a few minutes and I called Sandi and visited with her.  I helped
Shellie with some painting in Jace’s room and I also helped Roy get his sand
buggy loaded so he could take it to get it repaired.  Mae and I went shopping
for some material for Shellie.  We stopped at Walgreen’s and filled my
prescription.  We then picked up Quint from his friends.  Randy called and I
visited with he and Judy about their house plans.  Mae and I went over and
picked up Pizza and Panda Bear Chinese food take outs for dinner.  Roy,
Shellie, Mae and I watched another movie this evening.  This one had quite a
bit better language but it was an impossible plot.  I filled in this journal
entry before Mae and I showered and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning as meetings do not start until 3 PM.  It was 11 AM before most of
us got up.  After prayers I read my scriptures and meditated about them.  Alma
34 gives one a lot to think about and ponder.  I am very greatful for having
the Gospel of Jesus Christ in my life to give me purpose and guidance and the
goals that I am trying to achieve.  Often I feel very weak but the study of the
scriptures gives me hope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We enjoyed
church meetings and again Shellie did very well giving her Sunday School
lesson.  There was a couple that is just starting to investigate the Church in
attendance today.  I think they attended last Sunday but this time the Bishop
invited them to stay for the other meetings besides Sacrament meeting.  They
weren’t too sure of that but stayed.  Shellie asked me to pass out slips for
class members to assist with quotes and scriptures.  As I did the one Brother
saw they were numbered so he said “I will take number nine because we will
never get through that many and I won’t have to give it anyway”.  As Shellie
was finishing, being short of time, she said that she would have to skip some
of the quotes but would like quote nine read to finish.  I just about laughed
out loud.  Before we started Priesthood meeting I couldn’t help from ribbing
the Brother of his selection of quote nine.  He said “yes, and it was the
longest one.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Shellie and
Roy soon had a nice dinner prepared after we got home.  Just as we were setting
down David called.  Shellie answered and took the phone into the other room. 
The visited for almost a ½ hour and then Shellie brought the phone to me and he
and I visited for another ½ hour.  It was fun to visit with him.  He is sure
good to keep in touch with us.  We held Family Home Evening at which Garrett
gave a lesson about missionary work and bore his testimony and told of his
excitement as he waits for his call.  We had ice cream for refreshments, mine
being yogurt.  We then started to watch a DVD that Gary Sorenson sent to Roy
and Shellie.  It was movie pictures taken of Egypt and Israel last spring.  I
started to hurt until I took some pain pills and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
3:20 AM and was up for a little while.  I was going to try sleeping in the
recliner but tried the bed and was able to go to sleep again.  I was up by 8 AM
and so started working on my journal.  Shellie got up and went to work on
painting Jace and Kevis’s room so I left my computer and helped her.  I got the
painting finished while Shellie went out to dinner with Roy.  Mae and I played
a couple of games of Rummy this afternoon.  I played a couple of games on my
computer.  Shellie brought me a frozen yogurt this evening.  I ate about ½ of
it and saved the rest.  I have had quite a bit of pain today and I am not sure
what is causing it.  We went to bed after 11 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
shortly after 1 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  About 2 AM I got up and
walked around and finally got in the recliner but couldn’t sleep.  I thought of
watching a show but was concerned about making to much noise and waking others
plus I don’t remember how to run their equipment.  I went to sleep sometime but
again woke before 5 AM.  I went back into the bedroom and tried to sleep but
heard the boys get up and off to school.  Then Mae got up about 7 so I finally
got up to stay about 8 AM.  I have experienced quite a bit of pain during the
night and my c-pack was also uncomfortable and noise.  I read my scriptures, showered,
shaved and made the bed before coming out.  The boys are all back to school. 
Mae and I went to Ann at the Winsar Center and got a treatment with the
Vib-Machine.  She also used a low level lazar beam on my back, stomach and throat</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Areas.  We found out later
that the charges for this kind of treatment could have cost over thirty to
fifty dollars but she only charged us $10 for the Vib treatment and said she
wanted to see if the lazar treatment would help me.  Mae and I then drove 1062
S. Doran street in Mesa and took a picture of the home that we lived in the
second time we moved to Mesa.  From there we looked for the home we bought the
last time we lived here.  We finally had to call Shellie and ask her how far
east on Brown Avenue we had to go.  She said that it was passed Greanfield
road.  With that we were able to locate the house we had bought on 5054 E.
Fountain Circle Dr.  After taking some pictures of that house we drove over to
the common area and took some pictures of the swimming pool.  We drove to a Taco
Bell and got something to eat and used their restrooms.  I also walked around
to get a cramp out of my leg.  We went to Basha and bought a few groceries
before coming home.  It was sure fun being with Mae.  She just makes my day
when we do things together.  I lay down and took a nap after getting home. 
Shellie made a nice dinner this evening.  I filled in my journal and worked on
some more of my personal history.  Roy and the boys watched the DVD “The
Pirates of the Caribbean”.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7 AM and had breakfast.  I went in to get dressed but was so cold that I
crawled back into the covers and went back to sleep.  I slept until about 10 AM
when I got back up.  After shaving I made the bed and read my scriptures.  I
sure enjoy the scriptures and realize how much I need to read them to stay true
to my conveniences with God.  I continually hope and pray that someday the
scriptures will become more important to my children.  As Mosiah explained to
his son Helaman, it is only through the study of the scriptures and following
their teachings that we will find our way back to Our Father in Heaven.  I
worked about 5 hours on Roy’s trailer removing the screws from the flooring.  I
had no more than came in the hours when Roy called and wants to take the
trailer to pickup their sand buggy.  The company had called him and said that
they have it repaired.  I went out and reassembled enough of the bed so that he
could take it to pickup the sand buggy.  Mae cooked her rice and chicken
casserole for dinner and it was sure good.  The boys went to M.I.A. so after
Jase watched his show I put on a Western show and watched it.  Garrett got on
the internet and was able to order a key cover for the one that got broken on
my computer.  We went to bed before 10 PM that is a first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, January 10, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
until almost 8 when I got up and showered and shaved.  Everyone else had eaten
so I got me some shredded wheat for breakfast.  Mae hadn’t slept very well so
she lay back down for a little while.  Roy went to work while Shellie got
everything packed.  Roy told Shellie that he would be home by noon if she could
be ready to go by then.  Shellie assured him that she could.  Shellie was ready
but Roy didn’t show up.  Shellie, Mae and I even had time to play a game of
Rummy.  It was after 2:30 PM when Roy came.  They left about 3 PM.  Mae and I
went shopping and then came home and fixed some dinner.  I also made some
peanut butter with Shellie’s blender.  After dinner we set down to watch the
VCD of Lion King 2.  Mae and I had never seen this movie but the boys have so
the finally left to find other activities.  I filled in my journal.  We then
read scriptures as a family.  I played a couple of games on the computer and
help Mae do a little quilting.  I finished my journal entry and we were going
to bed but Garrett came home from work just then so we visited with him.  He
had pleased his boss today and so was given several items of merchandise.  He
gave Mae a set of cooking utensils and me a shaving bag.  He and Mae stayed up
and visited for a while but I finally went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
were looking through some of Jace’s school work.  The one was really special to
us.  It was a small coloring booklet showing winter seines that you see out
your window.  One was of a mailman walking in snow, another of a bird sitting
on a branch covered with snow, another of a bike covered with snow and another
of a snow plow.  It then showed a window and asked what you see out your
window.  Jase drew the black and white checkered window valance that Shellie
had just made and then a bright sun coming up over the eastern mountains in
Arizona colors.  We thought that was quite an insight for someone raised in
sunny Arizona.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae also
found time to visit and listen to Quint and Kevis this evening.  she is quite a
neat Grandma.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, January 11, 2008</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t get
up until 7:45 but Mae was up getting the boys off to school.  She even walked
Jase and Kevis to their school to be with them and to get in some exercise. 
After breakfast I figured on the bolt needs for Roy’s trailer.  I called and
found that I could get the screws that I need at Copper State Bolt and Nut Co.
in Mesa.  I made a list of things we wanted to do and was ready to go.  Mae had
got on the internet and found several letters so we read them before going.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had a very
nice letter from Anna Lisa Mactal, telling of their challenges there in the Philippines.  
There was also one from Roger and again asking for money.  The Clarks added us
to their mailing list and sent information of their experiences in Norway.  The
Mcharry’s sent a letter telling us of their trip to northern Luzon in the Philippines. 
We had been to several of the places that they told about visiting.  It was
good to get the letters.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We then went
to the Walgreen’s on Riggs and Stapley.  We bought Birthday cards for Bob,
Scott and Jeff and we tried out a back massage pad that we are thinking of
buying.  We mailed Bob’s card and our Voter Registration cards.  We then went
to Ann’s and got a Vib treatment and a Low Level Lazar treatment.  We next went
on into Mesa and I bought the screws I need.  We stopped at a Sub-Way and got
some lunch before coming home.  I watched “the Red River” on video after we got
home.  Mae made us some dinner.  After dinner I wrote in my journal and studied
the material for the Sunday School lesson.  Roy didn’t find anyone to teach his
class so if I can get permission from the Bishop I will give the lesson for
him.  A fellow from the Ward called and asked if Roy had found some one to give
his lesson.  When Mae said that he hadn’t, he said he would, so I guess I don’t
have to worry about it.  Quint has his friend Mason staying the night with
him.  Kevis stayed with his friend Adam tonight.  Quint and Mason wanted to
watch a movie called The Men in Black.  I watched it with them just to have an
adult with them.  Mae didn’t want to watch it so she played with Jase.  The
show was worthless.  It should have been thrown in the trash can.  I worry
about the shows that Roy and Shellie let in their home.  I finished this entry
and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I though
about the show last night and still felt that it was a horrible thing to let
enter the mind.  I feel very concerned about this generation.  Mae got up and
got Garrett off to work this morning and then came back to bed with me.  We
waited until the other boys got up before we got up.  After breakfast I started
working on Roy’s trailer.  Quint came out and helped me.  it took us a little
while to decide the best way to re-assemble the decking.  We worked on until
this afternoon.  We probably put 6 or more hurs into it today.  Mae has been
busy all day with washing, cleaning house and quilting.  She made a nice dinner
for this evening but as normal Jase didn’t like it and Kevis is very picky. 
Garrett was late getting home from work and he just ate on the run.  We took
the rest of the boys and went over to the Frozen Yogurt store where we all had
yogurt and played games.  Kevis played Mae a game of chess which he won.  Quint
played me a game and I won.  We came back home.  Mae played with a game with
Jase and put him to bed.  Mae, Quint, Kevis and I then watched the show
“Newsies”.  It was a much better show than the one we watched last night.  At
11 PM I went in and took my shower.  I then turned the TV on and watched the
end of a movie.  Mae had continued to visit with Garrett and was late coming to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
before 7 AM and read my scriptures.  I went back to bed and slept until almost
10 AM.  Mae had been up since 8 AM.  I shaved, made the bed and went into the
kitchen and started breakfast.  I helped Mae start dinner and I worked on my
personal history.  We took the boys to church.  It is a late time to have the
block program when it starts at 3 PM.  It was dark when we came out of
meetings.  When we got home the boys changed their clothes.  Mae and I finished
dinner.  After cleaning up the dinner table Mae and Quint mixed and baked
cookies for a Family Home evening treat.  We had a nice evening getting the
boys, except for Garrett, to bed before 10 PM.  I filled in this journal entry
and then played a couple of games on the computer but I think I am going to
head to bed.  Mae is still upstairs with the younger boys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
4:45 AM and by the time I was ready to go back to bed it was time for Mae to
get up to get Kevis and Jase ready for school. She had got up and prepared
breakfast for Garrett and Quint.  I got up and shaved, said prayers, made the
bed and ate with Kevis and Jase.  Mae and I walked Kevis and Jase to school. 
We then continued to walk around the school park and on to home.  I helped Mae
quilt on Kevis’s quilt until David called and we talked for almost an hour.  It
was good to visit with him.  He said that they had got quite a lot of snow but
it is now melting quite fast.  When Garrett came home from school we ate
lunch.  I then went to the grocery store for a few items.  One of the things I
got was a ball of string for Jase’s kite.  The wind has blown just right for
kite flying.   I watched a video that was good. When Jase got home from school
the wind had just about stopped.  We tried it anyway but didn’t have very good
success.  We let Jase play on the park toys for a while before coming home.  I
watched a Maverick video and Mae got the quilt ready to sew the hem before we
ate dinner.  After cleaning up from dinner Mae, Kevis and I played darts, foes
ball and another game that is upstairs.  I drove over and got Quint from one of
his friends.  We read scriptures and discussed the 6<sup>th</sup> chapter of 1<sup>st</sup>
Nephi and how the first 116 pages of translated manuscript were lost and the
speed at which Joseph was able to translate the Book of Mormon.  I finished my
journal entry while Mae put the boys to bed.  We watched a show while in bed. 
Garrett came home from work and had stopped and got the mail.  He was excited
to let us know that my “J” key cover came.  He then installed and tested it and
of course had to report that success.  He is a special young man.</span></p>

6:15 AM but after prayers and reading the scriptures I went back to bed.  Mae got
up and got the younger boys off to school.  I think she walked them to school
and then continued for a morning walk before she came home and woke me.  As I
enter my journal it is sure nice to have a “J” key again.  Mae worked on the
quilt and finished it today.  I worked on the trailer for about 3 hours.  The
drill got quite hot so I quite for the day on that job.  I wish I had a heavy
duty drill when I do jobs like this.  Mae put beans on to cook with the ham
hawk left from the Christmas ham.   I found and watched the DVD of “Mclintock”
this afternoon.  I also went to Little Caesar’s and got two large pizzas.  it
was a good thing because none of the boys ate the beans.  When Kevis eats pizza
he wastes more crust than he eats.  The Quint never stop talking while we were
at the table so by the time we finished dinner I was about ready to scream.  I
came into the computer room and worked on my journal.  Mae took Quint to his
piano lesson and will be gone for about an hour.  We read scriptures with the
boys before Mae had the younger boy go to bed.</span></p>

5:45 AM but after reading scriptures I went back to sleep.  Mae got up and got
the boys off to school.  She woke me so I ate breakfast and then we went to
town.  We got another vib-treatment.  We then went to the Lehi area and took
pictures of our first and second homes in Arizona.  We next went to the Family
History Library to see about some training for my calling as a Ward Family
History Consultant.  We were told that the first thing that I needed to do is
to be registered as a Ward Family History Consultant.  In order to do this I
must have my Ward unit number, my membership number and my confirmation date. 
We were shown and told several things that I needed to be trained in.  By the
time we left there I felt completely overwhelmed with the calling.  We then
went out to eat lunch before coming home.  I lay down and took a nap and then I
worked a couple of hours on the trailer until Mae had dinner ready.  I tried to
call Bob this evening but didn’t get an answer at either Bob’s number or at
Mark’s number.  Mae had me take Quint and Kevis to Mutual at 7 PM.  After
returning I turned on the movie “Quigley Down Under”.  We watched about ½ of it
when Garrett brought the boys home.  While Mae got the boys to sleep I called
Bob again.  He and Mark had been out doing our Home Teaching and Carroll was in
Salt Lake with her sister.  Bob said that he would try to get the information
that I need and call me back.  We finished watching the show before going to
bed.  Garrett and I got talking so Mae went to bed with out me.</span></p>

up to get Kevis and Jase ready for school she realized that Quint had forgot to
set his alarm and Garrett had one to sleep in the Family room and hadn’t woke
up.  Those two were late for school.  I worked on the trailer again today and
got the decking finished except for one bar that needs to be bolted down and I
need some nuts and bolts for that.  I watched a show on video this afternoon.  This
evening I repaired the electrical wiring on the trailer.  Quint and I watched
“Search for Red October” tonight.  I took Kevis to Mervin’s to find Garrett. 
We needed Garrett to tell us the steps for getting on Shellie’s e-mail. 
Kevis’s teacher had sent his home work home through the inter-net.  </span></p>

boys went to school Mae and I went back to bed.  We went into the Temple and
went through a session.  After the session we ate dinner at the Temple’s cafeteria. 
The boys had just got home before we did.  I took Quint to his friends so he
could spend the night.  I then went to Walgreen’s and bought a Birthday card
and addressed it to Becky.  I also got a card ready for Jeff.  I took them to
the Post Office so that they have a chance of getting to them before their
Birthday is over.  I then stopped at The Home Depot and bought some nuts and
bolts for the trailer.  Mae is preparing dinner so I caught this journal entry
up.  During dinner I have to just keep my mouth shut and get finished as soon
as I can and leave the table.  I just get to upset at the pick eaters.  After
the dinner dishes were cleaned up we watched the movie “Red Fury”.  After
putting Jase and Kevis to bed, Mae and I watched “Sabrina”.  Garrett came home
about 11 PM and wanted to talk so Mae got up and visited with him.  I fell
asleep while they were visiting.  When Mae came back to bed we finished
watching the show.  Mae fell asleep during part of it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was after
2 AM when the show ended and we went to sleep.  We didn’t get up until almost
10 AM.  I helped Mae get breakfast ready.  I went over and got Quint.  We got
all the children doing Saturday chores.  I finished the last work on the
trailer and cleaned up.  I called Bob and he said that he had called Brother Saunders
but hadn’t received a call back.  Bob called me back in less than a half hour
with the information.  Brother Saunders said he had forgotten so he went right
over to the church and printed of my record.  Bob said that today the sun is
shinning up there but the temperature this morning was 6 degrees.  They also
have about 8 inches of snow.  I have Garrett outside mowing the grass here. 
Maybe it is nice to be here.  This afternoon we watched the movie “The Sons of
Katie Elder”.  We had to pause the show while we ate dinner.  Mae had made a
nice fried chicken with mashed dinner for us.  Roy and Shellie got home about
6:15 PM.  We stopped the show to welcome them home and then after the show
finished they showed us their pictures and told about their trip.  Every one
decided to watch another movie but I was tired so I started to bed.  I hadn’t
finished my journal entry so sat down to do it.  I opened my personal history
and added more to it before finishing my journal.  By the time I finished, the
show was over.  Mae and I took our showers and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke after
9 AM.  When I went into the family room Shellie was in there writing in her
journal.  I asked her if they would like biscuits and gravy for breakfast. 
When I mixed the biscuits I was sorry that I had mentioned fixing them for they
felt very heavy.  I know that the baking powder was old so I doubled the amount
that the receipt called for but the dough was still very heavy.  I was ready to
throw them into the trash and make something else but Shellie and Mae convinced
me to bake them anyway.  They weren’t the best but everyone ate them anyway. 
Mae and I called Jeff and wished him a Happy Birthday and visit with him for a
few minutes.  I worked on my personal history for a while, and then I got
talking to Quint about the importance of schooling.  We had to hurry in order
to get to church in time.  It was hard to believe how fast time went by today. 
We enjoyed the meetings.  In sacrament meeting the bishopric spoke and gave
very good talks.  The Sunday school class was very interesting with the subject
of the lesson being the Tree of Life.  In Priesthood class we discussed the
early life of the Prophet Joseph Smith.  I truly have to agree that his life is
amazing.  It is totally amazing to me that the Father knows all things from
beginning to end and all there is in between.  One person commented that if we
received Eternal Life we had it all.  I couldn’t help feel that if we received
eternal life then we have the opportunity to begin receiving everything that
God has.  We all pitched in to prepare dinner.  After dinner was over we held
Family Home Evening.  Garrett has in charge of an activity so he taught us a
game called Cork.  In reality you learn the game by catching on to and
remembering rules as they are generated in the game.  We quite playing at 11 PM
and that was fine with me.  I finished this entry and then I played a game of
spider solitary on the computer.  I lost about ½ dozen games and so quite.  Mae
decided that she would play a game while I brushed my teeth and got ready for
bed.  She got the game set up and then came into the bathroom for some hydrogen
peroxide to wash her mouth.  When she came back to the computer Shellie had
picked up the game and stayed to finish it.  I thought I would die laughing at
the situation.  We soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
until after 7:30 AM and when I went back to bed Mae ask the time.  It was 8:22
AM so she got up.  We said prayers and did our exercise before we got up to
make breakfast.  I called David as he had tried to call us last night at 5:30
PM.  We were not home from church until after 6 PM.  David had called to see
how soon I needed my truck returned for he had it at his place.  I assured him
the there was no hurry.  David said that they had got 12 inches of snow last
night which now makes them over 24 inches.  After breakfast Shellie, the boys,
Mae and I went to the Phoenix Zoo.  Even though Garrett was not in favor of
going to the zoo he enjoyed the day.  Roy had to work today.  We rented a bike
that Garrett described as a Flint Stone car.  It was fun but we had a bad
experience with someone complaining that Garrett was driving reckless.  This
was not true but we had a security patrol get after us.  After leaving the zoo
we went to Jack in the Box and ate dinner.  We then stopped at Block Buster and
Shellie picked up a couple of DVD.  This evening we watched the one DVD
entitled “Amazing Grace” which is taken from a true story of William
Wilberturth fight to stop slave trade.  It was really a good story and worth
watching.  I filled in this entry before going to bed.  We forgot to call Becky
to wish her a Happy Birthday.</span></p>

4 AM and didn’t want to get up but couldn’t go back to sleep.  I finally got up
and used the bathroom and then tried to sleep.  I think that I dosed off when I
heard Garrett and Quint up.  That ended my sleep so at 7 AM I got up and
showered.  Mae was awake from about 4:45 on so she was also short sleep.  We
found that Shellie also hadn’t slept much so we all tried to go back to sleep
after Kevis and Jase went to school.  I slept until 11 AM but I don’t think
Shellie and Mae went to sleep.  I watched a movie of a submarine crew during
World War II.  Mae and Shellie went shopping so I watched another show “Left
Behind”.  It was a interesting story also.  Shellie bought some trout so when
we got home I fillet them.  We will cook them for tomorrow evening.  Mae cooked
her rice and chicken casserole for dinner this evening and I think every one
enjoyed it.  After the dinner dishes were cleaned up we read scriptures as a
family.  We then watched a movie called “The Game Plan”.  It was fair but at
least I don’t recall much profanity or nudity in it.  </span></p>

shortly before 4 AM and after being up for a while Garrett and Quint got up to
go to school.  I was afraid that if I tried to go back to bed I would wake Mae
so I went into the family room and watch “The Cinderella Man”.  Shellie and I
worked on Jase and Kevis’s room painting a checker board design on the lower
27” of the walls.  We used masking paper and tape and then coated the edge of
the tape with paintable silicone caulk.  The caulk stopped the paint from
absorbing back under the tape and leaving an uneven edge.  It took us several
hours to get the masking completed but less than ½ hour to paint the area.  It
came out looking very well.  Mae and I went shopping for a few groceries and
then cooked trout and baked potatoes for dinner.  After dinner Mae and I took
Quint and Kevis to the church for Mutual.  Mae and I started a movie and then
we went to get Quint and Kevis.  Garrett had already picked them up by the time
we got there.  We read scriptures with part of the family and then went to bed.</span></p>

then got Kevis and Jase ready.  Both Mae and I walked Kevis and Jase to school
and then we went for a walk.  I sure enjoy being with Mae even if it is walking
the boys to school.  I fixed us some breakfast but Roy didn’t want pouched eggs
and when Shellie got up she had a bowl of prepared cereal.  Shellie and I then
put the border trim around the walls in the little boy’s room.  Mae came up and
helped some but mostly she cleaned up the kitchen.  Mae also got most of our
things packed up so that we are ready to leave for home tomorrow.  We started
to watch the show “Saints or Soldiers’.  This afternoon we went for another low
level lazar and vib-machine treatment.  When we returned home we watched the
ending of the show.  I entered this much of my journal entry and then I got
more of our things packed to go home.  </span></p>

prepared to leave.  We took our time as we didn’t want to be in the early work
traffic.  Roy also advised us to wait until after 8:30 AM to allow the traffic
to slow.  Roy was also very kind to us thanking us for all the help he have
been to he and Shellie while we were here.  He said that if it was to cold for
us when we got home we were sure welcome to return.  Shellie also told us that
we could return and if we would they would get a regular bed for that room.  We
have been sleeping on two air mattresses on top of each other.  It has been a
good time being here but we feel that it is also time to return home.  We
stopped at a Wal-Mark and bought Mae some Carmel Corn as we had bought some
earlier that Mae had really liked.  We had to got through our receipts to find
what store we had bought it before.  I also filled up with gas and added air to
the tires.  As we traveled I had to stop a few times for Mae to use a
restroom.  We enjoyed the drive and stopped at the Maverick station in
Flagstaff to get gas and also a frozen yogurt.  This is the only Maverick
station we have found in Arizona.  There was one in Page but it is closed for
re-building.  We got to Page about 3:30 PM and got us a room in the Motel 6 for
the night.  We enjoyed relaxing and taking a nap.  We went out to eat this
evening.  We first tried the Western café but they close early.  We then went
to the Dam Bar and Grill.  We had been told that they had good food.  it was
pretty good but it was also expensive.  I had prime rib but it wasn’t as good
as Maddox’s in Brigham City.  We did enjoy the relaxed evening with just the
two of us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Nick called
us as we were leaving this morning and was very concerned about Sandi.  He said
she was under a lot of stress at work and also is taking on to many other
peoples problem.  She had woke during the night crying and at 3 AM went down
and got in the hot tub.  He asked if it was necessary that she came out this
evening.  I ask him what she was coming out to.  He said that he understood
that our family was getting together this evening.  I told him that we were
just leaving Arizona and wouldn’t be there, I know that David was out of town
until Saturday evening and we had talked to Mike and he hadn’t told us of any
get to gather.  Nick then said that he understood that Jeff was having some
problems and Sandi was coming out to meet with him.  I told Nick that we would
make some calls and look into it.  We did and found that Sandi is under a lot
of stress with the position she has with the school union along with her
daughters wanting Mom to do to much for them.  We did talk to several and Sandi
and feel that Sandi has things fairly under control and she does want to go up
and be with Jeff for the evening.  We cushioned Sandi about taking on to much
but were greatful for her concerns for Jeff.  I think part of Nicks concerns
may be man’s understanding of the way women express themselves.  </span></p>

before we left the Motel, Sandi called and she and Mae talked for 20 minutes. 
I packed the car while they were talking.  It sounds like it was a good
experience for both Sandi and Jeff last night.  We drove on to Mike and Becky’s
with a few short stops along the way.  I sure enjoy being with Mae.  We went to
a school play at the High School where Mike works.  The title of the play is
“The Hidden Garden” and I had to really concentrate to follow the plot and what
was going on.  There was a brief explanation of the plot in the program that
really helped me to understand it.  The performers and orchestra did a very
good job.  Mike is very proud of his school and his position as Assistance
Principle and has very mixed feelings about the possibility that he will be
leaving the school to become a Principle next year.  It was late when we got
back home and Mike has a 9 AM meeting to attend so we soon went to bed.</span></p>

President and after that meeting she caught some Visiting Teaching caught up. 
Church block started at 1 PM.  After meetings Mae, Becky, Mike and I stayed as
Tayler Page was set apart as Beehive class president along with the rest of the
Beehive presidency.  Mike and Becky had a nice dinner ready shortly after we
got home from meetings.  As we were playing games as a family this evening one
of Mike’s friends called to give us the report that it had just been announced
that President Gordon B. Hinckley had passed away.  Although it was a shock yet
it was a feeling of gratitude and feeling good that he is now free from this
earths trials and he is also back with his Eternal companion and sweetheart
Marjory Hinckley.  Before going to bed we did turn on the news to hear the
reports of his passing.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early to have breakfast with the family.  Mike and Becky got off before 8 AM
and should be ahead of the storm that is predicted to get here today.  After
everyone got off I lay down and took a nap.  I called Mike about 11:30 and they
were just arriving at St. George and hadn’t been in any storm except a little
rain.  I cleaned the drain in the downstairs bathroom.  I also looked at
possibilities with that bathroom in remodeling it.  That is hard to really come
up with a real good situation.  This house is a difficult plan to remodel.  The
storm did hit right after I talked to Mike.  It really came down for about 3
hours and then let up.  After David came home from school I asked him if he
would use the snow blower and clean the walks.  When he finished and came in
Mae took the two little girls out to play in the snow.  When they got cold Mae
called me to have me open the garage door so that they could come through the
back.  When I pushed the opener the door would not lift.  David and got looking
and I saw that the one torch spring was broken.  I called to find a new set of
springs and Home Depot said that they had them.  This evening David and I went
down to get the springs.  We went to the grocery store first for a few items
and then to Home Depot.  They do not carry the springs that we need.  It was
too late to call other door company’s this evening.  We went on over to the
Maverik where we got us a frozen yogurt.  When we came home we held F.H.E. 
Taylor gave a very good lesson and F.H.E. went very well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6:15 AM and got Page and David off to school.  After the little girls went to
school I called some door company’s about the springs.  I found out that they
will not sell springs to an individual because of the liability law suites that
occur due to accidents from do-it-yourself customers.  I called Becky and she
talked to Mike during his lunch break and then she called me back and told me
to have the springs fixed.  A-1 Garage Door sent a man up at 2 PM and it only
took him ½ hour to replace the springs.  It cost $100 for the set of springs
and $75 for the installation.  This evening David and Page went to Mutual.  Mae
helped Mattie with her home work and while they did that Jessie and I played
catch with a rubber ball.  Then Mae, Mattie, Jessie and I played catch.  We
then popped corn and had treats before we put the girls to bed.  Becky called
and talked to the girls for a few minutes.  I filled in my journal.  Mae and I
played two games of Knock with Page and then she went to bed.  David came home
about then and we played one game with him.  I lost every time tonight.  I took
a shower before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5 AM although the alarm was set for 5:45 AM.  Mae didn’t sleep very well last
night.  Mae prepared breakfast so the David and Page could get off to school. 
It snowed last night so I got up and cleaned off the drive and walks.  Mae got
Mattie off to school about the time I finished.  I went upstairs and took a
nap.  When I got back up I packed up most of my things so that we can leave
when Mike and Becky get home.  I repaired the kitchen sink water faucet and
worked on the fireplace.  I think the thermocouple is out on the gas control. 
I had to give up and reassembled the fireplace.  After lunch I went downtown
and bought some M&amp;M candies for Mattie to make a project for school.  I
also bought some other groceries and tried to find some brown paper ether in
poster board or construction paper.  I couldn’t find any brown paper that would
work.  Mattie wanted to make some cookies out of paper and glue the M&amp;M’s
to it.  I called Mae and told her I was unable to find the paper.  She looked
for some brown cardboard and found a box that would work.  I also went to Home
Depot and bought some towel bars that I installed in the downstairs bathroom
when I got back to Mike’s.  Mae cooked a chicken casserole for dinner and we
stayed to eat with Mike and Becky when they got home.  We left Mike’s at 5:45
PM and drove to Sandi’s where we visited with Sandi for another two hours.  By
the time we got home, unpacked and to bed it was mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept until
7:20 AM when I got up.  I read my scriptures and did some exercisers before
going in to see if Mae was up.  She had just woke up.  Bob made biscuits and
gravy for us and we went up to at 9:30 AM.  After breakfast I ended up staying
for an extra 2 hours visiting with Bob and Mark.  Mae and I went through some
of our mail and updated our Christmas card list.  We also downloaded the
pictures from our camera and reviewed them.  Of course after downloading the
pictures we had to view them and 446 pictures take a little while to view.  I
then made a copy of those pictures for Shellie and put it on a CD.  I filled
out a couple of medical surveys that were sent to me.  Bob invited us up for
dinner this evening.  I then visited for an hour.  We watched a show on
Hallmark this evening that was cute.  We then gave each other haircuts and then
took a shower.  It is sure nice to be home again.</span></p>
