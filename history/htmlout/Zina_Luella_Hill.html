<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>            Zina
is my Grandmother on my mother’s side.  She was married to William M. Hill. 
Grandpa died of a heart attack when I was three years old so I don’t remember
him.  I remember of going to Sugar City where they lived.  Their home was white
and had a screened porch.  I believe that after Grandpa’s death Grandma stayed
with Aunt Vida for a short time.  The apartment on the West of our home became
vacant and I think it was then that Aunt Welma and Grandma moved in there. 
Uncle Lee was in the military because of World War II.  At the end of the war,
Uncle Lee and Aunt Welma returned to Teton.  I remember returning to Grandma
and Grandpa’s home in Sugar City and the grass had grown so tall that they had
to get a neighbor to come in with a hay mower to cut it before a regular lawn
mower could be used.  Grandma came to live with us from that time until her
death on December 31, 1958.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>            I
remember that Bob would sleep in the attic above Grandma’s apartment and I
believe that after Welma left Margaret would sleep with Grandma.  After
Margaret got married and Bob went into the service, Mrs. East who’s husband
died moved back to Victor.  She was the owner of the house and the
Mother-In-Law to Harold Homes, who lived to the house south of us.  Mrs. East
moved into the apartment, which Grandma had been living in, and Grandma moved
in with us.  Occasionally Grandma would go for a visit to her other children,
but home was with us.  I had a great love and respect for my Grandmother and
thought there was no finer woman on earth.  Grandma was always a very stately
person and her appearance was always very neat and well groomed. At home she
would wear a house dress but even that was always clean and neat.  When she
went anywhere outside the house she always dressed her best.  She helped me
with Church assignments and school homework, giving me lots of encouragement. 
Often in the evening she would have me brush her hair and often I would trim
the corns and bunions from her feet and toes.  She truly became a second mother
to me.  Mother worked most of the time outside of the home, but Grandma was
there to help us children.  In 1952 dad got a job with Hill Air Force so our
family to move to Utah, Grandma moved there with us.  In November 1954, on
Thanksgiving night Uncle Myron and Aunt Lila, their daughter Joyce and her
husband and Uncle Grant and Aunt Margie were all killed in an automobile
accident.  Uncle Myron had been in the Veterans Hospital in Salt Lake for an
eye operation to restore the sight in his eye.  He was released that morning to
return home.  Uncle Grant and the others had came down to take him home.  They
stopped and had Thanksgiving dinner with us in Ogden.  As they left our place
Uncle Myron made the comment that if he never ate another meal, he was sure
full then.  On the way home, a drunk ran into their car and killed all six of
them.  Grandma received some insurance money from that accident.  She used some
of that money to make the down payment on a home in Sunset for Mom, Dad and our
family on the condition that she could live there until her death. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>            Grandma
seemed to me to have had her share of trials.  During the flue academic of 1912
three of her children died with the flue, all with in 48 hours.  Grandma went
into a great depression and even some of the neighbors felt that she had lost
her mind and needed to be hospitalized.  She said that one day she looked out
the window and there stood ------- holding the baby in her arms and ------ by
the hand with the most peaceful look and she know that her children were ok. 
She was able to recover with that and continued with life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>            Once
Grandma told me of a spiritual experience she had that I have always remembered
and wondered about it.  I would like to preface this experience by telling a
little about her earlier marriage to Grandpa Hill.  William M. Hill was a
lumber jack for many of their early years of marriage and while raising their
family.  As a result of this occupation the family lived in the hills and
timber land during much of the family’s early years.  The boys grew up without
the Church activity to influence their lives.  As they chose girls to marry,
they were not members of the Church.  All the boys served in the military
during World War II.  Myron, Irven and Grant served in the navy and Floyd
served in the Marines.  When their father died, none of the boys were active in
the Church.  My mother, Aunt Vida and Aunt Wilma were active.  There were three
other children born to the family and I will say more about that later. 
Because the family lived in the timbering areas, none of the family attended
Church.  From all I was told Grandpa was a honest, hard working individual and
instilled this in all his children.  I have been told that Grandpa could stack
a deck of cards, while the sharpest of card players watched him, and he could
deal out any hand he wanted to any player.  Often being asked to demonstrate
this ability to others.  I was always told that even with this ability he was
never accused of cheating at anything.  On one occasion when Bob was a young
boy, Grandpa and Bob would often play checkers.  Grandpa would always win.  On
one occasion Grandpa had to be excused for a minute during a game.  While he
was gone Bob switched the position of one of the pieces.  When Grandpa came
back and looked at the board, he said, “You have moved a piece and that is
cheating.  I don’t play games with cheaters.”  It took Bob several months of
asking forgiveness and begging before Grandpa would forgive him and play a game
with him again but with a warning that he never cheat again.  When Grandpa grew
older and moved into town, he was deaf.  Without the aid of speaker systems and
hearing aids, like we have today, he couldn’t hear the speakers and the
program, so he stayed home.  Looking at the Church records you would say that
William Hill was inactive at his death.  Grandma told me that one night after
Grandpa’s death, he appeared standing at the foot of her bed.  She set up in
bed and he said to her, “Zina, unless you do more to getting our boys active in
the church than what you are doing, you will not be able to come to where I
am.”  That is all that Grandma said happened, but she did work more with her
family and before she died all the children except Uncle Floyd were active in
the Church and had been to the Temple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>            When
Grandma was a young girl, she and her sister Irene were out picking
huckleberries just a short distance from the house.  Having picked their
buckets full and evening setting in, they started for home.  As they were
walking they heard a baby cry.  Zina had been told by her parents that the cry
of a mountain lion sounded like a baby’s cry.  She told Irene to hurry for home
and not to stop.  As they hurried the sound seem to be just behind the bushes
and to the side of them.  The two told their parents about the experience and
the next morning their father took a rifle and went out to the area that the
girls had came.  He found prints of a large cougar that must have followed them
all the way to within a few yards of the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>            The
following experience was told to me, but I am not sure if I have the details
correct or not.  I don’t know if any one else heard or can remember the
experience or not.  If I can I will try to get a copy of this to Aunt Wilma and
she might be able to remember it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>            Hyrum
Oscar Crandell is my Great Grandfather on my mother’s side.  He was married to
Margaret Emma Guyman, my Great Grandmother and to Margaret’s younger sister in
a plural marriage.  During the time that the United State Government was
outlawing the practice of plural marriage and arresting any that were in this
agreement of plural marriage.  For the safety of the family, Hyrum decided to
take his family to Mexico.  This was being done by many families to escape the
laws being forced on them.  The family loaded their belongings into wagon’s and
with teams started the journey from Idaho to Mexico.  I guess there was many
trials with such a journey but the one that I remember of being told about
occurred as the family was in Southern Utah.  They found out that the sheriffs
posse was after them and would probably catch up to them the next day.  They
broke camp and had Hyrum’s oldest son, Hyrum Crandell “Jr.” stay behind.  When
the posse came into the Sharif asked for Hyrum Crandell.  Hyrum Jr. said I am
Hyrum Crandell.  The sharif them took him under arrest.  The Sharif them put Hyrum
Jr. on his horse and took him back to the closest constable.  When questioned
by the constable, Hyrum Crandell Jr. was able to testify that not only was he
not guilty of practicing polygamy but that he wasn’t even married.  It was his
father that they were looking for.  The law had to release Hyrum and by that
time the rest of the family had traveled a safe distance away.  When he family
arrived in Mexico Hyrum built a nice home and got a farm started.  After
getting things set for the youngest wife he took his first wife back to Idaho
and never saw his second family again.  One of the daughters kept a day by day
journal of this experience but when it was all over the family decided that
some one might get a hold of the journal and cause trouble so the journal was
burned.</span></p>
