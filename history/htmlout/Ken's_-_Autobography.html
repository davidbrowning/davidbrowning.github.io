<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On February 27, 1939, I was born at my Grandpa
and Grandma Hill’s home in Sugar City Idaho, the second son to Charles Henry
Browning and Emma Margaret Hill Browning, they were married   Two and a half
years earlier, September 22, 1936, LeRoy had bee born and five years after my
birth, on March 1, 1944 Dan Irven was born.  Although we made several moves
during the first three years of my life, the place I remember as home was
Victor, Idaho.  Victor is a small farming community, with a population of 150,
located in the Teton Basin, west of the Grand Teton Peaks and just over that
mountain from Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Here I remember most of my childhood days
as we lived there until I was twelve years old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Both my father and mother had been previously
married.  Dad’s first wife, Viola Rebecca McFate, had suddenly became sick and
died the following day, Oct. 23, 1932.  It was listed on her death certificate
that she died from Consumption.  (From everything that we have been able to
find out, she probably died from “Ruptured appendix)  Florence Ora or as I
remembered her “Floss”, was in High School and Richard Stephen or as I always
knew him “Rich” was 8 years old, the two of them were still living at home.  Geneva
Rebecca, Dad’s oldest daughter was married to Clyde Thomas and lived in Rexburg,
Idaho and Cleo Henry, the oldest son was married to Norma Bean and lived in
Thornton.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My Mother had been married to Lester Young, but
had divorced.  To that marriage was born Margaret and Floyd Robert, as I always
knew him as Bob.  Mother had moved back home with two children, living with her
Mother and Father.  The timing was during the Great Depression.  Due to the
depression, Grandpa Hill had been laid off work and having three more added to
the family, it put quite a heavy strain on the budget.  From what I was later
told, “Charles approached Margaret (my mother) with the idea that if they were
to marry, he could help her raise her two children and she could help him raise
his two children, still at home.  To this suggestion, Margaret said that she
wouldn’t consider the idea.  She told him that she had no notion of marring a
man twice her age, Dad being 50 years old and she being 25 years old”.  My
Mothers Aunt Bertha, found out, a short time later and took my mother aside telling
her that her and the two children had put a great strain upon her parents, when
they hardly had enough food on their table for their own family, let alone adding
three more due to her not being able to hold her marriage together.  The next
day, Margaret approached Charles and said, “I am not in love with you now and I
doubt that I will ever be in love with you, but if you still would like to take
care of me and my children, then I would consent to marring you.”<i>Some where
in that agreement there must have been a mis-understanding, as Mom never did
help Dad raise his two children, and she kept her word that she never did love
him.  On one occasion Mom told me that she never did love my Father.  To this I
told her “I always know that and from the time I was old enough to understand
how children are conceived, I wondered how me and my two brothers were
conceived.!” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I guess that because Geneva, Cleo and Florence were
married before I was born, they seemed like Uncle and Aunts to me.  Rich was at
home for a while but my first real remembrance of him, was of him, was he being
in the army.  At that time, world war II was in progress.  I can remember when
the war ended, and Rich came home.  The day he arrived home, he had two friends
with him.  It seemed so funny to me as Rich was about 5”6” high and both of his
friends had to duck their heads to walk through a 6’8” standard door opening. 
I believe that the three of them only stayed overnight.  Then next thing I
remember is that Rich had found a job in Jackson Hole and was living there. 
The next time I saw Rich is when he came home to introduce his new wife to
Dad.  The thing that impressed me most, at that time was how beautiful Lois
was.  Also, I had been told that Rich, as well as Cleo, were colored blind.  I
don’t think I really understood that until, as Rich and Dad were talking, I was
mainly just lessoning, Lois came out of the house.  I remember how beautiful she
looked in her red dress.  (Now you need to know, that Mom had just painted, as
few days previse, the porch a light green.)  As Lois, came out, Rich looked at
her and made the remark, “Your dress is the same color as the porch”.  We all
got quite a chuckle out of that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As far as Margaret and Bob, I always thought of
them as full Sister and Brother because I grow up with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Also, I had two nephews, Dee &amp; Larry and two
nieces Nola &amp; Daline that were older than myself, a nephew, Rex, just
younger than me and two nieces, Judy and Vieda close to Irven’s age.  That
always seems strange to be called Uncle Ken.  On one occasion, when I was about
12, I stayed a night with Cleo and Norma.  The following morning was Sunday so
I went to Priesthood meeting with my seventeen year old nephew, Larry, who was
almost 6 feet tall.  As we walked towards the Church house we met some of his
friends, who also looked like they were 6 feet tall.  Larry introduced me to
his friends as Uncle Ken.  I Still remember feeling so small that I would like
to have crawled through the grass and hid myself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             My mother told me that when I was three years
old, I had my tonsils removed and while recovering I found and ate a soda
cracker, which started my throat to hemorrhage.  My mother quickly put me in
the pickup and took off for the nearest hospital.  About half way there, I
threw up and it was all blood.  Mom was panicked, and being close to the Indian
Reservation, went in there to find a doctor.  She drove there as she knew I
would probably not make it to the hospital.  She found a doctor, but he told
her that he couldn’t touch me since I wasn’t Native American and didn’t live on
the reservation.  Finally, when he saw me coughing up blood, he quickly took
care of me and saved my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My Father had had several occupations, from
farming, grain elevator manager, painter and a butcher.  The decision to move
to victor was because Delos Larson wanted Dad to open a meat department in his
General Store.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Roy and I looked a lot alike as children, but we
had very different personalities and were constantly fighting and arguing as we
grew up.  Mom said that I was a good-natured child and could play for hours
with two cans and some dirt.  I would sit and pour the one can of dirt into the
other and keep myself amused for a long time until Roy would come and kick them
over or take them away.  Mom had tried everything she could think of to stop
the two of us from fighting but nothing worked.  Once day Mom had had her
fill.  She told us that the next time she caught us fighting she would take us
outside, roll up our pant legs, and then we were to start hitting each other. 
She told us that each time we stop fighting; she would swat our bare legs with
a willow.  Well it wasn’t long until Roy and I were back at it.  Mom carried
out her threat, but when we were forced to fight it didn’t seem to be as much
fun.  Sure enough, when we wouldn’t fight the willow came across our legs. 
Soon Roy had had enough, so he took off running down the street.  Mom chased
him, caught him, and swatted his legs with each step he took, all the way back
home. By the time they got back Mom was so exhausted and upset that she went
into the house and forgot about me.  This was one time that Roy really got the
worst of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Victor, Idaho</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Although we made several moves during the first
three years of my life, the place I remember as home was Victor, Idaho.  Victor
is a small farming community located in the South end of the Teton Basin, west
of the Grand Teton Peaks.  We moved there as Dad had been offered to run a
Butcher Shop in the Delos Larsin Grocery store.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our first home was located on the east side of
Main Street in Victor and then we moved to a home on the west side of Main
Street and a half block further south. This home was owned by Mr. and Mrs.
East, who lived in California.  Harold Holms, their Son-In-Law, lived next door
to the South.  I believe that arrangements to rent that home were made through
the him.  We lived in that home until I was twelve years old. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember when we first moved into the home, it
seemed to me to be a big home.  <i>Years later Mae and I had the opportunity
and go through the home.  The “large dining /living rooms were each 12’ X 12’
the kitchen and bathroom were each 8’ X 12’ and the two bedrooms were each 10’
X 12’</i>.<i> </i>  It was a two-bedroom home with a large dinning / living
room, a kitchen and a bathroom.  The one bedroom was Mom and Dads room.  Mom
later built a small clothes closet in the one corner of their bedroom. The
second bedroom was entered by entering the bathroom and then entering the
bedroom, which became an awkward problem at times.  Mom soon took care of that
situation, by having a carpenter build her a large fruit cabinet and placed it
so that it formed a hall way, with one door going into the bedroom and another
going into the bathroom, a much better arrangement.  I believe, I remember how
we all slept, as there was 6 of us in a two-bedroom home.  Mom and Dad, had
their own room.  Margaret, Roy and I had the second bedroom and Bob slept on
the couch in the front room. Margaret had a double bed.  Roy and I slept in a
single youth bed with one on one end and the other at the other end.  Bob slept
on the front room couch.  When Irven was born, a crib was put in Mom and Dad’s
bedroom, for him to sleep in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we had Family from out of town come for
special occasions, that shuffled things.  I remember that some of us slept on
the front room floor.  Sometimes Margaret would go up to Uncle Albert and Aunt
Vida’s, where I believe she slept with Barbara.  Somehow things worked out</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            With the front room/dining room arrangement, it
was large enough, that by putting the furniture back against the walls, we
could set up tables extending through both rooms.  I remember that setup for
Thanksgiving Dinner and other special events.  It worked out, even if some of
use children had to eat in the kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On the West end of the house, was a small
one-bedroom apartment.  For some time, a young divorced lady rented that
apartment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             After the death of my Grandfather William Hill,
when I was three years old, Grandmother Hill moved from their home, in Sugar
City to live with Aunt Welma and Uncle Lee Wilding, on the Wilding farm east of
Teton.  Then when America joined with allies in World War II, Uncle Lee was
drafted into the Army.  The decision was made for Grandmother and Aunt Welma to
rent the back apartment and moved to Victor, as Uncle Lee was stationed
overseas in the Philippines.  Aunt Welma was pregnant with their first child.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After the war ended and Uncle Lee returned home,
Aunt Welma returned to Teton, Idaho with him, but Grandma remained in the
apartment.  That made it nice for us as Margaret would sleep with Grandma.  At
this point, Grandma just became part of our family, as far as I was concerned. 
Even though she lived in the back apartment, she ate and spent most of her time
with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The next big event came with the engagement of
my sister Margaret’s to Dean Beasley.  They purchased a lot South and West from
where we lived.  They then bought an older farm home that was about 6 miles
west and north of victor.  The farmer that had owned the home, had built a new
home and they had just moved out of this home.  The home was jacked up and two
skid beams placed under the home, then laying fencing poles sideways under the
skid beams (the fence poles acted as small wheels, the house could then be pull
with a caterpillar.  I remember helping with this job, by carrying the fence
poles, as the beam rolled over the poles and the poles came out the back end of
the house, carrying them back to the front of the house where someone would
place the pole back under the skid beams, again.  Dad would not allow me to put
the poles under the beam, for fear that I could slip, and the house pulled over
me.  Shortly after moving the home into place, Margaret and Dean were married and
the ceremony was performed in our front room, with our Bishop performing the
wedding ceremony.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            With Margaret moving out, that left Grandma
alone in the apartment.  Mother didn’t feel good with her being alone.  As
there was an access through the ceiling, in one of the closets in the back
apartment to the attic of the house, Mom made a sleeping area in the attic
where Bob would sleep.  This also let Roy have the double bed, and Irven slept
with me in the twin bed, giving Mom and Dad more room in their bedroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            However, this arrangement didn’t last very long
when we heard that Mr. East had passed away.  We were also informed that Mrs.
East was moving back from California to Victor.  She would live in the
apartment and that meant that Grandma had to move out.  Also, at this time, Bob
graduated from High School and joined the U.S Airforce.  And so, Mom and Dad
bought a bunk-beds and so Roy slept in the top bed and Irven and I slept in the
lower bed.  That gave Grandma room for her double bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad’s business as a butcher was going well. 
Besides the butcher counter, in Larson’s grocery store, Dad started killing his
own beef, sheep and pigs.  He was using a wood framed shed just out the back
door of the store.  When the Government enacted the U.S.D.A. which regulated
the handling of all meat butchered for retail sales.  The inspector told Dad
that he could no longer kill his own meat, in the shed.  He would have to
purchased his meat through an approved Slaughter House that met U.S.D.A.
standards.  There was a Slaughter House, ten miles north in Driggs, but Dad did
not like the way they handled or cut their meat.  The decision was made that
Dad build his own Slaughter House.  He purchased a five-acre lot, outside the
north west corner of Victor’s city limits.  I believe that with the help of
Uncle Irven, Mother brother, Dad and Mom drew up the plans and got them
approved by the U.S.D.A. standards.  I don’t know if Dad hired a contractor or
if he just built the building under his own direction with as little as
possible hired help and a lot of volunteered help.  I do remember of walking
down to the project and watching them hand pour the cement, after it was mixed
in a small cement mixer, poured into wheel barrels and pushed to the forms, up
2” X 12” wood planks.  With in a short time, Dad opened his own Slaughter
House. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             At first Dad tried to maintain the Butcher Shop
and run the Slaughter House in the evenings and Saturdays. Then as business
continued to pick up, Mom tried to take over the meat counter at the store and
Dad running the Slaughter House.  However, it didn’t last long when the two
operations became to much stress on the family.  Dad at that point closed his
Meat Counter in the store and went full time with the Slaughter House.  Dad’s
business continued to grow even to the point that Dad got complaints from the
Driggs Slaughter House, that he was hurting their business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have many fond memories about the Slaughter
House, both good times and hard work that we were involved with.  I believe
that some of my fondest memories were going with Dad to the auction in Idaho
Falls and Rexburg.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad, had one big problem.  He had grown up
believing that “A MANS WORD WAS HIS BOND ” and he ran both the Butcher Shop and
the Slaughter House with that philosophy.  It didn’t work!  I remember one
evening Dad came home and Mom was at the kitchen table writing letters.  Beside
her was a stack of Dad’s (approximate 3” X 5”) carbon copy bill books.  When
Dad came in and saw the Bill Books, he asked her what she was doing?  She
answered that she was just writing to some of these customers, asking if they
could pay some on their accounts.  Dad got very angry and said, “these people
gave me their word that they would pay and you don’t write them to remind them
of their promise.” In Fall of 1950, Dad closed up his shop and went to work in
Bute Montana for a meat packing company.  He would sleep in the back of his
pickup with only a homemade shell, cook his breakfast on a two-burner camp
stove and work in the packing plant during the day time.  After work on Friday,
he would he would leave work and drive home, getting home quite late in the
night.  Spend some time with the family on Saturday and Sunday, leaving home
late Sunday afternoon, getting to Bute in time to start work on Monday
morning.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>              We lived in that home until I was twelve years
old.  Attached to the back of the home was a small one-bedroom apartment.  For
a short time, there was a younger that rented that apartment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Often, I would take the 22 rifle and go rabbit hunting in a nearby
field.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Again, when I was 11 years old, on a warm
Saturday, I went fishing with Rich and Lois.  Although I had caught many fish
by hand, I had never been fishing with a pole and caught a fish.  On this
occasion I was sitting on an old wooden bridge and let the line out until it
was just about to a large bush.  I saw a fish come out to take the bait but as
I started to reel in, the fish only followed for a little way and then turned
back.  I again let the line out towards the bush and again the fish came out. 
I don’t know how long I continued playing with the fish, but it was for some
time.  Finally, the fish darted out and grabbed the bait.  It was a thrill that
I had never witnessed before.  I played the fish, enjoying the sport for as
long as I could, before landing the fish.  I then walked back to the car. 
There Lois was on a blanket reading a book with Janet, just a baby, sleeping. 
I wasn’t feeling very well so I laid down and soon fell asleep.  When Rich returned
they tried to wake me but couldn’t.  Rich put me in the car and they brought me
home.  I learned, three days later, that when I wouldn’t wake up, Mom called
Uncle Albert, who came and administered to me.  On Tuesday morning, I woke and
felt fine.  On Thursday, Mom took me into the Doctor.  The reason for the delay
was due to the fact that we only got a Doctor in the valley one day a week. 
After examining me, the Doctor said I was now ok.  “Thanks” mainly go to
Heavenly Father for blessing me in both of these occasions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            During my grade school years, I attended school
in a three-room log cabin.  Our school house had burned down the summer before
I started school.  The men of town built this cabin as a temporary school house
until a new school could be built.  We had 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup>
grades in one room, 3<sup>rd</sup> &amp; 4<sup>th</sup> grades in the next room
and 5<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>th</sup> grades in the third.  The 7<sup>th</sup>
and 8<sup>th</sup> grades met in, what we referred to as the old Bank Building,
as that was what it originally was, but the bank had gone under with the
depression and had remained empty since.  By the time I got to the 7<sup>th</sup>
grade that building was vacated, and we were bused to the Chapin school about
three miles north of town.  When we returned to school, after the Christmas holidays,
our new school house was completed and all the grades - first thru eighth went
there and the other buildings were vacated.  Grades nine through twelve were
bused to the High School in Driggs, ten miles to the north.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*******</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>            All of dad’s children,
from his first marriage, except for Rich who was the youngest, were married
before I was old enough to remember.  They seemed more like aunts and uncles to
me rather than brothers and sisters.  Also, I had two nephews, Dee &amp; Larry
and two nieces Nola &amp; Daline that were older than myself, a nephew, Rex,
just younger than me and two nieces, Judy and Vieda close to Irven’s age.  That
always seems strange to be called Uncle Ken.  On one occasion, when I was about
12, I stayed a night with Cleo and Norma.  The following morning was Sunday so
I went to Priesthood meeting with my seventeen year old nephew, Larry, who was
almost 6 feet tall.  As we walked towards the Church house we met some of his
friends, who also looked like they were 6 feet tall.  Larry introduced me to his
friends as Uncle Ken.  I remember feeling so small that I would like to have
crawled through the grass and hid myself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Irven was five years younger than me but was my
tag-a-long.  He always wanted to go with me, and I usually took him, until I
grew older (in High School) and had friends that I wanted to be with.   Mom
said that he was lost when I started dating and wouldn’t take him with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Rich lived with us a few years in Victor that I
can vaguely remember.  He worked in the Rock Quarry, west of Driggs.  There
they mined lime stone rocks that were shipped by rail to the Idaho Falls U&amp;I
Sugar factory.  The lime stone was used somehow in the processing of Beet
Sugar.  He then joined the Army and I only remember that he mailed letters to
us occasionally.  Rich had several experiences that I have written up in my
history.  One of the main things I remember of Rich is when he came home from
the service he brought two friends with him.  It seemed so funny to me because
Rich is only about 5 foot 6 inches tall, and both of his friends were so tall
that they had to actually duck as they went through the doorways in our home.  I
also remember when Rich brought Lois home to introduce her to his family,
before their marriage.  I thought that Lois was one of the prettiest and nicest
ladies I had ever met.  I remember sitting out on the back porch with Dad and
Rich.  Mom had painted the porch a light green color just a few days earlier.  Lois
came out in a very pretty red dress.  Rich made the comment: “Your Dress is the
same color as the porch.”  At first we all sat there kind of dumb like, and
then it dawned on us that Rich was color blind.  We then got a chuckle over his
comment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            All of us kids were raised in the church and
taught the principles of the Gospel, although I have often wondered by whom and
just how.  I believe that I have to give most of the credit to good Primary and
Sunday school teachers.  Dad had been ordained a High Priest, mainly because of
his age, but he wasn’t the most active high priest in the ward and in his later
years in Sunset, he would occasionally attend Priesthood meeting, if he was
asked to attend.  I guess most of my home encouragement and training in the Church
was given me by my mother, who really wasn’t active until we moved to Utah.  My
grandmother always encouraged me in my church assignments as mom always worked
to provide for the family need.  That was the situation until shortly before I
married.  My Primary teacher was the one that saw to it that I was baptized. 
She came to my house and picked me up on the Saturday prior to Fast Sunday,
drove me to the Stake house in Driggs where I was baptized.  She was the only
person, attending that Baptismal service that I knew.  The next day, during our
fast &amp; testimony meeting, my Uncle Albert confirmed me a member of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  None of the rest of my family was
even there. While in Victor, I graduated from Primary and was ordained into the
Aaronic Priesthood as a deacon.  As a youth in Victor, I often remember that
during the beautiful summer nights of sleeping out under the starry sky.  Some
times that was up in the mountains with family camping trips and often just in
the yard at home.  In Victor I only remember of two or possibly three street
lights in town and so in the clear summer nights the sky was such a spectacular
sight that I always thought of the great hand of God it the creation of the universe. 
As far as I can remember I always know that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of
God.  That Joseph Smith was truly called to translate the Book of Mormon and
restore the Priesthood and Authority of God to Prophets called in these latter
days.  I have had many experiences that has built and strengthened my testimony
of the Gospel.  I have received personal testimony that The Church of Jesus
Christ is true and being directed through men called of God.  I know that I
have received personal answer to many personal prayers.  I have received a
personal revelation that the Book of Mormon is the word of God and given to us
in this Last Dispensation of Time to witness the Divinity of God the Father and
His Son Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  **(I need to make an insertion here, so as not to discredit
my mother in any way, as she had many experiences in life to challenge most of
us.  I believe that you can get a better idea of her life by reading her
personal history.  I love my Mother and have deep respect for her.  I also want
to state that I have great respect and love for my Father.  As I have thought
about his life I have often wondered how he stood the test that he went
through.  I can only pray to my Heavenly Father, asking for the strength to
sustain me that I can endure as well as he did in my trails and challenges of
life. )</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             The only grandparent I knew was my grandmother
Hill, as Grandpa Hill died before I could remember him.  My father’s mother
died when he was still a 8 years old and his father was murdered when a bandit
held up his grocery store in Idaho.  Grandma Hill lived with us until her death
in December, 31, 1958.  She was really a second mother to me. I will always be
grateful to her for her guiding influence to me as well as to all the rest of
the family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As I said, Dad wasn’t the most active person in
the ward, but during the summertime I remember many choice weekends camping in
the hills that were so near to us.  I guess it was from Dad that I gained my
great love for camping, but my love for fishing came from my brother, Bob.  One
thing Dad did teach us was the value of work and being honest to your fellow
man.  I don’t think Dad ever made an unfair deal or cheated anyone in his life;
in fact, he expected the same from almost everyone he met and because of this
it made him feel bad to remind people that they still hadn’t paid their bill. 
Because Dad would not collect from those that had charged and never paid what
they owed, he finally had to close his business in 1951.  After closing his
slaughter house, Dad went to work for a meat packing company in Butte,
Montana.  At this time, Bob was home on leave from the U.S. Air Force.  One day
while Dad was in Montana, Bob went down to the slaughter house, just mainly to
look around.  He found two orange crates, one full and the other over half full
of bill books.  These were charge slips where Dad had allowed customers to
charge meat or butchering services, which had never been paid.  Knowing that
Mom and Dad were struggling from lack of finances, Bob took them to the County
Attorney, to see if they were collectable.  He was told that about ½ of them
were out dated (7 or more years old) but the others were collectable.  Bob was
told that all he needed was Dad’s Power of Attorney and they could collect
them.  Bob could hardly wait for Dad to come home that weekend.  As soon as Dad
arrived home, Bob told Dad what he had found out.  Without saying a word, Dad
put his hat and coat back on and drove to the slaughter house, where he built a
fire and burned the bills.  When Bob asked, why! Dad said that he would hurt
people’s feelings if they tried to collect on the charge bills.  That was the
end of the discussion.  Dad drove to Montana on Sunday afternoon to be to work
Monday morning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Dad slept nights in the back of his pickup and
drove home Friday night to be with the family on the weekends.   On one of
these trips home, the steering column on the pickup broke causing him to wreck
the truck and almost lose his life.  I remember listening to Dad tell Uncle
Albert of his realization that he was dead.  He said he could remember standing
outside of the pickup, looking at his body as it laid in the upside down
pickup.  He said he was not sure how long he was outside his body, but then he
remembered of the great effort of trying to breathe again.  After getting out
of the hospital and getting his strength back, it left him without any
transportation, and therefore, no way to go back to his job in Butt, Montana.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After Dad’s death I have tried to
recalled to memory that experience and have wondered why Dad would have been in
the area, where that accident happened.  One time while visiting Lois, I
mentioned that to her.  A short time later Lois and I were again visiting about
the matter.  Lois asked about my memory of there were broken eggs around the
wrecked pickup.  The question then came up as to why for the eggs being in the
area.  I remembered that Dad would sometimes bring eggs home when he came home
from Montana where he was able to buy the eggs from a Egg Farm in Butte at a
very low price and Mom would try to sell them locally to help with finances. 
From what Dad has said there was more than just one case of eggs.  Lois then
expressed the idea that Dad may have been bringing the eggs to some of the
restraints in West Yellowstone.  If that was the case that would explain not
only the eggs scattered at the wreck but why Dad was taking that route home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Following Dad’s recovery, Dodge (Myron Davis),
Margaret’s husband, called Dad and told him that he thought he had a job for
the two of them painting.  Dad took the bus to Idaho Falls where he. Dodge and
another man started painting a three story building.  They had only been
working for a short time when Dodge said to Dad, that he didn’t feel very safe
on the scaffolding.  They were on the very top of the scaffolding, without a
safety rail or any safety gear.  Dad said that he was just thinking that very
thing.  At that time the third man working with them slipped and fell.  Dad
said that he and Dodge just watched as the man would hit one brace, then fall
to the next brace and continued until he hit the ground.  Dad and Dodge just
looked at each other and climbed down.  By the time they got down others were
around the man, so they just walked off the job.  The next day Dad was looking
through the news paper for a job when he saw an ad that Hill Air Force Base in
Ogden Utah was hiring and the position of painter was among the listings.  Dad
took the Greyhound bus to Ogden the next day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*********</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There were many choice memories that took place in
Victor before moving to Ogden.  One experience I shall always remember is when
Dad gave me a small Weiner pig.  It was probably one of few trained pigs, but I
had him trained so that he would come when I called him.  He’d eat out of your
hand, and we used to ride him all over.  The only problem was that he grew so
big that he could not raise himself up after lying down, every time he needed
to go down to the creek for water, Dad had to raise him up with a pole. 
Finally Dad felt that he had to get rid of him because of his size.  One day
when we were at school, Dad went ahead and butchered him.  He had to sell all
of the meat because no one in the family would eat it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Dad giving me a dog named Pete.  He
was one year old and his breeding was a cross between an English staghound and
greyhound.  When full grown, he weighed between 95 and 100 pounds.  He stood
about three to three and one half feet tall, and could put his paws on the top
of a full grown man’s shoulders and lick the top of his head.  He became a
great friend to Irven and I, but was always considered to be my dog.  There in
Victor we had hard winters which lasted at least six to seven months with the
snow always covering the fences.  I trained Pete as a sled dog, and had made a
regular dog sleigh for him to pull.  Because of his breeding he was very fast. 
I can remember one fall as we went up into the hills to get our winter’s supply
of firewood.  (Yes, in those days we used wood and coal for cooking and
heating.  We had a oil stove in the living room but often it would get so cold
that the oil would set up and wouldn’t flow.  It became Roy’s and my chores
every night to chop firewood carry in coal for the stove).  We took Pete with
us in the back of the truck, but when we had filled the truck with logs it made
him nervous to ride on the logs, so he jumped off the truck and ran along the
side of the load.  My mother was driving the pickup and Dad was riding in the
back with Irven and I. When we got to the highway, Dad leaned towards Mom and
told her to see how fast Pete could run.  We clocked him for a little over
thirteen miles at 55 miles an hour, then, within the next mile, he slowed down
and stopped.  There was an irrigation ditch full of cold water and he just fell
into it.  I was afraid that the cold shock might cause him to have a heart
attack so when we got home I got on the bike and rode back.  When I rode up to
him he jumped up, shook of the water and came trotting back home with me.  In
often raced Pete against my friends and their dogs.  Pete and I could always
win, except if we tried to race on Main Street.  Somewhere he had been trained
or had a natural instinct, not to run on Main Street.  One year I decided to
enter Pete into the races. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Each year, Victor would host a Winter
Carnival.  Main street would be blocked off from all other traffic.  There
would be horse races of every kind, teams pulling Bob Sleighs, cutter sleigh,
saddle and bare back races, weight pulling contest.  There were all kinds of
skiing contest, dog team races and the one I was the most excited for was the
single dog sleigh race.  These events drew contesters and spectators from all
over the country.  I knew that the races were always held on Main Street, but
felt that with at least 20 to 30 other entries and all the rest of the
activities and races that would be going on, Pete wouldn’t mind racing there. 
However, he did mind and when the gun fired for the Dog Race, I was the only
one who had a dog and sleigh that was still sitting on the starting line.  I
have many other memories of Pete, but in this history there isn’t room for them,
so I’ll put them in “My Stories”.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I still remember the year I got my snow skis.  I
learned to ski on the old potato cellar just across the street from our home. 
The next year, we felt that we wanted something a little more exciting, so one
Saturday, Nate Hill, Bob Jacobs and myself wanted to go up to the foot hills. 
We didn’t have the money to ride the lift at the ski hill, but we had a nice
hill we enjoyed.  On that Saturday, I was told I could go, but to be sure to be
home before the sun went down.  We had a great day and as the sun got lower in
the sky, we decided we had time for one more trip down the hill.  About halfway
up the hill, Bob said he was too tired to climb to the top, so he would meet us
at the bottom.  Nate and I continued to climb and when we stopped for a rest,
we looked down the hill and Bob was lying down in the snow.  We debated for a
moment, then skied down and found that he had fallen and badly sprained his
ankle.  Bob was much larger than either of us, so we had to almost carry him
home.  It took us what seemed hours to go that one and one half miles to his
home, and by the time we there, it was way past sundown.  When I got home my
feet were starting to freeze.  Dad just took a knife cut my ski boots off.  I
still remember that they then put my feet in cold water and snow, to bring out
the frost bite.  I was crying, not because of the pain but that was the first
time I had ever had a pair of real ski boots, even though they were 2<sup>nd</sup>
hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Move to Ogden</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Finally in the summer of 1952, Dad came to Utah,
having seen an ad in the news paper that Hill Air Force Base was hiring
painters.  Dad took the bus and came to Ogden to apply for the job.  Dad was at
that time 66 years old and when he was filling out his application he thought,
“If I put 66 years of age down, they won’t even look at this application.”  So
he changed his birthday from 1886 to 1896 and got the job.  He worked there
until he was 72 years of age, 62 by their records, at which time he retired.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad had a heart attack on a Sunday evening and
when I came home, Mom asked me to see if he would let me call a doctor.  I went
into his bedroom and he had sweat pouring off his face like a hose was running
over his head.  Dad refused to let any of us call any one.  The next morning
his alarm went off and he got up and went to work as normal.  Each day when he
returned home he would complain to Mom that his chest hurt so badly.  Mom kept
telling him that he needed to go into the Doctor, but Dad would refuse. Unbeknown
to Dad Mom had called the Doctor.  The Dr. told her that he was sure that Dad
had suffered a heart attack but there was nothing he could do if Dad wouldn’t
come in.  He told her that he should go directly to the hospital.  Mom told
him, “That where was no way that he would be willing to do that.”  Dr. Taylor
told her not to worry about the hospital, He would take care of that if she
could get Dad into him.   Finally on Thursday dad went into see Dr. Taylor. 
Dr. Taylor lessened to Dad’s heart and then said, ‘I need to have an X-ray but
my machine was not working so he would have to take him up to the hospital to
use their machine.”  When they got to the hospital and put a gown on dad and
put him on a table, then Dr. Taylor handed Dad a clip board with a form on it
and said, “Charly, I need you to sigh this form before they can take the
x-ray.”  Without reading the form, Dad signed it.  It was an admission form. 
When the x-rays came back and Dr. Taylor read them, they confirmed that Dad had
indeed had a saver heart attack.  The heart had torn away from it’s lining and
scar tissue was forming.  Dr. Taylor said that from all he could see, Dad
should have died almost instantaneously with that saver of an attack.  With Dad
already signing the admittance form and only being in a hospital gown, Dr.
Taylor put him into a hospital bed with orders that he was not to as much as
put his feet on the floor.  This didn’t hold for Dad and he really gave the
nurses a bad time.  By Saturday, the Doctor released him because he wouldn’t
stay in bed or do what the nurses told him to do.  He said that he just as well
be at home.<b> </b>Monday morning Dad went back to work.  He continued to work
there until Hill Field went through a force reduction.   Dad’s superiors
convinced that with his heart attack he could retire on a medical.  His
built-up sick leave would continue his paycheck until he reached retirement age
for Government retirement.  This is what he did and at age 75 he filed for
Social Security.   Later the Social Security questioned his age, for he should
have been collecting Social Security starting at age 65, so they paid him back
payments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Anyway, let’s get back to 1952.  My mother and
Roy came down to Ogden on the bus, after Dad got his job, to find a place for
us to live. Grandma, Irven and I stayed at Uncle Lee and Aunt Welma’s for a
week.  Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice then came and got us and we stayed at their
place for a while.  Irven and I also went out to Rich and Lois’s for a while.  I
believe that it was another week before Mom, Dad and Roy came back to Idaho on
the bus, to move our furniture out of the home in victor.  They had made
arrangement to store our furnishings and had also arranged with someone in the
Valley to haul our furnishings to Utah in a cattle truck.  I don’t remember if
it was Rich or Uncle Irven that picked Mom, Dad and Roy up at the bus stop and
then we, including Irven and I, drove up to Victor.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Before leaving Victor I had sold my rabbits to a
fellow that lived west of town.  I also gave him my dog Pete as Dad didn’t
think the city was anyplace for him.  When we got out of the car at Uncle
Albert’s, Pete met us.  We petted him for a minute and then he went over to a
dish of water and food and immediately began to drink and eat.  Uncle Albert
said that it was the first time, since we had left, that he ate or drank
anything.  The man I had given him to had taken him home and tied him up.  Pete
broke the rope and then came back to town.  When we weren’t at the house Pete
came up to Uncle Albert’s.  Even there Pete wouldn’t eat or drink.  The fellow
came back and got him and this time he locked him in a garage.  Pete dug under
the wall and came back to town.  Again he came back and got Pete, this time tying
Pete with a chain inside the garage.  After a day of being locked up, the man
felt that he needed to let Pete have some exersize, so holding the chain with a
firm grip, he let him outside.  Almost immediately, Pete took off with such
great speed that when he came to the end of the chain, he tripped the fellow and
started dragging him until the man let loose.  Again back to town.  This time
the fellow told Uncle Albert that he didn’t think he could ever control Pete
and so didn’t feel it would be worthwhile to take Pete back to his place. 
Although Pete stayed at Uncle Albert’s he still wouldn’t eat or drink.  Uncle
Albert, had that morning arranged for someone to come that afternoon and shoot
Pete, in order to stop him from dying from dehydration and starvation.  After
getting all the furniture and belongings loaded into the truck, Irven and I
convinced Dad and Mom to take Pete to Utah with us.  They finally agreed, so
Pete and Roy rode on top of the load to Utah.  Irven and I went back to stay
with Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice in Pocatello until Mom and Dad could get into
a home. Grandma was there at their home too.  Part of the time, Irven and I
stayed with Rich and Lois.  In July, Mom called to tell us that she had found a
place to live.  She asked Rich and Lois if they would bring us to Utah.  I have
always remembered that as we came through Logan, several places seemed very
familiar to me, even though I had never been in Utah before.  I have often
thought and wondered about that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After our move to Utah, Dad felt Pete was just
too large for the city.  Pete could jump almost any fence.  He wouldn’t remain
tied.  He was large enough that he would deliberately go into the street and
stop traffic.  One afternoon when I got home from school, we found a large
steer head on the front lawn.  It was evidences that Pete had traveled to West
Ogden where he had found it and carried it clear through the center of town, to
our home at Monroe and 30<sup>th</sup> street.  Twice Dad gave Pete away, while
Irven and I were away from home.  Within two or three weeks, Pete would
return.  The next time Dad sold him but again Pete came home, however, this
time the man came to get him.  I was home and the man asked if I would put Pete
into his truck.  That was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.  As
I nudged Pete to get into the truck, he just looked up at me for a moment, and
then he got in the front of the truck, moved over to the other side of the cab
and never looked back.  I felt as though he said, “If <u>you</u> want me to go,
then I will.”  That was the last I ever saw of Pete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The morning after Mom had called Rich, to tell
him that she had found a home to rent and asked if he would bring us to Ogden,
Mom found that the home had been rented to another family for more money.  She
then found a small apartment that she rented on 30<sup>th</sup> Street and Wall
Avenue.  She and Roy had just got our furniture moved into the apartment the
morning that we arrived.  The apartment had a small front room, a kitchen, a
bath room and two small bedrooms.  Rich and Lois just stayed long enough to eat
and then left of home for there was no place for them to sleep.  Mom and Dad’s
bed room held their double bed and a dresser.  The other bedroom fit a set of
bunk beds, grandma’s double bed and her dresser draws.  The bunk beds and the
double set right next to each other and you had to climb over grandma’s bed to
get into the bunk beds.  Irven and I slept in the top bunk and Roy slept in the
bottom bunk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            With the move to Utah came many changes.  I
never really liked living in the city and looked forward to and enjoyed summers
when I could go back to Pocatello and work with Rich, farming.  The first
summer was probably more just a vacation for Irven and I than doing much work. 
One instance which I remember that year was while I was building some rabbit
pens.  Rich and Lois were living in a trailer house, parked next to the home
they were building.  At that time they had the garage and part of the basement
walls up.  I was working in the garage building rabbit pens, while Irven, Janet
and Carla (Rich’s oldest two girls) were just playing around nearby.  Lois came
into the garage and through the door into the basement to put some trash in a
trash can there.  As she walked back through the door a rattle snake buzzed. 
Lois and I killed the snake, but it always amazed me that we had been so close
to it all morning and it hadn’t bothered us.  The next two summers I helped
Rich in the hay.  Also the third year, I worked part of the summer for Melvin
Anderson driving a caterpillar tractor on his dry farm.  While working for
Rich, I would get a dollar an hour, but while driving cat for Mr. Anderson, he
paid me $2.25 per hour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We only lived in the apartments on wall for a
couple of months, when Mom found a home on 28<sup>th</sup> Street and Lincoln Avenue. 
While living here, I started Jr. High School at Lewis Jr. High, about four
blocks east of our home.  I will always remember my first day at school.  As we
started class, my Home Room Teacher called the roll.  When he came to my name,
he said, “Kenneth Browning, How many guns do you have?”  I looked a little
startled at the question and answered that we had a 22 rifle, a shot gun and a
pistol.  With this answer he just looked at me but continued on down the roll. 
When he got to the next to the last person on the roll, he said, “Judy
Browning, how many guns do you have?”  To this she replied, “I don’t know, we
have five gun cabinets full of guns, guns in every draw and every closet in the
house.”  That was the end of the roll call.  When Dad came home from work I
asked him why are the Browning’s supposed to have so many guns?  That was the
first time that I heard the story of the Browning Arms company. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>(I want to insert a story at this point, that you may
want to skip from reading to your children, according to their maturity.) </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This was the first winter that we lived in
Utah.  We know that money was very scares but recognized it even more when
Christmas approached.  In Idaho our Christmas really started with Thanksgiving
or the next day, depending on whether or not we had family for Thanksgiving
Dinner.  Ether on Thanksgiving after dinner or the next day we got the sleigh
and ax out and drove to the mountains to select a Christmas tree.  When you are
out in the forest, it is hard to judge the height of a tree and we always
wanted one that would reach our 10 foot high ceiling.  We would always select
more than one knowing that we could give extras to Uncle Albert and Aunt Vida
or other neighbors in the area.  The tree had to not only be tall but had to be
the perfect shape.  Oh what a fun time that was.  Now in Utah, we couldn’t go
to the forest to select a tree.  We had to go to a tree lot.  There you paid
for a tree by the foot and with the finances, that really cramped the
selection.  We went to several lots but the fun soon diminished and we would go
home disappointed.  The day before Christmas, Mom and Roy came home with a tree
about 2 feet tall.  Another tradition we had in Idaho was that the tree was
brought into the house the Day before Christmas to be set up.  We always had to
cut our selected tree off in order to get it into the house.  We children then
got to place one ornament on the tree and then we left the room and didn’t see
the tree again until early, 4AM if Mom and Dad could keep us in bed until then,
Christmas morning.  This year, Mom brought the tree into the house in the early
afternoon.  Being so small she suggested that we put it on a card table to give
it some height.  Then, due to the size maybe we could all decorate the tree. 
That finished it; Irven and I just went to our beds totally discouraged and not
caring if Christmas even came.  Now Irven was at the age when other children
had told him that there wasn’t a Santa Claus but that it was just your Mother
and Father.  He still wasn’t sure and didn’t want to believe what he had been
told.  On Christmas morning Mom finally came and woke us.  She had to do that a
couple of times because we were so disappointed we didn’t want to get up. 
Finally we got up and followed her into the living room.  There to our surprise
was a full, completely decorated Christmas tree.  Irven just stood there
gassing at the sight before our eyes and then exclaimed “Now I know for sure
there is a Santa Claus”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We lived in the home on Lincoln, for about 1 ½
years, when one night Roy came home quite late      “2 AM” from a party.  When
he came into the house he could smell raw natural gas.  The air was blue just
up to the top edge of the beds.  He woke Mom and Dad, who immediately woke the
rest of us and got us out of the house.  They called the fire department who
when they got there shut off the main gas valve.  They found out that the
furnace flew had rusted and collapsed, putting out the flame but letting the
raw gas continue to flow.  That was a luck night for us, as had Roy came home
later than he did, we would have all been asphyxiated.  The next morning Mom
called the Land Lord.  He agreed to have a new furnace installed.  The
installation required the removal of part of the flooring to get the old
furnace out and the new one back under the crawl space.  Mon then suggested to
the Landlord that while we had to replace some of the flooring, it might be a
good time to redo all the flooring with hardwood.  The Landlord agreed that we
could take any expenses for materials out of the rent money if we would do the
work.  We spent several days laying the hard wood, sanding it and then putting
a finish on it.  Mom then repainted the inside of the house.  The home really
looked much better.  A couple of weeks later as we were setting around the
table as a family, eating dinner, a tall, well dressed African American couple
just walked in the front door.  Mom jumped up and ran to the front room and
asked them if she could help them.  They then introduced them self as the new
Land Lords and they stopped by to meet us.  They informed her that they had
bought the home that day.  Mom politely told them that as long as we paid the
rent, it was our home and no one had the right to just walk in.  To this they
left, but the next day mom found another home to rent and we were moved within
a week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I started the eighth grade at Lewis Junior High
the year we moved to Ogden.  I still remember an instance on that first day at
school.  As the home room teacher began to call the roll, he got to my name. 
“Kenneth Browning,” he called.  After I answered, he asked me how many guns I
had.  He hadn’t asked anyone else questions like that and I wondered why me as
I told him I had a shot gun and a twenty two.  He then looked at me funny and
went on until he came to Judy Browning.  He then asked her the same question he
had asked me.  She, however, answered that they had several gun cabinets full,
and she wasn’t sure how many.  When I got home I asked Dad why the Browning’s
were supposed to have a lot of guns.  That was the first time I was told about
my great, great grandfather, Jonathon Browning, and how he was a gun smith and
had a shop in Nauvoo, Illinois when the Saints settled there and also about his
sons, my great grandfather, David Elias Browning, and his half brother, John
Moses Browning, and them inventing the Browning automatic rifle.  Since that
time I have always wondered where the money split, one side got it all and the
other, none.  As you can guess, I am on the other line.  I have also not found
any other account, except that which was told me by my father, connecting the
two brothers together in that invention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we moved to a duplex home located on Monroe
between 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> streets, I was already half way
into the ninth grade at Lewis Jr. High.  I didn’t want to transfer to another
school, so I rode my bike or walked every day back to Lewis.  My sophomore year
I went to Ogden High, which school I didn’t like, but enjoyed a couple of
classes there, machine shop and ROTC.  English, however, was quite a different
matter.  I remember that the teacher was two weeks late for school because of
illness, but the first time she came to class, she bawled me out.  I never know
why, but this became a daily routine, and should she slip up and forget, I
would be asked by my class mates, “How come?”  Needless to say, I didn’t like
her and, therefore, my grades suffered, which hurt me in the long run.  On my
first day in Seminary as the instructor read my name, he asked, “Are you
related to LeRoy Browning?” and when I said he was my brother, he exclaimed “Oh
no, not another one!” From then on he and I didn’t get along either.  I guess
Roy had set a bad stage for me to follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Sunset</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While at Rich’s, the next summer, I was happy
when Mom wrote telling me that they had moved to Sunset and bought a home
there.  That fall I started my junior year at Davis High.  I liked that high
school.  Davis was a smaller school and we were living in a small town again. 
On the morning of the first Thursday of school, it was announced that Clover Club
Foods needed some part-time help.  The last hour of school that day was to be
an assembly, so I figured that if I skipped the assembly I could get over to
check on that job offer before all the other kids, and then get back in time to
catch the school bus.  However, I was unfamiliar with Kaysville and on foot and
when I finally got there, there was a line of applicants clear out into the
parking lot.  I about gave up for I knew if I waited, I would miss my bus,
besides I was at the end of the line and was sure others ahead of me would get
the job.  I decided to stay anyway and one and one half hour later I was
interviewed.  I had to hitch hike over 10 miles home and just as I got home the
phone rang; it was Francis Robinson from Clover Club Foods asking me to report
to work after school the next evening.  I was one of three who were hired. 
Each evening we would clean the plant, and on Saturdays we thoroughly cleaned
everything.  That first Saturday we were asked to be at work at six a.m.  Mr. Robinson
asked if that would be a problem for me? I said that it wouldn’t because I was
used to getting up early.  However, Mom forgot to set the alarm, and she woke
me at 5:45 a.m.  I was stopped in Clearfield by a police officer for going 70
mph in a 30 mph zone.  When I explained my rush, he let me go, telling me to
slow down in Clearfield.  I got to Kaysville, ten miles from Sunset, changed
clothes and clocked in at 6:10 am.  I worked there during the school year and
as spring came, we were told we could go on full time for the summer.  Although
I wanted to return to Pocatello and farm, I decided I had better keep my job
with Clover Club.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I started work for Clover Club Foods, I
know that I would have to get me some sort of transportation.  When I spoke to
Mom about that need, she suggested that I should buy Roy’s car.  He had
purchased a 1950 Ford two door hard top and had only made one payment on it
before joining the U.S. Army.  She told me that, if I would make the payments,
take care of all insurance, repairs and operating expenses, the car would be
mine.  She also said that she needed to get the car out of Margaret’s use
because she and her boy friends were running car into the ground.  Margaret was
also not paying any of the expenses or payments on the car.  I said that those
conditions would be ok with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            About a year later, the car started having
mechanical problems that looked like it was going to be quite expensive to
repair.  Rather than putting the money out for the repairs I traded it in on a
Black 1952 Chevrolet four door.  That car became my dream car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It wasn’t until Roy returned from the army,
served two years as a missionary and came home and was married before I found
out that Roy had never been told of this situation with his car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I enjoyed school at Davis; however, English
became my worst subject because of not studying and learning anything my
sophomore year at Ogden.  The final term the instructor planned to fail me,
which would mean I would again have to take English in my senior year. 
However, he said fifty percent of our grade would be counted on a research
paper.  I really worked on that paper and when completed, I received an “A” and
“B” grade on it.  That averaged my grade out to a “C” and I passed the class. 
The instructor told me he was very disappointed that he wasn’t able to fail me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Because of working every night after school, I
didn’t participate in very many school activities.  Also because of my friends
who were dating girls that lived in Roy, when I did date, it was mostly girls
that lived in Roy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I graduated from Davis the spring of 1957.  As I
left school I was not sure what I wanted to do.  I knew I wanted more of an
occupation than just working for Clover Club Foods; that just didn’t interest
me.  I didn’t feel that I was prepared for college and I also didn’t know what
I would study if I went and how I would pay for college.  The Air Force had a
training plan if you would enlist, and Aviation Mechanics interested me.  I
passed the test for that schooling, so in July of 1957, I enlisted for four years
with the U.S. Air Force.  While at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, in Basic
Training, I had a heat stroke and ended up in the hospital with a fever of 106.4
degrees.  They packed me in ice and then poured rubbing alcohol over it.  That
dropped the temperature to a -3 degrees.  When I was well enough, they sent me
home with a medical discharge in September of that same year</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After returning home I decided to attend Idaho
State University in Pocatello where an aviation mechanics course was offered. 
When I got to Pocatello I was too late to register for fall term.  The
registers office told me that I would have to wait until winter term to
register for school.  I got a job at a service station there in Pocatello and
lived with my Aunt Bernice, Uncle Irven and my cousin, Leslie.  Just before
Christmas  I went to register for winter term and was told that the aviation course
I wanted only took new applicants during Fall term.  I would have to wait until
the next fall.  I gave up on that and moved back home with my parents.  Jobs
were hard to find at that time, but because of a neighbor, I got a job with
California Packing Company at the Clearfield Naval Base.  Later name was changed
to the Freeport Center.  I started as a box car loader, but in four months I
became a fork lift operator.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Although we lived in the same Ward in Sunset as
did the Porter’s, I had really never met or paid much attention to Mae Porter. 
I have thought since, that maybe the Lord put blinders on me so I wouldn’t
notice Mae earlier as we would be too young to get serious at that time.  It
wasn’t until I started work at California Packing company, that my best friend,
Hendrick Brandenburg, asked if I would get a date and go to the Stake
Sweetheart Ball with him and his date.  I told him that I hadn’t planned on the
dance and it was probably too late to get a date.  He persisted so I called
some of the girls I had been dating; but as I was afraid, they already had
plans.  When I couldn’t think of anyone else to call, he suggested I call Hal
Porter’s sister. Hal was my age and Mae was two years younger.  Mae accepted a
date with me then and many times after that.  Neither of us really wanted to
get too serious or go steady, but we dated steadily.  However on our third
date, when I went home that night, I told my mother that I had met the girl
that I wanted to marry.  I still had plans to go on a mission—a life time goal
of mine.  Mae wanted to go to Henigers Business College and become a secretary
after graduating from high school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            About this time, Roy, who for a couple of years
had become inactive in the church, had repented of his ways, had enlisted in
the army for two years and had returned home.  For the first time in his life,
Roy wanted to go on a mission, so he talked to the bishop.  The question of
finances came up because Mom and Dad were having a hard time.  I was working
steady so I volunteered to pay half of Roy’s mission costs.      </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae and I dated for eight months and I finally
proposed to her, still keeping in mind that I wanted to go on a mission.  I had
now been ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood as an Elder, but no call for a
mission yet.  The next day was Sunday, and of course, our engagement was all
over the ward.  Brother Kendrick, the first counselor in the bishopric,
commented that we couldn’t do that for I still had to go on a mission.  That
comment prompted me to make an appointment with the bishop. I wanted to know if
he was going to call me on a mission or not.  After that interview, although he
didn’t say he would not call me to go, I told Mae we could make wedding plans
for I was sure he would not to call me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>----------------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While courting Mae, working full time at
California Packing, I attended night classes at Weber State Collage, in I.B.M.
Board Wiring.  When I graduated from that class I applied for a job with the
Internal Revenue in Ogden and got a job with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>----------------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Eight months later, after Mae graduated from
Davis High, on the nineteenth of June 1959, Mae and I were married in the Salt
Lake Temple by Elder LeGrand Richards of the Council of the Twelve Apostles.  I
have never regretted that day and feel that Mae and I have developed a very
special love and companionship together.  I have, however, regretted not having
had the opportunity to accept a mission call as a young man.  I had never
understood why that call didn’t come, however, while serving in the bishopric
in the Mound Fort Ward in Ogden, I was giving a lesson to the teachers quorum
on preparing financially for your mission, when the feeling came to me that
that was the reason.  I guess Bishop Nicholas felt that with me helping to
support Roy, there would be no money for my mission.  Mae had told me that on
numerous occasions, but it hadn’t clicked until now.  She had also told me that
one day she and I would serve a mission together, which we have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Ogden</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have always been restless regarding my life’s
occupation.  Many times I have startled Mae when I would come home from work
and say: “Let’s move to Washington, I hear they need programmers up there, or
lets go look at farms.”  I always felt I should have been born 100 years ago. 
I used to think I was born in the wrong generation for I like hard work and
think I would forgo the luxuries and comforts of this day to the slow and
simple life of the farmer 100 years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have always had a strong testimony of the
gospel and been active in church work.  In fact, in one ward we moved into, we
had lived there for over four months and still hadn’t been asked to take a
position.  We were about to change wards as I couldn’t stand to be idle in the
church.  I have always held a position since I was 14 years old.    The next
week I was sustained as Aaronic Priesthood Secretary.  Some of the positions I
have held are:  Sunday School teacher, M.I.A. President, Elders Quorum
President and counselor, Aaronic Priesthood secretary;, 1<sup>st</sup>
counselor in the Bishopric five times, executive secretary twice, stake high
councilman, stake missionary, counselor in the stake mission, full time
missionary twice with Mae, family history consultant, and High Priest Group
Leader and assistant.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Personal History of Kenneth H Browning 1969 – 1970</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had entered into a partnership with Larry
Braithwaite a couple of years earlier.  We had gone into residential
construction and remodeling.  This lasted a little over a year and a half when
interest rates went from 5 percent to over 13 percent.  Within a short time we
were in financial difficulty plus our book keeper had made serious errors in
our financial records and we found that we were $10,000 in debt without any
work coming in.  We had to dissolve our business with each of us taking half
the debt incurred, to pay back.  $5,000 was a lot of money to be in debt in
those days.  Larry and I went to work for a contractor that Larry was
acquainted with, but I soon found that he couldn’t be trusted and his paychecks
were written on rubber and wouldn’t even be accepted by the bank for
collection.  I then went to work for a modular home construction company, but
at a very low wage.  I continually looked for other employment.  I found out
that Weber Collage had an opening in their Data Processing Department so
applied there.  When I went in, I found that I knew the head of that department
from when I had worked for Commercial Security Bank.  After our initial
interview he wanted me to come to work as a computer operator.  He suggested
that I could then take collage classes as an employee, working for a degree in
computer science and a teaching certification, and then teach here at Weber
College.  As an employee of the collage these classes would be at no charge. 
Another benefit would be that my family could also have free college education. 
Whoa! Was I excited?  Almost a week went by and I hadn’t heard more from him so
I called him back.  He informed me that he couldn’t hire me because I was the
wrong color.  He said that the government had told them that they couldn’t hire
anyone for any position until they hired a minority.  He said that there was
not an application in the collage office files for any position by a minority
person.  But until they hired some minorities, they couldn’t fill any
positions.  A couple of weeks later he called me and told me that Browning Arms
Company in Morgan were looking for a computer programmer.  I went there and
turned in an application and had an interview.  The interview went very well
and at the conclusion the D.P. manager said that I had not filled in one area
of my application.  I had left blank the space that gave the hourly rate I was
asking.  I had told him that I had been out of the data processing profession
for over two years and I knew he couldn’t pay me what he was paying the other
programmers, so I told him that I was hoping that he could make me some kind of
an offer as to what would be reasonable.  He said that he couldn’t and that I
had to put an amount in the space.  After trying to figure out what we could
possibly get by with, I filled in the space.  When he looked at what I was
requesting he commented; “We pay our janitors more than that, so if I couldn’t
program at all he could give me a broom and still be ahead.”  He then said that
if I could do the job, that I said I could do, in 90 days he would bring me up
to where I should be paid.  I agreed on that condition, and went to work for
them.  The next 90 days were very difficult days for me but I kept in mind the
promised raise in income.  Our financial situation had continually decreased
and what I was working for was not enough to meet our needs.  Add to that was
the obligation of indebtedness from my construction experience with Larry.  I
had taken one half of the indebtedness but didn’t have income to feed my family,
let alone pay anything towards that.  I had accepted two debts of $2,500 each,
one to Wheelwright Lumber Co. and one to Moyes Glass and Door.    We had sold
our home in Ogden and I had taken a second mortgage for just under $2,500 in
order to sell the house.  I took the Second Mortgage Contract in to Wheelwright
Lumber and asked them what they could give me towards the bill.  After a few
days they called me and told me that they would give me less than $1,000 for
it.  They said that they had to consider the difference it would be for them to
have the cash or the second mortgage, and that was all they could offer me for
the contract.  I then took the second mortgage to Bill Moyes and asked him the
same question to which he replied that he would sign the bill as paid in full. 
I gave him the mortgage and thanked him for understanding my needs.  When
Wheelwright’s found out what I did, they started collections against me. 
During this same time I had been called to serve as 1<sup>st</sup> Councilor to
Bishop Kent Murdock in the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup> Ward.  One evening after
our Bishopric meeting, Bishop Murdock asked me to stay for a few minutes.  When
we were alone he handed me a welfare food order.  He had already paid for the
Hospital bill for the birth of our son David.  I told him that I had not asked
for the order.  He said that he knew that, but he also knew of our financial
situation and I was to take the order weekly until we got back on our feet.  I
asked him to release me from the bishopric so I could work for the food order. 
He refused to do that and said I was working hard enough for it now, and he
needed me in my calling.  Just a couple of weeks earlier, John Ross, the other
counselor, had asked me how many hours a week we were putting in as
counselors.  I told him that I didn’t know.  He said that he was going to keep
track of our time for a couple of weeks.  After a week John ask me if I knew
how many hours he and I each put in during the last week.  When I told him that
I didn’t know but I knew it had been a busy week.  He said the each of us had
put in over 40 hours and he had no idea how many hours Bishop Murdock put in. 
He then said that he wasn’t keeping track of our time anymore because it was
too discouraging.  During this time I was working 60 hours or more a week for Browning
Arms on a weekly salary.  Work was going well at Browning’s and during this
time there were a few incidences that took place with the company.  Just prior
to my coming on board with Browning’s Val Browning retired and turned the
company over to his son Val Browning Junior.  There seemed to be several big
mistakes made under Val Jr. management. Their warehouse in Japan in which they
had several hundred rifles and shotgun unfinished stocks stored was flooded
with ocean water.  Lower level management advised Mr. Browning to destroy the
stocks and start over.  Mr. Browning would not, but told lower management to
dry the stocks and finish them.  Within a year rifles and shotguns were being
returned because the finish on the stocks was peeling off.  That was a huge
financial loss.  Then Browning Arms had a big game rifle they were developing
that Mr. Browning told management to put it into production.  Management told
Mr. Browning that it was still in the test stage and wasn’t ready for
production.  Mr. Browning ordered it to go into production.  I was working late
one night when a teletype came into the head office from a customer that had
purchased one of the first rifles that came out.  He had gone to Africa on a
hunting expedition.  He shot a water buffalo as it charged him.  The buffalo
dropped but then got up and charged again.  The hunter pulled the trigger again
but nothing happened.  Lucky for him, his guide shoved the hunter out of the
way and shot the charging buffalo which fell right at the hunter’s feet.  When
the man looked down all his shells lay in a pile on the ground.  With the first
shot the magazine cover had opened and let the unfired shells eject from the
gun.  Another major blunder was found out when the IRS sent notice to Browning
Arms that they were delinquent on the first quarter withholding taxes for
Jarman’s of Organ.  The accounting department called and told the IRS that they
didn’t understand the delinquent notice for they had nothing to do with
Jarman’s of Organ.  IRS told them that according to their records Browning Arms
owned Jarman’s of Organ.  When research was completed it was found that Val
Browning, while stone drunk at a Christmas Party, had purchased Jarman’s of
Organ which was millions of dollars in the red.  I was told that because of
these financial blunders, Browning Arms management found that they were in
financial problems.  Just days before I reached my 90<sup>th</sup> day of
employment Mr. Browning put a freeze on wage increases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            With the strain on our budget, no hope for a
raise in the near future, working long hours on salary and putting in many
hours in the Bishopric I really became discouraged.  To add to it, Utah was
experiencing a hard winter and a long drawn out cold wet spring.  I came home
one day and told Mae that we had to get away or I would lose it.  Realizing our
financial situation and the weather conditions, Mae asked where we could
possibly go.  Larry and Tammy had moved to Arizona so that Larry could get out
of the cold which was irritating his Romatoid Arthritis.  I suggested that we
might go there for a few days.  The next day, Mae mentioned to her mother, the
possibility that we might go to Mesa Arizona but she didn’t know where we could
get the money for gas.  Mae’s mother said that if she could go with us and stay
at her Brother Van’s she would pay half of the gas.  We called Larry and Tammy
and they invited us to come and stay with them.  I took two weeks off work and
from my Bishopric calling and we drove to Mesa Arizona.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The weather was warm and beautiful and we had a
wonderful time with Larry, Tammy and their family.  On Sunday when we went to
church, Larry introduced me to Ron Shumway.  Ron was the Data Processing
Manager for Hugh’s Air West Airlines.  He invited me to come over to his home
after meetings and visit with him.  After dinner I walked over to Ron’s, just
two houses east of Larry’s home. Ron and I visited for a while and he asked if
I had ever programmed in Cobalt.  I told him that I had not, but I had learned
three earlier programming languages and didn’t feel it would be hard for me to
quickly learn it.  Ron suggested that he bring me some programming manuals and
that when I returned home, I study them and then send a sample program back to
him.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a wonderful time with Larry, Tammy and
their family.  I did do a little reading of the Cobalt manuals and after
returning home I re-wrote a program, that I had just completed writing for
Browning’s, into Cobalt.  I asked one of the keypunch operators if she would
have time to punch the program for me.  She stayed a little while after work
and punched it for me.  When I got home I gave the punched deck, already
packaged up and addressed to Mr. Shumway, to Mae and asked her to mail it to
Ron.  A few days later, when I got home from work, Mae said that Mr. Shumway
had called and wanted me to call him back.  I was surprised that he had gotten
the package so soon.  I called his home and his wife said that he had gone on
business to San Francisco.  Ron returned my call the next day (without checking
with my journal, I believe that it was Wednesday) and asked if I could come
back down for an interview.  In my mind I figured travel time to Phoenix and
told Mr. Shumway that with the drive I could be there by Monday morning.  He
replied, “Oh no don’t drive, just go to the Hughes Airline ticket office in
SLC, Friday morning and he would have tickets waiting for me.  Thursday
morning, I asked my manager if I could take Friday off and he approved it.  The
next day I flew to Phoenix and met with Ron Shumway, Scott Fry and two or three
other supervisors.  After a fairly brief interview they took me out to lunch
and when we returned to the office they offered me a position at twice the pay
I was presently getting.  I asked for the weekend to make my decision, so that
I could talk it over with my wife.  I flew back home that afternoon.  Mae and I
talked it over and prayed for guidance.  I also talked it over with Bishop
Murdock.  Monday morning I went into my manager at Browning Arms and turned in
my resignation.  He said, that he was afraid that was the reason that I had
taken off Friday.  He then asked what it would take to keep me there at
Brownings.  I told him that I would stay if he could give me one half of the
increase that Hughes Air West was offering me.  He said that he would be back
in a little while to talk to me.  He left and I went back to my desk and
continued to work.  It wasn’t until 2:30PM when he came back to my desk and
told me that he had been at Mr. Browning’s office every since I had talked to
him and that if I didn’t accept the job offer at Hughes, I was the biggest fool
he knew.  He said that he could hire someone in new at what I was asking, but
he couldn’t give me a raise.  I suggested that I quit and he hire me back, but
he said that he had even suggested that to Mr. Browning and he wouldn’t let him
do that either.  I left Browning Arms two weeks later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We decided that we didn’t want to take Sandi out
of school with only 1 ½ months left in the year so I would move down to Arizona
and stay with Larry and Tammy.  This would give me time to also look for a
home.  I could also fly home on the weekends to be with my family, as being an
airline employee I could fly round trip anywhere Hughes Air West flew for
$4.00.  After a couple of weeks I found a home for sale and Ron Shumway loaned
me a $1,000.00 for a down payment.  I had Mae fly down for a few days to see
the home.  We bought the home in Lehi but couldn’t take possession for a
month.  Not wanting to be without my family for that long I found a two bedroom
apartment that we could rent for a month.  We started making arrangements to
move down on Memorial Day weekend.  That would give me three days to make the
move.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One of the conditions of renting the apartment
was that I put the power under my name.  I called Salt River Power to arrange
for the power to be turned on.  I told them that we would be arriving with our
furniture on the following Sunday and questioned if, with Friday being a
holiday, they would have time to get the power on.  They assured me that it
would be on when we got there.  Ron had me take off early Thursday to make sure
that I could make plane connections ok, as we always flew on standby at that
price.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae picked me up at the Salt Lake Airport
Thursday when I arrived there.  I rented the U-Haul truck and a tow hitch to
pull our car behind. When I rented the equipment, I bought insurance on the
equipment, by waving the insurance on the contents.  This was a decision that
we regretted later.  Mae had done a very good job getting most of our things
pre-packed.  Friday was spent finishing the packing and loading the truck. 
Some of the Brothers from the Ward came and helped me pack the truck Friday
afternoon so that we had the truck and the car well packed and ready to go the
next day.  When I hooked the car up to tow it behind the truck I disconnected
the U-joints from the transition and tied the drive shaft up to the car frame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We stayed at Mom and Dad Porter’s Friday evening
so that we could leave on Saturday.  Mom Porter continually told us that we
should drive by way of Las Vegas to avoid the mountain roads.  Also, it would
be a much faster way to go.  Tammy also advised us that we carry any live
plants in the front of the truck so that when we came to the State Checking
Station they would be easily assessable for the guards to check.  These two
bits of advice we also came to regret later.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Leaving our children at Mom and dad Porters, Mae
and I left early Saturday morning.  As we drove, we continued to look at the map
and just before we got to where Highway 20 crosses over from I-15 to US-89 we
made the decision to go by way of Las Vegas.  The trip went well, although we
were a little crowded with the plants in the front seat with us.  As I said,
the trip went well until we crossed Hoover Dam.  From that point on the road
was only a two lane road, and it was just up one hill and then down the hill;
one after another from there until just before we got to Phoenix.  With going
uphill with that load, we would be driving in low gear with the speed needle
hardly registering on the gage.  Then when we stated downhill we would be lucky
if we could reach 20 MPH before we started to climb again.  With it being a two
lane road, traffic was held up for miles behind us.  Drivers would often see
some space, and quickly try to pass us.  Anywhere I could, I would pull as far
right as I could, so cars could pass.  A highway patrol car soon passed us and
then drove just in front of our outfit, being out of sight from traffic following
us.  When a driver would lose patience following us, and take a chance on
passing, the officer would pull them over and give them a ticket.  He would
then work his way up in front of us again and wait for the next un-expecting
driver.  He must have given well over a dozen tickets that day.  When we got to
the border checking station, the officer just waved us through and didn’t check
any of our items.  I felt like telling him that we had carried all these plants
down from Utah in the front of the truck expecting him to check them, so he had
to at least look at them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was after mid-night when we got to the
apartment in Mesa.  As the apartment was about a block from Larry and Tammy’s,
we had stopped for a minute to see if we could stay the night with them.  Larry
followed us over to the apartment, but when we went in, there was no power on. 
Larry helped us quickly unload most of the items that were to stay at the
apartment.  We just stacked them inside the front room and left.  Larry drove
us back to stay the night with them.  We left the moving truck and our car in
front of the apartment.  On Sunday morning, I pulled the car over to Larry’s, and
then took all the rest of the furniture to the home of my supervisor Scott
Frye.  Scott had offered to let us store the remainder of our furniture in half
of his garage, until we are able to move into our new home.  I then returned
the truck to U-Haul to close the rental agreement with them.  We stayed with
Larry and Tammy again Sunday night.  Larry and I did go back to the apartment
on Sunday, to get our car, but we found that the wire holding the drive shaft
up had stretched enough that the u-joint had hit the pavement and lost the
bearings.  Monday morning Tammy let us use her car.  Mae and I went over to the
apartment, but still the power was not on.  Mae took a shower in cold water. 
While waiting for Mae, I moved a couple of boxes onto the kitchen cupboard and
some items into the bedroom.  I then took Mae to the Airport for her to fly up
to Utah and get our children.  She was to fly back with them the following day. 
After Mae’s plane left I went to work.  When I got into the office, I called
the power company and they assured me that the power would be on today.  After
work I stopped at an auto part store, bought a new universal joint for the
station wagon and then went to Larry’s where I repaired the car.  I then drove
over to the apartment.  When I drove up, there was a large black hole where the
kitchen wall had been.  The Land Lord’s son ran over and said that after the
power company turned our power on, the renter in the upstairs apartment smelled
smoke and called the fire department.  The fire was contained to just our
apartment but most of the things we had carried in was damaged.  I later found
out, that if we had taken out content insurance when we rented the truck, all
our items would have been covered.  The Land Lord made arrangement for us to
move into another apartment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Things seemed to settle down and life went back
to good.  Mae and the children came down and that was special for the children,
as that was their first airplane flight.  We had a swimming pool just out the
front door of our apartment so the children especially enjoyed that.  One day
the Land Lords wife invited Mae and the children to use their private swimming
pool.  That turned out bad as the pool evidently hadn’t been used and cared for
enough, and after swimming in it, some of the children had ear problems.   Mae took
them into a Doctor.  One day at work, my assistant supervisor called me aside
and gave me an envelope containing over $100 that workers had donated for us to
help with the expenses caused by the fire.  The time quickly passed and soon we
were able to close on our home.  We quickly adjusted to our neighborhood and
new Ward.  </p>
