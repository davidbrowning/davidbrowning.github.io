<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
Mae and I slept well last night.  This morning after breakfast we did some
stretch exercises.  Mae got on the computer preparing a talk for Rachel’s
Baptism this coming Saturday.  I did some chasing to pay the rent, reserve the
Roy North Park for a family reunion of the 3<sup>rd</sup> of July, mailed a get
well card to Deanna, went to Jennie’s where I picked up some priobotics, then
to Harvest Moon Health store for several items there, to Bed Bath and Beyond to
get Mae a new veggie dicer and back home.  After lunch I took a short nap and
then built a cloth bar that fits in our car.  We then had dinner.  This evening
we went Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching to Sister Leah Neilson, Dennis and
Judy Patterson and to Marianne Ray.  For our lesson we gave the DVD of “Finding
Faith in Christ”.  Sister Neilson is having several areas in her home being
repaired due to the waters pipes, maid of Paley Buntline, detonation.  That is
the same thing that happened to our place and caused me to replace all my
waterlines, as well as many others in the park.  Because of the repairs we
could not get into the room where Her DVD player was so she asked us to bring
it back on another visit.  The Patterson’s really enjoyed the film and he would
like to work it into one of his Priesthood lessons.  As for Marianne, I am not
sure!  I am not sure just how to help that girl!  Before we went to bed we
played Rummikub at which Mae beat me both games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 7:30AM but by the time I finished my normal routine, including usually
at least ½ hr of studing the Scriptures, then exercising with Mae, eating
breakfast, finishing my exercises that the Dr. gave me to do and took a shower,
it is now after 10AM.  Mae called Deanna to see how she is doing.  Before
hanging up Deanna asked Mae if sometime I might have time to look at a problem
they are having with their roof.  When Mae told me that I said that we should
go today, so Mae made a casserole for them and we went to their place.  When I
looked at the roof I am very concerned that it needs to be reroofed.   We
enjoyed visiting with them and then Bryce insisted that he buy me some frozen
yogurt for my time coming out to see them.  We got home just in time to get
some dinner and then go Home Teaching Visiting Teaching to the Hilton’s and
Sister Lemon.  Mae is quite tired this evening so we soon went to bed after
returning home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up early so that we could take Marianne into the doctor for an iron
infusion.  She was to leave by 8:45am but do to problems she was an hour late
leaving.  We took her up to the hospital and after making sure that she was
still going to be treated, we left.  We went to Costco, where we did some
shopping.  From there we stopped at Seagull Book where we purchased volume 2
&amp; 3 of the Book of Mormon made Easier.  We then went to Wal-Mart where we
purchased some groceries, plus a necklace for Sister Neilson and a tub of lip
stick for Mae.  When we got home those two items were not with the other groceries. 
Mae called the store and they asked us to bring the sale receipt to the store. 
We couldn’t find the receipt and I think I had the clear put it into the sack. 
We went back to the hospital to get Marianne.  When we got back to her place
she wanted me to check out a couple of plumbing problems.  Mae and I went back
to Wal-Mark and they gave us a replacement of those two items.  We took the
Necklace, some cup cakes and a Birthday Card to Leah.  Bishop Mullin stopped by
and asked if I would get someone to help me and got to the Scheer and
administer to Mimi Scheer.  I called Lane Johnson and he helped me.  I reported
back to Bishop and told him that I felt that he should prepare for her funeral
as I don’t think she has much longer to live.  I feel bad as we will probably
be gone when she passes.  Both Mimi and Arnold are a great example of great
people and will surely be missed by our Ward.  Mae had returned home from choir
practice about the same time I got home for the Sheer’s.  We read the speech given
by Mitt Romney who really cut Donald Trump as well as Hillary Clinton.  That
speech and that speech alone should put both of them out of the race for
President, but I am afraid that Satan already has his plans. I entered this
journal entry and then Mae and I played Rummy before going to bed.  I won the
game tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>  <i>(Just
an interesting projection, I believe that Trump will get the Republican

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke during the night deep in thought of my family and of Brother and Sister
Sheer.  I am concerned that Sister Sheer will pass away while we are away.  If
so, what will Brother Sheer do without her?  I have great concerns about my
family.  I believe that it was about 5:45am when I went back to bed.  When I
woke about 7:30am I found that Mae had problems getting to sleep and so she
also got little sleep last night.  When I got up, Mae had breakfast ready. 
While we were having morning prayers, Scott and Mishelle came with the twins
that we “mainly Mae” are going to tend today while Scott and Michelle go
skiing.  Knowing that Mae would take the camera with her and the children I
took it down to Lee Gifford’s to take some pictures of the way Lee plants and
prunes his grapes and raspberries, so that I can show Becky.  However! I found
the battery was dead and needed recharging.  On the way back home I stopped and
talked to Ken Brown, the Son-in-law to the lady in trailer #285.  He is
trimming some of her trees.  I visited with him and his wife.  Mae left with
the children.  When I got home I wrote a letter to Mike and started today’s
journal entry.  This evening Mae and I went down to Gifford’s and tilled and
raked the garden boxes.  After finishing those we were tired so we went to Del
Taco and bought some Chicken Fried Burritos.  Wet then came back home and
relaxed.  We watched some TV as we ate and then Mae got a phone call from
Marianne Ray and she talked to her for over an hour.  I watched another good
movie before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up early, very concerned with the Sheer’s.  I don’t know if that set me
off but I was very dizzy all morning.  After breakfast I called Bishop Mullins
and he said that he was keeping track of them and their daughter and
granddaughter were also there to help them.  I lay down to take a nap but was
cold so Mae got me the electric blanket.  When I got warm I fell asleep and I
think I slept for an hour.  I went through our seeds in the shed but could not
pea seeds, so I went to Home Depot and bought some.  I planted one garden box
at Lee’s with the pea seeds.  Lee also gave me some raspberry starts that I
will get to Mike and Becky.  For now they are in our refrigerator.  Sandi came
out to go with us to Rachel’s baptism this afternoon.  Gary had brought Sandi
out and will go visit his children while we are at the Baptism.  The Baptism
went very well and I was pleased to Baptize Rachel and to stand in the circle
for the conformation.  Following the services, we went to Gale’s mothers ward
chapel where Marcy and Gale had prepared a very nice lunching.  When we got
home, Gary came back and he, Sandi, Mae and I played some games.  I entered this
entry before we went to bed.  We realized that we hadn’t filled the car with
gas, so we drove over and filled it before min-night.  We just try to keep that
Sabbath the best we can.</p>

slept in this morning and then got most everything packed up before we went to
Church.  We enjoyed the meetings with today being Fast and Testimony meeting
Sacrament meeting was very enjoyable.  The Stake presidency also came as our
High Priest Group leadership was released and a new Group Leadership was
installed and set apart.  A new financial clerk was also sustained as Lee
Gifford had to be released, with he and Glory going to Africa for a few weeks
to three years.  As soon as we got home we got the rest of our things packed
and soon left for Grantsville.  It was raining when we left home and by the
time we got on the freeway it was raining quite hard.  By the time we got to
Lagoon it was raining quite hard and then when we got on 215 it was pouring
from then on.  We enjoyed the evening with Chelci, Steve and their family.  We
slept quite well although they have a quilt on their bed, where we slept, that
is really heavy.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke by 5am and read scriptures for a while.  I woke Mae by 7am although she
hadn’t slept well, due to her worrying about the children.  Mae and I prepared
breakfast and the children ate well.  Chelci and Steve slipped out quietly and
the boys have been very good.  Nate and Addie had school and rode the bus.  The
twins ate well and played ok.  We took them for a walk, having them in the
stroller, but before we got very far we noticed that Luke was getting sleepy,
so we had them get out and Mae took their hands and walked with them.  After
getting home, Mae fed them and then took them upstairs to take their naps. 
Addie got home at 11am and we enjoyed playing games with her.  I went to the
store for a few groceries.  Sandi stopped over for a little while on her way
home from work to see how we are doing.  We are doing very well.  I watched a
show on TV this afternoon.  After dinner this evening we held F.H.E. with the
children.  We then played a game of “Sorry” with Addie and Nathan.  Jacob still
has diarrhea and we are not sure just what we should do about it.  I called
Sandi and she said that Chelci was told by her Doctor that there wasn’t
anything that you could give babies to help them.  I called David but he wasn’t
home.  I guess we will just have to wait and see.  Although it has gone pretty
well today, Mae is sure tired this evening.  We got to bed before 10pm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept well however Mae got up with leg cramps.  I wish that we could find
help for that problem.  Addie didn’t have to go to school but will go to dance
at 11am and another lady will stop by to get her.  Nate woke about 7am and we got
him ready and some cereal for breakfast.  Mae and I had time to take our
showers before getting the twins up.  I started breakfast before the twins
woke.  I helped Mae get them up and changed.  Jacob seems to be doing better this
morning.  We had a nice breakfast and those two boys sure like food.  Nate and
Addie are a little pickier.  Sandi called when she got to work to check on us. 
We were happy to tell her that we are doing ok.  I had time to work on my
journals for a while this morning.  After Nate got off to school, Mae got Addie
and the twins up.  While she was doing that I prepared breakfast.  After
breakfast Addie, Luke, Jacob, Clutch (the dog), Mae and I took a walk.  We got
lunch before Addie was picked up for her dance lessons.  After Addie left, we
got the twins down for their nap.  Mae and I also took a nap.  After we got up,
we turned on the show and watched “Call 777” starring James Stewart.  Not only
was it a good story but, what even made it better, was to find out that it was
a true story.  After the show, Mae started dinner and I worked on my journals. 
Nathan came home from school not feeling very well.  We looked for a
thermometer but were unable to find it until just as Mae called Sandi.  I had
just located it and took Nathan’s tempter.  It is a little higher than normal,
but not that high.  Anyway, we let him stay home form Scouts.  We had a nice
dinner but Nate went to sleep on the couch and didn’t eat.  We suspect that he
doesn’t want to go to school tomorrow because of a spelling test.  Addie went
to her dance class and then went back to the lady that took her and stayed
until later to play with her friend.  After dinner, Addie wanted to play games
again tonight.  We gave the twins a bath and they sure enjoyed that.  We really
are enjoying the children but they are wearing us out.  It is now after 9:30pm
and they are all in bed.  Mae reminded me that we have only two days to go.  As
much as we are enjoying the children, we are ready to call it enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
had Diarrhea all night and got very little sleep.  Nathan didn’t feel well,
anyway that is what he said, but it sounded like an excuse he was using.  He is
having two tests today, one in spelling and one in math.  Mae spent quite a
while helping him in both areas and before it was time for him to leave; he was
doing well in both areas.  This morning Mae had to take Nathan to piano lessons
and the teacher will get him to school.  So, while Mae was out, she went to the
store and purchased some Pepto-Bismol, which seemed to help me a lot with the
diarrhea.  I did get a couple of hours sleep but then was awake the rest of the
day.  Mae and I tried to watch a couple of shows on TV but the twins woke
during the second show and that ended Mae’s relaxation.  When Nathan came home
from school, he told us that he had got 103% on his spelling test and 98% on
the math test.  I asked how he could get 103% and it was due to extra words for
extra credit.  He was very proud of his accomplishment and was happy that
Grandma had helped and encouraged him.   I helped Mae got the twins up and
dressed.  Mae got Addie ready and off to pre-school and then prepared a nice
breakfast for us and the twins.  I did help with cooking scrambled eggs.  I put
the TV onto a Mickey Mouse channel for the twins to watch and then went in and
showered.  I helped Mae with the twins then Addie came home from pre-school. 
We got some lunch and then put the twins down for a nap.  After getting them
down I put a show on TV for Addie, Mae and I then took a nap.  After sleeping
for a while we got up and watched a show with Addie.  I couldn’t understand the
words so I worked on my journals for a while.  After the show ended Mae and
Addie played a game of Uno so I joining them in another game of Uno.  Then we
played Moose and the second game of Moose Nathan also joined in.  I then
watched a John Wayne show.  Addie again played a game of Stinger Bee with Mae
and I joined in a couple more games.  We then got the children to bed about 9PM. 
The children have been very good to mind and the twins are very good and just a
lot of fun to watch them play and to see how they are developing.  One just has
to wonder how life will turn out for these children.  We sure have a lot more
hope for them than JaNae and Brad’s family.  For them we just don’t know how to
even hope!  As I read the scriptures I worry about many of my children, Grand
Children and Great Grand Children.  Oh, how I pray for the blessing of my
Father in Heaven!</p>

the night progressed.  I started having hiccups off and on the next day.   After
a few minutes of hiccups my stomach would go into sever rapid cramps which
really hurt.  The hiccups and cramping continued until I had to try to sleep on
the couch in order to let Mae get some sleep.  I was awake most of the night,
with very little relief.  The day went well with the children, but I couldn’t
help much since I was still having the darn hiccups.  Heather, Chelci’s friend
who takes Addie to preschool and dance, asked if Addie could play with her
daughter again.  Mae, Nate and the twins went to pick her up shortly before
dinner.</p>

the morning progressed I began to feel some better.  Mae was up early to get
Nate off to school and get Addie and the twins ready to go to their
grandparent’s home.  At 8:15am Steve’s mother and father came and took the
twins and Addie to tend until Steve and Chelci come home this afternoon.  I
helped Mae get our things ready to go, but of course, Mae had to go through the
house and clean it up.  She wanted to change the sheets on Chelci and Steve’s
bed, but couldn’t find other sheets to put on it, so decided to wash these ones
and put them back on, but we couldn’t get the washer to work.  It was about
noon when we finally got away.  As we left Grantsville, we talked as to whether
we should go home until I was feeling better or go on to Arizona as we had
planned.  As we approached the 215 intersection we finally decided that I was
feeling pretty good so we would go on South.  We got to Kanab about 5pm and
stopped and filled the car with gas before going to Judy’s.  After a short
visit we took Judy out to eat at a Mexican restaurant where we enjoyed a nice
dinner.  We came back to Judy’s for the night.  By bed time I was again
starting to experience hiccups and stomach cramps.  I tried to sleep in the front
room in a recliner but that didn’t work.  </p>

She suggested that I try going back to bed with her but that didn’t work so Mae
went into the front room to sleep.  That didn’t work for her as the Grandfather
clock kept her awake as it bonged every 15 minutes and really loud on the hour. 
By 5am we got up and got ready to leave.  I had been constipated all night but
before we left I was able to have a bowl movement, but the stool was a dark
black.  When I went to take out things out to the car, I found that it was
snowing very hard.  We quickly put things into the car and then drove to a
filling station where we had a canapé over us so we could do some rearranging
of the car.  We also bought some water for drinking on the way.  As we drove
out to the highway, we set there trying to decide whether we should go south or
north.  We finally decided that I would probably get over this sickness, that I
am experiencing now, and would be ok.  I turned south but the snow was still
falling very hard.  I could only drive about 40 mph with the limited vision. 
Within a few minutes another bad attack hit me and I just turned a u-turn and
started back toward home so I could get to a doctor or hospital.  I had Mae put
into the GPS the location of an Instant Care facility and we started driving
that way.  We were not sure just where the place was located but when we got to
the White Sands turnoff, it indicated that we should turn there.  I told Mae
that there was no way I was going to turn there.  We drove on to the next town
and found a service station that was now open.  I pulled in and Mae went into
the store and asked them where there was an Instant Care Physicality and they
told her that the closest one was in Kanab.  We decided to continue north until
maybe we could find some place on the way north.  I was hurting so bad that I
had to let Mae drive.  At 6am Mae called David to get his advice.  He said that
he would do some checking and call us back.  We communicated with him several
times and finally decided that we would continue north and if possible make it
to the Provo Area.  We had told him what my symptoms were and that my stool was
a black.  (I’m quite sure that both Mae and I told him that I had taken Pepto-Bismol
but somehow he didn’t understand that.)  The black stool quite worried him and
he concluded that I might possibly have a bleeding ulcer.  As we continued
north, the storm subsided but still had snow on the road.  David had Scott call
us to get our insurance information so that he could find a hospital, where we
might go to, which would be covered by our insurance.  When Jeff called and was
concerned, and said that Gail has a brother who owns an airplane, and if needed
he might come and get us and take us to a hospital.  By this time we were
already on Hwy-20 going towards Inter-State 15, plus I was feeling ok.  I told
David that we would continue driving north.  He called back a short time later
and said that he was on the road driving to pick-up Mike and the two of them
would meet us on the way north.  A short time later, David called to find out
our location and how I was doing.  I told him that I was ok and that I would
prefer going to the Ogden Regional Medical Center if possible, as that was
where we know that our insurance would cover me.  Plus if I should have to stay
in the hospital, it would be close for Mae to be at home.  Through our phones,
we were also able to select a central meeting place where Mike would drive
David’s car with Mae riding with him and David would drive our car.  This would
take a lot of stress off of Mae.  By that time I was feeling quite fine as the
cramps had subsided.  At Provo we let Mike off and Becky met him there.  Mae
then drove our car and we followed David.  We continued to the Ogden Regional
Medical Center where they did lots of tests and could find no reason for my
problems.  That was almost a letdown after all the problems, inconveniences and
expenses I have caused.  We came home and unpacked just what we needed as we
are not just sure what we will do now.  We were both worn out and just
relaxed.  We fell asleep on the recliners watching something BYU TV and when we
woke we watched a show “Ridding Tornado” before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in and then when I got up I reset our thermostat settings.  I got us some
breakfast and Mae started getting her hair done.  After breakfast Mae wasn’t
feeling the best so I had her go back to bed.  I decided to go to Sacrament
meeting but when I got there meeting was almost over.  I looked at the clock on
the wall and then at my watch, there was 1 hour, oh no we forgot that today
started Day Light Saving Time again.  I just went home when the meeting was
over.  It’s been a lazy day although I have worked on my personal journal
getting it caught up.  I reset all our clocks this evening and changed the
batteries in them.  I got Mae and I some cottage cheese and apple sauce for
this evening as we watched a true story on BYU TV about a boy that had fought
censor and lost his right leg.  With an artificial leg he set out to run a
marathon across Canada.  At over 2/3rds of the way he had the censor return to
his lungs and had to go back for treatment.  Seven months later he returned to
finish the goal but died just before his 23<sup>rd</sup> Birthday and just
before finishing his goal.  He raised a lot of money that was all donated to
the fight against censor.  It was quite an amazing story.  We went to bed after
10:30pm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up this morning and got things packed to leave.  Mae is having back problems
so we stopped in Layton at Dr. Bennett’s for her to get a treatment.  We
traveled to Kanab where we stayed at Judy’s again.  She is such a wonderful
hostess and so enjoyable to visit with.  We had stopped at the store before
getting there and bought some fries chicken and a salad.  Although Mae still
has some coughing and I still have some diarrhea we are feeling much better
that before.  We both slept well tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept until about 6am and had a nice breakfast before we packed and continued
on our trip.  We did stop in Page, Arizona to purchase a couple of items at
Wal-Mart.  Other than a couple of stops to trade drivers, we traveled on to
Phoenix, where we stopped for fuel and a car wash before going on the Shellie
and Roy’s.  Shellie had a baby shower to go to and Roy didn’t get home until
late so Mae and I just relaxed with Jase.  We put a DVD on and watched it. 
When Roy and Shellie got home they joined us in the show.  We then got the book
that Shellie had made for Roy’s 50’s Birthday and went through the first part
of it.  Finally at 11:30 pm I gave up and we went to bed.</p>
