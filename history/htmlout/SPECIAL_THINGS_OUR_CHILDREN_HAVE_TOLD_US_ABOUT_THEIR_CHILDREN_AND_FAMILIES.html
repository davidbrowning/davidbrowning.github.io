</span></span>Ken &amp; I were at Scott &amp; Mishelle’s home on Sunday night. 
We had stopped by on our way home from David &amp; Shauna’s.  Shauna had
invited us for dinner since it was Emily’s birthday.  When we walked in Scott
&amp; Mishelle’s home, Kylan and Ashley were in a playhouse build by Scott and
made out of a quilt placed over the top of the bunk bed ladder the couches and
a chair.  Scott had put their DVD Player in it and was letting them watch a
video on it in their play house.  Scott said that the children were so excited
and Ashley hugged her dad and said “Thank you daddy, you are the best daddy in
the whole world.”  Scott was happy he had made it for them.  I thought to
myself “Scott is a good dad, and I’m so glad he does those special things for
his children to show love for them.”  I was talking to Kylan on the phone on
Friday and he was telling me that his dad was going to take him bowling the
next day – on Saturday and he could hardly wait.  Sunday night Kylan was
telling me all the fun they had bowling and what a wonderful time they had. 
Ashley had been sick, but she got better, so all the family went bowling. 
That’s neat too.  Kylan had been so excited, that I hoped they would be able to
go as I knew Kylan would be so disappointed if they didn’t.</p>

</span></span>David had told us that night (Sunday, Nov 12, 2005) that Conner
runs to the door when David is ready to leave for work in the mornings and he
waves and blows kisses to him and is so cute.  He says he loves that.  I love
to hear our children tell us these things as it makes me feel so good and I am
thankful that our children love their spouses and children.</p>
