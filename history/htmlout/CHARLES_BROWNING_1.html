<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>CHARLES BROWNING –
SLAUGHTER HOUSE</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My Father, Charles Henry Browning, was a butcher
by trade; at least from the time I was old enough to remember him.  Although he
had owned a dry farm and managed a grain elevator before I was born.  I think
those occupations are recorded in his history as recorded by Betsy Browning. 
I, therefore, will not at this time re-tell those experiences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My first remembrance was that Dad ran a meat
retail department in Larsen’s General Mercantile Store on Main Street in
Victor.  I would often walk to the store and enjoy spending time with my Dad. 
He had a refrigeration room that he always kept various dressed out animals
hanging there.  He almost always had a large wooden pickle barrel in there.  I
remember that I would ask Dad for a nickel to buy candy and when he said that
he didn’t have a nickel, I would reply with, “then can I have a pickle?”  That
always got a chuckle and a “yes” reply.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad had to buy his meat from other
slaughterhouses or kill the animal in the field.  He also built a small shed
out back of the store and did some killing there.  I think that new USDA laws
finally forbid him from using that shed and frowned on him killing in the
field.  Finally Dad bought a five acre lot just outside the North West City Limits
of Victor.  There he built his own slaughterhouse for the purpose of killing
his own animals to supply meat for the Butcher shop.  I remember watching the
construction of the building.  The cement was mixed in a small electric cement
mixer, poured into wheel barrels, which were pushed by hand, to hand built
forms over 2 X 12 planking.  The original building was about 24’ X 40’ and was
divided into four rooms.  The N.W. room was the killing room, the N.E. room was
the cutting and wrapping room, the S.W. room was the cooling room and the S.E.
room was the refrigeration room.  When Dad first started killing there he did
all his cutting by hand.  My brother Rich was in the army and in one of Mom’s
letters to him she told him that Dad was working hard and often came home very
tired, with sore aching muscles after cutting an animal by hand.  Dad was still
running the shop in the store and did the butchering after hours or would have
Mom run the shop while he worked at the slaughterhouse.  On receiving this letter,
Rich found a Sears and Roebuck catalog and with some of the money he had saved,
from his military pay, he ordered an electric band saw for Dad.  It wasn’t very
long after Dad started operation in the slaughterhouse that the decision was
made to quit the shop in the grocery store and to go full time with the
slaughterhouse.  Many people in the valley wanted Dad to do the killing of
their animals instead of taking them to the Driggs slaughterhouse.  Also, Dad
found a lot of requests for him to furnish meat to the restaurants and Dude
Ranches in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The following summer Dad added a fifth room onto
the North end of the slaughterhouse.  He also built a large chicken coop and a
pig barn further north of the Slaughter House.  In the chicken coop Dad kept
approximately 300 laying hens.  This kept him with chickens to kill for meat
and eggs to sell.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Here are a couple of incidences which happened
in connection to the slaughterhouse.  I’ll add others at a later date.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On the South West corner of the block where we
lived was a hotel.  About the same time Dad was getting his slaughterhouse
going, a family by the name of Burnside became the manager of that hotel.  Mr.
Burnside also had a hobby of raising and running sled dogs.  At first he
kenneled them just behind our lot.  That soon caused a problem with many
citizens of the community as the dogs were always barking day and night.  To
add to those problems, the dogs often broke out of their kennel and caused a
nuisance in town.  He was finally told that he had to kennel his dogs outside
the city limits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mr. Burnsides set up his Dog Kennels, just
across the road from Dad's slaughter house.  The dogs would still get loose and
almost every time they did they would go for Dad's chickens.  At first it was
just a few chickens, but one night four or five dogs got out killing almost 200
chickens.  I remember helping with the cleaning of all those chickens.  Dad
saved what we could.  Dad then took the chickens up to Mr. Burnsides and told
him he had just purchased them.  Mr. Burnsides had to buy a freezer to keep
them in.  It was just a few days later that Dad and I went to the Slaughter
House, and as we got out of the pickup, we could hear chickens squawking.  Dad
jumped the fence and ran for the coop door.  Just as he arrived, a dog came out
the chicken run.  Dad caught the dog by the collar, lifting it into the air,
swung it around his head two or three times before bring it to the ground with
all his might.  The dog was killed instantly by the crushing force.   I had
just arrived at the fence to see the whole thing take place.  I was impressed
with the strength Dad had.  Mr. Burnsides had to buy a few more chickens that
day.  From then on he also tried to keep his kennels in better repair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            About a half mile south of Dad’s slaughterhouse
lived a man named Ceiler Westover and his sister.  The sister was crazy and
Ceiler was considered a moron or had a very low IQ.  Dad often had Ceiler do
some work around the slaughterhouse and would pay him a little.   Often the pay
would be with some meat to help them out.  Dad had tracks on the ceiling of the
slaughterhouse on which he would hang meat and could easily move the meat to
and from the killing room, the cooling room, the refrigeration room or to the a
loading area.  One day, Dad was cutting meat and asked Ceiler to bring a half
of beef from the cooling room.  As Ceiler was pushing it along the track, Dad
looked up to see that Ceiler had not switched the track properly and the switch
was open.  Dad hollered, but Ceiler was coming too fast to stop.   Dad ran and
as the roller came off the track, Dad caught the beef in his arms.  The roller
came down and hit Dad's head causing a large cut.   I remember watching the
blood running down his neck and him carrying the half beef to the cutting table
and putting it down with out it touching the floor.  That was another
impressive moment of Dad's strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Dad had put the fence around the slaughter
house property he had put the entrance gate coming to the South West corner of
the building.  As a result, every time he wanted to load out meat, he had to
open the gates to drive in, and then close the gates so no animals could get
out.  He decided to change the gates to the East side.  The gates consisted of
two gates, each about 10 feet long, swung off heavy posts.  The post stood
about 10 feet high and had two cross logs at the top going from one post to the
other.  This made quite a heavy frame, but Dad thought he could move the frame
without disassembling it.  The upright post had also been set in concrete and
about 3 to 4 feet deep.  We therefore dug around the concrete and planned to
break the cement off with a sludge hammer.  Dad and I were just finishing
digging around the second post when the whole frame began to move.  Dad
hollered for us to move as he thought the frame might be tipping over, but to
our amazement Ceiler had squatted down and put his arms around the first post
and was lifting the post, and cement out of the hole.  Dad and I both watched in
amazement as to Ceiler’s strength. </p>
