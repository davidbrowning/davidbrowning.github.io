as close as I can figure, Larry Braithwaite &amp; I were sustained as
counselors, in the Mound Fort 1<sup>st</sup> Ward Bishopric, to Delmar M.
Moulton, on October 29<sup>th</sup>, 1966.  I was sustained as 1<sup>st</sup>
counselor and Larry as 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor.  We were not set apart at that
time, as we were having a Stake Conference in two weeks and President Wimmer
thought it would be nice to have an Apostle set us apart.  Apostle Sterling W
Seal would be our visiting authority.  However when President Wimmer asked him
about doing it, he said that was his responsibility.  For many years I had
unkind feelings towards Elder Seal because in between the morning session and
the afternoon sessions there was held a meeting for the Stake Presidency, High
Counsel, and Bishoprics.  Elder Seal really laid it on us, bawling us out for
our low percentages.  He said that if we were to be paid a million dollars a
year, we would all work untold hours for it.  He emphasized “that the Lord
agreed to give us all that he has”, and we were not working hard enough for our
pay.  Although, all in attendance was discouraged after that meeting, in
reality he was right, and we needed to work harder.  I believe I have grown
enough to forgive him and realize that he was only trying to encourage our
Stake.  But the discouragement seems to hang on to our stake and I think our
percentages continued on the down slop.  The program at that time is that a
General Authority only came to a stakes conference every other time or every
six months.  However, on the next Stake Conference, Elder Paul Dunn of the
assistances to the Twelve came.  He was not expected by the Stake President
until that Sunday morning.  We enjoyed the morning session and then at the in
between meeting Elder Dunn really lifted us up.  I remember that the afternoon
session was great and we all looked forward to it.  After the concluding
speaker, President Wimmer announced the closing hymn and the closing prayer. 
As the hymn ended, Elder Dunn leaned over and whispered something to President
Wimmer.  As the Brother was coming to the stand to give the closing prayer,
President Wimmer stood and announced that Elder Dunn would like all Stake
Presidency, High Counsel and Bishoprics to please go to the cry room after the
prayer.  We were there only for a few minutes as Elder Dunn expressed his love
for each of us and that he just wanted to shake hands once more with each of us
before we left.  It was surly the cry room because there wasn’t a dry eye in
the group.  We left that conference ready to take on the world.  I think I will
always remember that experience.  I gained a love for Elder Dunn that I will
always cherish.  </span></p>
