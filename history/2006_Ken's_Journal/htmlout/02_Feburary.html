<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 7 AM and after reading my scriptures I showered and then went back to
bed.  I slept until 11 AM before getting up and eating some breakfast.  Last
night I felt much better but this morning I am still under the weather.  After
eating I did get on the computer and answered a e-mail to Tony and one to
Brother Macio in the Philippines.  Mae has gone shopping for a while.  I went
to sleep for a while.  Mae and I watched a JAG show but it ended to be continued. 
I hate that kind of ending because most of the time I never get to see the
ending.  This evening Mae went over to Melea and Troy’s for a Birthday party
for Troy.  I stayed home, slept some and watched show on the Hall Mark
channel.  Bob told me there was another show on another channel so I turned
channel for a few minutes but the sponsor time encouraged you to go on line and
gamble during the break.  That made me mad and I decided that I would not watch
their show just because of the commercial break.  My show was just ending when
Mae got home.  We read another chapter in our book before I entered my journal
entry and went to bed shortly after 10 PM.</span></p>

alarm set for 6 AM but I woke shortly after 5 AM.  I went back to bed for a few
minutes before getting up at 7 AM.  Bob &amp; I went over to Grant and Stacy’s
so that I could measure the back patio door for a replacement.  Mae had
breakfast ready when we got back home.  We attended the funeral services for
Robert Harris Kleitches, the father to Pat Bradfield.  Pat &amp; Ron asked me
to dedicate the grave.  Gary Nelson came but El &amp; Dennis and Joan &amp;
Ralph couldn’t make it.  We were glad that we were able to attend.  I am
feeling much better today.  Pat and Ron invited their family members plus Gary,
Mae and I to go with them to eat at Applebee’s.  it was good to have time to
visit with Pat and Ron and some of their family.  Bob and I went looking for
material for me to put doors on some shelves for Bryce and Deanna.  Mae and I went
up to the Sunset City Building to attend the wedding reception for Sandra
Graham &amp; Mason Keith Humpherys, but the line reached way out the front door
and I had a meeting with the Stake Presidency at 7 PM.  I had for gotten about
the meeting but Steve Smith reminded me of the meeting so we had to leave in
order for me to make the meeting.  It was after 8 PM when I got home so we got
something to eat and watched a show on TV and then read the last of our book. 
It was almost 11 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM but let Mae sleep in a little longer.  I really enjoyed reading in the book
of Acts this morning.  I am so grateful for the testimony that I have been
blessed with.  Mae made breakfast for me and packed me a lunch.  I showed her
how to scan items into the computer.  I took my trailer up to Bryce’s and then
went shopping for materials.  I also bought a thirteen inch plainer.  I needed
my miter box that Mishelle borrowed.  I got Bob to go over to her place and get
it for me.  Bob is having some problems with getting dizzy but he still was
willing to help me.  After getting the miter box, Bob stayed and helped me
until I quit to go home.  Bryce came and I stayed longer to install a lock on
their bedroom door.  I didn’t get home until after 6 PM.  Mae had dinner ready
and then we watched a couple of show’s on TV before we went to bed.  She really
pampers me, getting any thing that I would like.  I am really very spoiled by
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3 AM with a headache so got up and took some aspirin and slept the rest of the
night in the big chair.  We slept in until almost 8 AM before we got up and
took showers and started the day.  I finished setting the window in the outside
door.  We were going to go to Home Depot and get some materials but the day has
gone fast and it was time for us to go to Sherry’s son Cole’s Baptism.  Bob
both baptized and confirmed him but in the conformation he said “ordain”
instead of “confirm” so after the Bishop had them go into his office and re do
the conformation.  We were invited into the recreation hall for cake and ice
cream.  We went over to Home Depot and bought materials that I will need for
Bryce’s job.  When we got home we watched two movies on TV before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                With our
meetings starting at 11 AM we were able to relax this morning.  This being the
first Sunday we continued our fast from yesterday evening.  Also the Bishopric
took the lesson time during Priesthood so I was able to get out of giving the
firs Sunday message.  They did a wonderful job with their messages.  I took the
opportunity to bare my testimony during Fast Meeting today.  There were many of
our members that were missing today.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner
this afternoon.  After dinner Mark went with me and we walked to Sister
Walkers.  We administered to Kelsey Walker as she hasn’t been feeling well and
Sister Walker also wanted to receive a blessing.  I appreciated Mark going with
me and helping.  Mae wanted a picture of she and I to be printed so that she
might cut them out and insert then into a valentine frame for each of our
Grandchildren.  I must have spent 4 or 5 hours getting them printed for her.  I
was tired when we finished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM but let Mae sleep as she didn’t sleep very well last night.  I went up to
Bryce’s and worked until 11 AM.  I guess that my Palm went low on power and I
lost all data and had to restore it when I got home.  I stopped and deposited
$350 cash that Bryce had paid me in advance.  Mae had her hair trimmed, colored
and set this morning.  She got home in time to go with me to see Dr. Johnson. 
He feels that I should have my stomach scoped so I will have that done
Wednesday February 15<sup>th</sup>.  From there we went to Bountiful where we
mailed a package to Shellie and then went over to the Bountiful Rest Home and
visited Sister Kathleen Nelson.  She was glad to have us come but with her
Alzheimer Disease we don’t think she knew who we were.  That is sad to see her
in that situation.  We went out to eat at the Chuck Wagon.  On the way home we
took a drive up Farmington canon to see if it would be a good place to go
snowmobiling but did not go clear to the top.  Coming back down Mae suggested that
we stop &amp; look at the beautiful sunset &amp; valley below.  We came home
and I did some work on the computer and made my journal entry.  I also had to
re-enter several  entries in my Palm that I had made since the last time I had
ran a back-up.</span></p>

AM coughing and was afraid that I would wake Mae so I got up.  It was after
2:30 but before 3 when I went back to sleep in the recliner.  I got back up at
6 AM to get ready for work but lay back down for another hour.  I got to work
before 9 AM and worked until 5 PM.  Bob went over to The Home Depot to get
another 2 x 4 for me because I cut one to short to use.  I also had him trade
some hinge set because they had the wrong corner cut.  I did get quite a lot
accomplished and I think Deanna and maybe Bryce will appreciate the look of the
shelving when I finish.  I just had time to eat and get ready for my meeting
when I got home.  We met as a High Priest Group leadership and then Brother
Smith and I went visiting Brother Dave Ericksen and Brother and Sister Barns
this evening.  It was 9 PM when I got home.  I filled in my journal and wanted
to get right to bed but Mark came down and that lead to some discussion.  It
was after 10 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
late.  We had some breakfast and I worked on the bank statements.  Chelci came
by and had lunch with us.  I went into Ogden and paid my bill at The Home Depot
and then went us to Shaver Mart and bought new blades and a head for my electric
razor.  I went over to Cerissa Thompson’s to discuss the work she needs done. 
I visited with her live- in boy friend and we decided that I will remove the
plumbing and the damaged floor and her boy friend will tile the floor.  I will
then reinstall the plumbing.  I will start tomorrow on a time base at a rate of
$30 per hour.  Mae and I went shopping and when we got home I started working
on the checking accounts again.  It took most of the evening getting them in
balance.  </span></p>

work this morning at Cerissa Thompson’s where I removed two layers of under layment
that was water damaged do to a bad toilet seal.  When it was repaired before,
whoever installed the toilet did a poor job.  I worked until 2:30 PM.  After
taking my truck home I went over to Roy where I had ordered a corsage for Mae. 
I also bought her a Valentine Card.  Bryce and Deanna stopped by for a few
minutes and paid me another $200 for the work I did for them.  I took a 40 minute
nap before getting ready to go out.  Georgia and Rick invited us for dinner and
then we went to a Tri-Stake Valentine dance.  The Davis concert band provided
the music.  It was a very nice dance but by 10:30 PM I was very tired.  I ate
some toast with peanut butter and honey before I made my journal entry. 
Georgia told us that Ralph Provost died the first part of January.  We were sad
to find that out and that we hadn’t been able to attend the services.</span></p>

to the church and helped clean the building.  We only had four of us there so
we were a couple of hours getting it done.  I came home and cooked breakfast.  I
worked on plans today but have been unable to do much.  Mae had me check the
car as we are getting a “service engine soon” light that is coming on.  I
couldn’t find anything wrong but I did change the air filter.  I drove over to
Ogden and the light came back on.  I stopped and washed the car and the engine
and then returned home.  The light didn’t come on this time.  Bob come down to
remind Mae of the sales at Tom’s so I went over with Bob and got a few items. 
I got home just in time to change and got to the World Wide Leadership
Training.  It was very good and focused on the Family.  We ate some super when
I returned and then went up stairs and played “Canasta” with Bob and Carroll. 
We quite and came downstairs at 10:30 PM.  I filled out my journal and we went
to bed.</span></p>

early this morning to attend a Stake Priesthood Leadership meeting.  When I
went to start the car it almost started and then went dead.  I had to take the
truck to meeting and we took it again for the block meetings.  Meetings went
well and Mae felt good at the way her class went.  I have had quite a bit of
stomach pains during the meetings.  I met Jeff and Gail at 4 PM and took them
to Irven’s home to look at it.  At 5 PM Scott and family, David and family and
Jeff and Gail came over for dinner and spent the evening.  Jeff, Shauna, David,
Scott and I played a game.  It was quite fun.  It was a good evening having our
family here.  Bob had a dizzy spell and could see double this afternoon.  We
went up to check on him this evening and he seems to be doing ok.  We were
tired and soon went to bed.</span></p>

the car over for him to check.  After breakfast I was going to call our
insurance co. and have them send a tow truck to take our car to Dee’s garage to
get it repaired.  I decided to check the car one more time before calling and
it started right up and ran fine.  I called Dee and ask him what he thought. 
He said to bring it over and let him check it.  I got Mark to help me drive it
over.  Mae used Bob’s car to go to Farmington where she met and went walking
with Jackie Thompson.  I took Bob up to see his Doctor.  He could not find any
reason for his double sight yesterday.  We went up to the county dumps and
unloaded the trash from Cerissa Thompson’s house.  We also stopped at Durk’s
Plumbing and I visit with Chris about hydronic heat.  I worked on the computer
drawing house plans for a while.  Mae had invited Robin Walker and her family
over for dinner and Family Home Evening.  Mae made a nice dinner, then we had a
short lesson witch I gave and then we played some games.  They went home at 8
PM.  I entered my journal and worked on house plans for a while.</span></p>

house plans.  Mae went shopping with Mishelle to buy wedding and wedding shower
gifts.  Jeff brought Mae a Valentine card and me a gift certificate during his
lunch hour.  This after noon Bob took Mae and I shopping at the BX on Hill Air
Force Base.  We were able to find some good buys on some gifts and we also

some items for a wedding shower for Chelci.  The roads were very bad and
traffic was slow.  After eating dinner I went over to the Church and shoveled the
walks.  Brother Higgley had been there before I got there and cleaned of the
main walks with a four wheeler.  Mark also went over with me and we were able
to finish cleaning the walks in about a hours time.  Bob and I went Home
Teaching to Brother Jackson’s.  Sister Jackson and their daughter are in St.

papers for Mae to send to the Dugan’s.  We also stopped and got a birthday card
for Quint.  I worked on the cabin plans for a while.  This evening I went
upstairs while Mae had her book group here.  Bob had a DVD of Mobsters and
Mormons that we started to watch but we only got into it about 15 minutes when
we became disgusted with it and shut it off.  We put on the show “The Sound of
Music” and enjoyed it so much more.  </span></p>

Chris Payne were sealed and married for Time and Eternity.  The Sealer was
Brother Pinegar and he gave a marvels short talk before performing the marriage
ceremony.  After pictures were taken Mae and Carroll took our car and went to
Grantsville to attend a Wedding Shower for Chelci.  Bob, Mark and I went to the
Lions House for the Bridal Breakfast.  It was a very nice dinner.  When we got
home I took a nap.  Bob woke me when Rich, Lois and Elise came.  Elise was
tired so I had her take a nap on our spare bed.  The rest of us played Mormon
Bridge.  Mae and Carroll came just as we finished the first game and so we
played a second game.  We also played one hand of Knock.  Elise, Rich and
Carroll drove their car to Salt Lake and Mark, Mae and I took our car.  The
reception was held at the Chapel just West of the State Capital Building.  It
was a nice reception but lightly attended.  I am sure the bad weather had a lot
to do with that.  We stayed until the reception was over.  I am sure that Mark
would have like to have gone earlier.  It has been a good day.  Mae said that
the shower went well for Chelci.</span></p>

family.  Irven &amp; Sandy had taken Christine, Mat and their family to the
airport so they could fly home.  However Christine called later to inform them
that their flight was canceled in Dallas due to weather.  They have to stay in
Dallas tonight and should be able to get home tomorrow.  That will make Mat
miss a day of schooling.  We enjoyed visiting and ate dinner with them.  We
then played a game of Mormon Bridge with the family.  We were late getting

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7:30 AM when I got up.  Mae slept a little longer before she got up.  We
changed the sheets on the bed and I prepared breakfast while Mae started the
washing.  I took a couple of knifes upstairs and used Bob’s sharpener.  Of
course Bob, Mark and I got talking and that took some time.  I worked most of
the day on the cabin plans. Mae wrote letters to Sister Vengco and Sister Emie
Valtazar.  She used the old computer so it took me a little while trying to
remember how to get it to print.  Bob invited us to eat super with them. 
Sherrie had brought some noodles to them so we ate with them and watched the
show “The Parent Trap”.  We then came downstairs and watched the show “Sound of
Music”.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
7:30 AM and Mae got up shortly after.  I went down to Randy’s and picked up a
check that repaid us for the $40,000 we loaned Jay Bird Investment Inc. plus
interest of $839.87.  When I came back Mae was on the computer so I got myself
something to eat and then because I was cold I wrapped up in a blanket and went
to sleep for an hour.  Mae was gone to meet some of her friends for lunch.  I
spent the rest of the afternoon working on plans.  Mae and I went into
Riverdale to the Best Buy and bought a Chess game for me for my Birthday.  We
then went to the Ogden Temple where we ate in the cafeteria and then went
through a session.  There was several from our Ward there.  We stopped at
Farr’s after and I bought Mae an ice cream cone.  We then went to Wal-Mart and
bought me two shirts for my birthday.  On the way home Mae read another chapter
from our book.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We took the
car over to Dee’s Garage and left it there for him to work on and try to
correct the emissions.  From there we went to the Davis Hospital where they ran
some upper G. I. test.  After I got home I fixed me something to eat.  Mae got
on the computer so I took a nap.  I worked on plans for 5 hours this afternoon
plus I loaded my chess program that Mae bought me for my birthday.  After
dinner we went over to Sportsman Warehouse and looked at the fishing report
board.  We also bought some bait and some propane tanks for the heater.  Mae
read from our book as we traveled.  Irven called just after we got home.  He
invited us to attend a meeting with them tomorrow evening.  I told him I would
if I get back from fishing in time.  Mae played a game of solitary and I played
a game of chess, which I won.  We got clothing out for tomorrow.  We went to
bed about 9:45 PM and I had forgotten that I was to go with Steve Smith to
check the building.  He went by himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
left shortly after 8 AM and went up to Manua ice fishing.  When we first got on
the ice I drilled the first hole and checked with the fish finder and saw
fish.  I set Mae up and before I got set up her pole started to dip.  That was
the last action we had.  We quit at 1:30 PM and went snowmobiling for a while. 
We got some reading in and it was an enjoyable day.  It was 5:30 PM when we got
home and I was beat so I called Irven and backed out of going to Salt Lake with
them.  We watched a movie on TV and then I took a nap.  I was ready to go with
Steve at 10 PM but he didn’t show up.  I finally called him.  He had fallen
asleep so I guess we are even for me forgetting last night.  I filled out my
journal entry after I got home from checking the church house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM for about 45 minutes but then went back to bed.  I didn’t wake until 7:45
AM.  I helped Mae make the bed and then prepared breakfast while Mae did her
hair.  I called Dee’s and spoke with the mechanic about our car.  They will
have it repaired today.   I had Bob go with me and I checked out the needs to
repair Robin Walker’s garage door.  I cleaned out my ice fishing tent and put
it away.  Mae went visiting teaching and when she returned we left for Mike’s. 
We went by way of Weber Canon as I wanted to drive up Loss creek to the
reservoir, however I was lessening to Mae read and watching the road and I
drove by the turn off.  We decided not to turn back but to go on to Heber
City.  We were looking for a sign that David had seen when Mike, David and I
had gone ice fishing at Strawberry in January.  We could not find the sign but
did stop at Heber Log Co. and visited with them about building material for our
cabin in Star Valley.  I ask if there were any building lots in the area of
Heber but they didn’t know of any.  We came on down to Orem where I called and
found that there is a gas station in Orem that on 800 N 1500 W that has natural
gas for vehicles.  We went there and filled the truck.  We then went on to
Mike’s.  Mike has bought a 2004 Mini Cooper made by BMW.  He and I took it and
went to Well’s Fargo where we closed out our safety deposit box.  We played
games this evening after the little girls went to bed.  It was late when we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until almost 8 AM.  We enjoyed a peaceful morning with Mike and the children. 
Becky is gone with her sister’s and sister-in-law’s for a couple of days.  Mike
and I went to the sports store and looked around for a while.  Mike had me
select some things for my birthday that the four couples, Mike &amp; Becky,
David &amp; Shauna, Jeff &amp; Gail and Sandi, could give me.  On the way home
we took a road up the mountain north of American Fork.  It went up to the top
where very expensive homes are being built and back down into Draper.  It is
unbelievable the amount of homes that have been built in that area.  We stopped
at --- and bought me some socks.  Mae had dinner ready when we got home.  After
eating and cleaning up we left to come home.  I took Mae over the same road
that Mike and I had gone just to show it to her.  We stopped at the store and
bought a few groceries before going on home.  We went over to the Stake
activity this evening.  It was ok and a lot of families attended.  We enjoyed
dancing although it was just a disk jockey.  We left just after 9 PM and went
over to Maverick to get gas and a frozen yogurt.  I played a game of chess and
before I finished Steve came and got me and we checked the church house for
security.  I entered my journal.  Bob came down for a few minutes.  Mae made
Funeral Potatoes for tomorrow’s dinner at David’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and enjoyed the late meeting schedule.  Meetings went well and with the aid of
a cough drop and some gum, I stayed awake through the complete block.  When we
got home Mae made some grilled cheese sandwiches and then she went back to the
church for R. S. visiting teachers conference.  We then went up to David and
Shauna’s where almost all of our family gather in honer of my birthday.  After
dinner all the family gathered and gave me gifts.  Gail and Jeff gave me one of
the new flash lights that never need new batteries.  All the rest went in
together with a fishing hat, two fishing pole holders for carrying the polls,
and three pair of socks.  Mae asked all the kids to tell something or an
experience they remembered about me.  Mike was hesitant to do this.  David
started and once it started there was many experiences shared.  It was a very
enjoyable evening.  We got home just before 10 PM.  I was ready to go with
Steve Smith to check the building but when he didn’t come before 10:30 I called
him.  He said that the Bishop told him to check it after a 6 PM meeting so he
did.  Mae called Terry to visit with him about the Bushnell Family reunion.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke quite
early and so I lay in the big chair and fell back to sleep.  Mae woke me about
8 AM but we went back to bed for a while.  Bob and I drove up to the Lost Creek
reservoir to see what it is like.  I don’t think the ice is very thick and I
don’t think it would be a good place for Randy to be.  Mae prepared a dinner
for my Birthday and invited Bob, Carroll, Mark, Irven &amp; Sandy.  She had
dinner ready at 4 PM.  Bob, Carroll, Mark, and Irven came then.  Sandi came a
little later.  After dinner we played a new game of European Train’s.  We had
fun playing that and then we played “Marbles” and enjoyed that.  We visited
Irven &amp; Sandy for a while before they went home.  By the time I made my
journal entry and we got ready, it was after mid-night before we went to bed.</span></p>

until almost 8 AM.  We had to hurry to get ready as Bob invited us for
breakfast of fish at 9 AM.  Mae and I then went to Sister Walker’s as she asked
if I would give her a Priesthood Blessing.  Mae then went for a treatment with
Dr. Bennett.  She stopped on the way home and bought me some Velcro to attach
my pole holders to my pickup and ice fishing sled.  I went upstairs and watched
a DVD that Irven let us borrow that left us with a lot of questions about the
destruction of the World Trade Towers.  The evident shown on that DVD and the
questions asked certainly makes you wonder about our National Government and
security.  I worked on cabin plans for a little while.  At 7 PM I attended a
High Priest Group Leadership meeting.  At 7:30 we invited our committee
chairman into our meeting and discussed ideas with them.  After they were
excused we continued our meeting for a while.  Shellie called and I asked her
if I could call her back. I did as soon as we dismissed.  We talked for about a
half hour.  I sure enjoyed talking to her and she wished me a happy birthday.  
Steve and I went to the church at 10:15 to check the security.  There was a
group still playing basketball that we had to ask to quite and leave but all
else was fine.  I finished entering my journal.  Mae called Shellie back and
visited with her for a while. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I just want to send a big
Thank You for all of you coming Sunday in honor of my Birthday.  It was special
for all of you to make such a effort.  The gifts are really appreciated and I
will remember each of you as I use and enjoy them.  I was never gifted with
words and often when I start to express my feelings my mouth gets going before
my mind does.  I hope you will remember that and forgive me and take what I say
for what it is worth, but not offensively.  As we left to come home I thought
of the evening and what I had said.  I am fearful that I didn’t express a
proper appreciation, like I wanted to.  I also realized that I may have even
offended some.  For example, when I opened the flash light I commented about
some lights we had bought that didn’t work.  (Only one didn’t work, and perhaps
it still will).  I hope I didn’t give the impression that I was disappointed in
anyway with the one that was given to me.  These kind are great because you
don’t need batteries.  I have used it already and put it in my truck.  The
small light I put on my key chain as it will be handy when I put a key into a
lock at night.  I have water proofed my fishing hat and am excited that it will
shade my face, neck and ears when I’m fishing.  I bought some Velcro and have
installed my fishing rod holders and am grateful that I now won’t have to worry
about my poles getting broken.  I am wearing my socks already and appreciate
them as I needed them.  Mom was saying a while ago that we both needed to buy
socks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>As Jeff and Gail were getting
ready to leave Sunday evening, thoughts and comments were expressed about their
expected baby.  I had to just smile as Jeff expressed his concerns and even
fears to David.  Then David explained that before his children arrived he had
the same concerns.  I thought how interesting that we have to go through
personal experiences in order to understand them.  I have always been amused
that when Mom explains a recipe, she often does it the same way Grandma
Bushnell or Grandma Porter or Grandma Jensen did.  To which she would respond,
how do I know what is “Just until it is thick enough or sweet enough or moist enough?”
I do hope that if Mom or I get too <i>concerned</i> or too <i>anxious</i> <i>or
give unwanted advice or are even over bearing</i> that you would remember that
our concerns are motivated by the love we have for each one of you.   Our
Children, their companions, our Grand Children and Great Grand Children are our
greatest joy, concern and happiness.</span></p>
