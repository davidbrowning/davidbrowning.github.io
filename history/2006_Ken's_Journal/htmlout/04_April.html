<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t wake
until 7:30 this morning so after the normal morning routine I finished yesterday’s
journal entry and started this one.  We watched the first session of General
Conference.  I did a little work on the house plans between sessions.  At 6 PM
Shellie and I went to visit the Lewis’s and told him of my experiences of pain
and what I had done to overcome it.  I done know if it will help him or not. 
He has been longer in pain than I was but I don’t think his pain was any
greater or maybe even as great as what mine was.  I did not want to miss
General Priesthood but maybe it can help him.  Roy, Shellie, Mae and I went out
to eat this evening.  After getting home we watched part of a show but Mae and
I gave up on it and came to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then got up and showered.  I helped Shellie prepare breakfast.  Conference
had started before we got breakfast ready but we just ate while it was on.  We
enjoyed the conference speakers and especially President Hinkle’s closing
talk.  After conference Mae and I decided that we would leave after the closing
session and drive part way tonight.  We left about 4 PM D.S.T. and drove as far
as Page and stayed at Motel 8.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7 AM but then we loose an hour as soon as we get into Utah.  We ate a
little before leaving the motel as they offered a continental breakfast with
the room.  It was 11 when we got to Panguage so we stopped and walked around a
block to starch our legs.  We stopped at a Hogie Yogie and got a frozen yogurt
and a sandwich.  We then traveled on to Fillmore and stopped at Bill and
Joyce’s.  They said they hadn’t found much in way as property for sale.  We did
visit with a realtor but got the same response.  We came on to American Fork
where we stopped at Mike’s for a little while.  They fed us before we came on
home.  Mike is now caring a concealed weapon and has a permit for it.  It is
scary at what a school principle has to worry about now days.  It was after 9
PM when we got home and then brought every thing in and put things away.  We
were sure tired and ready for bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early but forgot that our clocks have not all been set to daylight saving time
and I thought we still had plenty of time.  I had planed to leave for S.L.
about 8 AM but didn’t make it until almost 9 AM.  I called the Door &amp;
Window Bargain to see if my door was ready.  He said he was just finishing it
so we drove down to get the door.  The door was in very bad condition when we
got there.  The light didn’t fit properly and the door had a large scratch on
it.  I told him that the door was unacceptable and we left.  We checked on some
doors on the way home and ended up going out to BMC West and buying a slab and
a light there.  Things didn’t go very good for me today.  I bought paint to
finish the door and then went to cut the door.  I had questions as to whether
the door will fit so I help off until tomorrow when I can take it out to
Sandi’s.  I decided that I would have to buy a new set of sheet rocking stilts
to do Chad’s basement so bought a set up above H.A.F. B.  I went grocery
shopping with Mae.  She fixed me something to eat when we got home and I went
to a H.P. Group Leadership meeting at 7 PM.  Mae was on the inter-net when I
got home and was on it until after 9:30 PM.  I then entered my journal entry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM but we didn’t get away for Sandi’s until 8:45.  We stopped at the grocery
store to pickup Mae’s prescriptions but they didn’t open until 9 AM so we went
on.  It was storming on the way but the worst was the winds.  I slowed down to
50 MPH because of concerns about the wind.  Although the weather was sometimes
bad I was able to remove the old door, cut the new door and install it.  I was
sure glad that I hadn’t cut the door at home because it would have been wrong. 
This way it worked out good.  We visited with Sandi about her engagement to
Nick.  I hope she understands our desire to help and support her.  We came home
and got here just in time for Bob and I to go Home Teaching.  We visited with
the Jackson’s and the Johnston’s, both are doing ok.  The Jackson’s have a new
baby girl and she seems to be doing well.  We were at the Johnston’s quite a
while.  Bob helped me get his generator out and put oil in it so I can take it
with Mae and I tomorrow.  My generator still isn’t finished.  I ate a little
dinner and then tried to get organized to go tomorrow.  I couldn’t find some of
the information I wanted to take with me tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early planning to go to Wyoming but it was snowing hard.  Vanita called and
said they were really getting a hard storm.  We changed our plans and stayed
home.  At 9:45 AM Mae had an appointment to have her tooth fixed so I took her
over to Ogden.  While she was in with the Dentist, I worked on my house plans. 
We spent a lot of time looking for a projector screen but really didn’t find
any.  This evening I balanced our checking accounts.  That took me quite a
while.  I don’t feel very well this evening.  Both Mae and I took a nap today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up to early but I had a lot to do.  Aunt Beth called and needed some help.  I
made some calls to Inkley’s to purchase a projector screen.  After breakfast I
went to Wells Fargo Bank and closed our checking account with them. I
re-deposited the money into our savings at America First Credit Union and while
at the store purchased some salt pellets for the water softener. I went to Aunt
Beth’s and repaired her toilet and got a case of goods out from her storage. 
After filling my pickup with natural gas I stopped at Durk’s plumbing and paid
my bill.  I took the pickup to the Kaysville inspection shop and got it checked
and licensed.  Mae fixed us a sandwich when I returned home.  I went over to
the Ogden cannery with Bob and Mark and helped can sugar.  It didn’t take us
very long.  Mae has been busy all morning and afternoon around the house.  I
helped her for a while.  Bryce and Deanna came to have dinner with us this
evening.  After dinner we helped Bryce and Deana with their computer and gave
them several presentation files in case they needed them in the mission. It was
after mid-night before I got to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM and decided to stay up and prepare biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  Mae
convinced me that I would wake Bryce and Deanna if I got up this early so I
went back to sleep for a few minutes.  Then Mae got up and let me sleep.  When
I got up at 7:40 Mae had breakfast about ready.  We then found out that they
wanted to fast today before being set apart this evening.  Mae therefore
invited Bob, Carroll and Mark down for breakfast.  I tried to call Sister
Walker after breakfast to arrange for a time that I could install new springs
on her garage door, but she didn’t answer.  I figured the materials needed to
re-install the fence for the back yard.  Bob and I went over to Home Depot and
got what we needed.  The rest of the day was spent digging the fence post holes
and installing the post.  Before quitting for the day we went over and got my
generator.  Mae had picked up the projector screen I had ordered through
Inkley’s.  She also called and visited with Sister Moulton.  It sounds like she
is ready to go home.  Mae and I showered and enjoyed cuddling in bed and
watching a JAG movie that Bob had recorded for us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7:30 and Mae slept until almost 8:30.  We enjoy our meeting schedule as we can
sleep in on Sundays.  I worked on Terry information concerning his death.  I
enjoyed Priesthood but didn’t go to Sunday school as I visited with Smoky to
see how they are doing.  I also visited with Steve and Mark about home
teaching.  Mae went into Jr. Sunday School.  We had a lot of visitors in
Sacrament meeting because of three babies to be blessed.  I slept through most
of the testimony section.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner at 2:30 PM and
then we went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and ate about 5:30 PM.  We enjoyed
being there; Jeff and Gail come over for a little while.  It was fun to visit
with them.  Mishelle has done a great job with remodeling the bathroom off the
family room.  She is quite amazing with the things she dose.  We got home about
10 PM.  I made some entries into our checking and savings accounts and made my
journal entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early so I could get started.  Bob and I went to Sister Walker’s and installed
new overhead garage door springs.  That went well and then we came home and
worked on the fence.  We got all but one section of the fence done.  I had to
quite to run up to the sheetrock supplier and get some sanding screens to use
up to Chad’s.  Mae worked on preparing pictures to show at a fireside in the
Country Creek Single Adult group this evening.  We went to that at 6:30 PM but
other than Ken &amp; Christine Wilks, Tina Linderman and her father were the
only ones that showed up.  The Wilks would have had us stay longer but we told
them I had to get up early in the morning.  I was so tired that I didn’t even
do my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 4
AM to get ready to leave for Idaho at 6 AM.  Chad was here just after 6 AM and
we soon left for Idaho Falls.  We stopped and filled up the truck in Ogden
before going on.  When we got to Chad’s I assembled my stilts before I started
taping the ceiling of their basement.  Chad had some work to still do on the
sheetrock.  He did go into work about 3 PM, for a couple of hours.  After working
on the stilts for a couple of hours my toes began to burn me until it seemed
that I was standing on a fire.  I had to get off the stilts for the rest of the
day.  We quit and ate some super about 7 PM then I took a shower and quit for
the rest of the day.  I showered and then entered my journal for two days.  I
called Mae to find out how her class went this evening and to let her know that
I loved and missed her.  I think I was in bed before 10 PM.  I worked about 5
hours today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I started the
day at 6 AM but it was 7:30 before I started work.  Chad got up at 6:15 and was
out the door by 6:40 headed for work.  There was a lot of work that should have
been done before I got here and furniture and carpeting still on the floor so I
lost better than 4 ½ hours doing that.  Those that hung the drywall had never
taped so they did not know some of the things they should have known before
they hung the sheetrock so taping is a lot slower.  One problem is that the builder
of the house put wall studs and floor joists on 19 ½” centers.  I have never
seen that done before and I wonder if that is code here.  Anyway it is going
slower than I thought it would.  I called Maggie Klass and she wants me to
finish the stair railing and help them plan the shower in the one bathroom. 
Chad got home about 6:45 PM just as I was quitting for the day.  Chad fixed
some dinner, I showered, Chad went to The Home Depot for some sheetrock corners
for me, I called Mae and entered my journal entry.  I am now very tired and
ready to go to bed.  Good night.  I worked 10 hours today</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I again got
started before 8 AM and worked until 1 PM then stopped for lunch and a short
nap.  I was back to work at 2 PM and didn’t stop until 7:30 PM.   Chad’s family
got home about 4 PM.  Chad and I went over some of my house plans so that he
might figure my beam needs.  I called Mae again this evening.  We will plan on
returning Monday for a day or two and then go over to Star Valley.  Chad wants
to do some work downstairs so I will show him what to do, and then go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>My hands are sure getting dry
from the water and sheetrock mud and they are becoming sore from exercise that
I’m not use to doing.  I worked 10 ½ hours today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I fixed
myself some wheat cereal for breakfast and then went to work just before 8 AM. 
I worked hard and stopped at 1 PM and fixed me myself a sandwich for lunch and
took a short nap before going back to work.  I quit at 7 PM and cleaned up.  By
7:30 PM I was loaded up and headed for home.  At Downey it started to rain and
rained heavy over the pass and continued raining all the way home.  I got home
at 10:30 PM.  it is sure good to get home.  Mae has been busy all day preparing
for our family to come for a Easter Egg hunt tomorrow.  I worked 10 hours
today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning and then got up and got ready for our family.  The weather broke
and it was a good day for the Easter egg hunt out side.  Mae divided the hunt
up so the older children looked in the far back yard and the smaller children
hunted in the front section of the back yard.  Bob was able to finish putting
up the chain link fence so it was good to know that the children couldn’t get
out into the street.  Mae had prepared a nice dinner with the help of our
daughter-in-laws.  I discussed the possible ways of financing our home in
Wyoming with my sons.  I also called and talked to Shellie and to Sandi about
it.  We have a lot of questions about what to do.  I just hate to put all our
money into it plus all the labor and then have the banks get it.  There is
still a lot of decisions about it.  At 3 PM I came in and took a ½ hr. nap so I
would be able to stay awake during the Priesthood Leadership meeting in
connection with Stake Conference.  Mae was very tired by the time our family
left and she finished straightening the house.  She sure appreciated the help
our daughter-in-laws gave her.  Our sons all have great wives.  I just hope my
sons realize that.  Mae went to the evening session with me.  We came home and
watched the movie of “Sleeping Beauty”.  I saw the end of it but fell asleep
right after that.  Bob had cooked some pies using raw sugar and gave me a slice
of pumpkin.  That is the first pie I have eaten since November of 1988.  It
didn’t seem to bother me.  bob also sent down a full apple pie made with the
raw sugar but I didn’t dare try too much at one time.</span></p>

and then when we got up we discussed the Wyoming home.  We are not sure just
what to do.  We ate some breakfast at 11:30 and then went to Stake Conference
held at the Ogden Tabernacle.  When we got home Mae and I took a nap.  We
prepared some dinner of halibut with baked potatoes, squash and salad.   This
evening we watched the show “White Fang”.  Mike called concerned about Doug and
Karen so I called and talked to Doug.  They are doing ok and improving.  They
have a lot of bills but at this time they don’t know how the insurance will
turn out.  Doug said that they are still ok financially but a told him to let
us know if that changes.  I had to catch up my journal for a couple of days
this evening.  Its late and we are going to Idaho in the morning so I had
better get to bed.</span></p>

am, but didn’t get away until 8:30.   We finished reading our 3<sup>rd</sup>
volume of “Prelude to Glory” on the way.  They are great books about the
Revolutionary War.  We will have to buy the 4<sup>th</sup> volume to read on
our way home.  Mae reads while I drive.  We stopped in Idaho Falls for lunch at
a Subway and also bought bread, yogurt, etc at Smiths before going on to Chad
&amp; Lindsey’s.   I started sanding and mudding about 1:00 p.m.  Mae played
with their children, visited with Lindsey and vacuumed up the dust after I
sanded.  We ate supper of Navaho Tacos about 7:30 pm.  I then finished up a few
corners and then we had Family Home Evening about 9:15.  Chad asked Mae &amp; I
to tell our favorite missionary story for home evening, which we did.  I
showered afterwards and then we went to bed.  We brought up our blow-up
mattress and laid it on their daughter, McCartney’s bedroom floor.  We found
out yesterday that Kim’s wife, Jeanenne’s mother passed away on Friday.  Mae
called Georgia to let her know since Kim didn’t let any of us know.  I put in 7

after 8 am.  I quit for lunch about 12:45.  After lunch and a short nap, I
started back on the basement at 1:30.  Mae read to me out of the book “Natural
Cures”, a book Bruce loaned us while I put the 3<sup>rd</sup> coat of mud on
the walls and ceiling.  When I began texturing the ceiling of the bedroom and
bathroom, Mae helped me by putting mud on the trial.  We then did the ceiling
of the family room.  We had to quit about halfway through to eat supper.  Chad
and Lynsey had invited the missionaries for supper.  Lynsey made really good
pizza using Rodes Bake &amp; Serve bread as the crust and a spinach sauce &amp;
chopped chicken.  We enjoyed visiting with the young missionaries.  Mae again
helped me finish the ceiling and then I did some touch up work before coming to
bed.  It was after 10 pm when I quit.  I put in 11 hours today.</span></p>

downstairs for about an hour this morning and then Mae and I left for Wyoming. 
We stopped at Deseret Book and bought book 4 of “The Prelude to Glory”.  We
drove to Stare Valley to looked at our lot and talk to some suppliers.  At
Alpine I talked to a man that said that property values have gone up a lot in
the past year.  We then went up to the office and talked to them about building
or maybe selling.  She informed us that our lot may now be worth $70,000 to
$73,000.  We talked to a Realtor and she said we should list it at $72,500.00
if we want to sell it and she felt we should get it.  We ate some lunch and
then talked to Lampe Concrete co. about supplies.  We then stopped and saw
Banita for a few minutes before coming back to Chad and Lynsey.  Chad told us
that the job in Utah that he had applied for came through and they have three
weeks before he is to report.  We thought we would get to bed early but it
still ended up after 10:30 before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got started
just after 8 AM sanding.  Mae helped me by cleaning up my mess.  I sure enjoy
having Mae with me this week.  I completed the work about 4:30 PM.  We packed
up my tools and our clothing and were prepared to leave about 5:30 PM.  We
stopped and got chicken sandwiches to eat for diner.  After we got on the
freeway we called to see if we could go to Rich &amp; Lois’s this evening.  We
enjoyed visiting and playing Mormon Bridge.  It was late when we got to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
after breakfast left Rich and Lois’s just after 9 AM.  I had taken time to do a
little measuring as Elise wants me to do some remodeling of the house for her. 
I am a little concerned about doing it as I will only do it right and Rich is
more concerned about saving a little money.  We went by way of Lava, through Montpelier
and to Garden City.  At Garden City we met with a realtor who showed us four
different lots.  Each was in two lots groups so that we have to buy two lots
together.  We are some what interested in the first set but we need more
information on what we can do with them.  After buying some lunch, we came
home, getting here at 4:35 PM.  It was 5:30 when we got to Brother &amp; Sister
Clark’s.  They drove from there and we went to S.L. where we attended a concert
featuring the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra, The Oak Ridge Boys, the
U.S. Army Herald Trumpets and Expressions of Silence.  When we got back to the
Clarks we went in and visited for a while and had some fruit and ice cream.  It
was a great evening and we got home just before mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  I had slept in the recliner all night because of stomach
problems.  We discussed the pros and cons to the different lots we have looked
at.  We went into the Temple about noon and went through a session.  We went
with the main purpose to trying to find out what we should do about the lots
and building.  I don’t know the answer but feel that we should not build this
year.  I don’t know what the Lord would have us do but I guess we will go with
that decision for now.  We went out to eat at Sizzlers after the session.  This
evening we started to watch a show on DVD but the end of it is bad so we
couldn’t see the end of it.  I guess Irven and Sandy called Bob and want to
know if Sandy and Mark can stay with us for two or three months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and read my scriptures and took a shower.  I crawled back in bed for a while. 
Time went fast and we had to hurry to get to church.  Meetings were very good
and we enjoyed being there.  Bob and Carroll invited us to eat dinner with
them.  Just before we went up to dinner Mike returned my call from yesterday. 
I informed him that we were not going to build this year.  In his questioning I
told him that we might accept another mission call.  I caught up my journal as
I was two or three days behind.  Mae was on the phone most of the remainder of
the day, as the boys called and talked to her about our decisions.  I took a
nap.  This evening we read from a book written by Nola Vance concerning their
experience with the Teton Dam flood.  Charles Hyer called and visited with me
for a few minutes.  As we go to bed I am not sure what the Lord has in store
for us but I just hope we are making the right decisions.  I sure feel lost.</span></p>

about 6:30 AM although I slept in the big chair most of the night and then Mae
woke early so to let me sleep she slept in the big chair.  It was raining this
morning so Bob and I didn’t get in to much of a hurry to load trash.  Mark came
out and we got his limb chopper going and chopped up a lot of trimmings.  Just
before we left for Sherrie’s to get her trash Mae came out and told me that
Sister Walker needs help.  Her car stalled in Farmington and a police officer
brought her home.  Bob and I took her keys and went to Farmington and on the
way I called JP Towing who met us there and towed the car to Charlie’s Auto
Repair in Sunset.  We then went to Winegar’s where I bought some stamps and
some sausage.  Georgia and Rick came over at 6 PM.  Mae had a nice dinner
ready, we then got invitations ready to mail to the Porter family for the
reunion on August 14<sup>th</sup>.  After that we played two games of marbles. 
Georgia was pretty tired and hurting when they left to go home at 10:15 PM.  We
straightened up and I filled in my journal before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6:30 and Mae was already up.  Mae doesn’t feel good about talking to Sandi
about building her a home and us living in her duplex.  Mae is also concerned
about Irven and Sandy and if we should have then come and stay with us.  I
don’t think that will work but Mae won’t let it drop.  I am really confused as
to what we are doing and which way to go.  It has really depressed me today.  Mae
went up to Jennie’s.  Bob and I loaded Sherrie’s junk on the truck and took
trash to the dumps.  I started to go to Klaas’s but as I got off the freeway in
Layton Billie called and said he couldn’t meet me until maybe later.  I came
home and did some figuring on the sprinkler system and then got me something to
eat.  Mae came home for a few minutes and then went visiting teaching.  I lay
down and took a ½ hour nap.  I then went over to Klaas’s and visited with
Billie about the remodeling of the bathroom.  I had just finished with Billie
when Maggie came so I re-explained my ideas.  I left and stopped at Scott’s to
talk to Mishelle but Kip was out so I visited with him about Klaas’s project
and ask if he could help direct Ward efforts.  It was 6 PM when I got home so I
quickly changed, ate some dinner and went to a High Priest Group Leadership
meeting at Mark McPhie’s.  That lasted about an hour.  Steve wanted me to visit
with Vie Graham about some committee responsibilities and to have him give the
lesson this Sunday.  Mae didn’t get home until after 9 PM.  Bob bought us a
case of fresh strawberry’s so we will have to put them up tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We decided to
fast this morning before going to the Bountiful to witness the marriage and
sealing of Johnny &amp; Angela Grice.  They also had their 12 year old daughter
Arron sealed to them.  The Grice’s live in the Clinton 20<sup>th</sup> Ward and
Mae knows Angela quite well.  The Sealer gave then some tremendous counsel and
advises.  I really felt privileged to have been able to attend and listen in. 
Mae and I have spent most of the travel time discussing the various options we
are thinking about in the near future.  We stopped at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in
Layton and bought new pillows, a humidifier, two air cleaners and a bath
brush.  After eating lunch we put up 7 pints of strawberry jam and quite a few
sliced Strawberries for the freezer.  I helped the full time missionaries with
a project of removing the fitzers from in front of Robin Walkers.  After that
project Bob and I went down to Wal-Mart’s and bought some Round-Up and I
sprayed the garden area, which I applied this evening.  I called Jeff Brimhall
and he is going to haul the grass sod away for me on Saturday.  Mae went with
Gale and Marcy to the Institute class this evening.  I watched the “Sting” on
TV this evening.</span></p>

6:30 AM and after the usual morning routine I prepared breakfast of sausage,
eggs &amp; potato patties.  Mae seemed to be busy and went for a walk at 1015
AM.  When she got back we went to Ogden where we checked at the Colonial Court
Apartments about the availability and cost of an apartment.  The single bedroom
units cost $580 to $650 and the two bedroom units cost $750 to $900 and the
utilities cost about $70.  We next went out to Grand View Acers condemnations
on 3700 S and Quince.  I was not impressed at all with them.  When we got back
home Bob had dinner ready for us.  He cooked liver and onions and some chicken
for Mae.  Mae was on the computer planning her book group this afternoon.  I
watched some TV although there wasn’t much to watch.  I played a game of chess
with the computer and beat that game.  We went over to Jeff’s and got the
scooter although I am not sure I want it.  We played a game of Harts with Jeff
before coming home.  I entered my journal before getting ready for bed.</span></p>

AM and called Mike to wish him a Happy Birthday and to ask him where the
condo’s were there in Lehi that he had told us about.  I told him that we would
be down.  It was later than I had wanted us to get away.  We went over to the
Checker Auto in Layton and exchanged the hub cap that Mae had bought last week
for a smaller size.  We went up to David &amp; Shauna’s and gave Connor his
Birthday Present.  We traveled up to Heber where we looked at two lots that one
might buy and hold for investment.  We then came down Provo canon and went to
Steven Hulet’s to look at some work that he wants me to do.  We next went to
Mike and Becky’s and followed them to S. L. where we went to eat at Black
Angus.  Becky’s parents also met us there.  It was a very enjoyable evening in
honor of Mike’s Birthday.  After leaving Black Angus Mae and I went shopping
for a baby shower gift for Gale.  I started to do this journal when we got home
but got too tired and went to bed.</span></p>

I joined with other Brothers from the Ward to help a family move.  After
getting back home Bob and I started re-installing a sprinkler system in the
front West lawn.  Sister Watson called me and asked me to get a trailer from
Watson’s for them to use to haul the fizzers away that the missionaries had
taken out for her.  Bob and I used a sod cutter to cut the lawn from where we
are going to run the sprinkler lines.  We went over to Durk’s and purchased the
part to install the sprinkler lines.  Mae went to a Baby Shower held for Gale. 
She was there a couple of hours.  Scott and Mishelle came over and used some of
my tools to cut out and shape some boards for Mishelle’s crafts.  I helped
Scott and Mishelle with their project and helped Bob and Mark on the sprinkler
project.  Mae prepared dinner for us of waffles.  After eating I got the
scooter running.  Scott taught Mishelle how to drive the scooter.   Scott and
Mishelle gave Kylan and Ashley rides on the scooter.  I think that Scott and
Mishelle enjoyed it as much as did Kylan and Ashley.  After Scott and his
family left Mae and I came in and watched part of a show on TV.  We used the
sealer and bagged 11 pt of frozen strawberries.  I caught my journal up and we
went to bed.</span></p>

to tomorrow.  I down loaded the pictures from our camera and decided to copy
them to my memory stick and take it up to David today.  David called and
invited us up for dinner at 4 PM.  We attended our Ward block program.  I had
trouble staying awake during the end of Sunday school and the last of Sacrament
meeting.  I tried to call Uncle Lee and Aunt Welma but no one answered.  I
called Cheryl and visited with her for a while.  We enjoyed going up to David
and Shauna’s for dinner.  Shauna cooked steak and they were very good.  David
and I viewed the pictures that we had taken of the lots in Heber at the
Timberlakes.  David wasn’t very impressed with the upper lot and decided that
he wouldn’t invest in it.  I will still go tomorrow and most likely make an
offer on the lower lot.  After getting home we went up to talk to Bob and
Carroll for a few minutes and ended up playing Canasta with them.  Bob and I
won this evening by quite a ways.  Mae called Shellie before we went to bed.</span></p>
