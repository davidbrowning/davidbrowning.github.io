<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7 AM and got the day started.  Mae had a dental appointment at 9:30 AM in
Ogden and I had an appointment with the realtor in Salt Lake to talk about the
property in Heber City.  The upper lot #1377 the price has gone up to $80,000
so we wrote up an offer on lot #1490 for $60,000.  After leaving the office I
called David and we decided to put an offer on #1377 and then do some checking
on it.  It was after 1 PM before I got home.  Bob and I started to put the sprinkler
system in when David called and we decided to go up and look at the lot.  I
talked to Mike and he had a realtor from Afton tell him that our lot in Star
Valley was not worth $70,000 but more like $30,000 to $40,000.  That changes
the picture some.  I have got to check on that tomorrow.  We also have several
questions about lot #1377 in the Timber Lakes area.  The hard thing is to know
who you can trust.  David also has some work he wants to know if I want to do
it.  I will have to figure it out.  It was almost 10 PM when I got home.  I
showered and entered my journal entry.  Most of the day has been spent on those
lots.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
before 7 AM.  I completed reading the New Testament and especially enjoyed the
last 4 chapters of Revelations this time.  I got more out of reading the New
Testament in general this time but there is still some of Revelations, Paul’s
writings and some of Peter’s writings that I still struggle with.  After
breakfast I started calling with questions concerning the lots in Timber
Lakes.  I also made some calls about our property in Star Valley.  There are
lots selling and also listed for $65,000 to $75,000 in the area that our lot is
in.  I talked to Mike and told him I would sell him ½ ownership in the Star
Valley lot for $30,000.  Bob and I worked on the sprinklers and got them
re-installed.  We also buried the drain pipe to the back rain gutter.  David
called me and I told him of the calls I had made on the lots.  He also
expressed some concerns he has about investing in land right now.  We will
think it over for a little longer but will possibly backing out on purchasing either
lot.  Mae and I may sell our lot in Star Valley and just bank the money for
now.  Mae fixed dinner and I came in from working in the yard at 7:45 PM, very
tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up with
plans to put the railing in Klaas’s house but a call from Irven changed
things.  He wants my help so I told him I would come over.  While we were
eating breakfast I got a call from Utah Power and Light.  There is power to lot
#1377 but not to #1490.  It will cost from $7,000 to $10,000 for them to
install power that far.  I got over to Irven’s about 9 AM.  Dave Jensen was
there.  Irven started to explain his plans for a business.  I will try to help
him but I told him that I am not interested in a job and I am not going to
change our plans and family activities.  I don’t know who is right and who is
wrong but there is family problems going on.  I tried to get some prices on
containers and that took the rest of the day.  I came home about 5 PM and had
dinner with Mae.  She left for Lois Falck’s in American Fork who she will stay
with tonight and tomorrow night while she and Lois attends Woman’s Conference. 
Bob and I started to replace the rain gutter in front of our sun room but I had
miss-measured and had Bob get the wrong material.  Before going to bed I played
two games of chess on the computer, wining one and losing one.  I also played
spider solitary and won that and a game of harts and won that.  I got to bed
before 9:30 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 5:30 AM in order to be ready to go to Irven’s this morning.  I had a talk
with Irven and cautioned him to count the cost of this business venture he is
getting into.  Of course it ended up with the tax issue and I expressed my
feelings about that.  He did say if anyone was to ask him if they should get
into what he has done he would advise them not to.  I told him I was not
interested in a job with him but that I only came over to try to help him.  He
asked if I would do some repairs on his house and I agreed to that.  I will
estimate what it will take and get back to him.  I came home at 11:30 AM.  I
made calls to David and Sandi about the lots.  I called Don Azevedo of Stage
Coach Realty and ask him to list our lot in Star Valley Ranch for sale for the
amount of $65,500.  I also called Travis Richins and told him that I wanted to
retract our offer to buy lot 1490 and 1377.  Travis asked me to send him a
letter on each explaining the reason why.  I prepared a letter on lot #1490 but
it took me most of the evening to get the letter to go.  I talked to David and
he still may want to discuss lot 1377 so I didn’t send a letter on that yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up planning
on going to Klaas’s and installing more hand railing but Irven called and
wanted my help.  I went and spent most of the day.  Andrea came this
afternoon.  We had a chance to visit and she asked me if I thought her dad was
ok.  I am not sure.  He is emotional, sometimes forgetful, he doesn’t take care
of himself as he is going with out sleep and not taking time to eat.  I am just
not sure what to think.  When I got home Bob and I put some aluminum trim above
the entrance.  I was sure tired and couldn’t keep awake to do my journal.  I
showered and then was going to do my journal but the power went out for a
while.  When Mae came home we went upstairs where Bob fixed dinner for us.  It
is sure good to have Mae home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
after the normal morning began to prepare to have our family here for
breakfast.  Bob prepared biscuits for me.  I prepared gravy for us.  When our
children and their families came Mishelle cooked the scrambled eggs.  We ate
and enjoyed being together for most of the day.  We got the scooter out and the
parents and kids really enjoyed it.  After our family left Bob and I put a rain
gutter up and repaired a wall in the flower beds.  Elise called and wants me to
figure the patio and step replacement for her.  This evening Mae and I watched
the first DVD of the “the Work and The Glory”.  We really enjoyed that story
again.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7 AM and while Mae worked on her Primary class lesson for today, I took
my shower.  I then worked on the computer preparing a lesson for the High
Priest group lesson for today.  That went quite well except I had too much for
one lesson.  Bob invited us for dinner with then today.  He also invited Irven
and Mark over as well as Mark Hulet.  After dinner we played a game of Mormon
Bridge and a game of Knock.  We had to stay away from any discussion with Irven
or he would recoil.  I visited with Mark Hulet after Irven and Mark had left
and I am just not sure how to help Irven.  I am afraid that he is headed for
serious health and mental health problems.  Bryon Duggan called and we visited
with them for a while.  I caught my journal up to date.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM.  After breakfast Mae had to leave for Ogden for a dentist appointment.  I
debated on what to do as it looked very much like rain.  I called Maggie to
tell her that I would have to wait until storm was over.  Maggie said that
Billie had removed one of his cars from the garage so I could work in the
garage.  I got to Klaas’s at 9 am and worked the rest of the day.  I had to
stop on the way home for natural gas for my truck.  Jeff was at our place to
borrow Bob’s pickup in order to get a barbeque grill he and Gail had bought. 
Mae sent an approval to list our property in Star Valley for sale at the price
of $65,500.00 to Bill Azevedo with Stage Coach Realty in Thayne, Wyoming. 
After eating dinner I showered and then I prepared invitations for a baby
shower for Gail, while Mae read from our book.  I filled out my journal and we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as I have a dental appointment at 10 AM so there was no need to get up early. 
I went to Dr. Dickerson in Roy.  I felt he helped me understand more about my
teeth than any dentist that I have been to.  His price was more than what Bob
thought it would be but Bob doesn’t hear well so he could have been wrong.  It
was 12:20 PM before I got over to the Klaas’s to start work.  It went quite
well but I was sure tired when I got home.  Mae had dinner ready when I got
home.  After eating I showered and got ready.  We attended a Relief Society
Enrichment evening at which husbands were invited.  It was very good and the
refreshments were vegetable trays, chips and Deviled Eggs so I was able to
enjoy the refreshments.  It was 9 PM when we left for home.  It was a very good
evening.  I filled out my journal entry and then most evenings we play a game
or two on the computer before going to bed.</span></p>

up until 6 AM and with Mae’s help was at Klaas’s before 8 AM.  I worked hard
and by 4 PM was finished with the installation and staining of the stair
railings.  Maggie got home as I was cleaning up and paid me.  Mae had dinner
ready when I got home.  I ate part of dinner and then had to hurry to meet our
Home Teaching appointment with the Jackson’s.  Brother Johnston isn’t feeling
well so we will visit them at a later date.  On the way home Bob wanted to go
to Winegar’s for some groceries so I decided to deposit the check of Maggie’s. 
There weren’t enough funds in her account to cover the check so I will hold it
a couple of days.  When we got home I finished my dinner.  We then watched a
documentary on Brigham Young.  I entered my journal and played a game before
going to bed.</span></p>

this morning.  After breakfast I sent a e-mail to Travis with the Real Estate
Co. that handles Timber Lakes in Heber asking him to return our money on the
property’s we were proposing to purchase.  Sandy called me concerned about Irven
and what he is doing.  I don’t have much advise for them except that they
aren’t going to solve their problems being separated.  Mae and I then went for
a walk.  I drew some plans on Rich and Lois’s house for Elise and started to
figure a material take off.  After lunch Bob went with me and we measured
Irven’s house to figure a sprinkler system for it.  We then went to Durk’s and
bought the materials for Steve Hulet’s job.  We stopped at Winegar’s and got a
few groceries.  I worked on Elise’s job a little longer and then when the
Sisters started to arrive for the Book Group, I went up stairs and watched a
John Wayne movie with Bob.  I filled out my journal and then got ready for bed.</span></p>

12:30 AM with acid reflex and slept the rest of the night in the recliner.  At
5 AM I woke and went to the bathroom and then went back to bed.  I woke at 8 AM
feeling pretty good.  Mae prepared breakfast and after eating I started on the
plans for Elise.  Sandy called and asked if Mark could stay with us for a
while.  I don’t know how this problem is going to work out.  I called Chad to
see if he could figure the size of 2 X’s I need for the face beam to the deck
on Rich’s house.  Hopefully he will have time tomorrow.  Mark wants to start planting
the garden so I work with him for a while.  Georgia and Rick picked us up at 2
PM and we attended the Temple to be with Summer Porter as she got her own
endowments before getting married next week.  After the session Georgia, Rick,
Mae and I went out to eat at the Chuck-Wagon.  We enjoyed visiting and eating. 
As soon as we got home we had to hurry to leave to attend the wedding reception
for Melinda Craven and Michael Williams.  We enjoyed meeting many old friends
from that area.  We hadn’t been home long before Mark came over.  I filled out
my journal and played a couple of games before going to bed.  </span></p>

plans.  A little later I worked with Mark in planting the garden.  I quite and
came in to find out when lunch was going to be, it was then 2 PM. After eating
and cleaning up we went shopping for Mae a Temple dress and some new shoes. 
Mae couldn’t find what she wanted in dresses. At 5 PM we needed to go to Morgan
and attend a performance of a singing group that Emily sings with.  We got
something to eat at a drive in and then attended the program.  That program started
at 6 and went until 6:30PM.  Then the group was to sing at a Miss Dairy Queen
pageant at 7 PM so we stayed for that.  Between the two programs we went to the
Drive-in for a ice cream cone.  We heard sirens and saw smoke so David, Tyler
and I follow it and saw an old garage burning.  After the pageant we went to
David &amp; Shauna’s home as Tyler and Emily wanted Grandma to play games with
them.  It was 11 PM before we got home.</span></p>

the dinner.  We enjoyed having the family here.  They left about 5 PM to see
other Mothers.  We got a call from Sandy who turned the phone over to her
son-in- law who is afraid that Irven may be going to commit suicide.  We told
them we would go over to check on them.  Mark went over first and we went over
about 15 minutes later.  When we got there two police officers had already
arrested Irven, had him handcuffed and were ready to put him in a police car. 
Irven’s Bishop came and we talked about the situation for some time.  The
officers took Irven to the McKay hospital.  Mark wanted Mae to go over with him
to visit Irven.  I drove to American Fork with my trailer and stayed the night
at Mike’s.</span></p>

prepared me some breakfast.  I went to Steve Hulet’s where I met Steve.  I ran
new water lines for a bathroom in his basement and then did the same work in
the house to the west of his home.  In the last house I kinked a line just as I
was finishing up, plus the pressure relief valve would not seat on the hot
water heater.  I decided that I would have to buy parts to fix those two
problems so I will come back tomorrow.  I had told Mike that I would help him
install a new evaporative air conditioner this evening.  It was almost 8 PM
when I got back to Mikes.  He and David had got the old AC undone so when I got
there we took the old one down and pulled the new one up.  The old down chase was
completely rusted out at the top and will not hold the new unit.  We talked it
over and quite for tonight.</span></p>

breakfast I went down to an air conditioner shop and ask if they could make me
a new down chase.  I gave then the measurement just smaller than the old one. 
While they were making that I went to Home Depot and bought a few other items
plus the parts I needed to finish up Steve’s job.  I also went over to Orem and
filled the pickup with natural gas.  When I got back to the AC shop the parts
were ready for me.  I went back and finished Steve’s job and then went back and
worked on Mike’s job.  I was all day working on the two of them.  I left for
home at 4 PM and got home at 5:30 PM but I was really tired.  I decided that I
was two tired to go to the Temple this evening.  Mae hasn’t been feeling food
for the past couple of days.  I had her order some Chinese Food to be
delivered.  We borrowed the second movie of the Work and The Glory from Bob and
Carroll and watched it this evening.</span></p>

in the yard.  We expected a man to come to haul the dirt away but he had
problems at work and didn’t come this morning.  Bob and I went over to Irven
and Sandy’s and moved the barrels from the small pickup to a larger one that
can handle the weight.  I guess Sandy came home Monday evening and Jennifer
also came up to try to help with this problem.  I guess Irven is really mad at
the world and most every one in it.  I spent most of the afternoon and evening
working on estimates for David and Elise.  I went with Brother Morgan Thomas to
look at a repair job for Sister Brenda Perkins.  Brother Morgan and I will start
repairs on a water damaged ceiling tomorrow.  At 7:30 PM brother Wayne Thompson
came Home Teaching.  Mae still isn’t feeling well.  Sandy called and doesn’t
know how to handle Irven.  It looks like he might be released on Friday and we
feel this will be a mistake.</span></p>

the car and truck out of the driveway.  It wasn’t very long after that when the
trucking co. that Bob had contacted came and started hauling away the old dirt
and sod that we had removed from the driveway last Fall.  Mae and I went to
Farr West and watched a baseball game between Grantsville High and St. George. 
Sandi, Chelci and Nike got there late.  Grantsville lost and that but them out
of the season.  Mae and I got home at 2 PM.  I had Bob pick up a sheet of
sheetrock for me.  Brother Thomas and I went to Sister Perkins and removed the
sheetrock from the hallway ceiling where it had been water damaged.  We
installed new sheetrock and put the first coat of tape on it.  By the time we
finished and cleaned up it was 5:30 PM.  Mae has been sick all day but still
went with me to the ball game.  When I got home she fixed some dinner.  We ate
and then watched a movie on the TV before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
2:30 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep thinking about David, Jeff and Irven. 
These are problems I certainly don’t know how to handle.  I hadn’t written in
my journal last night so decided to do it this morning.  McAfee wanted to be
updated when I turned the computer on so I did that first.  I then updated my
journal.  I was still wide awake so I played a game.  Mae came in at 4 AM and
asked me to come back to bed.  I slept a little longer before we had to get up
in order to attend the Temple with Daniel Herring and Summer Porter as they are
sealed to each other.  Brother Reed, a son of President George Reed, officiated
and did a wonderful job.  we stayed after for pictures and then came home.  I
fell asleep and slept quite a while this afternoon.  This evening we went to
the wedding reception and visited with many from our family.  It was 9 PM when
we got home so soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae still
isn’t feeling well but got up and got breakfast.  We then went to Ogden to look
at a boat that is for sale.  We probably would have bought it but the seller
wouldn’t let me take it out for a test drive.  With out that I will not buy any
thing of that much value with out testing it.  We looked for another sale but
when we found out where the address was realized it was in a section of Ogden
that we didn’t want to be in.  When I got home Bob had loaded a lot of things
to be taken to the dumps so I went with him.  This afternoon Mae and I went
shopping and bought her some dress shoes.  After eating dinner Mae started
watching a shop.  I went to Wal Mark and bought some orange and apple juice,
some new drinking glasses and a garden sprayer.  We watched the last of the
show together and then went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up to
use the bathroom and as I checked my day planner I realized that there is Stake
General Priesthood meeting this morning.  I hurried to be ready.  Bob and Mark
had remembered it and the three of us went together.  The talks were very well
given and very appropriate.  The theme was on fulfilling our Priesthood
responsibilities.  When I got home Mae was still in bed asleep.  She still
isn’t feeling well and she got up and cleaned house during the night.  I
prepared breakfast and then entered yesterdays and this morning’s information
into my journal.  Mae was reading a booklet she received about “The Da Vinci
Code”.  I see the concern at the strike against the Christen Church’s but I
also see that it may help some to be willing to open their ears to the truth.  Mae
didn’t attend Relief Society or Sunday School but came for Sacrament meeting. 
Bob invited us and Sandy and Mark for dinner.  After dinner I came downstairs
and took a nap.  Mae, Carroll, Mark and Sandy played games.  They had a good
time and it was good for Sandy to get away.  This is really hard with Irven’s
situation.  He is pretty upset with his family.  This evening Mae, Carroll, Bob
and I played Canasta with Bob and I in the lead when we quit because of time. 
I talked to Randy at 10 PM about fishing and also about the difference between
a TIG welder and a arc welder.  Randy suggested that for most of my welding I
would be better off with a arc welder.  He suggested that I just borrow his.  I
filled in my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM to use the bathroom and read my scriptures but I then went back to bed and
slept until 8 AM.  After breakfast I was going to work on our bank statement
but Mark came down and I helped him with the garden until almost 2 PM.  I
helped Bob find a line and install a sprinkler head.  We ate some lunch and
then I went with Brother Thomas to Sister Perkins where we put a finish on the
sheetrock repair we did.  I worked this evening on our bank statement.  It was
10:30 PM before I completed getting our account in balance.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM, read my scriptures and worked on the computer.  Mae got up before 8 AM and
fixed breakfast.  I worked on David’s and Elise’s bids.  Mae went to the
chiropractor about 11:30 AM.  Bob and Carroll invited me up for lunch and Mae
came up when she got home.  She had stopped and bought some blouses.  I went to
Home Depot and got prices on Elise’s materials.  I got home at 5:15 PM and Jeff
came right after that.  Mae had a nice dinner prepared but Jeff couldn’t eat
much as he had just returned from the dentist.  After eating Mae and Jeff went
to S.L. to buy a back pack for a baby to ride in while hiking.  I was going to
go to a High Priest Group Leadership meeting but Steve had to work and couldn’t
get home for it.  I watched a show on the Hall Mark channel.  Mae and Jeff came
before it finished.  The pack looks like it will be a good one.  I feel very
depressed this evening and am not sure why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6 AM and went to the bathroom and read my scriptures.  I came back to bed
for a little while and then we got up and got breakfast.  We went up to Jennies
for treatments.  She gave me 6 different items to take twice a day.  She also
gave me a foot cleans.  She also suggested that I try treating my Hy-hernia by
drinking a quart of water when I first get up and then jumping up and down for
a few minutes.    We ate lunch and then I started working in the flower
garden.  Bob and I went to Scott and Mishelle’s and loaded the decorative block
they removed for the garden area.  When we got home it was time to clean up and
then go Home Teaching to the Johnston’s.  We had a nice visit with them.  I
watched a show in TV this evening.  Mae watched part of it with me.  I entered
my journal before we went to bed.  Mae talked to Shellie and they want us to go
to Lake Powel with them this summer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Taking all my
medications and the water, along with exercising, prayers and scripture study,
takes all morning.  Then I got on the internet to try and find decking for
Elise’s job.  Mae and I also played with our phones getting them adjusted.  The
Niederhauser’s sent us a letter so we read that before I went outside to work. 
I worked all day getting a drain installed for the flower beds East of the sun
porch.   Tomorrow I will try to get the retaining block placed.  It was late
when I came in for dinner.  Mae got her hair cut and colored this afternoon. 
She looks very nice.  I sent a e-mail to Tony Gerritsen this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM and after normal morning I worked on the computer for a few minutes.  The
rest of the day was working on the flower beds.  I had to rent a brick saw to
cut the decorative block but that worked so much better than any other way. 
Bob did help me and we finished up at 7 PM.  I was completely excused when I
came in the house.  I showered and we ate a light super and watched the last
half of a show before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I again woke
at 6 AM.  Mae was up shortly after I got up.  She prepared breakfast and then
got ready for a baby shower for Gale.  It was held at Scott &amp; Mishelle’s. 
I helped her get the car packed.  Jeff, Scott and I went up to David’s.  We
cleaned David’s garage out getting ready for me to finish the sheetrock.  We
went to Morgan and got some lunch.  After eating we come back to David’s and
played a game.  On the way home I picked up the scissor lift at Universal
Rental as they will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.  After Mae got home
we went over to Lowe’s where I priced some decking parts and got some materials
for David’s job.  We then took Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley out to eat at
the Chuck-A-Rama in Bountiful.  I made some entries on the computer and filled
in my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM but went back to bed at 7 AM for another hour.  Time went fast and we soon
had to hurry to be ready for meetings.  I stayed after Sacrament meeting for a
few minutes and visited with our Bishop about the Temple Sealing in connection
with Chelci being sealed as a child and about Sandi’s third marriage.  He couldn’t
throw much light on the situation either, except we will just wait and see how
they develop later and for sure during the millennium.  Mae was busy preparing
dinner when I got home.  I helped some and then played some chess.  Mae
realized that the roast hadn’t cooked so we put it in the pressure cooker and
finished cooking that way.  We had dinner ready at 4:30 PM and when Chelci and
Steve didn’t come by 5 PM, Mae got her phone to call.  She noticed that she had
a message.  It was Chelci letting us know that both Chelci and Steve were sick
in bed with flu.  We had plenty to eat.  We went into Ogden to see Irven at the
hospital.  Visiting time is from 6 to 7 PM so we didn’t have much time.  I
don’t know if Irven is doing better or just caught on that if he fights them he
will be in there a long time.  We visited with Sandy and Andrea after 8 PM.  I
sure don’t have any answers but it seems to me that Irven is still planning to
start a business.  We came home at 9 PM.  David called me a couple of times. 
We ate a fruit cocktail desert that Mae made with raw sugar.  I filled in my
journal and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 AM and Mae got up at 6 AM.  I left shortly after 7 for David’s.  We
couldn’t back the trailer up their driveway so we unloaded the scissor lift at
the street and tried to drive it up.  It wouldn’t do that so we pulled it up. 
I got what I could reach from the floor with the first coat of mud.  Mae came
up about 10:30 AM.  Mike and his family had just got there.  At 11 AM we went
up to the Morgan South Cemetery to decorate graves.  Scott &amp; his family,
Jeff, Georgia and Lindsey met us there.  We then met at the park and had
lunch.  Troy, Meliah and their children also came to the park but had missed us
at the cemetery.  Mae and I went back to David’s and got my truck and took it
down to the freeway entrance where we left it.  Mae and I then drove back to
the cemetery and walked around for a while.  After leaving the cemetery we
picked up my truck and came home.  We ate some diner and then I planted six
shrubs for Mae.  We went upstairs and played canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Bob
and I won again tonight.  It was after 10 PM before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:45 AM but Mae left me a note that she hadn’t got to bed until after 1 AM so I
let her sleep.  I returned the trailer to Universal Rental and then came back
and got my trailer.  I got to David’s just after 8 AM.  I worked all day but
didn’t get the first coat complete yet.  The scissor lift sure works good for
doing those high ceilings.  I quite at 4:30 PM and cleaned up.  We moved
David’s boat so I could leave my trailer there tonight.  Mae was planting
flowers when I got home.  She had dinner about ready and I just had time to eat
and shower and go to the High Priest leadership meeting.  Mae was still
planting flowers.  I got a few clothes ready to take with me tomorrow.  I
entered my journal and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep very well last night so I let her sleep in a little longer.  Bob needed
some help moving an old stove out to the curb so the Salvation Army could pick
it up today.  Besides being late leaving the traffic was bad trying to get
through Roy.  I stopped at The Home Depot and picked up some materials.  It was
almost 10 AM before I got to David’s and started work.  An hour was spent
getting the materials.  I worked until 6 PM.  I stayed at David and Shauna’s
tonight as Mae went down to Mike and Becky’s to attend a piano recital that
David participated in.  she stayed there tonight so she can attend a special
award ceremony that Taylor will be in.  this evening I called Mae.  She said
that David did very well in the recital.  I also called Shellie and Roy about
fishing at Lake Powel.  I was late getting to bed.</span></p>
