<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM so that I could get a early start at removing the dead trees in back. 
Mae got up and got breakfast ready for me.  She cleaned house this morning.  It
was after noon before we finished and we were both very tired.  I showed Mae
how to balance the bank statement and then took a nap.  When I woke she had it
just about complete but was out of balance.  I worked with her and we soon
found the errors.  I spent the rest of the afternoon getting the welder and
other materials needed to build the trailer on our tent trailer so we can pull
the boat behind it.  Mae and I watched some recorded shows before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
until about 7 when I got up.  I needed to get our tithing ready so while I had
Quicken up I made some entries into it.  Meetings were very good and I enjoyed
every one of them.  I was able to stay awake through all the block.  I helped
Mae start dinner and then I took a nap for ½ hr.  We had Troy, Meliah, Weston,
Makayla, Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley all over for dinner.  After dinner I
got the scooter out and they had fun riding that.  Sandi and her two
granddaughters came over for a few minutes to show us some pictures that Mike
had taken of Sandi and Nick.  She also talked to Mae about printing off some
labels for her.  When everyone left we were very tired.  I took the garbage out
and then I packaged some meat for Mae, in the seal-a-meal.  I filled out my
journal and we went to bed.  Mae cleaned up some of the mess first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM so I could get an early start on the camp trailer.  I had bought the wrong
part to fix a 220 V extension cord so I had to go to Home Depot and exchange
it.  It was after 8 AM before I really got started.  At noon Irven and his
family came and we went to Willard Bay boating.  Irven, Sandy, Andrea,
Jennifer, Chris, Mark, Mae and I all went.  We had a lot of fun but it was late
when we got back home.  I went over to the store and picked up some items for Mae. 
I filled out my journal while Mae was getting things ready for tomorrow.</span></p>

5:30 AM but didn’t feel very good so I went back to bed.  Mae and I prepared
breakfast for our family.  All the boys and their families came for breakfast. 
We prepared biscuits, gravy, eggs and fish.   We then spent the day visiting
and playing games.  For dinner we had salads and grilled meats.  Bob, Mark and
Irven joined us for dinner.  It started to blow and then rain.  David was
concerned about his place and this storm so they left about 5 PM.  Mike and his
family went up to David’s for the evening.  Mae played games with her
grandchildren while we watched a show on TV.  Mae went over to Layton to watch
the fire-works display with Scott and his family.  I stayed home and watched a
John Wayne movie.  </span></p>

to bed until almost 2 AM so we slept until 6 AM.  Mae and I took the Buick over
to <br>
Western Radiator to have them clean out the radiator and change the
anti-freeze.  I spent most of the day working on the tent trailer getting the
hitch built on the back.  I took Bob over to get his car from the garage and
then picked up some parts.  This evening Mae cleaned out the boat while I did
some other work and got tools put away and put what tools I want with me in the
truck.  It is 10 PM and I am tired so I will finish this entry and take a
shower and go to bed.  I have a back upper left tooth that is bothering me this
evening.  I had to take some pain pills in order to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early but still had a bad tooth ache so we called Dr. Cottle and was able to
get in at 10:30 AM.  I got the truck and trailers wired for lights before I
went over to Dr. Cottle’s.  After x-raying the tooth he said it was just
beginning to abases and it either needed to do a root cannel or pull it.  Being
that is a upper muller I told him to pull it.  When I got home we finished
packing and soon left.  With the trailer set up we could only drive 45 MPH or the
boat trailer would start fish tailing.  We got to East Cannon North Camp ground
and set up camp.  Sandi and Nick came about 6:30 PM.  We went out fishing for a
while and caught three fish before we came in.  I was going to leave the boat
on the water but it looked like storme so we took the boat our.  I had Nick
back the boat trailer in and after he told me that was the first he had backed
a trailer.  After eating some dinner we played our marble game.  Nick and I won
both games.  We enjoyed having them with us.   It was late when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and went out fishing.  We cooked up the fish for breakfast.  It was a
beautiful morning and almost as soon as we started fishing Sandi caught a nice
16” trout.  They were slower after that but we did catch a couple more before
we came in.  Mike and Mattie came about noon and stayed with us the rest of the
day.  We caught a few fish but it was slow.  Mike, Mattie, Sandi and Nick left
this evening.  We checked on the showers and felt good about them so we took a
shower before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We thought
about going fishing this morning but decided to sleep in and then prepare to
leave.  It was 1 PM before we to come home.  We decided it is a big job to pack. 
We stopped at the exit by David’s and he met us there so we could give him
Conner’s fishing pole and Shauna’s purse.  They had been left at our place on
the 4th.  David also gave us a check for the work I did for them.  We got home
at 3 PM and the Clarks came at 3:30 PM for us to go with them.  The Maharry’s,
the Hyer’s, the Clark’s and us met at Maddock’s for dinner.  We enjoyed
visiting with all of them and enjoyed riding with the Clark’s.  We unloaded the
pickup and put things away.  Jeff, Gale and Benjamin stopped for a few
minutes.  I caught my journal up to date and we went to bed very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early but went back to bed and slept until after 8 AM.  Mae woke me to let me
know that Bob would have breakfast ready in a few minutes.  He had prepared
biscuits and gravy for us.  I did get most of the Priesthood lesson read before
we went to church.  Sandy came over and went to church with us.  She had taken
Irven back to the hospital yesterday.  This is sure a trial for them and it is
hard to even suggest what they should do.  Sandy stayed for dinner as Bob and
Carroll invited us to eat with them.  Bob prepared a wonderful roast dinner for
us.  It is no wonder that I am gaining wait.  Mae and I went over to Scott and
Mishelle’s at 5 PM.  I called Kip Michaelis to see if he was finished with my
staple gun.  He had, so I went over and got it.  Mishelle had made Navaho Tacos
for dinner and we ate with them.  Having just eaten one was plenty for us.  Mae
and I stayed with Kylan and Ashley while Scott and Mishelle went to a meeting
about the youth pioneer trek for their Stake.  We finished reading a chapter in
our book before we came in, so it was 11 PM when we got in the house.  Bob came
down with a plate of cookies he had baked with raw sugar so I could eat them. 
They were very good but I only ate one this late at night.  I filled out my
journal and we went to bed about mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30 AM and got dressed.  I went upstairs but Mark was still asleep so I went
down to the Stake onion patch by myself.  I got there at 5:30 AM and walked
down the three rows assigned to the High Priest Group.  They were in good shape
but the rows assigned to the Elders were in pretty bad shape.  I started
weeding one row as I worked my way back.  Mark came at 6:30 AM and helped me
with the row I was on.  We finished that row at 9:30 AM and came home.  After
eating breakfast I tried to call ACE Hardware in Alpine Wyo. but all sales
representatives were busy.  I took a nap for 1 ½ hr.  When I got up I again
called the ACE Hardware and talked to Don.  He had me fax him the plans and he
got back to me with the prices.  Mae and I went out to Grantsville and tried to
help Sandi.  Sandi had received the pictures back that Mike had taken last
Saturday.  They turned out very good.  I couldn’t help feeling that maybe Sandi
is getting the marriage that she should have had several years ago, I sure hope
so.  Sandi gave me most of Terry’s fishing equipment; Terry’s boys didn’t want
them.  We went up to the Deseret Peak Complex 7 PM to watched Nick and the team
he is on play a game, they won 18 to 8.  We then came on home getting here
about 10 PM.  The ride out and back gave us some time to read from our book. 
We went to bed with concerns and tears in our eyes.  When we left to serve as
missionaries all six of our children went to the Temple with us.  Now, three of
the six are not worthy to attend the Temple at this time.  We do not know just
how Shellie and Roy are doing and are afraid to ask.  Earlier this year Shellie
expressed great concerns and when we responded with suggestions she got up set
with us.  Mike is criticizing Sandi for getting married and giving up the
government retirement that Terry left her.  Sandi said that she and Nick have
talked of just living together but decided that because of Chelci, Mae and I
and the talk that would take place that they wouldn’t.  I wonder where we went
wrong in teaching our family.  Scott is also looking for work as the company he
has been working for gave them their last check last week.  He is now looking
for work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and went to the Temple this morning, feeling we needed a spiritual lift. 
We did enjoy the session and were ask to be the company witnesses.  Mae took me
home after the temple session and then she went to Farmington to walk with
Jackie and have lunch.  I took a ½ hour nap and then tried to work on Elise’s
project.  Mae called and is having car problems.  I rented a car caddy and
towed it over to Western Radiator.  We left it there for them to check it out. 
I changed clothes when we got home and Bob and I went Home Teaching at the
Johnston’s.  Mae and I then went up to Morgan to watch Tyler’s ball game.  This
is the last game of their season.  It was fun to watch the game.  We come on
home and I made my journal entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM and after normal morning I worked on Elise’s plans.  I was interrupted
with Bob wanting to go to the base to get me a pair of pants.  That took us
until after noon.  I then had a fellow come and spray the back of the lot, so
more time was spent.  We then got a company to come and take away the old truck
of Bryce’s, so that took more time.  I tried to get away to go to Pocatello
about 4 PM but Troy called and wanted me to drill a couple of holes through the
brick and block walls.  It was after 6 PM when I stopped at the station on 21<sup>st</sup>
street and filled up with fuel.  I got to Rich and Lois’s about 8:30 PM.  Rich
had us drive over and look at a couple of deck on houses in the area.  Elise
went to bed quite early but Rich, Lois and I stayed up late talking.  I then
filled in my journal so it was 11:30 PM when I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6:30 AM and got the day started.  Most of the day was spent in location
materials, pricing and planning how to do what is wanted.  That is part of the
problem is Rich, Lois and Elise are not sure as to what they want and sometimes
they disagree as to what they want.  I think that we will start dismantling the
old deck tomorrow.  We will need that gone before we can really get serious
with the plans.  Rich and I went out twice checking on materials and cost plus
we checked out another home in the area to see how they built their deck.  This
evening we played a game of Mormon Bridge and then read from the scriptures. 
We discussed with aw the information we have learned by reading the “Prelude to
Glory”.  It was after 11 PM before I got to bed.  Mae called this evening and
her book group went well this evening.  She will go to David &amp; Shauna’s in
the morning.  She told me that our car isn’t finished yet.</span></p>

early and after breakfast I got started demo. the old deck.  I asked Rich if he
would go into town and rent a jack-hammer.  He got back shortly after 3 PM and
I worked until after 8 PM.  I took a shower and then lay on the floor using the
Chee Machine.  Lois then rubbed my back with a vibrator.  Elise was still up
and we got talking about the remodeling.  It was almost mid-night when I went
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up a
little later as I had planned to go home this morning.  As we discussed the
rental of the jack-hammer I decided to try to get the steps broken out before
our time ran out on the one we had.  I worked an about 4 hours but got the
steps broke out.  We think that we have a fellow that has a loader that we
might borrow the first of next week.  I drove home this afternoon getting to
the park where Mae and the kids were about 5 PM.  After the children played a
little while we ate a sandwich lunch there at the park.  Mae took the children
and bought them an ice cream cone while I went to the grocery store for a few
items.  I was very tired but stayed up until Mae put the children to bed.  I
fell asleep and Mae stayed up washing my clothes and cleaning house.</span></p>

7 AM and got the children some breakfast and started them to getting ready for
church.  Shauna’s parents, John and Vicky Howard, came at 9 AM and took over. 
We left at 10 AM and came home in time to attend church at our Ward.  I was
called out of Priesthood Meeting and ask if I would help out with one of the
Primary classes.  Bob and Carroll invited us to eat dinner with them.  Mae went
over to Sister Walker’s after eating.  I visited with Mark a while.  Rich
called and told me that we could get the backhoe and front end loader tomorrow
so I quickly packed my things and drove up to Pocatello.  I got there at 9 PM. 
Jeff and Joyce also came to visit their parents at that time so we visited
until after 10:30 PM.  I then filled in my journal for yesterday and today.  It
was after 11 PM before I got to bed.  I forgot to bring my pillow with me from
home.</span></p>

went to Dennis Eldridge’s and was able to borrow his backhoe and dump truck. 
We did put fuel in the units and paid for the license on the truck.  The use of
those units really helped us with the work.  Lois also called and got two of
their grandchildren and grandson in law to come over and help.  We were able to
haul over 15 ½ ton of rock, cement &amp; trash to the dumps.  After dinner I
took a shower and work on the computer for a while.  I called Mae and she is
having some problems with her eyes that is causing her some discomfort.  She
keeps very busy and I think that is a lot of her trouble.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I spent most
of the morning working on the plumbing under the kitchen sink.  We couldn’t get
the leeks sealed and finally had Rich go to town and get more parts.  I did get
the last of the rock wall pulled out and took one load to the dumps.  I went to
Home Depot and placed a order of materials to be delivered tomorrow.  Rich and
Lois went to the Temple and did sailings.  I drove to Idaho Falls and picked
them up after 3 PM.  we drove to Afton Wyoming and looked at decking at the Ace
Hardware.  We then went to Thyne where I met with Laura Jensen and Don _____
and signed the final papers on closing the sale of our property in Star Valley
Ranch.  I feel a little sick at the thought of sailing that land and hope we
are doing what is right.  It certainly was the best investment I have ever made
but I would have liked to have built a home there to live in.  it was almost 10
PM when we got home.  The plumbing under the sink still has a leak somewhere. 
I will have to work woth it tomorrow as it is too late this evening.  Elise had
to have a mole removed from her cheek today so she isn’t feeling to well this
evening.  We are still trying to decide what decking and railing to use on the
deck.  Rich has trouble with the price of material now days and he still wants
to use the old lumber to save money.  I worked on the computer for a few
minutes and then went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When we got
up this morning the kitchen sink plumbing still showed signs of leaking.  I let
it wait and we worked outside still removing waste.  I had to build a part for
the accelerator on the tractor before we could start.  We had some large
sections of concrete so I removed the end gate on the dump bed before loading
it.  We got our delivery from Home Depot shortly before noon.  After eating
lunch I worked on the kitchen sink.  I had to use silicone caulk and Teflon
tape to get the joints to seal but I think it is now ok.  I went into Home
Depot and bought some more materials as well as looking for special items.  I
called Bob and asked him to check on a couple of suppliers there for some of
the things I need.  It has been a long day and is now 10:45 PM and I still have
to take a shower before going to bed.  I have talked to Mae a couple of times
today.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>David called and is quite

for that but needs a door put on it.  I may have to help him this weekend even
though Shellie’s family will be here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Rich and I
started laying the retaining wall on the South side of the driveway.  We got
three layers laid.  I then patched the cinder block wall under the front door. 
That took a little while.  After eating lunch I packed my bags.  Rich and I
then went into Pocatello where we checked materials and prices at Rich &amp; Lois
gets their quilting supplies and bought 3 roles of batting.  We went back to
Rich’s and unloaded the batting.  I hooked up my trailer and left at 6 PM for
home.  I got there a little before 9 PM stopping to fill up with gas.  Mae and
Jase came home from Lagoon shortly after I got home.  They were tired and so
was I so we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We let every
one sleep in and then prepared breakfast.  I did some chasing to get the door
for David and some materials for Rich’s.  I also got a new battery for our
camera and when I got home found it was the wrong one.  I checked on the cover
for my boat and bought some new tie down straps for the boat.  I picked up some
fried chicken on the way home for lunch and then we had to hurry in order to
get ready to leave for Tooele to attend Sandi &amp; Nick’s wedding and
reception.  Mike was ready and took family pictures before the wedding
ceremony.  We had all our family there except Brad as he had to work until 6
PM.  The wedding ceremony was very beautiful.  Sandy was very radiant in her
wedding dress.  This was the wedding I have always wanted for her and just hope
and pray that Nick is the one and can bring into her the love she deserves.  I
really felt good over what took place.  It was a wonderful evening and there
was many that we know at the reception.  Bob, Carroll, Sherrie and Mark came. 
Rich, Lois and Elise came down to support us.  They are so great to do that. 
We stayed until the reception finished and then helped clean up.  It was late
when we got home and I was to tired to update my journal so am doing it before
I go to David’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but went back to bed and Mae let me sleep until after 8 AM.  I helped a little
with breakfast, then after eating I went to the store to get ice and bottled
water.  Mae, Shellie, Roy and the children all went back to Lagoon today.  I
had some trouble and interruptions but left for David’s about noon.  I had to
stop for a few items at The Home Depot and got to David’s about 1 PM.  David gave
me a hand and we installed a security door on a room under his front steps.  He
will keep medical samples in this room.  We put on a steel exterior door with a
good keyed lock on it.  Hopefully this will make a good impression on the
inventory personal when they come to check his inventory.  With David helping
me it gave us some time to visit.  I also stayed after finishing the work and
we visited.  They invited me to eat with them and then David and I continued
the visit.  I got home after 8 PM.  I stopped and looked at Marks.  Just then
Mark came out and we got visiting and that took some time.  Mae called me from
Lagoon and did not have a time that she would be home.  I filled out my journal
and then I am going to shower and go to bed.  I hope my visit with David did
some good.  I felt good at the way it went.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM and went back to bed before 6 AM.  Shellie had told Mae that they wanted up
at 6 AM to get away but they changed their mind and didn’t get up until after 8
AM.  Mae and Shellie had stayed up until after 2 AM and then Mae couldn’t go to
sleep for another hour because of her legs hurting her.  It was 10 AM before
Shellie and Roy and the children got away.  We had to hurry to get to church. 
Irven and Sandy attended church with us.  Bob and Carroll invited us and Irven
and Sandy for dinner.  Mae had invited Scott’s family for dinner at 5 PM so we
just finished one dinner and then set down to another.  It was after 8 PM when
Scott and Mishelle left and then we went up stairs and visited with Bob and
Carroll until 9:30 PM.  I filled in my journal and we went to bed.  We put on a
movie and watched it before going to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM but then went back to bed.  We got up about 8:30 and Mae asked if the parade
was on so I turned it to channel 5 and found that the Salt Lake parade was just
starting.  We loved watching the parade while lying in bed where we had a fan
blowing on us and the house was still cool for the night.  After the parade we
went out to eat at the Chuck-A-Rama in Ogden with Bob and Carroll.  Mae then
did some house work.  I took a short nap and then got some things ready for our
trip next week.  I took a flyer over and got it copied for Mae.  While out I
ordered two pair of jump suits from Penney’s.  We went up to Verla Porter’s as
all of Aunt Beth’s family were together and it gave us a chance to visit with
many of them.  I got on the computer when we got home and drew some plans for
Chad Porter so he could build me the steps for Rich’s.  I also down loaded some
pictures from our camera for Mae.  I completed today’s journal entry before we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had set the
alarm last night for 4 AM this morning but when I woke at 6 AM I realized that
I hadn’t turned it on.  We didn’t get away until after 8 AM.  After taking in
our bags I got to work.  I had Rich go into town and rent a block saw.  I used
the backhoe to remove some dirt.  When Rich got back I found that the saw
didn’t work for who ever used it last didn’t clean it up and the pump was
locked up and one of the water lines was plugged so it wasn’t wetting the blade
on both sides.  We had to take it back but wasn’t able to get another one.  We
lost quite a bit of time doing that.  We started laying the block wall on the
north side.  It was after 9 PM when we quite and came in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Rich and I
started laying block at 7:30 AM because I had called the Pro Rental in
Pocatello and they hadn’t repaired the brick saw that we had returned last
night.  I had Mae &amp; Lois go to Blackfoot where the Pro Rental there had a
brick saw.  After they left the Pocatello rental called and said they thought
they could repair their saw.  I had Mae &amp; Lois continue and decided that if
Pocatello rental called before they got to the Blackfoot rental, then I would
have them come back and get the one at Pocatello.  They were almost back when
the Pocatello rental called but they were too late.  We got the </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>South wall laid and 2/3 of
the North wall before we ran out of blocks.  We cut enough block to finish the
job so we could return the cutter in the morning and will then pick up some
more block at Home Depot.  After showering Rich, Lois, Elise, Mae &amp; I
played a game of Mormon Bridge before going to bed.  I had to fill in my
journal also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was going
to get up at 5 AM but was to tired and didn’t get up until almost 6 AM.  After
breakfast Rich and I went to Blackfoot and returned the brick saw.  When we got
back to Pocatello went to Franklin Builder Supply and ordered the decking.  I
still have to order the railing but they didn’t have a sample for me to check
out.  They will get me a sample.  We picked up 100 more blocks for the
retaining walls.  When we got home we finished installing those.  Rich &amp;
Lois’s home teacher sent over a large rainbow trout.  It weighed about 6 lb. 
Lois baked it for lunch and it was very good.  I worked on the plans of the
decking.  Rich tried to repair a plumbing problem in the downstairs bathroom but
couldn’t.  I went down to help and spent 2 or 3 hours plumbing.  We ate dinner
and then left for home.  We had to stop in Ogden and fill up the truck with
gas.  It was 10 PM before we got home.  We took showers, I filled out my
journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until almost 7 AM although I had been up earlier.  I had slept in the recliner
most of the night.  Bob had got me the oil, filter and air cleaner to service
my truck so I did that first thing.  Bob brought me down some Alkalime to help
with the acid that I seem to have to much of and it helped so I didn’t go into
the Dr. this morning.  After servicing my truck I hooked up the camp trailer
but then we decided to leave it and stay in a motel.  We had to stop at the
grocery store so it was after 12 when we got away.  Mae read from our novel as
I drove.  We got to Fillmore at 4:30 PM, filled the truck with gas and checked
into the motel.  We got to the park in Meadow at 5 PM.  Kim, Summer and Daniel
were already there.  Kim asked me if I could help him set up a soccer net so
the next little while was spent at that.  As I went back to the bowery Bonnie’s
two sons were starting the grill to cook hamburgers and hotdogs.  I gave them a
hand enjoyed visiting and becoming acquainted with them.  As I mentioned Kim, Summer
and Daniel was there, Georgia, Rick and Lindsey came, Meliah and her children
came and Mae and I but, that was all from Mildred’s side of the family.  Aunt
Joy and several of her family, Aunt Iris and several of her family and of
course Uncle Farrell’s family was the sponsors this year so most if not all of
their family was there.  Some of Uncle Van’s family is coming tomorrow but
Uncle Van and Aunt Allison were called to serve a mission in the Salt Lake
Temple area and started serving last week.  None of uncle Jun’s family came. 
It would have been better if more had came but we had a great afternoon and
evening.  When we went back to our motel we got together with Rick, Georgia and
Lindsey and played games.  Meliah wanted to join us but she couldn’t get her
children to settle down and go to sleep.  They were having too much fun being
in a motel.  We stayed up until after mid-night.  Georgia told us an experience
that happened to Noland that was exciting.  I would like him to tell us about
it at our Glendon Porter reunion next Saturday.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:45 AM and went to the bathroom, read my scriptures and said my prayers.  I
went back to bed not wanting to wake Mae.  I filled in my journal before we
went to the reunion this morning.  When we got there, they had hot cakes, ham,
scrambled eggs, sliced tomatoes and fruit.  Uncle Van and Aunt Allison were
able to join us at the reunion this morning because it was their P-Day at the
Mission Home.  Jeff, Susan and Mary Lue and their families also came this
morning.  I went fishing up Corn Creek Cannon with Bonnie’s husband Jim, some
of their grandchildren and Lacy (Keila’s daughter) and her husband.  I did
catch two small fish that I let loose.  I did hear a rattle snake but did not
see it.  When I could tell the direction the sound was coming from I went the
other way.  It was 3 PM when I returned to the motel so I bought me a fish
sandwich for lunch.  I took a shower and a nap before going back to the
reunion.  Uncle Van, Aunt Joy and Aunt Iris told experiences and memories of
the past.  I wish it could have been recorded for they are the last of the
older generation.  Dinner was catered this evening and it was very good.  When
we got back to the motel this evening Georgia, Lindsay, Rick, Meliah, Mae and I
got together and played games.  It was almost mid-night when we got to bed.</span></p>

7 AM and had to hurry to get packed and checked out and be to Meadow by 8:15
AM.  We were the first there except for Pat, Bonnie &amp; Jim.  Jim had got
permission from the Meadow Ward Bishop for us to hold our own Sacrament
meeting.  Bill Goddard and I were asked to bless the Sacrament.  Following the
Sacrament the meeting was opened to testimonies.  I felt very good at the
things that were said.  After the meeting the reunion was dismissed.  Georga, Rick,
Meliah, her children, Mae and I went to the cemetery and looked for the grave
sites of George and Iva Bushnell and their parents.  We spent a couple of hours
there and really enjoyed it.  It was 2 PM when we started for home.  We stopped
in American Fork and had dinner with Mike and Becky.  Mike showed us the
pictures taken at Sandi’s wedding.  I took a short nap and then we came on home. 
We got here at 8 PM and by the time we unpacked and repacked so I can leave in
the morning it was 10:30 PM before we got to bed.  I just have to add that I
thought this reunion was very successful.  I just felt bad that none of our
children attended.  </span></p>

worked on it for a while.  I worked on the plans for the deck and then Rich,
Lois and I went to Pocatello and checked on the deck railing.  Rich and I did
get some stakes placed.  Rex and Linda came over for dinner and we played
Mormon Bridge.  I talked to Mae a couple of times on the phone.  She put up
some pickled beats but only got three pints.  She went to Dr. Bennett’s for a
treatment today.  I didn’t charge for today.  It was after 10 PM before I got
to bed.   I can’t get the printer to work on the computer.  That makes it
harder to use the plans.</span></p>
