<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I spent most
of the day laying out the footings for the decking.  I did wash down the
driveway as Rich was concerned about the dirt on it.  I also did some more work
on the basement bathroom sink so the drain and plug worked better.  Rich wanted
to add a roof over the deck and I was not right sure if he was serious or not. 
Lois told me that we wouldn’t do it now. This evening I worked quite late on
the plans for the steps and the landing.  The printer for our computer quite
with the error light on and I could not clear it.  This light has been coming
on the past couple of weeks but we have been able to clear it and go on, but
today I couldn’t get it to clear.  I talked to Mae and had her check on a new
printer at Best Buy.  I also had Rich and Lois take my printer into Pocatello
to have it checked.  They can’t check it for a couple of days.  They also had a
new printer for $250.  When Mae called me back she could get a new printer for
$79 so I had her get it.  Mae also bought me two more pair of coveralls that
are permanent press material.  Craig &amp; Carla stopped for lunch as they are
taking their youngest son to the mission home.  He is called to serve in
Mexico.  I visited with Craig about their new home and he will send me a copy
of the plans to figure a hydronic heat system for it.  It was 11 PM before I
finished this journal entry and got ready for bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Last night a
dog kept barking so I had to close the windows in order to sleep.  Although it
was a cool night, with the windows closed I became quite warm.  I started work
on the footings shortly after 8 AM and only stopped for an hour at lunch and
about that long for dinner.  I finished and came in this evening at 8:45 PM.  I
took a shower and entered my journal entry for today and went to bed after 10
PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Rich hadn’t
slept very well last night thinking about the landing I had formed at the
bottom of the stairs.  It took some time to come to an understanding that I
would lower the landing but I needed to have a landing for the steps to set
on.  I was quite upset with the problems I am having with Rich.  I was afraid
that this might happen.  I was able to rent a U-Haul trailer for concrete and
got the Cement from the concrete factory.  One load poured the step landing and
five footings.  The cement went pretty well.  We cleaned up the U-haul trailer
and returned it.  We picked up some items in town.  I had Lois take my printer
into a shop but they didn’t feel hat they could fix it.  It was 4 pm when I
headed for home.  This evening Mae and I ordered some Chinese food and watched
a couple of videos.</span></p>

errorns to do, pickup steel rebar, buy a cover for the boat, exchange the
coveralls that Mae had bought for me, and buy a pull behind lawn sweep.  After
getting home Bob and I assembled the lawn sweep.  This evening we tended little
Benjamin for Jeff and Gale so they could attend a class reunion. Mae told me
that Jeff had asked Trent Teeples to bless Benjamin this Sunday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                 We slept in
until 7 AM so didn’t get over to Chad’s until 9 AM.  I worked over their
cutting the steel and drilling it so Chad can weld the step units for me.  We
only had enough steel for ½ of the units so I will have to get more steel on
Monday.  Mae and I went over to Georgia and Rick’s at 3 PM but no one else came
until 5 PM.  All of our family came except Shellie’s.  Almost all the rest of
the Glendon Porter family was there.  It made quite a large gathering.  Several
of us played a game of volleyball before eating.  Rick, although he was in
quite a lot of pain cooked the hamburgers and hotdogs.  It has been a very
enjoyable evening.  Jeff came over to me during the evening and informed me
that Trent Teepols would be giving the blessing for their baby.  Because Mae
had told me yesterday that that was the plan, it wasn’t a surprise but it still
hurt..  My feet and legs were hurting quite bad by the time we went home.  I
went right to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My legs and
feet were really hurting this morning.  I don’t know if I ate something that
caused it or whether it has been the stress of Rich’s job or the stress of my
two sons that are struggling with their testimony’s and then to have Jeff have  a
friend bless his baby instead of me as the grandfather.  It really felt like a
slap in the face but I guess that is the way children are.  I hurt so bad and
felt bad about the blessing that I told Mae I wasn’t going to go, but would stay
in bed.  Mae insisted that I had to go, so I did.  I really hurt through out
the meeting.  I took Mae over to the lunching but I went home and went to bed. 
When Mae came home I got up for a while.  I called Rich and Lois and told them
that I wouldn’t be coming up tomorrow.  They said that they had decided to
remove the driveway cement and have it re-poured.  Scott and Mishelle brought
Ashley and Kylan over for them to stay with us while Scott and Mishelle go on
the Pioneer treck to take pictures.  It was late when we went to bed.</span></p>

and waited for the children to wake.  I helped Mae prepare breakfast.  Time
seems to slip by but I did get some of my journal caught back up.  The car had
overheated yesterday so I called Western Radiator and asked about it.  He told
me to bring it back up.  I called Mike about some questions about buying a new
computer for Mae and getting me a new palm.  Bob and I took the car into
Western Radiator.  Bob followed me into town while I took the car back to have
it worked on.  They called me from Western Radiator and said that the radiator
cap had been left off and that had let all the coolant blow out.  I will go
over tomorrow to get the car.  This evening we went over to Meliah’s and had dinner
and Family Home Evening.  Terry, Angela, Jaben and Jaren were also there.  The
children had fun playing.  We played Mormon Bridge and enjoyed visiting.  I
felt fairly well when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My feet and
legs hurt some this morning.  We decided that I had better not go to Rich’s
today.  After eating breakfast I tried to go back to bed.  I slept for a little
while but had acid reflex that woke me. I got up and took a shower.  Mae took
the children across the street to the park and let them play.  Mark informed me
that Carroll wasn’t feeling well.  We tried to call Bob but couldn’t find
Sherrie’s number and my palm pilot quite on me again.  While we were trying to
decide what to do Bob called and told Mae that he had taken Carroll into the
hospital.  I had Mark go into town with me and we got the car.  Mark drove it
home.  I noticed that my right rear turning light wasn’t working.  I went into
the hospital and spent the afternoon with Bob.  They ran test on Carroll from 1
PM until 5 PM.  Shortly after 5 PM Sherrie came up so I left and came home.  I
stopped at Wal Mart to get a light for my truck but found that it was the
holder that had gone bad.  I had to go to a parts house and buy a new part to
the light fixture.  I also went to Stapple’s and bought me a new Palm Pilot as
my old one quite on me.  I got CNG on the way home.  Mae had taken the children
to their home to check on one of their dogs and then to McDonald’s for treats
and let them play.  She has been with those two all day and was beat by
evening.  I cooked me some fish for my dinner and then worked on the computer
getting some of my files caught up to date.  I then filled in my journal.  I
stayed up after Mae went to bed.  I didn’t feel well so slept in the recliner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as the children were still asleep.  I probably would have slept longer except
Rich call me to see if I was coming up.  My legs are still hurting so I decided
that I had better not try it.  Mae prepared breakfast for us.  Mae took Kylan
and Ashley to Dinosaur Land in Ogden.  They were there all day getting home
late in the afternoon.  I worked on getting my new Palm loaded but could not do
it so I called Mike and he came up this evening and loaded the software and restored
my files.  Mark came down and we discussed the health problems that I am
having.  That took quite a bit of time.  Some of my problem may be coming from
the fillings in my teeth.  I was able to get some of my records updated today. 
I also got some of my Mannatech products capsulated.  While Mike was here Mae
played with Kylan, Ashley and Maddi.  She sure is a great grandma.  I finished
putting the Mannatech in the capsules before we went to bed.</span></p>

should say that Mae let me sleep in.  I added laa of our family’s birthdates to
my palm.  Mae was busy trying to get things ready for her meeting this evening
and at the same time take care of Kylan and Ashley.  At 4 pm I took the kids
home as Scott and Mishelle were back.  I visited with them quite a while.  I
borrowed some concrete tools from Kip.  I went down to Randy’s and he gave me a
treatment and it really helped to relieve the pain in my legs.  When I got home
Mae’s meeting was still going so I loaded some lumber and tools that I want to
take with me tomorrow.  It was late but Mae couldn’t go to sleep.  She has too
many worries.  </span></p>

bed.  She later called me to tell me that she got up just before 10 AM.  I am
glad that she was able to sleep.  I put forms in for cement for Rich.  I hope
that they can find some one to pour the cement next week.  I left for home at
5:15 PM, stopping in Ogden to get gas for the truck.  Mae went over to Jeff and
Gail’s this evening.  I did an update to our computer and took a shower.  Mae
didn’t get home until almost 10 PM.  We watched a video before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got going
after 8 AM.  After eating breakfast we went over to haul some food (that we got
from Sister Walker’s) to the Bishop office.  I have been on the phone with Rich
&amp; Lois concerning the cement for their driveway.  They had a couple of men
that would pour it for $650.00.  I told them that were way out of line and that
if they could find me help I would pour it Tuesday.  Mae and I attended the
Stanford Porter reunion held in Porterville.  It was well attended and we sure
enjoyed it.  With Terry’s family being there it gave the Glendon Family a good
representation.  Kim was nominated to be in the organizations leadership
starting next year.  None of our family attended the reunion, except Mae and
I.  I wish that some of our children would realize the importance of these
reunions.  Georgia was the only one from her family.  Kim had Summing and
Denial and Caleesee with him.  We stopped at David’s and helped them plant some
trees.  After getting home I took a nap.  This evening I watched a show on TV. 
Mae and I worked and planned for the lesson we are to give tomorrow in
Primary.  Bob came down and told us that Carroll is doing some better.  She is
home but she is in quite a lot of pain with her neck hurting.  I am being very
careful with my diet but am in quite a bit of pain.  It is not something that I
can’t tolerate but I am concerned about it getting worse.  Randy’s treatment
helped me the most but I don’t know if he can give me treatments very often.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and attended a Stake Priesthood Leadership meeting.  The meeting was good
but I question the wisdom of correcting the complete Stake because of the
failure of some Wards.  It seems to me that most of that should be handled in
more privet interviews.  After returning home we prepared and ate breakfast.  I
took a nap before we went to church.  Mae and I substituted in the Primary
teaching the 8 year old class.  It went quite well and we enjoyed the time with
the children.  We met the couple that is buying the Watson’s home.  This
afternoon we went up to David and Shauna’s for dinner.  It was a very enjoyable
afternoon and evening.  Shauna had prepared a lovely dinner.  David took us on
a ride around the development that he had purchased a building lot.  It is
amazing as to the amount of development that is taking place.  You can’t help
but wonder when and where it will end.  David had Mae and I try an invert
recliner that he has.  It really seemed to help my pain.  I used it a second
time before we came home.  Rich called me and we will plan on pouring concrete
at 12:30 PM on Tuesday.   Jeff Underwood will be there to help me.  I will call
the concrete co tomorrow to schedule the delivery.  We stopped at Scott’s on
the way home to get a check that Dian Prescott had sent Mae some months ago. 
It was 10:30 PM when we got home.  I then made my journal entry before we went
to bed.  </span></p>

to wake Mae.  I then took a short nap.  Bob brought us breakfast of waffles. 
That was special of him and we sure enjoyed them.  Mae is busy with the final
preparations for the Byron Porter Reunion.  I went over to Durk’s and took
Carla &amp; Craig’s house plans to get a bid on a hydronic heat system.  I took
the air hockey table that the Watson’s had given us to the D.I.  I stopped at
Bed Bath and Beyond and bought some air filters.  I drove out to Sandi’s where
I picked up her invert table.  I also figured what it will take to repair the
roof of the other duplexes carport.  I stopped on the way home to get some
French fries at Wendy’s.  I got a call from Susan Speirs about doing our
personal tax filling for us.  While talking to her I put sugar on my French
fries by mistake so I just throw them away.  I stopped and borrowed some knee
pads from Kip and then came home.  We had to hurry to get to the park for the
reunion.  The reunion went well and wee had a fair turn out.  Jeff and Gail
were the only one’s that came from our family.  It was late when we got home
and got things put away.  I made this journal entry before going to bed.</span></p>

there Jeff and Justin were already there and getting the work that I had left
for Rich to do done.  I was afraid that Rich wouldn’t get it done so that is
why I went up early.  The cement came at 12:30 PM.  It took us until almost 2
PM to get it poured.  Before pouring I wet the ground down very wet and figured
it would take quite a while to set, however by the time we finished pouring it
was almost to set to finish.  We got on it with edger’s, mag. floats, steel
trials and knee boards but soon found out that the edger’s wouldn’t work, the
steel trials wouldn’t work and we didn’t need the knee boards.  Jeff and I
worked for about 1 ½ hours with mag. floats and put a broom finish.  That is
all we could do.  I am very disappointed in the results.  I think that the Lord
heard and answered our prayers to get is where we did.  Lois fixed us some
thing to eat and we then came home.  We were very tired but I took the time to
set the inversion table up and lay on it a few minutes.</span></p>

It was a long visit because we got Patriarch</span></p>

fishing at Strawberry reservoir.  I decided that I should try starting the boat
motor before we left.  It wouldn’t start.  I worked with it for a while and
finally but a battery charger on the battery.  We came in the house and went
back to sleep.  I got up at 8 AM and still couldn’t get it to turn over.  I
finally took the boat into Peterson Marine’s and had them check it.  They
decided that the starter motor has gone out.  It will need to be pulled and
sent in to be rebuilt.  That will take several days and will cost in the area
of $350.00.  That was really disappointing to have to call the fishing day
off.  I am sure glad that I checked the motor before we traveled to Strawberry
and then would have found that it wouldn’t work.  We visited with the new
family that is moving into walker’s home.  We then went to C-A-L store and I
bought 3 pair of coveralls, 2 blouses for Mae and some Round-Up.  This evening
Bob took Mae and I to the P. X. on base and we bought a new deck top computer
for Mae.  This evening we watched the movie “From Now to Eternity”.  We then
took showers before going to bed and I filled in my journal entry.</span></p>

for Randy’s cabin.  We got home after noon and the Clarks came to get us about
1:30 PM.  It was almost 3 PM when we arrived at the Hyer’s in Preston.  They
have really done a lot of remodeling since we were here a year ago.  We visited
and then went to a restraint to eat.  We enjoyed visiting and becoming
reacquainted.  After eating we went down to Preston to the Hyer’s daughter’s
home.  We saw it last year but it is now finished inside and they are starting
the landscaping.  I still didn’t feel good at anyone having that extravagant of
a home.  It just doesn’t seem right to me.  we went back to the Hyer’s and
visited for a while before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke and
used the bathroom.  I read my scriptures and gave a lot of thought to the
cement at Rich’s.  This morning while talking to Charles we came up with the
idea of grinding the driveway to make it look better.  I think I like that
idea.  After breakfast Grenn and I went for a ride on the four wheelers.  We
drove up a dirt road called, Worm Creek Road, just to see the area.  We were
gone for over an hour.  We did see a doe and her fawn.  After returning Charles
got his boat out and all of us went for a ride on the lake.  The reservoir is
quite small and the water is now very low so there wasn’t a lot of room to
ride, but it was fun.  Most of us played some card games.  We had pizza for
lunch along with sliced tomatoes and fruit.  It was almost 3 PM when Grenn,
Kathleen, Mae and I left for home.  We got to our place about 5:30 PM so had to
hurry as we were to be in our seats in the Conference Center before 7 PM.  From
our place the Clark’s took their car on to their home.  I walked over to the
Fallis’s to see if they were going to go with us but they weren’t home.  Mae
and I drove down to Clark’s and took them with us.  We attended the special
program at the Conference Center, titled “A Salute to the Armed Forces” with
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Orchestra at Temple Square with special
quests Samdi Patty, Crook and Chas and The Band of the Air Force Reserve.  It
was really a enjoyable evening.  As we left the Conference Center I realized
that I had dropped my glass case.  I had my glasses so we just left it.  After
taking the Clarks home Mae and I stopped at Wal-Mart and bought a new glass
case and some pencils.  It was after mid-night when we got to bed.  It has been
a busy but fun week end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up but still had time for a dish of cold cereal for breakfast before
going to church.  I got sleepy during Sunday school and really had trouble
staying awake in Sacrament meeting.  Bob and Carroll invited us for lunch.  Bob
made a nice roast, potatoes &amp; gravy and corn on the cob.  I helped Mark
check out his fruit dryer to see if it was working.  I took time to catch up my
journal.  Mae packed my clothes for next week.  Mae is sure a good wife to me. 
She sure keeps busy and is concerned for everyone.  Irven, Sandy and Mark came
over at 6:35 PM and we visited and played games until 9 PM.  I finished my
journal entry and we got ready for bed and finished packing for tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 4
AM but let Mae sleep until 5 AM.  She got up and helped me finish packing and got
my breakfast.  It was after 6AM before I left.  It was after 8 AM when I got to
Rich and Lois’s.  I spent a while trying to figure out what should be done with
the cement.  For now I will take away the time spent on the cement and also
give them credit for the concrete.  I called Castle Concrete but they will not
do anything or in any way except any fault for the concrete.  I did get the
bearing posts installed and covered with sleeves before we quite today.  After
dinner I put up my tools.  I set up the inversion table in the garage and used
it there before coming in for the night.  I talked to Mae a couple of times
today and she cleaned up my fishing items in the shed.  This evening she went
up to Morgan to see a show put on by the High School.  I played a couple of
games on the computer and took a shower before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up by 6
AM and started work about 8 AM.  Rich had several concerns and other ideas.  He
kept questioning the way I was doing things.  It about got to me and I really
had to tell myself to calm down.  Once I ask him if he wanted to build it and
another time I told him that I would build it any way he wanted me to.  Despite
all that we did get quite a bit of the deck framed.  I don’t expect to complete
it this week.  Mae did go to Concrete Specialties and have them talk to me. 
They did think the idea of grinding the surface would be a good choice and
suggested that I seal it after grinding.  We quite about 6 AM and came in for
super.  I did go out and put tools away.  I laid on the inversion table a
couple of times today.  Mae called me to give me the bid on materials for Carla
and Craig’s heat system.  We ended up talking about this job and I indicated
that I thought I would have to write off the concrete time and materials.  Mae
could not understand that and became upset with me.  She even hung up on me but
called back and apologized but still thinks I’m wrong.  This is one job that I
wish that I hadn’t started.  I still have to shower and it is now 10 PM.  Good
night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was after
6 AM when I woke for breakfast.  Rich and I continued with the framing of the
deck.  Rich took Lois into the Dr. this morning and they decided that Lois
should have an operation for a hernia.  She will go in next Tuesday and will be
back home that day.  I went into town and stopped at C-A-L Ranch to get me some
suspenders for my nail apron and some leather laces for my work boots.  When I
went to pay for them I realized that I had not brought my wallet with me.  I
had to go back home and get it and then return.  I then went to Home Depot and
got some materials for the project.  Rich and Lois were back home when I got
back.  After lunch we went back to work and worked until 6:30 PM.  After dinner
we set around the table and visited.  It was 9:45 PM when I called Mae and
visited with her for a while before we went to bed.  She is sure special.  I
will now take my shower and go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We started
work at 8 AM and worked until after 5 PM.  We got most of the framing done and
are planning to spray paint the framing to make it more water resistant.  I
talked to Mae a couple of times today.  When we stopped this evening the
evening went fast but I didn’t get much more accomplished.  I have used the
inversion table a couple of time.  It is 8:30 now so I will take a shower and
go to bed.  Elise and I visited for a few minutes tonight.  I played some games
on the computer to relax before I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was a busy
day today.  I ran of a balance for Elise today and before she went to bed
tonight she wrote me a check for 4,000.00.  Rich and I started at 8 AM and went
most of the day.  We did stop for an hour for lunch.  It was 7:30 PM before we
quite this evening.  After dinner we cleaned up tools.  I called Mae and told
her I was to tired to drive home this evening.  She keeps busy cleaning when I
am gone.  Aunt Beth called and said that there was a unit that she was sure
would be for sale where she lives.  Mae checked and the family is not ready to
sell yet but the mother just died and thy are putting the father into an
assisted living unit.  The will call us when they are ready to show it to us. 
Bob had new tires put on our car today.  He also checked to see if Chad is home
but they are not.  Mae said that she thinks they are up to Snowbird for the
week.  Well it is after 10 PM but I will play a game or two before I go to
sleep.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and was awake before 6 AM.  I decided to get away as
quick as I could but Lois and Rich were up and had breakfast ready for me.  I
took some tools so I could work at Irven and Sandy’s today.  I left for home
before 8 AM.  I talked top Mae on our phone about the time I was at Willard.  I
had tried to call her before but she must have been out walking.  I asked Mae
to call Peterson Marina to see if my boat was repaired.  She called right back
and they do not have it ready yet.  I came on home getting there about 10 AM. 
It was good to be home.  After lunch I took a nap.  I then returned some tools
to Kip.  I stopped at Home Depot and bought some materials to repair the porch
post on Irven’s house.  I took the console to our old computer to the D. I. and
let them have it.  Jeff had come over on Thursday and put our new computer
together.  It seems a shame that the old one has no use except to be
discarded.  On my way to Irven’s I realized that I didn’t have a hammer or an
extension cord with me.  I called Bob and asked him if he could bring those
items over to me.  Mark came instead as Bob was helping Mark make a salad for
the social this evening.  Bob finished making Mark’s salad while Mark came to
help me.  Bob had forgot to tell him to bring the extension cord.  We went to
the back of the house and found a window to open and go through.  I was able to
use my extension cord and do the repairs.  I then went down to Chad’s and got
the step brackets that he had built for me.  I got home just in time to change
and go the High Priest Group social.  It was well done with every detail planed
by the committee.  After the social Mae and I went to the store and then to
Chad’s to give him a check for the brackets he made for me.  It is sure nice to
be with Mae.  We watch a show “El Dorado” with John Wayne before going to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but then went back to bed and slept until 9:30 AM.  We just had time to get
ready to go to church.  Bishop Steadman led the discussion in High Priest this
morning and did a very good job with it.  Sunday school was good but I became
sleepy towards the end.  I was afraid that I would sleep through most of
Sacrament meeting but the speakers did an excellent job and we had special
musical numbers so I was able to keep awake and really enjoy the meeting.  Bob
had us come up for dinner.  We then had Scott, Mishelle, Kylan, Ashley, Gale Jeff
&amp; Benjamin over for dinner at 5:30 PM.  We had a very enjoyable evening.  After
eating we set up a race track and ran timed races with the motor scooter.  Jeff
had the shortest time with five laps and a time of 98 seconds.  I called Elise
and we decided not to work next week but take the pressure off Lois as she will
be operated on Tuesday for a hernia.  I also wanted the week off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and couldn’t sleep so I got up for a while and set in the reclined.  I finally
got to sleep when Mae came in to check on me.  That woke me again.  I went back
to bed with Mae and went to sleep.  I woke at 9 AM and went walking with Mae. 
While we walked I called Peterson Marina to check on my boat.  I found that
nothing had been done with it.  I got a little upset.  The manager of the shop
was up to Pine View so they called him on a cel phone.   The Called me back and
will have it by tomorrow evening.  I am not happy over it, but there is not
much more to do now.  We stopped and looked at a house that has been for sell
for a long time.  We may look more into it.  We went over to Dr. Bennett and
got a treatment.  We then took some things over to Mishelle. I ordered some
coil springs for the Buick.  After lunch we went back and got the springs.  We
stopped at Staple’s and bought a CD cleaner.  We also stopped and washed my
pickup.  It really needed a good wash job.  After getting home Bob and I
changed the springs and put new shock absorbers on the rear of the Buick.  Mae
fixed a light super although it was after 9 PM when we ate.  While eating we
heard a noise from the kitchen drains and found that water was coming up the
drain into the sink.  Carroll and Mark have been canning and put quite a lot
down the garbage disposal and it plugged the drain lines.  We had to remove a
lot of things from the wash room and mop up the floor.  I was tired and didn’t
have much patience.  Mae has been working on the statement and has it about
balanced.  I will finish it tomorrow.  It’s late and we are going to bed.</span></p>

me.  We cleaned the drain and had to get a snake to break it loose.  I then had
to clean the wash room.  Mae went to Ogden to a genealogy class this morning.  I
called Peterson’s and they have my boat ready.  I went in to get the boat and
had the shop manager put the boat into the water.  We backed the boat stop back
about 4 inches.  After getting home I tried towing the camp trailer and the
boat.  I made more adjustments and towed it again.  I can go 50 MPH but after
that it starts swaying.  I think I will but a sway bar between the pickup and
the trailer and see if that will make a difference.  Mae had a nice dinner
ready and then I went to a High Priest Group leadership meeting.  After getting
home Mae went with me to put gas in the pickup and boat.  Mae fixed my lunch
and treats for me so Randy and I can go fishing tomorrow.  It is 10.45 PM so I
had better get to bed.  I did find time to finish the bank statement and get it
transferred to our new computer.  I also went to the bank and transferred the
money we got from the sale of the Wyoming property into our Secure Savings
where we will get a better return.</span></p>

AM and was at Randy’s by 5 AM.  We went up to Strawberry Reservoir and went
fishing.  When we launched my boat and tried to start it the battery was to
dead.  I removed the battery from my pickup and carried it to the boat and used
it to jump the boat.  It started right off.  We fished all day catching many
fish but were only able to keep 4 of what we caught.  The rest were over 15
inches but were under 22 inches.  I do not agree with this limit as to many
fish are injured and will die.  It was after 7 PM when I got home.  Mae fixed
some dinner and I bathed before going to bed.  My stomach didn’t feel to good
and Mae still wanted to stay up for a while so I went to sleep in the
recliner.  I woke a little latter with stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I slept
the rest of the night in the recliner. </span></p>

the alarm went off so I turned it off and went back to bed, but neither of us
went back to sleep so we decided to go fishing anyway.  We didn’t leave until
about 8 am.  We went to East Canyon Reservoir.  We didn’t catch any fish and
only had two bites, but we enjoyed the day anyway.  It was a beautiful day and
the lake and scenery were beautiful.  Mae read quite a lot in our book series
“Prelude to Glory”.  This afternoon about 4 PM we decided to give up on fishing.
 We set the trolling plate up so we could speed up and just went boating.  I am
very pleased with the performance of the boat.  On the way home I asked Mae if she
would like to stop at the restaurant in Morgan for supper.  We parked the
vehicles and ate a good chicken dinner.  Robin and her younger children came to
visit right when we got home.  I fell asleep setting in the recliner.  I was to
tired to make this entry tonight so went to bed.</span></p>
