<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae did get
up to help Shellie get the children off to school.  We said our goodbyes to
Garrett last night and to Kevis and Jase this morning as the left for school. 
We packed the car, saying goodbye to Roy, Quint and Shellie as Roy left for
work and Shellie had to meet with some Sisters, to decorate for a Ward party,
this morning and Quint went with Shellie to help her.  After packing the car we
went out into the back yard and pool area just to take some pictures and enjoy
it, as it might be the last time we get to enjoy this yard, if they sell their
home.  We left at 10:30 AM for home.  We stopped to use a rest room and starch
our legs at Sedona and the again in Flag Staff for gas.  We did go for a short
walk to stretch our legs.  We again stopped in Page at a Maverick for frozen
yogurt and then went to Kanab.  At Kanab we got a room at the Super 8 motel and
went out to eat.  The owner of the motel recommended to restaurant but it had
Italian menu so we looked for something else.  There wasn’t much of a selection
so we went back to the Italian restaurant.  We ordered a chick and potato dish
which was fair but disappointing for the amount it cost and the small serving
and not even a vegetable with it.  We ordered a Cesar salad that was only
lettuce and 3 croutons and know we were in trouble when we saw that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We left the
motel about 8:30 AM and traveled to Panguitch where we ate breakfast.  We
traveled on to the crossover Highway 20 and then stopped at Beaver for gas. 
When we did the attendant was out to help us fill the car with gas.  He then
washed our windows and asked if there was anything else he could help us with. 
It was such a surprise to have a service station give that kind of service that
it totally through me off balance.  The wind was so cold that as we left I told
Mae that maybe we should go south instead of north.  We traveled on to American
Fork and arrived at Mike’s about 2:30 PM.  After visiting with then we came on
home getting here about 5 PM.  We unpacked and then went shopping for a few
groceries.  After eating something for dinner, I quite and watched a show.  Mae
got on the inter-net and tried to clear a few of those.  We got a very nice
letter from Deanna and Bryce.  Mae watched the last of the show and then after
it ended it replayed.  Mae wanted to watch the first of it to see what she had
missed.  I finally fell asleep.  Mae watched the end of the show and then we
went to bed about 11 PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
started getting ready.  As it was Fast Sunday we had extra time so I started
working on my journal.  we had an appointment with the Stake President at 10:30
AM.  We were at his office just before 10:30.  The appointment was turned over
to a counselor in the Stake Presidency and was just an official release from
the High Priest Group leadership.  We attended R.S. and Priesthood and then we
came home to start dinner.  We went back to Sacrament meeting.  After meeting
we paid our tithing for December and signed up for Tithing Settlement before we
came home.  I called David to see if they could change the Family Christmas
party if needed.  I ended up being on the phone for 1 ½ hours discussing the
Church.  I was not going to let him criticize the Church and tell me that it
was wrong.  I don’t know if it helped but I would not back down.  I could not
help but remember the statement that our Bishop from the 13<sup>th</sup> Ward
in Ogden would say,<i> “A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion
still.”   </i>Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley came before I got off the phone
with David.  We talked about my conversation with David until Jeff and Gail
came and then decided we should wait until another time to have this
conversation.  Mae had a very lovely dinner of roast and trimmings for us.  We
visited and played games through the evening.  I worked on my journal before
going to bed.  I have talked with all the kids about our family Christmas party
and we will keep it on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of December.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7 AM.  I fixed breakfast and then worked on Craig and Carla’s plans.  I
was unable to get the fills to read on my AutoCAD so I took the disk into Ogden
Blue Print but they weren’t able to read it either.  I worked on our checking
account getting the items in that we had during the past three weeks.  I moved
my boat back and parked it for the winter.  While in Ogden I stopped at Seagull
Book and got two small books that we will give to Jennifer and Kris.  They will
have grave side services for the three children tomorrow at 1 PM, at the Orem city
cemetery.  When I returned from town I brought in the Christmas decorations
from the shed.  We ate some dinner and then watched two Christmas shows on TV.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I’m not to
sure just where the time went this morning.  I did get a call from Carla and
she told me that they will not be building this winter, but will wait until
spring.  Even then they probably will not put in a hydronic heat system.  After
getting up and showering we seem to have kept busy but before long it was time
to go to Orem.  Bob, Carroll, Mark, Mae and I road together to Orem, in Bob’s
car.  When we got to Orem we had a little trouble finding the cemetery.  We
asked one man and he gave us directions back to the area but then we had to
stop again and I went to a house and asked.  They were able to point us to the
right direction and we found it ok.  Rich, Lois and Elise were already there. 
They called us from the Malad area and told us that they were coming down. 
They are so supportive of all the family events.  A short service was held at
the grave side for the three babies of Jennifer and Kris Payne.  The service
was very appropriate.  After the service Kris’s parents invited every one to
come to their home for a lunch.  The service started at 1 PM and it was a clear
sunny day so it was not to uncomfortable for the service.  It was good to visit
with Jennifer and Kris and other family members.  The evening went fast and at
8 PM we went to the church to meet with Bishop Smith for tithing settlement.  I
had time to get on the computers and check out our earnings for the year and we
were able to report that we had paid a full tithing.  Mae started putting up
some Christmas decorations this evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM and used the bathroom and read my scriptures.  I then got dressed and
prepared breakfast.  Mae got about 7:30 and we ate together.  I went to Randy’s
and figured the needs to hook his house plumbing to the city sewer line.  When
I got home I worked on the computer trying to get the scanner hooked up to
Mae’s computer.  No success!  We can’t find the soft ware for it.  After eating
lunch I took a nap, I think.  Mae bumped the recliner, Mark came down, the
phone rang and my feet were jumpy but Mae said that she heard me snore so I
must have gone to sleep for a minute.  I went to the store for Mae and looked
for sesame seeds.  I ask a clerk and when he couldn’t find it he got another
clerk.  She was about to get their boss when she found it.  We spent a good 15
minutes looking for it and then when I got home Mae asked me why I had bought
that.  I told her that it was on her list.  She had meant to put sunflower
seeds on the list instead of sesame seeds.  I then went in the truck and got
some gas, went to the post office and mailed a package to Shellie and also the
Christmas cards.  From there I went to Durk’s plumbing and got the sewer pipe
and fittings for Randy’s.  When I got home Mae had her clam chowder made.  We
changed clothes and went to the Ward Christmas party.  We ate and then each
table had a Ginger Bread House to assemble and decorate.  At our table were
Neil and Jean Knudsen, Smokey and Sylvia Barnes, Mark, Bob, Mae and I.  After
we got the house finished we took it to the family that lived just west of the
Barnes.  Sylvia and Smokey invited all of into their home for a few minutes to
visit and have a hot chocolate.  It was a fun evening. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                In my reading
this morning I enjoyed reading the 76 Section of the D&amp;C.  We had to hurry
in order to be at Jennies by 9:30 AM.  We were there until after 2 PM.  I was
quite discouraged with the results of this session with Jennie.  She has both
of us on several doses of medication and we need to be on a fairly strict
diet.  I went up to Universal Rental and reserved a mini-back-hoe for Monday. 
I then went to Randy’s and did some surveying for the sewer line.  We got ready
to go to S.L. where we met David, Shauna and the children and saw the Christmas
Lights on Temple Square.  We then went to Bryan’s in-laws home and enjoyed a
family get together.   We ate snacks and visited.  Only David and his family
could come from our family.  Mike was planning to come, but Tayler got sick. 
Kylan was sick so Scott and his family couldn’t come, plus Mishelle needed to
go visiting with the R.S. Presidency as she is their secretary.  Gail had their
Christmas R.S. Enrichment, which was a progressive dinner and Benjamin had ear
infection so they couldn’t come.  I’m not sure why Sandi’s family didn’t come. 
All of Bryce’s family, except Darin came.  Darin and Sarah have a new baby. 
Kim’s family couldn’t come as Misha had a basketball tournament and she is on
the varsity team.  Brady and his family were there, Kristy came with Georgia
&amp; Rick, and of course, Bryan &amp; Jenna were there with their family. 
Maliah came with her two children.  It was a little cramped in that home, but
it was fun being together anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae fixed
breakfast while I got ready to go down to Randy’s to work on his sewer line.  I
rented a sod cutter because Judy wanted to save the grass.  The ground was too
frozen to cut the sod so I returned the sod cutter and scheduled it for Monday.
 I picked up materials at Home Depot so I could put lights with a covering to
thaw the ground.  I also picked up materials to make a cabinet by our computer
desk as we need more room for the printer, scanner, external hard drive, etc.,
etc.  I bought Mae a Christmas gift and a poinsettia too.  I went back to
Randy’s and set up the tent and lights before going home.  Mae and I left at
4:30 pm to go to Jeff &amp; Gail’s home as they invited us to go out to eat
with them at a restaurant past Morgan.  They have decorated their home so cute,
both outside and inside.  It was fun to see little Benjamin again, he is so
darling.  The meal and atmosphere was wonderful and we had a great time being
with Jeff &amp; Gail.  Jeff wouldn’t let us pay as he said this was for his dad
putting in their medicine cabinet for them.  Mae &amp; I split a roast beef
dinner as it was the special and the waitress said that this meal would feed
5.  It was very good and we also both got a salad.  Mae &amp; Gail both got a
large cookie for dessert.  When we got back to Jeff and Gale’s home, they
invited us to stay and play games.  Since it was only about 8 pm, we did.  We
played “Hand &amp; Foot .  It is quite a bit like “Canasta”.  It was fun.  When
we got home I prepared a gift for Mae.  She will have to pretend that today is
the 14<sup>th</sup> of December as I am going to giver her the 12 days of
Christmas but she needs this gift now.  It is an electric blanket with duel
controls.  Mae gets so cold when she goes to bed that I thought this will help
her.  Mae cleaned the house today, and had several boxes of items and bags of
clothing to go to the Deseret Industries.  She also cleaned out the laundry
room as she found mice tracks and items which the mice had chewed into, so she
threw all of that away.  I had seen a mouse before we left for Arizona and set
out a mouse trap, but didn’t catch it.  I guess it multiplied while we were
gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6:30 and took my medications and then as normal read my scriptures.  When Mae
got up I decided to lay back down for a few minutes.  We thought Scott and
Mishelle was bring the children over for us to tend while they went to the
Temple.  Bob came down and invited us to breakfast of biscuits and gravy so we
left a note on the door for Scott and Mishelle and went upstairs and ate. 
Mishelle called and said that Kylan was sick so they wouldn’t come.  Kylan was
really upset as he had looked so forward to be with his Grandma Browning.  We
went to a Senior Citizen Lunch and program held at the Clinton Elementary
school.  Bob, Carroll &amp; Mark went with us.  It was a very enjoyable lunch
and program.  The choir that performed is the one that Patriarch Johnstun sings
with.  Mae and I drove our car because after the program we went shopping for a
gift for a wedding reception we will attend this evening.  I then took Mae home
and I went down to Randy’s to see if the ground was thud.  When I got home I
helped Mae put up the rest of the Christmas decorations.  Finishing that job
caused us to go later to the wedding reception of Kip and Wendy Michaelis’s
daughter, Mary Ann.  We met several of our old acquaintances there and visited
with them.  We stopped on the way home and bought me a frozen yogurt.  Bob and
Carroll invited us up for apple pie and ice cream so I used my yogurt in place
of the ice cream.  We thought we would be back earlier than what we were and we
were going to play canasta, but it was to late when we got here.  Mae and I
watched a DVD “My Girl Friday”, staring Cary Grant, before going to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
6:20 AM and when I checked my day planer I realized that there was Stake High
Priest meeting this morning.  I called Mark and had him remind Bob.  I had to
hurry but they were ready when I got up stairs and we arrived at the church at
6:55 AM.  It was a good meeting.  When I got home I went back to sleep for 45
minutes before getting ready for church. When we ate breakfast I gave Mae a
gift of electric candles.  On the tag I put that we would pretend that today
was Dec. 15.  She was very excited about them but I done think Mae has got the
hint that I am going to give her 12 days of Christmas.  Like the electric
blanket, I wanted her to have them early.  During Sunday school I came home
with Bob and I put the dinner roast on to cook.  When I got the pan it is
warped on the bottom, so I got a couple of boards, laid the pan upside down on
one board, put the other board on the bottom of the pan and hit it with a big hammer. 
That straightened it out until it doesn’t rock on the stove now.  While I was
getting the tools out of my trailer Brother Bodily came out to check out who
ever it was in my tool trailer.  I thanked him for doing it.  Sacrament meeting
was very good today.  When we got home from meetings I helped Mae get the
dinner table set.  I also got on the computer and did some work on my journal
and used AUTOCAD to figure the slop on Randy’s sewer line.  David, Shauna and
the children came for dinner at 5 PM.  We had a wonderful roast dinner.  After
cleaning up the table and while Mae finished up the dishes, I then took David,
Shauna and the children upstairs to see Bob &amp; Carroll’s Christmas
decorations.  Bob and I went to the Fallis’s Home Teaching.  I finished my
journal entry and printed November’s journal and stored it in the binder for a
hard copy.  It was after 11 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t get
going as it had snowed last night.  I went down to Randy’s at 9 AM and checked
the ground where I had covered it.  It was free from frost so I went up to
Universal Rental and rented a sod cutter.  I cut about an 8’ ft. strip of lawn
from the front road to the house and stacked it out of the way.  I had Judy
call Blue Stake for me and schedule them to come out and mark underground
utilities.  I called Bob and had him bring me some marking paint.  When he got
here I had just finished with the cutter and had it loaded into my truck.  He
volunteered to return the cutter for me.  After finishing with the sod, I went
under the house and started digging the trench for the sewer line there.  I
also set it up so Randy could dig the trench.  I had just finished when there
was an electrical flash and then water started spraying all over.  I shut off
the water main.  I then check to see what had happened and found that when
someone had spliced a 220 V line, they had done it outside a electrical box and
had just twisted the wires together and taped them with electrical tape.  The
wire was left lying on the ground and when I moved it out of the way, a barer
wire came close to the water line and had shorted out.  The electric jumps blow
a 1/16<sup>th</sup> inch hole in the water line.  I shut of the water supply
and went for parts to repair the line.  I got my tools from home and had one
union.  When I cut and sodered the line together, the joint still leaked.  I
had to go to Home Depot for more supplies.  While there I picked up the parts
to repair the electrical lines.  On the way back I called Mae and had her prepare
me a sandwich to eat.  I really had trouble getting my sodered joints to seal
and had to redo the repair five times.  On the 5<sup>th</sup> time it held and
I went home.  It was after 11 PM when I got home.  I took a shower and then
socked in a hot bath.  I fell a sleep and Mae had to wake me and get me to bed
at mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae let me
sleep in until I woke at 10:45 AM.  She had gone to the store for groceries
while I slept.  Bob had brought down some waffle batter and the grill so that
is what we had.  We had just finished with breakfast and putting groceries away
when Shauna called and said that she had to take Taylor to the hospital in an
ambulance and ask us to help her by tending the other children.  We stopped
everything we were doing and went up to their home.  Mae tended the children
while I made up the beds and straightened up a few things.  I also started a
letter to Tony and Leah.  Later Shauna called us from the hospital to let us
know that Taylor was breathing better but the Doctors want to find what caused
him to have a convolution.  Shauna called again at 5:45 PM and told us that
they were coming home.  Her mother was bring them home.  As we had other
appointments this evening we got things ready to go when they came.  Smoky
Barns had already taken my place and Mae also had someone else that gave her
part but Mae went over for the Relief Society program.  I worked on the
computer getting a form created that will print out a score sheet for the game
“Mormon Bridge”.  I also made Christmas tags for the twelve days of Christmas. 
When Mae came home she tripped over my work boots that I had left by the front
door when I came in last night.  She fell quite hard but seem to be ok after a
few minutes.  </span></p>

Christmas presents for Mae.  When I got home Irven &amp; Sandy were here. 
Sandy got some information from Mae and then went to the copy shop.  Irven
stayed here and visited.  Bob and Mark also came down to visit with him.  Irven
ate dinner with Mae and me.  This evening Bob and I went Home Teaching and
visited with the Casey’s and the Johnston’s.  we took a cake and a box of candy
to them.  Sister Johnston gave us a bread mix and a CD that their son had
produced.  I wrote a letter to Tony &amp; Leah Gerritsen before going to bed. 
We haven’t heard from them for a while and they didn’t answer our last e-mail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5:45 AM so I could get a track hoe at Universal Rental and get to Randy’s.  We
dug the trench for the sewer line but just before we finished the sides caved
off.  We went over to the city office and were able to talk to the inspector
and he will come down first thing in the morning.  He will let us put the pipe
in with his inspection of the hookup to the main sewer line and back fill as we
install the rest of the line.  We were able to get to the sewer stub and hook
in with the first line before we quite tonight.  It was after 7 PM when I got
home.  Brother Thompson had come to visit us and was here when I got home.  Mae
had tended little Benjamin to day and this evening for Jeff &amp; Gail.  After
I ate some dinner Mae cut my hair.  I then had to get on the computer and
refigure the grade for the sewer line as the stub in to the main was not as
deep as we were told it would be.  I also made this journal entrance before I
took a shower and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:15 to get to work by 8 AM.  I returned the trackhoe and got a backhoe.  I
ordered some gravel but when I told Randy he said he had talked to someone that
drilled wells and he told Randy that the clay would be ok, so we canceled the
gravel order.  When we tried to compact the clay it just went soft.  We tried
using some gravel that was out to the side and back of Randy’s shop.  We had
success in getting the clay to pack so I called the gravel company and they
said they would try to get some to us.  He said that if I hadn’t canceled they
could have delivered gravel first thing this morning but they would now try to
get it to us before they quite today.  They did and with the use of gravel I
hope to finish laying pipe tomorrow.  It was late when I got home.  I was glad
that Mae didn’t find some place for us to go to night as I needed time to
finish my plans for the Twelve Days of Christmas for Mae.  I was most of the
evening but got all the gifts wrapped and put out for Mae.  Mae was tickled at
the gifts and the way I have them set up so she opens one each day.  We were
late getting to bed and I will have a big day tomorrow.</span></p>

5:30 AM and was down to Randy’s by 8 AM.  Mae got up and got my lunch and
breakfast for me.  I could see that Randy wasn’t much help but I needed some
that could see.  I ask Randy if one of his boys had the day off and could
help.  He went in and came back and said that Rick would help us.  it really
helped to have some one that could check grade and help with the work.  It was
4 PM when we finished installing the line and filling the trench.  I cleaned
the backhoe and then returned it to the rental.  I got home at 6 PM.  David and
the children were here.  Shauna was doing some shopping so David brought the
children and came to visit.  When Shauna finished she came over also.  Mae had
prepared a nice dinner of meat loaf, baked potatoes and squash.  After dinner
David and I played Mae and Shauna in a game of Rook.  After they left I filled
out the report on Randy’s, filled in my journal for today and took a shower
before we went to bed and watched a movie.  It was a Kerry Grant movie but I
fell asleep before it ended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae woke
about 8 AM but I didn’t wake until 9 AM.  Bob came down and invited us to eat
biscuits and gravy with them.  We then had to hurry to get to church.  I was
still tired so figured that I would come home and take a nap after Priesthood
but we remembered that Mark was going to teach the Gospel Doctrine class today
so I stayed.  Mark gave a good lesson and I stayed interested in it.  Sacrament
meeting went well and the Spirit was very good.  The music and the talks were
very good so I was able to keep interested and didn’t fall asleep.  The
Fallis’s brought three children with them.  They think that they will be able
to adopt them.  Bob &amp; Carroll had us up for a nice roast dinner.  They are
sure cute that way.  We just relaxed this evening.  Sandy came over to try our
inversion table.  One of Mae’s sister that she Visit Teaches had to drive up to
Logan and had a low tire.  She didn’t know where to get it filled with air but
she was also out of gas and had no money.  We went up and I checked her tire
and we filled her car with gas.  We offered to drive her to Logan but she had
several places to go and wouldn’t except our offer.  I worked on the computer
while Mae wrapped some gifts.  I sure love that girl.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
early this morning as she is meeting Jackie Thompson for breakfast.  I got up
just before she left.  I prepared my own breakfast and then went down to
Randy’s and installed a junction box and spliced the electrical wires to the
ovens.  I was about an hour doing the repairs.  I put all my tools, which I had
out while doing the sewer line and the plumbing and electrical problems, away
in my trailer.  Judy wrote me a check for the balance that is owed me to this
point.  On my way home I deposited the check into our account.  When I got home
I disassembled the door on the drivers side on my pickup.  I is not opening
from inside of the cab.  I found that the handle is broken.  By then Mae had
got home so she and I went out in the shed and found some more decorations that
Mae wanted.  We ate some lunch and then I showered and got cleaned up.  We
stopped at Murdock Chevrolet and I bought the parts to the door that I needed. 
We then went to Clark’s where we visited just a few minutes and then went to
S.L. to see the decorations at Temple Square with Grenn and Kathleen.  We ate
first at the Lion’s House.  We enjoyed the lights and decorations but it was
cooled.  We went inside the visitor center to get warm and I noticed that Uncle
Van and Aunt Allison we downstairs in the lobby.  We went down and visited with
them, and remained for almost an hour.  Kathleen recognized Uncle Van and as
they talked they realized that Van was the Ward clerk in the collage ward,
while Kathleen and Grenn were going to school there in Cedar City.  We enjoyed
the lights and the crowd on Temple Square and it was good to be with the
Clarks.  We had to stop at a store and buy some nibbles to eat as I drove home. 
It was 10:30 PM when we got home.  I filled in my journal.  Mae made us a cup
of Postum that we drank before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This morning
went fast.  Mae made entries into our Quicken file while I prepared breakfast. 
I then made some of the entries of the charges that I had made.  Bob came down
so I went with him to Hill Field and helped him buy a computer for Cole to
use.  On the way to the base we stopped and got the key to Irven’s pickup so we
could move it.  When we return home we moved Irven’s pickup and then
repositioned my tent trailer and snowmobile trailer.  We then stacked the wood
from Bob’s pickup to the back of the shed.  We put a cover over the tent
trailer and secured the cover that Sandy had on their snowie car.  Mae and I
went to the Ogden Temple this evening where we helped with a Sealing session. 
On the way home we ate at the Golden Dynasty.  I sure enjoy being with Mae, she
is special.  I made my journal entry and then printed Mae some more pictures
for Christmas letters.  Eating that late I had to sleep in the recliner.</span></p>

when I woke.  Mae was up when I got up.  After breakfast I worked on the bank
statement.  Mae figured that Pat would be here by noon but she called about 1
PM and hadn’t left her home yet.  I had some lunch and then went out side and
cut up the trees in the back yard.  We got a pickup load cut and then I went
over to Layton and changed the keys to the locks on Robin Steadman’s house. 
While I was waiting for Robin to come home, Pat called me and she was lost.  I
tried to tell her how to find our place but she seemed to really be confused. 
About that time my phone went dead and I was unable to contact her.  I will
come back on the 29<sup>th</sup> to install a doggie door for her.  It was
after 7 PM when I returned home.  I got gas in my pickup on the way home.  Mae
has been worried about Pat all evening.  We have been unsuccessful at trying to
find Pat.  Pat called Mae at 11:30 PM to tell her that she had finally given up
on finding our place and returned home.  We are so thankful for her safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up until late and ate breakfast at 10:30 AM.  We had each opened a Christmas
gift.  I am doing the 12 days of Christmas for Mae so she wanted me to open a
gift also.  I gave her a set of scales and she gave me a white shirt.  I sure
love being with her!!!  I repaired the lock and handle on my pickup door, then
Bob, Mark and I finished cutting up the trees that Bob and I had cut down last
summer.  We got a total of three pickup loads of fire wood stacked behind the
shed in back.  Mae prepared a lovely dinner and invited Brother Frankcom, Mark,
Bob &amp; Carroll to eat with us.  We visited for a while after dinner.  After
every left I turned on the TV and we watched the last half of the BTU &amp;
Organ’s football game.  BYU won 38 to 8 so it wasn’t a really exciting game. 
Mae and I then went to the grocery store for a few items.  I brought the
roaster oven in so we can cook two small turkeys tomorrow.  We assembled a game
for our family Christmas Party tomorrow at David &amp; Shauna’s.  I filled in
my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

her gift for the 9<sup>th</sup> Day of Christmas which was pink slippers and a
pink turtle neck sweater.  We got two small turkeys on to cook, for this
evening.  Mae tried to go to the choirpracter but couldn’t get there because of
accidents on main street and the entrance to the freeway.  I went to Seagull
Book and bought a book for Mark.  Sandi had to come to Bountiful tfor a Doctors
visit and so came on up and visited with us.  at 3 PM we started for David and
Shauna’s but the traffic and slippery roads slowed us down.  We had a wonderful
family Christmas party at David and Shauna’s this evening.  All of our family,
except for Shellie’s family was at the party.  It was late when we left and we
got home just before mid-night.  Sandi and Nick gave us a clock radio, David, Shauna,
Mike and Becky gave us a digital photo Frame.  </span></p>

to Weston and McKayla.  We then went to Scott’s and picked up our DVDs.  From
there we went to Home Depot and Pet Mart for some material for Robin Steadman’s
job.  We thought that we would visit Robin Walker but she never answered our
phone calls.  We went to the Rocky Mountain rest home and took a Poinsettia
into a lady that didn’t have but a granddaughter that would visit her.  We
visited for about an hour with her.  We went home and then took some treats to
the neighbors and then planed on relaxing and watching Christmas shows.  Jeff
called and invited us to their place to play games.  They bought pizzas for
dinner and then we played Rook.  Mae and Jeff stood Gale and I.  Mae and Jeff
beat us badly.  Gale and my hands were terrible.  It was close to mid-night
when we got home and went to bed.</span></p>

Sacrament was especially inspirational.  We hurried to get things packed up and
came up to David and Shauna’s; Shauna had a nice dinner ready.  After dinner we
played a game of pigs that was quite fun and everyone, including Connor, could
play.  The doorbell rang and we all went to see Santa Claus who stopped by to
wish the children a Merry Christmas.  After the children went to bed we played
a game of Rook, which David and Mae lost to Shauna and I by they gave up.  We
then got Christmas out and I filled in my journal.</span></p>

was 6:30 when they woke the children.  David and Shauna had a Christmas sock
for us to open when the rest opened theirs.  There was a sausage for us, some
butter mints for Mae and some corn nuts for me in the sock.  The family had
lots of nice gifts, David and Mike families also gave us the book “Infinite
Atonement” besides the digital picture frame they gave us at the family
Christmas party.  I gave Mae two pair of pajamas for the 12<sup>th</sup> day of
Christmas and a couple of other gifts.  Mae gave me two white dress shirts, three
ties, a pair of pajamas, a Leathers man tool, a cheese set, and a card
shuffler.  We left David’s about 9 AM and went to Jeff &amp; Gale’s.  We had to
return home to get a few things we had forgotten.  We then went to Scott’s for
a couple of hours.  Scott and Kylan received a remote control plane that they
took to the school to fly and it flow for about 5 minutes when it crashed into
a tree that ripped the wing off.  Scott felt bad and Kylan cried.  They will
have to get a new wing for it.  We then came to Mike and Becky’s where they had
a nice dinner ready.  We opened gifts and then played games and visited for the
evening.</span></p>

the time I got up.  Mike and I fastened a gun safe to the top of a night
stand.  I made up the rules to the game 99.   Mae, David, Page, Becky and I
then played a game of 99 and Becky won.  Mae and I went downtown shopping.  We
bought a prescription, some tooth brushes, a blouse and a skirt for Mae for her
Birthday.  When we got home I finished making instruction sheets for the game
“99”.  We played games with Mike and Becky this evening.  We played a game of
Rook with Mae and Becky against Mike and I.  I had terrible hands and then Mike
passed and left me the bib.  Mae passed at 140.  After Mike passed me helping
cards I was considering my options and when Mae got after me for taking to long
to play I lost my temper and got upset.  I felt bad after but it just got to
me.  Mike and I did win the game but it wasn’t good of me to lose control.  Mae
and I went to the store for eggs and milk before we went to bed.  We were late
getting to bed.</span></p>

tell us that they were at the hospital for her to be admitted for surgery.  We
left after 10 AM and went to 800 N Orem exit and went to the station there and
filled up with natural gas.  We drove to David &amp; Shauna’s and stayed there
until 3:30 PM.  Shauna and David had a nice dinner prepared in honor of Mae’s
Birthday.  At 3:30 we left David’s and took the pickup and trailer home.  I
changed clothes and we went to Clark’s in Bountiful where the Hyer’s and the
Maharry’s had already arrived.  We visited and then at a wonderful dinner that
Kathleen prepared.  We then visited and played two games of “Catch Phrase”.  It
was about 9:30 when we left and came home.  All of our children either saw or
called Mae for her Birthday.  It has been a good day but I felt a little funny
as we came home realizing that financially we do not fit with our missionary
friends.</span></p>

Robin Steadman’s installing a doggie door and building a landing for the dog to
be up high enough to get in the door.  It took me three hours to complete the
job.  Mrs. Steadman paid me for the installation and the changing of the lock I
had done a few days back.  she also asked me about the air coming down her
fireplace chimney.  I think the problem is that the stack was not built high
enough.  I suggested that she try to get the gas co. to check it for her.  I
stopped and deposited the check and got some groceries for Mae on the way
home.  I took a nap after eating.  This evening we went to the Layton Mall and
attended the movie “The Work and the Glory III”.  We then went to the mall and
bought us a chicken sandwich and went back to the movie “The Nativity Story”. 
Both movies were wonderful and very worth while seeing.  When we got home I
caught my journal up to date.</span></p>

out to the shed when Bishop Smith came.  After a few minutes of visiting he
called us to work in the nursery.  This has been my most dreaded calling but we
accepted it.  We went out to Grantsville to see Sandi and Nick.  Sandi is
pretty sour from the operation.  We stayed there for a while and then came back
home.  Nick is doing a good job of taking care or her but we were glad to see
her and let her know that we cared.  We will go back out on Monday and Mae will
stay for a while.  I will be there part of the time but I also hope to finish
Randy and Judy’s sewer hookups.  After getting home I filled out this journal
entry.  We then showered and watched a western movie.  I sure enjoy being with

shortly after we got home from meetings.  Carroll attended Sacrament meeting
but I don’t think she felt very well.  Bob is very concerned about her.  Mae
and I went over to Gale’s mother this afternoon as Jeff and Gale were there. 
we gave Gale her birthday present and they gave Mae her birthday present.  We
then went over to Irven and Sandy’s.  Bob and Mark also came over.  Their son
Mark was also there as he doesn’t go back to collage until January 2<sup>nd</sup>. 
We visited, played games and ate junk food.  Bob went home to be with Carroll
quite early but the rest of us played games until after 10 PM.  my stomach was
upset from eating junk food so late in the evening.  I am going to have to
sleep in the recliner from the affect of eating so late and too much junk
food.  Good night and Happy New Year.</span></p>
