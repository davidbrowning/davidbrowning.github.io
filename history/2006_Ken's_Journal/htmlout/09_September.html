<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  Bob had made waffles for breakfast and brought us some down. 
After eating breakfast I worked on the computer transferring some files over to
Mae’s desk top so I can clear some of the files from my computer.  I had
trouble with copping some of the pictures.  We went over to Dr. Bennett’s and
each got a treatment.  We went from there to S. L. where we attended the movie
“Joseph Smith, Prophet of the Restoration”.  That is really a moving and Spiritual
movie.  After the movie we tried to find Uncle Van and Aunt Allison but today
is their P. day.  We came on home stopping in Bountiful for gas, a frozen
yogurt and to purchase the 7<sup>th</sup> volume in the series we are reading. 
After getting home and eating supper I cleaned our boat and put on the new
cover on the boat.  We went up stairs and played Canasta with Bob and Carroll. 
The game was close but Carroll and Mae beat us.  Mae and I then came downstairs
and we filled in our journals.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
1:30 AM with my stomach bothering me.  I ate too much popcorn while playing
Canasta.  Mae was awake because of her arms, legs and feet bothering her.  She
hadn’t been able to sleep at all and had gotten up to do something.  She went
back to bed and I slept in the recliner.  I woke about 7 AM and stayed up.  I
let Mae sleep.  I am still so impressed with the movie “Joseph Smith, Prophet
of the Restoration”.  As I read this morning from the Book of Mormon my
testimony was even more strengthened as to this great Ladder Day Work that is
going forth.  I sorrow daily that David and Jeff are so blinded that they won’t
study and search for them self.  My testimony is strengthened daily to the
truths of the Gospel.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early but let Mae sleep as she didn’t get to bed very early last night.  Bob
came down at 8 AM and said that he would soon have breakfast ready.  He made
biscuits and grave and they were sure good.  Mark and I visited for a while
about computers after eating.  Mae has been busy cleaning house all day.  I
worked on the computer trying to transfer our picture files from my computer to
Mae’s computer.  I worked over 5 hours and just got started.  Scott came over
to return Bob’s pickup after hauling some trash to the dumps.  He suggested
that we buy a “cross over cable” and set our two computers in to a net-work. 
That sounds good to me so we went to Staples and bought a 10’ cord.  Scott will
sow us how it is done tomorrow.  We watched a show on TV this evening.  I
finished my journal entry before 10 PM and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I attended
P.E.C. this morning in Steve’s place as he is out of town.  Mae and I
substituted in Junior Primary this morning.  The class went very well.  I had
some problem staying awake in Sacrament meeting today.  I think I did get short
nap this afternoon and then most of our family came this afternoon.  We
barbequed hamburgers and hot dogs and had lots of salads to go with them.  I
set up the projector and computer so that we could watch a movie this evening. 
We used two sheets of sheet rock with a sheet fastened over it for a screen. 
Mae had put some pictures together in a presentation and we watched that.  We
then put on the video “Parent Trap” and watched that.  It was after 11 PM
before we finished the movie.  Mike and his family stayed over tonight, the
rest went home.  It was after mid-night when I went to bed.  Mae was a little
later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30 AM and left for Pocatello about 6 AM.  I stopped and got gas at Wilson
Chevron and came on to Pocatello.  It was just after 8 AM when I got to
Rich’s.  After lunch I did take a short nap.  We did get a good start at
putting the decking on.  Elise was able to help us as today is a holiday.  I
went to work anyway.  After dinner I did call Mae and visited for a few minutes. 
I filled in my journal and then took a shower before going to bed.  I also did
some work on the computer cleaning up some of the files before I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
4:30 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  After breakfast we started work about 8
AM.  We quite for about 1 ½ hour for lunch and then I took a nap.  We worked
until after 6 PM. and was very tired when we quite.  We got quite a lot done on
the decking.  I called Mae a couple of times this evening.  My back is acing
this evening and I wish I could go to Randy for a treatment.  I did lie on the
Chee machine for a half hour and hung on the inversion table a couple of
times.  I hope I can sleep better tonight.  I did play a couple of games on the
computer before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, September 06, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept
better last night and woke feeling pretty good.  I really enjoyed reading from
the Book of Mormon in the account of Samuel the Lamanite.  As I read from the
Book of Mormon I really feel a gratitude for the Gospel of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints and the understanding of life that it gives to you.  It gives
you such a hope for life and the purposes for being here and a hope for the
future.  I think of my children daily and am concerned for them, especially for
David and Jeff.  I pray and think of them and wonder what I might do to help
them.  With out the Gospel knowledge, where is there a hope for the future and
purpose for being?  My children are in my prayers continually.  I got to work
about 8 AM and worked until 12:30 PM when we stopped for lunch.  Rich had to go
in to town to a Doctors appointment so I had him get a few items while he was in
town.  It was after 5 PM when they got home.  Rich bought a door bell button
and some wire so we ran a line to the basement door as that is where many
people go when they come to see about quilting.  We worked until 7 PM and were
able to finish the decking.  After dinner I lay on the inversion table.  Mae
called and we visited for a while.  She told me that Kristen is getting a
divorce and is returning home.  I guess Georgia called and talked to her for 3
hours.  Mae called a second time and we discussed the trip with Mike and Becky
as to flying or driving.  I showered and finished my journal entry and played a
couple of games before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, September 07, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today was
spent figuring steps and we put on the facing around the deck.  I had one of
the neighbors stop over and look at the deck.  He was really impressed.  He put
on a redwood deck about 20 years ago and he said he really needs to replace
it.  I didn’t offer.  We quite about 6 PM for dinner and then went back out and
put tools away.  We sweep up the area as it may rain tonight.  I am really
tired this evening and my third finger on my left hand is really sore as I hit
it with a hammer.  I was trying to hole a board, look at the end that Rich was
holding and drive a nail all at the same time.  Well I missed the nail and hit
my finger.  My back is really hurting tonight also.  I talked to Mae this
evening.  She is tending Kylan and Ashley so Scott and Mishelle can work on the
DVD of the Stake Pioneer Trek.  She said that she heard from Irven and Sandy,
Jennifer is expecting triplets.  That will be a challenge.  It’s now after 9 PM
so I had better shower and go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, September 08, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked on
steps to the deck all day.  Rich worked on quilting.  We finished the day by
getting the measurements for the main stairway.  Lois had dinner ready so I ate
and then left for home.  It was almost 9 PM when I got there.  Mae and I
watched a shoe “Guys and Dolls” before going to sleep.  It was kind of a dumb
show.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, September 09, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 6:30 AM and got ready to go boating.  We took Scott, Kylan and Ashley
boating at Willard Bay.  On the way I stopped and bought some screws for Rich’s
deck railing.  Mae had bought a large water tub for us to pull with the boat. 
It was a lot of fun and especially for small grandchildren, but it leaks air so
I will have to take it back.  Mae had made us a picnic lunch which we ate there
on the beach before loading up to go home.  After putting the boat away I
pulled up the tent trailer so I could hook up a charger to the batteries.  We
hope to use it after next week at Rich’s.  I also had to open up the tub and
let it dry.  Jeff and Gale came about 5 PM to have us tend little Ben.  He is a
good baby and we sure enjoyed him.  He got a little fussy but then went to
sleep.  I got tired after watching a show so I went to bed.  Mae stayed up
until Jeff and Gale came and then visited with them, so it was after mid-night
that she came to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When I got up
I couldn’t find my glasses.  After prayer I went out looking for them and
walked right over where I had worked with the tub and found them in the grass
where I dropped them.  It is amazing to me how our Father in Heaven is so
willing to help and bless us.  Bob prepared biscuits and gravy for breakfast
and invited us to eat with them.  It was a very good breakfast.  I caught up my
journal before we went to Church.  I got sleepy during Priesthood so I went
home and took a nap during Sunday school.  I was glad that I had because we had
a full house for Sacrament meeting and we had to set on the stand.  With the
nap I was able to stay awake during Sacrament meeting.  After church I did some
work on my computer to plan the step layout for the main stairs at Rich’s.  At
4 PM we had invited the Fallis’s for dinner but they were a little late.  Mae
had a nice dinner and we enjoyed visiting until about 7 PM.  I worked a little
longer on the plans and entered my journal entry before we went to bed about 10
PM.  Mae has my suit case about packed and I should be able to get away in
fairly good time tomorrow morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, September 11, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I left home
at 5:45 AM getting to Pocatello at 7:45 AM.  I worked all day on the steps.  I
called Mae at 10 AM.  She told me that I had forgot to take the power
transformer to the computer.  That means that I will have to be careful about
using the computer or I will run out of power.  I did have to use it to figure
the step measurements.  That really helps for things like that.  I worked until
almost 7 PM.  I bought a water distiller this evening for $1,559.00.  it is
like the one Rich and Lois has.  When we installed the decking there was a half
dozen boards that are discolored and does not match the others.  We didn’t
notice it when we laid them but Elise washed the deck over the weekend and they
show up quite bad.  I had Rich pull them up and replace them.  I called
Franklin Lumber about adjustments and they will contact the manufacture and let
me know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, September 12, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We worked all
day on the steps.  Franklin Lumber called and said that the manufacture will
replace any discoloration if we will bring them back to them.  I had trouble
getting the two stair jacks exactly even so after dinner this evening I went
back out and build a jig to install the treads with.  Mae called me this
evening to ask about the operation of our DVD &amp; VCR player.  She is tending
David &amp; Shauna’s children while they go out to eat with Mike and Becky for
David’s Birthday.  Mae couldn’t get the VCR to play the tape for the children. 
Craig and Carla are interested in having me install a heat system in their new
home.  I told Carla that I would have to check the figures as what I had given
them was a rough estimate.  I will get back with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked
again all day on the stairs.  It is taking longer than I figured to get them
in.  Rich took the boards back for exchange and got a few more items.  He had
to order three more pieces of fascia.  I am concerned about finishing the job
this week as I hoped I might.  We quite about 7 PM for dinner and then went
back out to put tools away.  Rich also showed me how he cleans the distiller
and changes the filter.  I tried to call Mae this evening but she didn’t answer
her phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Another day
on the stairs and we still have some caps to put on the two small sets of
steps.  I was going to work late to complete them but it started raining so we
put away my tools.  The rain quite but we just cleaned up any way.  I did cut
spacers for a jig for the railing.  At Rich’s request I will space the bars 4
½” apart.  I believe that code calls for 3 to 3 ½” but I will do what they
want.  It was after 8:30 PM when I quite.  Lois had some fresh peaches ready
when I came in so I ate some with yogurt over them.  I then went to my room and
filled out my journal entry.  I will now take my shower and get ready for bed. 
I hope I get to bed by 10:30 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It started
raining about the time we went to work.  We decided to move the tools into the
garage to work.  I got wet so had to change clothes.  I got some things done
but shortly after lunch decided to quite for the day.  I got everything put
away and packed to go home when it quite raining.  I came home anyway.  It rain
off and on and it rained hard from Brigham City on and through out the
evening.  Mae and I went out to eat at the Chinese restraint in Layton and then
watched a video in bed.  It is sure good to be home with my beautiful wife.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, September 16, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We enjoyed
sleeping in and cuddling this morning.   I prepared breakfast of egg omelet
along with fresh peaches with yogurt.  After helping Mae make the bed, I got on
my computer and typed the last week’s journal entries.  I had just written them
on a piece of paper because of the limited use of my computer this week.  I
then removed the propane tanks from the travel trailer and went to the gas
station.  J.P. Service has all three gases so I was able to fill the pickup
with regular gas, natural gas and fill the propane tanks.  My bill came to over
one hundred dollars.  I then came home and hooked up the pickup to the trailer,
replaced the propane tanks and put the covers over the batteries on the
trailer.  I had removed them in order to recharge the batteries last week. I
next started to get fishing equipment ready for next week’s trip.  I spent most
of the time sorting out fishing poles.  With those I had and all of Terry’s
that Sandi gave me, I have more than I know what to do with.  We met Jeff and
Gale at Gale’s mothers place and went with them to Heber City where we met
Sandi, Nick, Chelci and Steve.  We went on the Heber Creeper Train ride.  There
was a drama put on before and during the trip and it finished at the station
when we returned.  We also were served pizza on the train.  It made an
interesting evening but I think once is enough, although the rest seem to enjoy
it.  I guess it just isn’t my cup of tea.  I had Jeff stop at Coralline’s
Frozen Yogurt where I bought us a yogurt.  Mae didn’t eat very much of hers and
gave the rest to me.  I had bought a large one for me so with hers I ate too
much.  I came back to haunt me as I had to sleep in the recliner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was able to
go back to bed about 4 AM so Mae let me sleep until I woke at 8 AM.  We had
breakfast and I showered and got ready for church.  Meetings went well although
I got sleepy during Sunday school.  Brother and Sister Falis were the speakers
today.  They did a very good job with their assignment.  They had invited the
Yang’s to attend with them and they did come.  The Yang’s are our neighbors to
the East of us and the Falis’s live East of them.  After church we went up to
David and Shauna’s for dinner.  Mike’s family, Scott’s family and Jeff’s family
also came.  Mae and I left so I could go Home Teaching.  Bob and I went
visiting to the Johnston’s and to the Falis’s and had an enjoyable visit with
each.  We were late getting home.  Mae was on the internet when I got home.  I
filled in my journal before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 for the bathroom and read my scriptures.  We were about to start some
breakfast when Bob came down and invited us to eat biscuits and gravy with
them.  Of course we couldn’t refuse so we were there for a while.  We both
worked getting things ready to go camping.  Randy had called so I called him
back.  He hopes to have the cabin ready by this weekend.  Rich called and I
told him that I might be a couple of weeks before I could get back.  it was
after 2 PM when we left the house and we stopped at the store for a few items. 
We then went over to Layton and picked up some of Jeff and Gale’s items as they
will be coming to Zion’s National Park on Thursday evening.  We traveled to
Pason where we stopped at a farm stand and purchased some corn and tomatoes. 
It was almost 6PM when we got to the camp ground.  The caretaker told us that
they will be closing the campground but we could stay two nights.  Mike, Becky,
Tayler, Mattie and Jessie soon got here.  We Dutch oven cooked chicken,
potatoes, carrots and onions.  We had time to eat and they had to go back
home.  We sure enjoyed having them come.  We cleaned up the dishes and put some
things away in the trailer.  For some reason the furnace won’t run off the
batteries so we will have to run the generator through the night.  I am
concerned that the power converter may have gone bad.  We stayed up and watched
the movie “Annie” on DVD by playing it on our computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had to fill
the generator several times during the night.  Mae didn’t sleep very well last
night.  I am glad that the camp ground is almost completely deserted or we
could not have run the generator through the night.  We did not get going very
early because of not sleeping very well last night.  It was about noon when we
went down to the lake and went fishing.  We hadn’t been out very long when Mae
had a bite and then she caught a nice rainbow trout.  We continued with our
luck until we had caught 7 fish.  The wind then came up and it was work trying
to keep the boat where we wanted to fish.  We finally rowed over to the west
side of the lake and quite.  We had to carry the boat to the truck.  When we
got back to the trailer the caretaker came by and said they were closing the
campground tomorrow but that we were welcome to stay longer.  The reason for
closing is because there is another storm coming tonight.  We considered the
possibility of getting a heavy snow storm and decided to pack up and get down
off the mountain.  We drove to Fillmore and stayed at the Apple motel.  We were
able to shower and use the swimming pool.  It was after mid-night when we went
to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 8 AM and while I used the bathroom and read my scriptures, Mae went to
the continental breakfast area and soon came back with waffles and yogurt.  We
never left the motel until 11 AM.  We then filled the pickup with natural gas
and went down town and bought some things for the trailer.  We traveled to
Beaver where we stopped at a Wendy’s for lunch.  We went to Cedar City where we
filled up with natural gas again.  There was a C.A.L. Ranch near by so we
stopped there and looked for more items for the trailer.  We them traveled on to
Springdale where we stayed in the R.V. Camp.  We visited with some of the
neighbor campers while we were putting up our tent trailer.  We are still
having some electrical problems although most of the trailer is working ok.  We
ate dinner and did some with the trailer.  I filled in my journal and then we
played three game of dominoes of which Mae won two of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did not
get out of bed until quite late.  We then prepared breakfast (lunch) of eggs,
hash browns and fish.  We then drove to St. George to see Aunt Joy.  She was
not there so we just left a note.  We next went shopping for items we need to
do some repairs to the tent trailer.  We shopped at Home Depot and Wal-Mart. 
We were tired when we finished and went back to our trailer.  Time has sure
gone by fast today.  Mae prepared dinner while I started the repairs.  I first
replaced the G.F.I. outlet as the original one checked out as faulty.  I made
some modifications to a 24” florescent light fixture so that it will hang above
the table.  We also assembled the baby crib for little Benjamin so that it is
ready when Jeff and Gale gets here.  Gale called about 8 PM and said that they
were just leaving.  They will be about six hours getting here so should arrive
about 2 AM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, September 22, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Jeff and Gale
must have arrived somewhere around 2 AM.  We had their bed ready so they just
slid in and went to bed.  About 4 AM I woke realizing that it was getting cold
and the furnace was trying to turn on but was only blowing cold air.  I
realized that the one propane tank must have ran out, so I went out and
switched the valves to the second tank.  The furnace soon started and I went
back to bed.  It is now 9:20 AM and Jeff and Gale are still trying to sleep. 
As I write this entry, little Benjamin was asleep and so beautiful, but the
neighbors are packing up and the noise has awakened him.  It is so enjoyable to
watch him.  We had a late breakfast and then got ready to got into the park. 
We road the shuttle to the end of the road and hiked up river side trail.  I
carried Benjamin in the breast pack up the trail and on the way back Jeff
carried him.  It was a good hike and we all enjoyed it.  It was after 6 PM when
we got back to camp.  We cooked Dutch oven chicken and it turned out very
good.  We had a enjoyable evening visiting and playing games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Jeff and Gail
got up early and went into the Park.  They hiked up Angle Landing, which is
quite a hike.  We kept little Benjamin with us.  He slept in giving us time to
take our showers.  He woke quite happy but when we tried to give him a bottle
he objected.  He would not take the bottle no matter how hard we tried.  I
finally left Mae with him and I went to La Verkin and got a few items we needed. 
I found a service station that will refill propane bottles here in Springdale. 
Jeff and Gail were back when I got back.  I hung a towel rack, dumped and
cleaned the holding tank, and switched the propane tanks.  We ate a sandwich,
then walked over to catch the shuttle to go into Zions.  We enjoyed riding the
shuttle and we went on the trail leading to the weeping rock.  It was fairly
steep, but only a short hike.  It was beautiful as are all the sights in
Zions.  We got home about 7 pm, fixed supper of spagitti, garlic bread, tossed
salad and leftovers and afterwards Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played Rook.  Gail and
I were partners and beat Mae and Jeff.  Gail went to bed after that game and
Jeff, Mae and I played Rummy.  Mae won that game and by then it was nearly
midnight, so decided we would play a game of 7’s.  It has been a great day. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8 AM so we had to hurry to get to church.  Jeff wouldn’t go with us and
that sure hurts.  I don’t think that they even think about the hurt that they
cause the rest of the family.  Gale and Benjamin went with us but Gale had to
keep Benjamin in the mother’s room most of the time.  We sure enjoyed the
spirit that was in the meeting.  We almost decided to move down here.  After
getting back to the trailer we fixed lunch and then played a game of Rook. 
Gale was my partner so Mae and Jeff were partners.  Jeff and Mae beat us.  Jeff
&amp; Gale soon left for home.  We have sure enjoyed having them here with us. 
Mae and I decided to go into the park and check on the horse rides.  Mae was
cleaning up the trailer and I finally had to get after her to go.  She didn’t
think we had to hurry but did.  We got to the main lodge and went to the corral
area just in time to catch Ryan, Lacy’s husband, who runs the pack trips here. 
Lacy is Pete and Keela Mangum’s daughter.  He was just hurrying to leave as he
had to get to town early this evening.  He told us to be there tomorrow at 8 AM
and we could take the trip.  We came back and went into town where we bought a
small pack to take water with us tomorrow.  We ate dinner, made some calls and
set around the camp fire and drank a cup of Postum before going to bed.  We
were looking on our day planner and realized that we have an appointment with
Jennie Porter on Tuesday morning.  We had to call her and change that
appointment.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM so we could be at the main lodge by 8 AM.  Ryan let us ride the horse back
trip at no charge, because we are relatives.  It was about a 3 ½ hour trip
which gave us a view of many beautiful areas including the Three Patriarch. 
Our guide has the nick of Ten Bears.  We really enjoyed the guide and the trip
but we were tired when we returned.  Mae was quite sour through the legs.  We
came back to the camp and took a nap.  Ten Bears had suggested that the best
steak house in town was the Pit and Spur, so we went there.  The meal was quite
expensive but we really enjoyed it.  Mae didn’t have the steak as she is not a
steak lover.  As we ate we discussed our concerns over Jeff and David.  Neither
of us knows what we should or can do to help them with their negative attitudes
about the church.  We came back to the trailer and added ice to the coolers. 
We set and enjoyed the landscape and read another chapter of our book.  It
cooled off so we came in and played a game of Rummy, which I won tonight.  I
filled out my journal while Mae took a shower.  We soon went to bed as we have
to leave in the morning.  Time has gone by fast and we have had a good time but
I think we are ready to return home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and spent most of the night in the recliner.  Most
of the problem was eating so much of that steak dinner.  I was also depressed
over some of my incapability’s and thinking of David and Jeff’s attitudes about
the Church.  Also the wind blow quite hard all night.  We got up before 7 AM
and started packing.  Mae prepared breakfast and we got the tent trailer
cleaned up, the pickup packed and the tent trailer folded down.  It was about
11 AM when we left the camp grounds.  We stopped at Fort Cove and went through
the tour there.  that took some time I guess we really didn’t have but it was
very interesting. We stopped in Cedar City for natural gas, and at Fillmore,
and at Orem. Bob called and said that the Freeway traffic from Bountiful on was
very slow so we took some alternates routs to get home.  It was 7 PM when we
got home so Mae jumped out and hurried to change clothes and ran to her R.S.
meeting.  I parked the trailer in the back and then ended up visiting with Bob
and Mark.  Bob gave me some salads for super and I visited until Mae got back
from her meeting.  We unloaded the pickup and I entered this journal entry
while Mae put away some things.  Mae gave me a hair cut and I took a shower
before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
read my scriptures, ate breakfast, put some things away that we had used for
our trip and then went with Randy to S.L. where we picked up the water tank and
pump for Randy’s cabin.  We drove to the cabin and surveyed the job sight. 
Randy has done a remarkable job digging the hole for the tank.  I figured
materials needed to do the job.  Steve Regan’s did not load all the material that
we had purchased.  The left the pressure tank out.  I called and they found it
after we left.  I found some food to prepare for dinner.  After Randy &amp; I
had eaten I drove home, getting there at mid-night.  Mae, Shauna and Gale went
to Park City shopping.  They had a good time.  Becky was going to go with them
but David got sick.  Mishelle also had something come up where she couldn’t
make it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, September 28, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 6:15 AM.  Mae helped me get ready to go back up to Randy’s cabin.  Bob
went with me today.  I picked up Materials at Durk’s plumbing, Steve Ragan’s,
Home Depot and Larry Peterson for Randy and Judy Porter’s cabin.  It was after
5 PM when Bob and I got to Randy’s cabin.  Randy had been working all day on
enlarging the hole for the water tank.  I helped him remove some rocks from the
hole.  We had a rock that was sticking up that would have pushed on the tank so
I started to remove it.  It just kept growing so Randy and I both worked on
it.  We finally had to did under it and tip it into the hole and just burry it. 
Bob prepared us a nice dinner of hamburger and noodles.  After dinner I did
some paper work and entered my journal for today.  It was after 10 PM before I
went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, September 29, 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM.  Bob fixed breakfast of fish, pan cakes and potato patties.  We worked all
morning getting the tank down into the hole.  It really worked out ok but was
quite a job.  Judy came just as we got the tank in.  We were given the wrong
size of a bulkhead and so had to go into Evanston to get different parts. 
While Bob and I went for the parts Randy started filling the dirt around the
tank.  The cover had been left off the tank until Judy saw that dust was going
into the tank.  She had Randy put the lid on but when I got back I had to get
inside of the tank and clean it out.  We got the pipes connected enough to
start filling the tank with water.  We also got the pipes for some additional
drain lines to be installed to the sewer.  We cleaned up and Bob and I left for
home about 7 PM.  We stopped in Evanston and got something to eat.  I then
stopped to fill up the truck with fuel.  Mae called just as I pulled in so with
out thinking I got out of the truck with out removing the keys.  Bob then got
out of the truck to go inside the station and get a drink.  When I went to open
the door to the truck it was locked.  Somehow the truck doors lock
automatically.  We had to call the police and an officer came over and was able
to unlock the truck.  That cost us an hour’s time.  It was almost 10 PM when we
got home.  I was really tired and we soon went to bed.  Mae had gone flying
with Noland in his ultralite plane this afternoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8 AM.  We had to finish eating our breakfast while we watched the start
of General Conference.  Before conference ended we had to leave to go to
American Fork to watch David play in the final football game of the season. 
David is playing on the Junior team.  The other team really beet them but in
the last quarter American Fork was able to get on the score board with 8
points.  We had to listen to the last of conference as we drove home.  This
evening I met with Scott and we attended the General Priesthood session.  After
it ended we went out to eat at Tony Romas.  Jeff also met us there and just
ordered some French fries and visited with us.  It was good to be with my boys
but I am very concerned with Jeff’s attitude about the Church.  Mae had figured
the bank statement while I was gone but there is still an error in it that we
will have to finish later.  I got a call from Randy and he said that there is a
leak in the water tank.  That is not good news.</span></p>
