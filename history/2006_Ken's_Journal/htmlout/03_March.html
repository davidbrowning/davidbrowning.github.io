<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
2:30 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep thinking about the DVD we watched
yesterday.  I don’t know what should or can be done.  I fear that there isn’t
anything that can stop the evil that is upon the world today.  Yet we are told
that fear is of the devil.  I worked on the cabin plans for a while today.  At
3:30 PM I watched a show on TV.  Mae went out to lunch with Jackie today.  This
evening she went to a Institute of Religion program with Gail and her Mother. 
I installed my fishing rod holders in my pickup and fishing tent this evening. 
I then came in and got me something to eat and turned the TV on and watched
“Mighty Joe Young” even though I have seen it before.  Mae got home just before
9 PM.  I made my journal entry and worked on cabin plans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 5 AM and instead of going back to bed for fear of waking Mae, I laid down
in the recliner.  We got up at 7:30 AM in order to make a doctors appointment
at 9 AM.  Dr. Jensen went over the test results and confirmed that I do have a hieratical
hernia.  He said there doesn’t show any tissue changing at this time but wants
to watch for that especially because that can turn cancerous.  He had me
schedule another upper scope for three months with his desk.  I talked with
Maggie Klaas and will go to their place at 1 PM to give them an estimate on
some repairs.  After checking Klaas’s needs I spent a couple of hours getting
prices on materials.  I had time to do some drawing on the bathroom Klaas wants
me to put in.  Mae fixed us some dinner and then we left for Salt Lake to
attend a concert by the Tabernacle Choir.  Bryce and Deanna met us at the
conference center and we enjoyed the concert together.  Afterwards we invited
them to stay the night with us.  It was after 10 PM when we got home and we
stayed up until after mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We stayed up
until after mid-night visiting with Bryce and Deanna.  We sang Happy Birthday
to Deanna about 12:05 AM.  We slept well and got up shortly before 8 AM.  Mae
prepared a very nice breakfast of fish, hash browns, eggs and muffins.  We
visited while eating and then cleared up the table.  Mae and I showed Bryce
some of our presentations and explained how the program worked.  I loaded some
of our picture files onto the disk of the presentations that I thought might
help them on their mission.  Chad came and got Bryce and they went hiking. 
Deanna packed up their belongings and I think she went to Shanna’s.   I worked
on the estimate for Klaas’s.  Mae and I ate some lunch.  At 4:15 PM we left for
Mike’s where we had dinner with them.  Becky had prepared a nice meal.  After
eating Mike, David, Tayler, Mae and I went to a basket ball game where Tayler
played.  Her team won the game but it was very close.  When we went back to
Mike and Becky’s home Mike, Becky, Mae and I played two games of Rook.  Mike
&amp; Becky beat Mae and I both games.  Before leaving to come home we got
talking.  Mike said he had a talk with Sandi and had told her that she needed
to decide what she wanted to do with her life and not have everyone else decide
for her.  I don’t know if it will help her or not.  I know that Mae was very
disturbed by what Mike said and what is happening with our family.  I am also
very concerned.  We thought that we had been good parents and had taught our
family well.  But while we were on our mission things seemed to start falling
apart.  Terry’s death, Sandi’s engagement is a concern, David and Jeff both
struggling with their testimony, Shellie is struggling with her calling and I
am not sure about what we should do.  Mae was very upset as we came home.  When
we left for our mission call I felt that my family was really doing well but
now I wonder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
get to sleep until almost 4 AM worrying about our children.  I woke shortly
after that and couldn’t get back to sleep because of the same reason.  At 7:45
AM I woke Mae and Bob called right after that and said he would have biscuits
&amp; gravy ready in 30 minutes.  We ate with them and then had to hurry to get
ready to go to the Salt Lake Temple.  We stopped on the way and got Mae’s
cell-phone from Gail.  We got to the Temple in plenty of time and went through
the 11:45 AM session with Chelci.  We enjoyed being in the Temple with Chelci
and Steve.  We went out to eat at the Olive Garden with Sandi, Chelci, Steve,
Steve’s Mother, three brothers and a sister-in-law.  It was after 4:30 PM
before we got home.  I worked on the bid and plans for Maggie Klaas.  I called
Maggie and gave her the prices.  She wants me to put the railing in next
Wednesday and she will wait for time to evaluate her mother’s condition.  We
did go to bed before 10 PM tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7:45 AM and with it being Fast Sunday we had a little extra time.  We got
on the internet and I wrote a letter to Roger Silvia in reply to his e-mail
asking for more help.  It is hard to turn these people down but I just don’t
know if we should continue sending them money.  I filled out our donations for
this month.  We pay our tithing, fast offerings, missionary fund, and into the
perpetual education fund but I don’t know if we should send money to those need
it in the Philippines.   If so where does it end?  We attended our meetings and
enjoyed the spirit there.  I was a little concerned at the number of children
that wanted to bear testimony and were to young to know except to giggle and
have some one tell them what to say.  Bob &amp; Carroll had us eat dinner with
them.  Bob is such a good cook and his food is so good.  Mae came down stairs
and called her Aunt Joy.  I visited a while then came down thinking I would
take a short nap before we went over to Scott &amp; Mishelle’s.  Mae was still
on the phone so I got on the computer and started this journal.  I looked at
the clock and realized it was 4:45 PM and we needed to be at Scott’s at 5 PM. 
I don’t know where the time went.  Mishelle had prepared a nice meal and we
enjoyed being with them.  They had a meeting to attend at 7 PM so we tended
their children.  We played games, I took a nap and we watched a Star War show. 
I really didn’t make much since of the show and I do not understand why anyone
would make such hideous creatures act like humans.  I think our world is sick. 
Scott and Mishelle’s meeting was a lot longer than they thought it would be.  When
they got home we had to leave.  It was 10:30 PM before we got home.  While I
was making this entry Mae popped corn and prepared some things for me for
tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and was down to Randy’s shortly after 5 AM.  We went up to Strawberry ice
fishing.  We fished until after 2 PM and moved areas several times.  Randy did
catch one fish just before we packed up and came home.  It was 5:45 PM when I
got home.  Mae had Robin Walker and her family over for diner and F.H.E.  Mae
saved a plate for me.  After a lesson we played Clue, Robin won.  I got sun
burn while fishing.  I didn’t expect it as it was heavily clouded all day.  We
went to bed early tonight.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and used the bathroom but didn’t read my scriptures as the batteries in my palm
pilot were very low.  I was still very tired so lay back down with Mae.  After
breakfast I put the snowmobiles and trailer in the back.  I cleaned up my
fishing equipment and put the in the sled and put it away in the shed.  I
hooked up the tool trailer and prepared to go do a small job for Clair Redding
in Farmington.  I typed a letter to Roger Sylvia concerning the money he keeps
borrowing from us.  I hope he will learn something from it.  One of my biggest
concerns is that not once has he acknowledged receiving the money or expressed
thanks for it.  I stopped at Durk’s Plumbing and bought a garbage disposal and
then went to Redding’s and installed it.  I then went to Home Depot and bought
the material for Klaas’s job.  They didn’t have all the material at the Layton
store.  David called me as I drove home.  He had some questions about
remodeling their basement.  He also wanted to find some time when we could get
together with them.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  Brother Mitchell
called me last night and said that he would not be able to be home to night for
our regular Home Teaching visit.  Also after I went to bed last night Mae got
the message that I wouldn’t be having a meeting tonight.  Therefore after
dinner I called Brother and Sister Mitchell to see if we could come over this
evening Home Teaching.  They said that would work with them so Bob and I went
over and had a nice visit with them.  Mae and I Drove over to the Riverdale
Home Depot this evening and bought the rest of the parts I need for the Klaas
job.  Mae and I read from our book for a while.  Mark came down with a
suggested list of plants for the garden.  I informed him that if I start the
house in Wyoming I would not be here to help with the garden.  It was after 10
PM before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 AM and left for work at 7:40 AM.  I worked at Klaas’s installing railing
between their dinning area and the family room.  I had it almost completed when
Maggie came home.  She wants me to put new railing going up from the living
room to the upstairs.  It was 5:30 PM when I got home.  I showered and fixed
myself some dinner and then Bob and I went Home Teaching to Brother and Sister
Johnston and to the Jackson’s.  Mae went with Gail and her mother to a
Institute class this evening.  She didn’t get home until 9:30 PM.  I worked on
the computer to gather income tax information.  It was after 10:30 PM before we
started to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
4:30 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  It snowed last night and is snowing
hard this morning.  I tried to decide what to do with going to work.  I can’t
cut wood out in this weather but decided to get the stain and finish and do
what I can with out building the additional railing.  I went out to go to work
but it was storming so hard I just came back into the house.  I did use Bob’s
snow blower and clean the driveway and front walks.  The weather cleared some
by 11 AM so I went to work at Klaas’s.  It took me quite a while to cut the
trim for the post base.  I started to stain the railing and realized that I
would be very late if I did it my self.  I called Bob and he came over and
helped me.  it was 7:30 PM when I got home and Mae had her study group at our
house so I just got the income tax information and took it over to Mr.
Sorenson.  After eating dinner, I did some book work on the computer and then
filled in my journal.  We soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob went with
me this morning to Klaas’s and we put the first coat of Urethane on the
railing.  With Bob’s help it took us 2 ½ hours.  Mae prepared breakfast shortly
after I got home.  I took a nap and then put up a shelf above the washer and
dryer.  I next installed an electrical plug strip at the end of the cabinets. 
I also repaired the dish washer while I had it out to run the electric line. 
Roy and Shellie came just as I was finishing.  Mae had a nice dinner ready
shortly after they came.  They gave Mae and I a beautiful book of pictures of
the activity’s he have enjoyed with our family during the past year.  Also for
my Birthday they gave me picture box on fishing.  It is really cute.  I called
and invited Jef and Gail over.  We played a game of “Marbles”.  It was
interesting that Jeff and Gail ended up winning when it looked for a long time
that Mom and I were way ahead and Jeff and Gail in last place.  After Jeff and
Gail left we played a game of “Knock”, Roy was the winner of that game.  Mae then
gave me a hair cut before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It has been a
wonderful day but it is now 10:25 PM and we are completely beet and ready for
some rest.   Mae got up just before 7 AM and I woke with the alarm at 7 AM.  Mae
and I prepared breakfast.  Roy and Shellie got up and got ready for breakfast. 
After breakfast we had to leave as Chelci asked if I would be a witness.  Roy
and Shellie came a little later.  The Temple ceremony was very beautiful and I
enjoyed the advice that was given them.  We had all our family except Jeff,
David &amp; Shauna.  It was sad to think of them not being there.  Pictures
were taken after the session in front of the Temple.  Jeff &amp; Gail, Roy
&amp; Shellie and Mae &amp; I went out to eat at the Lion’s House.  We got
there just at dinner time so we had to wait for a little while.  We drove out
to Stansbury where Jeff, Gail, Roy and I laid back in the seats and took a
nap.  Shellie &amp; Mae went to Tooele where they bought a card and a bow for
the present that Roy and Shellie gave.  Family pictures were taken at 4:30 PM
and then at 5 PM they held a special Ring Ceremony.  Following that was the
Wedding Reception.  The line held for about a hour and then they just visited
with people as they came.  Chelci sang a song especially dedicated to Steve. 
The D.J. but on some music and opened it to dancing.  Mae and I enjoyed
dancing.  We also enjoyed visiting with some of our old friends from out there. 
at 8:30 PM the reception broke up and the Newly Weds left for the Honeymoon, as
they drove away Sandi broke down and cried.  We stayed and helped load up the
gifts before leaving for home.  It was almost 9:30 PM when we got home very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept most
of the night in the chair.  We slept in so had to hurry to be ready in time for
Church.  Priesthood and Sacrament meeting were very good but I slept through
most of Sunday school.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner.  We got word
from Bryce and Deanna this morning that Doug and Karen had been involved in an
automobile accident in which both Doug and Karen were hospitalized.  After
dinner I called and talked to Sandy and got better information.  Time went by
fast and before long it was time for us to go over to Scott and Mishelle’s to
tend their children while they went to a meeting.  On the way over there,
Shellie called to let us know that they had arrived at Page ok.  They were
going to go on home tonight.  We were at Scott’s until after 9 PM.  Mae spent
the evening playing with the children.  I capsulated our Mannatech nurturance’s
and finished just before Scott and Mishelle got home.  When we got home I
filled in my journal.  Mae fixed us some cottage cheese, peaches and toast to
eat before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It snowed
last night so we changed our plans and didn’t go to Wyoming.  We slept in and
then I helped Bob clean sidewalks and driveways for both our house and
Sherrie’s.  We ate breakfast at 11 AM.  I worked on the computer figuring our
statements.  I was all afternoon working on them.  Carroll made some apple cake
using raw cane sugar so I will try a piece of it and see what it does to me. 
this evening we watched a couple of talks from General Conference and then
watched the movie “Roman Holiday”.  Sister Maggie Klaas called and she will be
bringing her mother home this weekend so she needs some handrails installed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went to the Temple.  On the way home we stopped and got some parts for Klaas’s
handrails.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Mae prepared lunch after we
got home.  I got on the computer and got our credit report.  It is in good
shape.  I sanded a hand rail and stained it.  I also worked on printing a
picture of me with the salmon I caught in Alaska.  Mae used it to put in the
picture box Shellie and Roy gave me for my Birthday.  Mae did quite a bit of
packing for us to go to Mike &amp; Becky’s Thursday morning and then down to
Roy and Shellie’s on Monday.  This evening Mae went to a Relief Society
Birthday Party and I went to a High Priest Group leadership meeting.  We both
got home about the same time.  We went over to the grocery store for some soup
Mae needed for a casserole she is making.  I finished the hand rail this
evening and will mount it at Klaas’s tomorrow.  I filed out my journal and we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When we got
up it had snowed hard during the night.  After breakfast Mae went over to
Georgia’s and spent the day with her.  Last night Georgia had been operated on
for cists and had her ovaries removed.  I went over to Klaas’s and installed
two handrails for them.  As I was going to Klaas’s I was going to get on the
freeway.  The weather has warming up and the roads were wet but not slippery. 
As I approached the entrance in Clearfield I had the feeling that I shouldn’t
get on the freeway.  I stayed on the main street and went to Layton that way. 
As I got to The Home Depot I looked towards the freeway and the traffic was
backed up and stopped.  When I came out of the store the traffic was still
stopped and as I started towards Kaysville I looked at the freeway and it was
just starting to move.  I thought it was neat that Our Father In Heaven would
inspire me over something as small as that!  I was about 2 hours at Klaas’s.  When
I came home I started on the computer but Bob asked me to check Sherrie’s to
check her kitchen stove.  That took two hours and found that the main control
panel would have to be replaced and that would cost about $250 for the part.  I
worked on the computer and took a ½ hr nap.  When Mae came home we ate and
packed to go to Mike &amp; Becky’s.  We will take all our things so that we can
go from Mike’s and go to Shellie’s.  Mae went to am interview with the Bishop. 
He asked her to be a Substitute Gospel Teacher.  It was 8:20 PM before we left
for Mike’s.  We finished reading volume 2 of the Prelude to Glory and started
volume 3 as we drove.  After getting there Mae and I helped where we could.  I
helped Becky prepare some hamburger for the freezer.  It was almost 11 PM
before we got to bed.  Mae went to bed while I was writing this entry so I
played a couple of games before I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until after 7 AM.  Mike and Becky was a while before they got away.  Then they
had to come back because Mike forgot to download the Reno area map into his
unit.  I figured what materials I would need to put outlets and a light in the
garage and called Mike to see if he wanted me to do it.  I also figured material
for some shelves for Tayler.  Mae spent time with the little girls in reading
stories, going for walks and playing.  I mailed a letter and a CD with the
plans of the cabin to Tracy Larson who is associated with Heber Valley Log
Works.  I ask him if he could help me with the design of the vaulted ceiling. 
I took it to the post office along with mailing a package for Samantha and
mailed the first volume of the “Prelude to Glory” to Jeff.  After dinner we
took David to a basket ball game.  David’s team won by more than 20 points.  Mattie
fell asleep on the way home so we just carried her upstairs and put her in
bed.  David and I made some refreshments while Mae read a story to Jessica and
then put her to bed.  David, Taylor, Mae and I them played Rummy.  David was
ahead but he left to sleep over at a friend’s home.  Mae was ahead but I went
out at the same time as going over 500 points, so that made me the winner.  We
soon went to bed after that.</span></p>

until 7 AM and I slept in until 7:30 AM.  We worked together and made
breakfast.  I worked on my plans and then just as I had the footing layer about
finished I erased the complete layer by mistake.  David and I ran electrical
outlets to Mikes work bench and one outside.  We also installed a shop light
over the workbench.  After dinner this evening David, Mae and I went over to
The Home Depot for some electrical wire staples and then on the way home we
stopped for some frozen yogurt.  Mae is spending individual time with each child. 
That is the reason we just took David with us this evening.  After getting home
Mae put the little girls to bed.  David, Taylor, Mae and I played games.  It
was 11:30 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was a
little after 7 when we got up this morning.  Mae was busy with tending the
children.  She did have David and Tayler help her with dishes and vacuuming.  I
spent most of the day working on cabin plans.  While I worked on the computer
we also watched a cute show on TV.  The story was taken from a real story of a
couple who uses a drug for her to get pregnant and she gives birth to six
babies.  Mae took Tayler shopping to Wal-Mart but the one that I gave her
directions to has been relocated.  David gave us information as to where it was
now located but I did not understand his directions so that got Mae more
confused.  She finally ask for directions and found it but then she couldn’t
find her way home.  It made an interesting afternoon for her.  This evening we
started to watch a movie on DVD but turned it off and played games with David. 
I took Tayler to a friend at 7 PM for a Birthday Party and picked her up at 10
PM.  She seemed to have had a good time.  It was going on 11 PM before we got
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David and I
got up early and went to Stake Priesthood meeting at 7:15 AM.  It had snowed
heavy during the night and was still snowing this morning.  They had asked a
Brother Brown to be the main speaker.  He has been a counselor in the Provo
Temple Presidency, a member of the Quorum of Seventies and assigned to the
Orient, a Mission President in Japan, a Stake President and a Bishop.  He spoke
about the blessings of the Temple and did a very good job.  I helped Mae
prepare breakfast and then got time for a few minutes nap before we went to
Church.  Bishop Residori, the previous Bishop, ask me about serving a mission
in the Philippines.  I was a while after meetings visiting with him.  We had a
nice dinner and after watched the movies “Johnny Lingo” and Finding Faith in
Christ”.  I got a good chance to visit with David and Tayler about my testimony
of the Church.  This evening we had a light super.  I talked with Steven Hulet,
Mark’s son, about some work he would like me to do for him.  I agreed to call
him when I get back from Arizona and the trip to Idaho Falls to finish the
sheep rock in Chad Porters basement.  David, Mae and I played “Knock” for a
while before we went to bed.  Mae won a game and David won a game but I lost
both times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4:30 AM and were ready to leave before 6 AM but Mae wanted to wait until David
got up before leaving.  We went as fare as Fillmore where we stopped for a few
groceries and treats.  We had snowy weather and some slippery roads until just
before Fillmore but the roads were ok from there on.  We also filled up with
gas.  We next stopped in Cedar City and visited with Dale Corry from Middleton
Timber Inc. about log homes.  He gave me several ideas and I was very impressed
with their system.  We stopped in St. George for a break and bought a Sub-Way
sandwich.  As we crossed the Arizona State line there was a semi that had
jack-knifed and the second trailer was tipped over and blocked the road.  We
were able to drive into the bar pit and get around it.  The traffic seemed very
bad as we went through Las Vegas and a 5 gal. Bucket flew out of a pickup in
front of us and went under our car.  It drug for quite a way before it broke
loose and came out.  I don’t think it did any damage but it did make us nerves
as there was no where we could stop.  We stopped in Kingman and bought some
soup and got gas before coming on to Shellie and Roy’s.  We stayed up visiting
until quite late.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Jase woke up
at 5:30 AM and that woke us.  I didn’t get back to sleep thinking about the
cabin.  I finally got up at 7 AM and showered and got dressed.  Shellie soon
had breakfast ready for us.  I spent several hours redrawing the cabin plans
after having Shellie and Mae give me some suggestions.  Shellie and I did play
a game of chess.  Quint has a chess set with the players being designed after
the Star Wars characters.  This made it very hard to remember which players
were which, for example; each of the four knights is different characters and
the same with all the other pieces.  The only uniformity is the pawns.  Anyway
Shellie beat me.  Shellie and I were able to talk about some of the problems
that she is having with her calling.  I hope I was able to give her some
helpful advice.  I tried to find a replacement window for the window over their
cabinet but was unable to find the company that manufactured this brand.  This
evening Mae and Shellie went to the Bridle Shower for Roy’s Sister’s daughter. 
She will be getting married this coming Friday.  I tried to spend time with the
boys.  They wanted to watch a show on TV so I let them pick a movie.  I tried
to not be too critical and they picked one that was supposed to be funny but I
saw no hummer in it.  When I ran out of popcorn I fell asleep and when I woke
the boys had gone to bed.  Roy had just got home from work.  I tried to explain
the situation with the windows but I have to be very careful how I say things
to Roy.  We came upstairs to go to bed about 11 PM.  We were a while after that
before we actually got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did not
get up until 8 AM.  Shellie prepared breakfast of waffles this morning.  I
spent all morning working on plans.  Shellie, Mae and the boys went to see a
movie.  I spent the rest of the afternoon getting one page of the plans printed
so that I might get help designing the roof structure.  When I went to Home
Depot they told me to look up Warehouses on the inter-net to get the material
specifications.  We got work that today that Roy’s niece and her fiancée have
called the wedding off.  I guess that is better now than after Saturday.  I
played several games of Connect Four with Kevis.  He won about as many times as
did I.  We watch the show “Anna and the King” this evening before going to
bed.  We were after mid-night getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked on
plans most of the morning.  About noon I worked on Shellie’s dishwasher.  I
called Chris at Durk’s and asked him about the drain hose and he felt that the
positioning of the hose might be the problem in the draining.  I called to find
other parts and could get them through GE.  The parts with shipping cost about
$160.00.  I ask Shellie and she wanted me to order them.  This evening Roy is
upset and didn’t want the parts.  I don’t feel very comfortable around Roy.  I
worked on plans for a little while this afternoon.  We went to the Temple this
evening with Roy’s family.  It was an enjoyable evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I started
working on the house plans by sending a copy of the plans to Middleton Timber
so that they might give me a bid for a log house kit.  I also called
Weyerhaeuser to find information as to spec. for the beams for the cabin.  Mae,
Shellie and I played some games.  This afternoon we all went to a gathering of
the Seymore Family.  We didn’t get home until after 10:30 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and went with Roy to repair a parking awning that he had damaged with his
Toy Hauler.  He had started to repair it a few days ago but cut his arm and had
to go to a Dr. to get it stitched up.  It only took us 40 minutes to finish the
job.  Roy apologized to me about the dishwasher.  After getting back we ate
breakfast with the family and then Shellie and then Mae and the kids went to a
Ward activity.  I stayed home and took a nap and worked on plans.  Roy also
stayed home and worked around the house.  Roy and Shellie went to a Seymore
family activity this evening to see Roy’s parents off to go back to their
mission assignment.  We stayed home with the kids.  I worked more on the
plans.  Joyce Goddard called me back after getting my message from the other
night.  They have been to St. George to help Aunt Joy out as she has broken a
rib.  We will stop in Fillmore and look for a building lot on out way home.  Roy,
Shellie, Mae and I watched the movie Bat Man before going to bed.  It was 12:30
when we came up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were able
to sleep in as church didn’t start until 1:30 PM.  It was a relaxed morning. 
After Shellie got home from her meeting she and I played a game of chess.  We
didn’t get it completed until in the evening and I did win.  We ate dinner out
by the pool and for a challenge of a dollar, Quint jumped in and swam across
the pool.  Kevis almost fell in when Jase pushed him but then when he was
trying to show how he almost fell in he slipped and did fall in.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and did some work on the house plans.  Shellie had me play another game of
chess with her.  It was a long game but I finally won again.  Shellie, Mae and
I watched a DVD about the Second Rescue of the Martin and Wooley Hand Cart Co, 
it was really good and I would like to get a copy of it.  This evening all the
family except Garrett went to Mesa where we played Miniature Golf.  It was fun
but we were late getting home.  We stopped on the way home and bought ice cream
for everyone except Jase and I and we had French fry’s.  It was 10 PM before I
got started on my journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until Shellie called everyone for breakfast.  Bob called to see if he had given
me a key to the lawn mower shed for he had locked his keys in it by accident,
but he hadn’t done it.  Mae gave me a hair cut this morning.  She used
Shellie’s set of clippers and the sizes are different so I got a close hair cut
this time but I like it.  I worked on cabin plans most of the day today. 
Shellie and Mae watched a show on TV.  I started to watch it but I didn’t get
into it so went upstairs and continued to work on cabin plans.  Dale Corry from
Middleton Timber called and said he couldn’t open my files.  This evening
Garrett helped me convert the drawing files to PDF files and e-mail them back
to Middleton Timber.  Shellie and Roy cooked crab legs for diner this evening. 
They are good but a lot of work for the meat you get out of them.  Shellie sure
tries to teach her children, she has scripture reading every evening and family
prayer and Family Home Evening but she doesn’t get very much help from Roy. 
Kip had called while we were eating so I returned the call about 10 PM.  He had
a person that wanted some work done but I declined to try to get this cabin
going.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We stayed up late talking
about our concerns for Shellie and her relationship with Roy.  He is very
demanding on what he expects of her, the way she dresses, sex relations every
night, her timing must not put him out, meals are to be ready when he gets home
but she seldom knows when he is coming home, the budget that she spends but he
can spend what ever he feel like and along with all that she is to do almost
total discipline and control of the children.  He becomes upset if her Church
callings inconveniences his schedule at all.  He was upset that she had forgotten
to tell him that the Home Teachers were coming this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 3
AM worrying about Shellie and didn’t get back to sleep until after 5 AM.  We
got up for breakfast at 7:30 AM.  I encapsulated more of our Mannatech product
this morning.  The rest of the morning was spent talking with Shellie.  Roy had
given her problems all night and she was very upset over it.  This afternoon Mae
and I took Jase with us and we went shopping and looked through some model
homes.  This evening Mae made dinner and we ate at 6:30 but Roy didn’t get home
until much later.  Shellie, Mae, Quint, Kevis and I played a game of Knock this
evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but then went back to bed.  We got up for breakfast.  I spent most of the day
working on plans.  I called Sandi and had her measure her patio door and call
me back the measurements.  I then called Door &amp; Window Bargain in S.L. and
ordered the door for Sandi.  Mike called this afternoon and said they had found
some glasses and thought they might be Mae’s.  They are not.  We visited for a
while about David coming up to Wyoming to work with me.  I told Mike that I
would like to have him but if he doesn’t play football this summer he won’t get
another chance too.  Chad Porter called and we changed the schedule for me to
tape his basement to April 11<sup>th</sup> through 14<sup>th</sup>.  After
dinner Mae, Shellie, Kevis, Jase and I played the game Chutes &amp; Ladders. 
Mae &amp; I stayed up and watched the movie “Quigley Down Under” before going
to bed.  It was mid-night before we got to bed.</span></p>

just before 7:30 AM and had to hurry to get down for breakfast.  Shellie and
Roy seem to be working on their problems and I just hope they can work it out. 
I worked on house plans quite a bit today.  Mae and Shellie went shopping for a
while this afternoon.  We watched three videos today.  Shellie had the first
one “Almost Heaven” then Mae had bought “Hers Mine and Ours” and then this
evening we watched “King Kong”.  That was too much TV for one day.</span></p>
