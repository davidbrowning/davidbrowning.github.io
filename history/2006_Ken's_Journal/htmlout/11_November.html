<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7 AM and did the normal morning routine.  Bob came down just as we were
ready to eat breakfast.  He asked about borrowing the juicer to do some
grapes.  The question came up as to how big it was.  Mae indicated that it was
quite tall and I said it was that tall.  I got it for him.  When I brought it
in I had to kid Mae but she wouldn’t admit that my size was closer to right. 
It was in fun but she does dislike being wrong.  Mae and I went over to Bryce’s
and picked apples to put up.  Georgia came over for lunch and to help Mae put
up apple sauce.  I went over to Best Buy and purchased a DVD/CD player.  I
stopped at The Home Depot and paid off my account with them.  I don’t think I
will use it any more as I am always confused at my payment and balance.  I made
a deposit at America First of Sandi’s and Rich’s checks.  I stopped at Ream’s
and purchased a new set of cowboy boots and then went over and helped Scott run
the wire to the last speaker for his surround sound TV.  We had trouble getting
up through the wall as there was insulation and a fire block in the way.  When
I got home Mae had put up several containers of apple sauce.   We ate some of
it with cottage cheese.  I hooked up the new DVD/CD player and we watched the
movie “Philadelphia Affair” before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We enjoyed
sleeping.  After getting up I got my clothes out for Mae to pack for our trip. 
I caught my journal up to date before we went upstairs to eat as Bob made
biscuits and gravy for us.  Mae had to go into Ogden to the dentist.  On the
way home she had a truck tire coming down the freeway towards her.  She was
able to swerve into the next lane and she saw it run into a pickup a few
vehicles behind her and she said it looked like it caused it to wreck.  We both
went to Dr. Bennett’s for treatments.  After finishing there we walked over to
the Layton Library and did a early vote as we will be out of town next week.  I
have very mixed feelings as to what good we do in voting any more.  We came
home, ate some lunch and I took a nap.  We went to the Ogden Temple and went
through a session.  I got the boat ready and filled it and the pickup with
gas.  I stopped for a few groceries.  Mae has been packing every minute she
could for fishing tomorrow and for our trip next week.  I had to put a battery
charger on the boat and will let it run tonight.  I down loaded some pictures
from our camera so it is ready to take tomorrow.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I left this
morning and was at the Big K Mart at the mouth of Parleys Canon in Salt Lake
before 6 AM.  Mae didn’t sleep very well last night so she didn’t go with me
this morning.  Nick was a little late but we made it to Strawberry Reservoir
shortly after 7 AM.  The boat performed very well and I am again completely
satisfied with my boat.  Fishing was slow but we caught a few.  Because of the
size regulations at Strawberry we were only able to keep two of the fish we
caught,  The one fish was a rainbow trout and the size limit dose not apply to
them.  That is the first rainbow trout I have caught at Strawberry for several
years.  It was cold but we enjoyed it and had a good day of fishing.  We quite
fishing shortly after 5 PM and loaded the boat.  We drove back to Daniel’s
Summit where I had reserved a room for tonight.  I had time to shower and warm
up before Sandy and Mae arrived.  We ate there at the restraint.  The food was
really good and the serving was more than we could eat.  After going back to
the cabin we played a game of marbles and watched a show on TV before going to
sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep very well and was up early.  She looked at the clock that was in the
cabin and it hadn’t been reset since the changing of Day-light saving time so
was one hour off.  She woke me and I got up to use the bathroom and read my
scriptures.  It was then that we realized that we were getting up early so
rested a little longer.  We got to the reservoir again shortly after 7 AM and
drove directly over to the Mud Creek area but there were several boats already
there so we stayed in the mouth of the area.  We had fish showing up constantly
on the fish finder so we stayed in that area and had good luck.  We caught
several but again because of the size regulations were not able to keep any
except for one.  We quite about 11 AM and went in as a storm was coming in.  We
were quitting at 11:30 anyway as I had scheduled to take the boat in to
Peterson’s to have the boat winterized and I have to be there before 3 PM.  It
didn’t take very long to get the boat loaded and we were soon on our way.  We
got to Peterson’s in time and then went home.  It took a little while to get
unpacked and we then finished packing for our cruse trip.  Mae gave me a hair
cut before I showered and got cleaned up.  I attended a Stake Priesthood
Leadership meeting in connection with our Stake Conference.  Mae went over to
Klass’s to a Birthday Party for Maggie’s Father.  She also got her dress from
Tinna as she added some lining to it for Mae.  When I got home from my meeting
I ate and then tried to take a nap as I had fallen to sleep in the earlier
meeting.  Mae came home with Benjamin as she is going to tend him this evening
for Jeff and Gail while they attend a play in S.L..  I attended the Adult
session of out Stake Conference this evening.  Mae has everything about ready
for us to leave in the morning.  I caught my journal up before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
3 AM so we could get to Mike and Becky’s by 6 AM.  Mike called us to see where
we were, just before we got to their place, so he could start up the car and
have it warmed up and ready to go.  We transferred our luggage to their van and
were on the road by 6:30 AM.  With just short stops for gas, we drove straight
through to Los Angeles.  As we got close to Los Angeles, I was amazed at how
well Mike did in finding the directions with the use of his G.P.S.  We went
right to the Best Western Motel in Long Beach, where we had reservations for
the night.  The hotel was nice and clean and the staff was very courteous and
accommodating.  We were a little concerned as the area around the hotel didn’t
look like that great of an area.  We called and ordered in pizza to be
delivered to Mike &amp; Becky’s room.  We ate and played games for a while
before going to our separate rooms to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The hotel
offered a continental breakfast so we went downstairs to eat there.  We had
waffles, with yogurt, fruit and honey on mine.  After eating Mae and I walked
outside to go for a walk but didn’t go far because of the concern for the
area.  At 10:30 AM we checked out of the hotel.  We were able to leave the car
parked in the hotels parking area, which is under the hotel with secure gates
for safety, and ride the hotel shuttle van to the pier where we are to board
the ship Paradise which belongs to the Carnival Cruse Line.  We ate lunch after
boarding and then went to our room where our luggage had been delivered.  We
had room 106 and Mike &amp; Becky had room 100 on the sixth floor or it was
also called the upper deck.  The ship has 12 floors or decks.  Our cabin was
small but very nice.  Our cabin steward was named Bee.  She is Filipino, very
friendly and kept our room made up and very nice for us.  Each evening we would
find a towel folded into a shape of an animal.  They were very cleverly done. 
At 5 PM before the ship sailed we had a evacuation drill that was mandatory
that every person participated in.  We know that we had to use the stairs so we
tried to go up to the 9<sup>th</sup> floor before the drill.  We were to late
and the elevators were put out of order.  After the drill finished we went to
the tour desk and signed up for two tours tomorrow at the Catalina Island.  We
also signed up for a tour at on Wednesday when we got to Ensanada.  We went to
dinner in the main dinning room and had a wonderful meal.  Our head waiter was
a Filipino by the name of Armando.  He was really enjoyable and very helpful
with the menu.  Following dinner we went to the evening entertainment.  They
had a comedian that was quite good and the jokes were fairly clean.  Then they
had a dance group that was good but the customs were very brief.  There wasn’t
much left for the imagination.  Before going to our cabin, Mae and I walked
around the open decks of the ships and enjoyed seeing the ship move through the
ocean and also we enjoyed the smell of the sea.  Bee made us a towel hart
tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today we ate
early breakfast and then took a “tender” (small boat holding about 50) to
transfer from the ship to shore.  We walked around Catalina Island for a while
and then went on a glass bottom boat where the guide took us out where we could
watch the fish as we fed them.  After that we went on a tour of the town and
the Botanic Gardens.  There was a memorial for Mr. Wrigley (the man who owned
the Wrigley Spearmint Gum company) .  That was a very good tour especially
because of our tour guide.  We then came back to the ship by the same tender. 
We met with Mike &amp; Becky to eat dinner.  We again stayed up quite late
walking around the ship and being on the decks.  The ship left this evening for
Ensanata Mexico.  Tonight Bee made us a towel swan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and ate breakfast about 8 am.  We then went into Ensanada and walked around the
one street.  We thought that we were following directions but found that we
took the wrong street.  The town reminded us of the Philippines except there were
old cars instead of trikes.   We did find a store that we bought a few items. 
There were children begging and street stores but not as many as were on the
street in the Philippines.  The town was dirty and streets and sidewalks
needing repair.  It sure brought back a lot of memories.  We went back to the
ship in time to board a bus for our tour to the blow hole.  Mae had to use the
restroom but found that they only had to stalls and one of them was closed. 
She held up the tour for a few minutes.  The tour guide was great.  Her name
was Lilianna and she made the trip worth while.  She explained many things
about the city such as their three main occupations were tourism, fishing and
farming.  She also explained about the government subsidized housing and showed
us the old housing and the new and explained that in another 45 years the new
will look like the old and they will probably be building another new area. 
She told us that the tap water is polluted and they that lived there also do
not drink it or they to will be sick.  They have to drink bottled water or
water from two wells that can be delivered to each home.  She pointed out the
American housing area.  It was very informative trip to the blow hole.  At the
blow hole she took us down the street of venders and told us of those that we
could trust to be fair with the buyers.  The tide was wrong as to seeing a
spectacular sight but it was interesting to see.  We had many venders try to
get us to look in their but most of them we just walked by.  Maybe I should
have let Mae look at silver but I didn’t feel that was the kind of silver that
we should invest in.  When we returned to the city we went to the ship and
boarded.  Aboard the ship we ate dinner, saw the program, had a dish of yogurt,
walked around the deck and went to our cabin and watched a Tom Cruse show on
TV. Bee made us a towel seal tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The ship set
sail for Long Beach about 10 PM last night.  We spent today on the sea.  Most
of the time the ship mainly floated about with the captain often letting is set
or rotating around in circles.  It was a relaxing day and we enjoyed shopping
at the shops on board, eating all we wanted and what we wanted and being
entertained.  We did get our things packed for the departure tomorrow.  The
captain did maneuver the ship to try to find the most sun shine as possible. 
Towards evening the ship did seem to gather speed as though there was a
destination to reach.  Time seems to go by very fast and soon we were getting
ready for bed.  Bee had made us a towel elephant tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up
early to eat breakfast.  As we finished I decided to have one last yogurt but
the mashing was already disassembled and cleaned.  Darn, but I have had at
least a dozen yogurts during this cruse.  After breakfast we brought our bags
up and departed the ship.  We were expecting a longer delay at customs but it
went very smooth and we were calling for a hotel shuttle by 9 AM.  We were
taken back to the hotel parking and were soon on our way home.  Mike drove
through the main traffic or until we got on Highway 15.  I then drove until we
got to Mesquite Nevada.  We stopped at a new Wal Mart and walked around for 20
minutes and used the restrooms.  Mike drove to St. George where we stopped for
gas and then went to eat at the Out Back restaurant.  I then drove to American
Fork.  We didn’t stay long at Mike’s but transferred our luggage and drove on
home.  This last section of driving was the worst as both Mae and I were
excused.  Our legs were very tired and the muscles cramped and hurt.  We came
into the house and unloaded the car.  Bob came down and gave me a hand at
bringing the luggage into the house.  We both took hot showers to relieve the
leg pains.  My stomach was upset so I had to sleep in the recliner most of the
night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I came to bed
about 4:30 AM.  We slept in until after 9 AM.  Mae got most everything unpacked
and but away.  We went to Ogden where we bought some items at Kitchen Knead and
then went to Sea Gull Book where we bought a book for Tyler and baptism.  We
then went to Petersen Marine where I got our boat.  They had winterized it for
me.  We came home and at 4:15 PM left for David &amp; Shauna’s church
building.  There was a large group that was gathered for the Stake Baptismal. 
Tyler was baptized and confirmed a member of the Church Of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints by his father.  I and Grandpa Howard were asked by Tyler to
serve as Font Witnesses during the baptism.  During the conformation, performed
by David, Mike Howard, Jason Howard, John Howard, Mike Browning, Scott Browning
and my self along with the Bishop stood in the circle.  Jeff was in attendance
but did not stand in the circle.  After the services we all went to David and
Shauna’s where we had a large six foot sandwich and all the trimmings.  We
visited and watched the slide show that was compiled by Shauna of Tyler’s first
eight years.  It was about 8 PM when we left for home.  We were tired and soon
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We felt like
it was a slow morning but before long we had to hurry to get to meetings on
time.  We had tried to get some of our journals brought up to date as I didn’t
take my computer with us on the trip.  Meetings went well and I enjoyed them. 
I did fall asleep in Sunday School for just a minute but other than that did
ok.  Bishop Smith asked if I could meet at 5:15 PM this afternoon for a short
meeting.  Bob invited us for dinner this afternoon.  He had cooked a wonderful
pork roast with mashed potatoes and gravy.  I visited with Mark and Bob for a
while after dinner.  I worked on my journal for a while and then went over to
the Bishops office for the meeting.  It was just a meeting to go over the High
Priest Quorum and the Home Teaching assignments.  Mae and I worked on my journal
and Mae answered E-mails.  I called Mike and visited with him concerning his
comments about the Church Development of Down Town Salt Lake City.  When I
finished and we hung up I wished that I had never called Mike.  Mae and I
discussed that at one time we felt that we had done a fairly good job of
raising our family but now we have serious droughts.  We love our family but
being parents certainly isn’t the easiest thing to be.  I finished catching up
my journal and it was 10 PM so we will go to bed.</span></p>

a normal time but I had quite a headache and so after eating breakfast I laid
in the recliner with two blankets over me and slept for two hours.  I woke
feeling much better.  Before laying down I connected our new external hard
drive to my laptop and copied the pictures off my computer to the external
drive.  It took over 4 hours to copy them.  Mae did a lot of washing today,
seems that we have gone, came home and left again for some time now.  She was
busy trying to catch up.  It snowed early this morning so the boat was wet.  I
didn’t dare cover it with it being so wet.  I will have to wait until it dries
out now.  I worked most of the afternoon on our bank statement.  It was a mess
and I spent a long time on it.  This evening we went upstairs and played
canasta with Bob and Carroll.  When the game finished Bob and I won by 50
points.  Mae helped me balance the statement when we came back down stairs.  It
was after 11:30 when we went to bed.</span></p>

early with a dream so was up for a while.  I came back to bed about the time
Mae got up.  Mae let me sleep a while longer.  Bob prepared breakfast of
biscuits and gravy this morning, they were sure good.  Bob took Mae out to the
base for some groceries.  When she got back I asked her to go with me.  she had
work to do but came with me anyway.  We went over to Scott and Mishelle’s to
get a letter sent to us from CitiBank.  They said they sent us a refund check
but I haven’t cashed it.  We then went to David &amp; Shauna’s where I drained
their sprinkler system.  We stopped at Home Depot when we got back from David’s
and I bought some visqueen &amp; some shrink wrap.  Mae had visiting teachers
come this afternoon.  I put up the canapé on the boat and hope it will dry out
enough to wrap it up for the winter.  Mae went to a Relief Society program this
evening.  Bob &amp; I went Home Teaching and was able to visit all three
families.  Mae was on the internet when I got home.  I made up some whey and
made me a sandwich and then filled in my journal.</span></p>

with Mae’s phone ringing.  By the time we got to it, it had stopped.  It was
Shellie and she left a message that she needed help.  It took us a while to
make contact with her but after Mae made contact and talked to Shellie, we
decided that we would get ready as quickly as we can and drive to Arizona.  I
had to take the door that I got for Randy to him and I have to get my boat put
away.  So I did that while Mae packed.  Mark gave her a hand packing the car. 
It was going on to 3 PM when we got every thing packed and left.  We drove to
Kanab where we got a motel for the night.</span></p>

This evening Shellie asked Roy and I to go with her to a sister in their Ward
that is having serious health problems and we gave her a Priesthood Blessing. 
I annoyed her and Roy sealed the annoying and gave her a blessing.  This sister
is having her share of problem and I think Shellie is having to much empathy
for her along with others and too many activities that she is involved with,
which is over stressing her.  This evening the boys pulled a draw out of the
kitchen cupboards and it fall on out and broke the draw.  I think I can repair
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
until breakfast time.  After breakfast I took a shower and shaved.  Roy showed
me where his tools were so today I repaired the drawer.  I found that the
runners were not supported strong enough so I reinforced them.  I also went to
Home Depot and bought 1” X 6” X 6’ pine board and added reinforcement onto the
drawer that I repaired and the one below it.  I made Shellie a plaque for her
wall by putting a router edge on part of the pine board.  Mae worked all day
cleaning house and helping Shellie get ready for a party of Sisters this
evening.  Seth Porter called this evening and they are having trouble with the
pump at Randy’s cabin.  I talked to him for quite a while but haven’t figured
out the problem yet.  Roy, the boys and I were asked to disappear for a while
this evening while the ladies were here.  We stopped at a video store and spent
a while looking for something worth watching.  With a half dozen calls Seth and
I finally figured out the problem with the pump and got it working ok.  We then
went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and ate.  We received a call and asked to stay
at least another ½ hour so we went to McDonalds and let the boys play n the
play land.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and when I got up Shellie asked if I would help make a biscuit and gravy
breakfast.  After breakfast I got telling Quint stories of my childhood and my
dogs.  We then helped Roy and Shellie get ready for the Seymore Family
Christmas party.  They started with going to a park and sending up balloons
with a message attached in memory of Todd and Gaylyn’s daughter that died when
she was two.  All the Seymore family gathered at Shellie and Roy’s where Patsy
and Veldon gave all their grandchildren quilts that Patsy had made while on
their mission.  Next the Christmas story was depicted with the children dressed
up and Veldon reading the account of the Christ child from the Bible. 
Christmas gifts were next exchanged for everyone.  Shellie had purchased gifts
for Mae and I from her and Roy.  We then ate, visited and some of us played
games.  It was late when everyone cleaned up and left.  Shellie played a new
game with me but I wasn’t too good at it.  Mae took her shower tonight so her
hair would dry during the night.  It was after mid-night when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept until
4 AM and then had to get up and move.  I found a blanket and laid down on the
recliner and slept there until 8 AM.  I was up for a while and then laid down
on our bed and slept until 10 AM.  Mae was up and starting breakfast so I helped
her and the boys, Mae and I ate.  Shellie had gone to a meeting.  Roy got up so
we prepared more hot cakes.  Shellie came home just in time and ate with Roy.  I
started a file of memories that I had of Grandma Hill.  The day went fast and
we soon went to church.  After church Shellie, Mae and Roy prepared diner of
grilled hotdogs and rice.  We ate dinner out side by the swimming pool.  Roy,
Garrett, Quint and I went to Stake Priesthood meeting.  This evening as a
family we had scripture study.  I worked more on Grandma Hill’s file.  At 10:30
PM I finished my journal entry and we went to bed.  The day seemed to go by
fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I am not sure
what took the time but it was mid-night when we started to bed but then my
stomach bothered me so I slept in the recliner.  Garrett woke me when he came
down to go to school.  I went to our bed and slept until after 8 AM.  All had
eaten and the boys had gone to school.  Shellie and I ate breakfast.  I called
Randy’s insurance company and explained how I ran over the small fox in
Wyoming.  I also called Carla and Craige but they weren’t home so I just left a
message with Tassie.  Roy asked if I could fix the water filter system so it
wouldn’t make a noise when operating.  I spent quite a while working on it when
I finally added 6” more to the drain line and it quieted the noise.  I also
glued some bricks back into place where they had been broken out during the
party Saturday.  We ate lunch and then I drove to town to get me a belt and
tie.  While there I also found a couple of gifts for Mae for Christmas.  I went
to Deseret Book and looked at some books that I would like, The Infinite
Atonement by Tad R. Callister and History of the Church by Joseph Smith.  As
Christmas is coming I will suggest that some of the children might consider
them for Christmas gifts.  I stopped at the grocery store and bought a few
groceries.  The weather is so nice that we ate dinner out by the swimming pool
again tonight.  Roy worked on the TV, DVD &amp; VCR players to get them working
together.  We watched the DVD of the second film of the Work and the Glory. 
Although we have seen the movie when it came out we enjoyed watching it again
on DVD.  I can’t help but wonder when we see all that the early Saints went
through, how can we, with all the blessings we enjoy today, expect to gain
equal blessings with what they have earned?   I finished my journal entry and
went to bed in a safe, comfortable home with a full stomach.</span></p>

this morning and then I showered and shaved before coming out to eat.  I
changed the filters on Roy and Shellie’s R.O. system.  Mae and I spent the rest
of the day wrapping Christmas gifts for our family Christmas party and for
Shellie to help her with that job.  It was fun working with Mae.  We called
Sandi and sang her Happy Birthday.  She said that she is doing fine.  She said
that when Terry was killed the night before she Birthday she didn’t think that
she would ever enjoy another Birthday, but Nick has been doing things for her
all day, some of her friends at school took her out to lunch and she has had
several calls from friends and family so it’s been a good day.  This evening we
watched the shows Brother Bear and Brother Baer 2.  I worked for a little while
on the memories and thoughts I am writing on Grandma Hill, before going to bed.</span></p>

last night and we also had spice food.  I couldn’t lay down so I went to sleep
in the recliner.  I woke up at 1:30 AM with a sick stomach and couldn’t go back
to sleep.  After taking some alkaline which helped settle my stomach I set at
the computer and played games for a while and started this journal entry and
wrote more on my Grandmothers story.  It was almost 6 AM when I went in to bed. 
I then slept until after 10 AM.  After eating some breakfast Mae and I went to
a car wash and washed our car.  We then did some shopping.  We stopped at a
fast food for some lunch.  This evening we put a John Wayne movie on and then
Roy, Shellie, Quint and Kevis and Mae &amp; I played a game of marbles.  Kevis
and Quint ended up wining.  Mae made up a pie for me for tomorrow.  I finished
my journal entry for today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then had cereal for breakfast.  Mae and I went for a walk.  We took the dog
with us.  At 12 noon we went with part of Roy’s family to Mimi’s restaurant
where we ate Thanksgiving dinner.  It was very good but it seemed strange where
we didn’t do any preparation of the meal and the weather is so nice.  When we
came back to Roy and Shellie’s where we played games and had desert.  Patsy had
us watch a DVD about a machine called a Vib Machine.  It is very interesting
and I would like to know more about it.  It was after 10 Pm when family left
and we called it a day.  We are certainly a blessed nation and enjoy so much. 
I wonder if very many realize it or even give it a thought.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8 AM before starting a new day.  Jase was the first of the family to get
up and he is so excited to show me everything in the house that his eyes caught
the vision of.  We know there is something that is holding Jase back in his
learning but do not know what it is or where to find help.  Shellie has tried
to get help from the school but hasn’t been very successful as of yet.  It was
10 AM before the rest of the family started moving.  After breakfast we got
ready to go to Tempe where we rented paddle boats and enjoyed an hour on the
Salt River.  Roy’s mother also came with us.  Mae, Jase &amp; I were in one
boat, Roy &amp; Kevis went together, Garrett &amp; Quint in another and Shellie
&amp; Patsy were together.  One hour was long enough as we were all tired of
paddling by then.  After that Garrett had to leave in order to go to work.  Roy
bought everyone a treat and we stayed around the park for a little while.  Patsy
then went home.  We went to the bowling alley in Chandler and bowled a game
each.  When we got home Roy, Mae and I went over to the Subway and had Garrett
make us up some sandwiches for us for dinner.  We watched the movie “Zorro II”
with the children and then Roy, Shellie, Mae and I watched another show “Burst
from the Past”.  It was fair but I would rather have gone to sleep early.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up about
7 AM and Mae got up about 8 AM.  I prepared breakfast of biscuits &amp; gravy. 
Roy and Shellie took the boys and Mae and I out to Casey Grand to see the house
they are trying to buy.  We spent some time looking at the model and then went
to the house.  It is framed up so we got the general feel for it.  It will be
nice but the main reason they are trying to get it is they hope to sale their
present home for $600,000 and this house will cost about ½ that.  They should
be out of depth if it works out.  We help Roy and Shellie put up their
Christmas lights and some of the decorations inside.  I got a call from our
Stake Executive Secretary who wanted to make an appointment for Mae and I to
visit with the Stake President.  Irven also called to tell us that Jennifer had
lost the one baby yesterday and had delivered the other two babies’ today. 
Both are very small, one is 1 lb. 4 oz. and the other 1 lb. 2 oz. and are
marginal, only being 22 week into the maternity.  Roy and Shellie put on a DVD
so we stayed up and watched it.  I don’t think I ever understood what the plot was,
who the hero’s were or what the ending was.  </span></p>

about 8:30 AM when Bob called to tell us that a winter storm was forecast for
Utah as far South as Saint George.  I called Kelley Bodily to let him know that
we are still out of town but he was already at a meeting.  His wife told me the
same forecast as what Bob had.  I guess we will stay longer here.  After
reading my scriptures, I showered and shaved and then lay back down and slept
until 11 AM.  Time went quickly and we soon had to leave for church meetings. 
Shellie had dinner ready when we returned home.  I tried to explain my feelings
or ask a question but Roy and Shellie took offence to what I was trying to ask
about until I just shut up and let it pass.  It seems that I can get myself
into this situation, particularly with my family, very easily.  This evening
all the family went to the Temple grounds to see the Christmas lights.  My feet
and legs were hurting so I stayed home.  I watched a couple of church videos
while they were gone.  I then worked on the computer typing more on my life
stories that I am trying to compile.  I finished this journal entry before
going to bed.</span></p>

shortly after 3 AM and was awake for some time.  When I finally got to sleep,
Mae let me sleep until breakfast was ready.  I fixed myself some cooked cereal
and toast.  Shellie had a Relief Society Presidency meeting here so Mae and I
stayed in our bedroom.  Mae read some of Sister Hinckley’s book, Glimpses.  I
guess I fell asleep after while and didn’t wake up until after 11 AM.  We ate
lunch and then Mae, Shellie and I went to town shopping.  We bought some paper
products and then went to Costco where we bought some Christmas presents and
groceries.  It was almost 5 PM when we returned home.  We got everything
carried into the house and put away.  I put the lights on Shellie’s Christmas
tree.  I then worked on my personal stories, quitting for dinner and scripture
reading and then resuming the stories.  I had Mae edit this evening work before
we quit for the day.  Bob called to tell us that another of Jennifer’s babies
died today.  It was the baby boy this time.  The doctors aren’t giving the last
one muck chance.  As of now they are planning to bring the babies to Utah for
burial.  How grateful for the teaching of the Church at times like this.  I
still wonder about our baby that Mae lost at 7 months along.  I am grateful for
hope.  It was 11.30 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

until almost 8 AM and then got up and started my day.  I fixed my own breakfast
and ate before taking a shower and shaving.  Although the weather was cloudy
when I first got up it soon warned up and is a beautiful day.  If it wasn’t for
the high cost of living and my hobbies of fishing and snowmobiling I could be
tempted to move down here.  The traffic and congestion is also a deterrent but
it’s not much worse that Utah and now the Wyoming area seems to be out of the
question.  I repaired a chair for Roy this morning for something to do and to
be useful.  Mae and I went shopping just for a couple of items but we went into
Wall Greens and Mae found so many items on sale that we came out with a bill of
$130.00.  I played Quint two games of chess when we got home.  The first one
was quite short but the second took us quite a while and Quint would have had
the avenge had I not forced a queen trade and that gave me the avenge and I was
able to win.  I tried to call Irven and Sandy this morning and could not get
them at their home.  I called Andrea and left a message for her to return the
call when she got home.  She called me this evening and gave me more
information as to Jennifer and their babies.  The first baby was named Grace
and was still born.  The second baby was a boy that they named Kyle Irven and
he died yesterday.  The third baby is a girl and they named her Magon Elizabeth
and the report today is that she is doing better and her chances are looking
better.  Irven and Sandy went to California to be with Jennifer and Chris and
the babies and arrived there yesterday.  Mae and I worked on our Christmas
letter this afternoon and have it about ready to print.  This evening Mea and I
watched “It’s a Wonderful Life” on DVD.  It was 11 PM when we finished the
movie and about then Shellie discovered that she had weevil in her pantry.  She
wouldn’t quit until the pantry was completely cleaned out and everything in
it.  I had Mae go in the other room and get ready for bed while Roy and I
helped Shellie.  It wouldn’t have been so bad except that Shellie has been on a
cleans and hasn’t had much intake for two days so she was so week she could
hardly keep going.  Add to that she had just had a Sister in the Ward that had
came to visit with her and for over a hour they stood outside in the cold
talking.  It was after mid-night before we got to bed.</span></p>

got the boys going for school.  After breakfast I lay back down and slept until
11 AM.  I spent all afternoon and evening working on the Christmas letter and
the labels.  I built a label file for Shellie and put on her computer.  After
dinner I took Kevis and Quint to the church house for scout meeting.  Bob
called us this morning to let us know that the third baby of Jennifer’s died
today.  I called Irven and Sandy and expressed our sympathy for the loss of the
babies.  Irven said Jennifer is taking it quite hard.  They will bring the
bodies back to Utah for burial but they do not know when that will be just
yet.  This evening I called and talked to Linda to let them know about the
babies.  They have been transferred to Bancroft Canada and their assignment is
to just trying to become acquainted with people in the area.  They are not to
try proselytizing.  Roy may be called to be a counselor to the new Branch
President but they don’t know for sure about that yet.  Roy asked if I could do
some repair work on his boat trailer so we went out and looked at the job.  we
let the family open the Christmas gifts from us this evening.  Grandma couldn’t
wait.  I finished this entry and went to bed about 11 PM.  Mae went to bed a
little earlier as she was too tired to stay up.</span></p>

before 6 AM with the fire alarm beeping.  I tried to find what it was that was
beeping and then when I realized what it was, I got a small folding step, but
it was to short so I had to get a larger set of steps.  Well; by that time I
had fully woken Mae.  Shellie came in from having gone bike ridding with
friends and was faint.  We had her lay down and finally she went back to bed. 
I replaced the battery in the smoke alarm and got it shut off.  I tried to go
back to sleep but couldn’t so finally got up.  Mae got the boys ready and
walked them to school.  When she returned she cut my hair and then I cut her
hair.  We took showers then I started work on repairing some boards on Roy and
Shellie’s boat trailer.  I called Roy and suggested that we repair both sides
of the trailer as both needed it.  This afternoon I went to Lowe’s and bought
material to repair the trailer.  I got the boards cut and started painting
them.  I worked on Christmas letters, return address labels and mailing label
addresses for our Christmas card list.  Shellie helped me with the return
addresses.  I had to call Shanna to get Bryce and Deanna’s address.  Garrett
showed me how to add special symbols with the computer.  This evening I put he
movie “White Christmas” on and we watched it.  Shellie said that is the first
time she has seen that show.  All the family stayed up and watched “Ice Age 2”
I guess it is ok.  Good night!</span></p>
