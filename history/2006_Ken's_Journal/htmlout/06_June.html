<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t get
up until almost 6:30 AM.  I ate and was to work before Seven AM.  I worked on
sheetrock all day.  I don’t think I am going to be able to finish the job this
week.  David had two presentations he was in charge of to day.  When he got
home he said things went very well.  I talked to Shauna about David’s attitude towards
the Church.  She said I had better talk to him about that.  I told her that I
couldn’t talk to him, Jeff or Noland, but they didn’t seem to want to talk
about it.  After David got home and went in I guess Shauna told him what I had
said so he came out and we visited for a while.  I came home this evening as
Mae was home also.  We ate dinner and then watched a show on TV.  I filled in
my journal for the past two days and then took a shower before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked up
to David and Shauna’s all day.  I did get the taping of the sheetrock done.  I
brought my trailer home with me as the landscapers needed it moved.  I was going
to put it in the garage but it wouldn’t fit through any of the doors.  I didn’t
want it left on the street so just brought it on home with me.  Mae had Kylan
and Ashley here to tend this evening.  We enjoyed them and they were good to go
to bed.  I did get Elise’s bid figured before I quit for the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8 AM this morning.  I fixed biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  I mainly
did it because I want to make them when we are at Lake Powel.  I haven’t made
them since we got home from our mission and the two times I tried to make them
on our mission they were a flop.  These turned out very good so I guess we can
try them again.  Mae took the children to Morgan and got the flowers from the
graves and then they went to the park.  I called Elise and gave her the prices
and she will think it over.  I went looking for a boat and was trying to decide
between two.  I took Mae with me this afternoon and we had about decided on one
of two and the salesman showed us a third boat.  Of course it is more money but
both of the other two needed a trolling motor put on them and this one doesn’t
so that saves and puts it close to the same price range.  We put $500 down on
it and will decide after thinking it over until Monday.  Bob fixed dinner for
us this evening.  They are sure special that way.  We were going to go over to
Irven and Sandy’s but Sandy call and said the Irven had a bad sore throat, so
we will do it another day.  We watched a movie that Bob recorded for us, before
going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  We walked over to the chapel as we had appointments to meet with
our Bishop at 10:30 AM.  He asked me if I would accept a calling as a
substitute instructor.  Of course I accepted it.  Mae was set apart in her
calling as a substitute instructor.  Bob and Carroll invited us for diner.  Mae
went visiting teaching after dinner.  We went over to an open house at the
Allen’s as their son enters the mission home on Wednesday.  We took our
humidifier over to Irven &amp; Sandy’s as Irven is sick.  When we got home we
played a game of canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Bob and I again beat them by
quite-a-bit.  We made plans and called Shellie concerning our trip next week to
Lake Powel.  I called Super 8 and made reservations for a room for next
Friday.  </span></p>

5:30 AM so I could get up to David’s before 8 AM but Sandy called and asked
that I fasten the barrels down in their truck.  I got to David’s at 8:30 AM.  I
worked until 5 PM and then cleaned up my tools.  It was almost 6:30 PM when I
got home.  Mae has been sick most of the day and feels worse this evening.  I
wired some money to Tonie and Roger’s this evening.  I took a shower and went
to bed.  </span></p>

sleep very well last night.  She is having stomach cramps and can’t get warm. I
got up at 5 AM and let her sleep.  She did fix me some breakfast and a lunch
before she came back to bed.  I started work at David’s before 7 AM.  It was
after 6 PM before I finished and cleaned up.  I stopped on the way home and
filled the truck with natural gas.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home. 
Sandy and Irven are really going through a lot of problems.  I hope they can
work things out.  After dinner Mae gave me a hair cut.  I filled out my journal
and played a couple of games on the computer before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were at
the North Davis Hospital at 7 AM for Dr. Jensen to run a EDG-Scope on me.  it
doesn’t look like there is any improvement in my condition but it also isn’t
any worse.  The question is do we just let is go and continue to take the
medication or do we try to correct the problem with an operation?  Dr. Jensen
suggested that I not go to work around the paint fumes and on the scissor
lift.  We came home and ate as I hadn’t eaten since last night.  We then took a
nap.  I had Mark go with me into Peterson Marina and I bought the 1996 Bay
Liner boat.  We then took it to Willard Bay where Bob and Cole met us and we
went for a ride in the boat.  It performed well.  Mae is still under the
weather but feeling a little better.  She has been busy preparing for her book
group and the Flaming Gorge trip.  I helped her a little and went to the store
for her.  I entered some transactions into the computer and filled in my
journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM and left for David’s about 7 AM.  It took me until 1 PM to finish the
painting and then with the help of David &amp; Shauna we removed all the
masking and got things put back together.  David and I cleaned up the scissor
lift and loaded it.  I called Jeff on the way home.  I returned the scissor
lift and then went home and got my trailer.  I met Jeff at Lincoln Elementary school
where we took 6 boxes of Gale’s books and a tree.  We took them to their new
home.  When I got home I put the tools from my truck to my trailer.  I made
Mark some poles and put them into the ground for the pole beans.  Mae had her
Book Club meeting this evening.  We were late getting to bed as we did some
packing for our Lake Powel trip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and packed the pickup and the boat to be ready to leave for Paige
Arizona.  Mae and I then went over to Jeff and Gail’s and helped Jeff pack and
move their items out of the basement of Gail’s Mother’s home where they have
been living, into the garage, so it will be easier for him, his brothers &amp;
friend to move their furniture and other items tomorrow.  Gail was still
teaching school so wasn’t with us.   Mae did the packing while Jeff and I
carried items and furniture upstairs.  Mae is good at packing.  I guess that is
because of all the practice I have given her with all the moves we’ve made.  We
worked until after noon when Jeff took us over to Subway and bought us lunch.  We
ate the sandwiches on the way as we drove.  We got to Paige about 8 PM and
checked into Motel 8.  We then went to Wal-Mart and bought two gas cans.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Saturday
morning we went back to Wal-Mart where we bought me a swimming suit, some
shorts and some tee shirts.  We met Roy, Shellie and the kids at Denny’s at 10
AM where we ate breakfast before going to the lake.  We then went to Wahweap
Marina to launch our boats and to meet with Butch who Shellie and Roy had made
arrangements to rent his house boat for this week.  We transferred all our
supplies to the house boat and left my boat to be towed behind the house boat
while Roy, Shellie, Mae and I went in Roy’s boat to find a camp sight.  The
boys and two friends stayed on the house boat.  We went to Last Chance area and
found a place.  Butch did have a little trouble on his way out as the tow rope
broke and he had to back track quite a ways to get my boat.  All turned out ok
and we got our sight set up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We spent
Sunday just relaxing and being together.  Shellie wanted us to take our boat
and go touring.  I told her that I didn’t use my boat on Sunday and it upset
them just a little.  The rest of the week went very well and we had a great
time.  I got time in fishing, sometimes by myself, a couple of times Butch went
with me and a couple of times Mae went with me.  We caught quite a few fish but
I never found a boil of fish like Randy had told me about.  On Thursday morning
with Mae with me we did get into a school of stripers and Mae and I caught fish
about as fast as we could land them.  I wanted to get a picture of Mae catching
her forth fish (these fish were from 21 to 26 inches long and quite heavy) so I
laid my pole down to take the pictures when a large fish took my bait and
pulled my pole into the lake.  All I saw was the bubbles as the pole sunk.  Besides
my fishing everyone had fun with water sports of all kinds.  They would usually
wake board, knee board and ski in the mornings so I didn’t get to see them
doing it, but Mae went with them the mornings when she wasn’t with me, and she
really enjoyed watching them.  She said Roy, Shellie &amp; Garrett are really
good and do all kinds of things on the water.  Quint wake boards some too, but
Kevis is still a little nervous.  She got lots of pictures.  Roy and Shellie
found a large tube that someone had left (probably it blow of a house boat) but
when no one came back for it they brought it back and we all enjoyed riding on
it.  Quint, Kevis &amp; Quint’s friend, Mason, was riding the tube and Roy was
pulling them fast and making the tube have some rough riding when Kevis got
hurt.  We think he sprained his wrist.  After that he was too nervous to do any
water sports, even ride again on the tube.  Of course, his wrist hurt for
several days too.  Roy, Shellie, Mae and I took turns cooking the meals and we
ate very well.  The weather was good although we did get some wind a couple of
times.  We took my boat out touring on Thursday and went to the Arches Natural
Bridge.  We had to walk 1 &amp; ½ miles to get to that and it was quite hot,
but it was worth the effort.  I was very pleased with the performance of our
boat.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We packed
most every thing up Friday evening and left early Saturday morning to come
home.  This time Mae and I drove our boat back.  We got to the marina before 10
AM and had a couple of hours wait before the house boat got there.  That gave
us time to clean our boats up and prepare to come home.  We again went to
Denny’s to eat.  Last Saturday when we ate at Denny’s I walked out without picking
up my Browning cap.  I figured I had lost that hat but when we came back, I saw
the waitress that had served us and asked her if anyone had found my hat.  She
remembered and said that she had put it away for me if I returned for it.  I
was very surprised and glad for that.  Shellie had suggested that we take a
walking tour to see a special sight that was advertised on the front of Arizona
Highways.  After eating we drove out to the area but they wanted about $21 a
person to take the tour.  We backed out of that.  Mae and I then left for
home.  We talked of taking a few days to come home and visiting Aunt Joy, Uncle
Van and Aunt Allison but then we remembered that Gale was to have her baby on
Monday so we came on home.  We were held up with a traffic problem just after
we passed the Highway Intersection 40, so after waiting for over a ½ hour we
turned around and went back and took the other route.  Going route 40 allowed
us to go by Cedar Breaks so we stopped there for a while and enjoyed see that
area again.  It was after mid-night when we got home and we were very tired. 
It has been a wonderful vacation and we enjoyed every bit of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was 1 AM
when we got to bed last night so when I woke at 5:30 AM I went back to bed and
we didn’t get up until 9:15 AM when we got a phone call asking us to substitute
a Primary class today.  About that time Bob came down to see if we were up.  We
had to hurry to get to Church on time.  As today is Fathers-Day Mae gave me a
new (as the boat and all my toys weren’t enough) and my boys and their sweet
wife’s gave me a $60 gift certificate to Sportsman Warehouse.  Shellie and Roy
gave me a set of salt and pepper grinders for Fathers-Day.  I went into the
opening of Primary and Mae went into Relief Society.  Mae came in when we went
to the class room.  Weston Greenhow, a twelve year old Deacon was prepared to
give the lesson.  We were very impressed with his preparations.  He had hand
outs, had scripture references for the class to look up, used the black board,
had a VCR clip to show and was well prepared.  Bob and Carroll invited us to
have dinner with them.  Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley came over for a
while.  They gave me a gift card from Sportsman Warehouse that all the boys and
their wife’s gave me for a Fathers-Day gift.  I took a picture of Bob and
Carroll that turned out very nice.  I took the computer up stairs and showed
that picture and some of our trip to Bob, Carroll, and to Bruce and his family
who were visiting.  I answered some e-mails and was on the computer getting
some of my journal updated this evening.  Mae set down and took a nap.  It was
after 10 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until Bob called us.  He took us to Big 5 sports store where we looked at
fishing poles.  Mae also bought her some walking shoes.  We went back home so
Bob could take Carroll to see the Dr..  Mae and I went out to eat at the Star
Café.  Jeff called to tell us that he had taken Gale into the hospital.  He
called a little after 2 PM to tell us that Gale had given birth to a 7 lb. 6
oz. Baby boy 19 “ long.  He said that both Gale and Benjamin David were doing
well.  We bought a present and went up to the hospital to visit them.  It was
exciting to see that sweet little grandson.   Gale’s mother and sister were there
also.  We discovered that both Gail’s widowed mother and us each have 16 grandchildren
now with the birth of little Benjamin.  We enjoyed holding the baby and seeing
how excited Jeff was.  The nurse came in and gave the baby his first bath and
first shots.  Benjamin cried out and his little lips quivered at the pain of
the shots.  Jeff had to leave the room while the nurse did that.  I had tears
in my eyes also.  We stayed for a while, but then went to Jeff and Gale’s home
and got some clothes for Jeff so he could stay the night.  We then went to
Ream’s and bought some groceries and back to Big 5 to get the fishing poles. 
They had loaded the reels with fishing line.  We then went to the Little Orient
and ate.  It was late when we got home but we watched the movie “Robin Hood”
before going to sleep.  It has been a very enjoyable day and especially being
with Mae.</span></p>

slept in although I got up at 7 AM and let Mae sleep later.  Bob prepared a
breakfast of biscuits and gravy for us.  After breakfast Bob took me to the
base where I bought a new suit and a few groceries.  Mae and I put up a case of
strawberries into freezer jam and I bagged some meat for Mae.  Mae and I went
back to the hospital to see Gale, Jeff and little Benjamin.  We then went to
the Ogden Temple and went through a session.  We missed the session that the
Ward was going on, so we attended a later session.  After attending the Temple
we stopped at Farr’s and bought Mae an ice cream cone.  When we got just about
home we stopped at a Maverick and I bought me a yogurt.  When we got home I
entered my journal for today.  I was very tired so we went to bed just after 11
PM.  Mae had trouble getting me into bed as I became so tired and everything
just seemed to leave me.  I later found out that Mae had trouble getting to
sleep so she stayed up a little longer.</span></p>

AM but let Mae sleep in.  I worked on my journal getting it up to date from our
Lake Powel trip.  It is hard to catch up when you get behind.  Bob and I went
looking for a edger and some weed spray.  We went to a Farm Supply store above
Hill Field to get the spray as it was much cheaper than what the lawn and
garden centers carried.  I sprayed the driveway for weeds and then I put the
pole holders on my boat.  Charles and Caroline Saunders came over this evening
for dinner and then we played Canasta.  Charles and I played against our wife’s
and we beat them quite badly.  It was a very pleasant evening.</span></p>

We went into Ogden for an appointment Mae had with Dr. David Lesser.  While I
was waiting for Mae I went down to Peterson Marine and got a brace for the boat
windshield and ordered a cover for the boat.  I also picked up some fishing
supplies at Sportsman Warehouse.  I went back to get Mae and then we came back
to Sportsman Warehouse and bought some life jackets.  We stopped at Wendi’s for
a quick lunch and then went to Dr. Jensen’s for my appointment.  We got home at
4:30 PM and then Bob and I went home teaching to Brother and Sister Johnston. 
Mae was waiting for me when we got back and we went over to Jeff and Gale’s to
take dinner and for Mae to try to locate some things she may have packed for
them.  It was after 8 PM when we got back home.  I had to hurry to get the boat
and fishing gear ready to go in the morning.  We couldn’t get gas this evening
so will have to get it in the morning.  Mae made me a lunch for tomorrow.</span></p>

fished until after 12 PM.  We had to be back home between 1:30 and 2 PM as Bob
had an appointment with his dentist at 2:30 PM.  it was a good morning with Bob
catching 3 fish, Mark 1 fish and I caught 2 fish.  All three of us had several
strikes that we didn’t land so it stayed enjoyable.  I cleaned the fish after
we got home.  Bob said he would cook them for breakfast Sunday morning.  This
evening Mae and I went to Alpine where we attended a wedding reception for Mitchell
and Angelina Brown.  It was really good to see LaDell and Eleanor Brown and
most of their children.  Mitchell is their youngest and last to get married. 
Eleanor isn’t doing very well health wise and seem to be suffering quite bad
with Fibermyalgia.  It was late when we got home.</span></p>

morning.  While fishing we saw a moose swimming across the reservoir so we went
fairly close to it where Scott could get some pitchers of it.  Mae and Michelle
had taken lunches so we ate about 11 AM.  David and Shauna and their family
came up about 1 PM.  We did some boating with them and used their float tub to
pull behind our boat and give the kids a ride.  I went on it with Kylan and
Emily and then Kylan and Ashley.  It was after 2 PM when we started to go
home.  Of course we had to load the boat and wipe it down before coming home. 
We stopped on the way home and filled the pickup and boat with fuel.  Mae and I
was sure tired when we got home.  Mae set down in the recliner and took a nap
when we got home.  I got most everything out of the boat and then I took a
nap.  This evening we played a game of Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Carroll
and Mae really beat us tonight.  We were tired when we came home but I filled
out my journal before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night and ended up sleeping in the big chair.  I woke and
got up at 8 AM.  Bob cooked the fish we caught on Friday and made biscuits to
go with them.  Bob didn’t feel well but fixed breakfast for us anyway.  We
attended meetings then we went up to Devin &amp; Betsy’s for dinner.  We
enjoyed the visit with them and the food was very good.  Betsey gave me back
Dad’s diaries that she has been copping.  This evening we read more in our
book.  I talked to Rich and will do the remodeling that Elise wants done.  I
called Randy and set up a fishing trip for next Friday.  Irven called and I
will go over to their place on Tuesday and repair their water line.  I also
scheduled Elise’s job for July 12<sup>th</sup>.  It looks like I am getting
pretty scheduled with things to do and I also have the sunroom to sheetrock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
quite late this morning.  I started work on our bank account but didn’t get
near caught up.  I worked on our boat getting the rod holders mounted.  I had
to go to town for some bolts so did some errorns for Mae while I was out.  We
invited Robin Walker and her family over for dinner this evening.  We cooked
hamburgers on the grill and ate outside.  I got the scooter out and let them ride
around on it in the back yard.  We were tired when they went home, but it was a
fun evening.  While putting things away we met and visited with our neighbor to
the East of us.  His name is Sy Ing and he speaks very good English.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept most
of the night in the recliner do to stomach problems.  I went over to Irven and
Sandy’s and installed a freeze less water faucet in the front of their house. 
I also grouted the tile I replaced some time ago.  Mae had the car heat up on
her again today.  Bob found me a radiator shop that will flush the cooling
system and check the A/C on July 5<sup>th</sup>.  Our Home Teachers came this
evening.  Mae then went up to Morgan to watch Tyler play ball.  I attended the
High Priest leadership meeting.  After getting home I filled capsules with Ambrotose
and Phyt-aloe.  It was after 11:30 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6 AM but then went back to bed.  David called about 8 AM so we got up.
After some breakfast we loaded a dresser into the trailer and went over to Jeff
and Gale’s.  Noland came over and helped me carry the old dresser downstairs
and carry in the one we brought over.  Mae had followed me over but with
Noland’s help I didn’t need her help.  I recessed a bathroom cabinet into the
wall.  I had to move some electrical wiring in order to do it.  I finished
about 4 PM and went home.  I moved some of my trailers out of the spot where
they were parked so that tomorrow Bob can mow the weeds down.  This evening I
went with Steve Smith and we visited Sister Johnston and Sister McIntire.  I
moved a dresser out of the South East bedroom into the center bedroom for Mae. 
We then went to the grocery store for a few items.  When we came out there was
a soft ball game going on at the park so we went over and watched it.  It was
11 PM before we got home.  I set the water on the back yard, filled out this
journal entry and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early for a while and then went back to bed until 8 AM.  Mae went to support
Robin Walker in court this morning.  I worked on David and Shauna’s bill and
also got a fax sent to the Ace Hardware in Alpine Wyoming.  This afternoon I
figured the material I would need to build a trailer hitch on the back of our
camp trailer so we can pull the boat at the same time.  Bob and I then went to
Bowman &amp; Kemp’s and ordered the material.  Bob will pick it up for me
tomorrow.  I took a 20 minute nap and then showered and Bob and I went Home
Teaching to Jackson’s.  Just as we came out Mae came to get me for the Ward
social.  It was a pretty good social as socials seem to go now days.  When we
got home I hooked up the boat and got it ready to go for tomorrow.  I worked
with the lawn sprinklers for a while trying to get them going but didn’t have
any success.  Scott called this evening and has more of Irven’s mail coming to
their address.  I have tried to call Irven but they don’t answer.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
shortly after 4 AM and was at Randy’s about 5 AM.  We went to East Canon
Reservoir and went fishing.  We used my boat this time and I again was very
pleased with the boat.  Just after 10 AM we had caught our last fish and I was
looking in the proclamation to verify the fish limit when a boat approached
us.  It was the Fish and Game officers.  They ask to see our fish and I felt
confident that we just had 8 fish.  Whoever when she counted then there was 9. 
I caught the last fish so I took the ticket.  We had a lot of fun any way. 
After getting home and taking care of the fish I took a nap.  Bob and I then
went out back and removed several dead trees that we were concerned that they
might blow down.  We still have one tree to cut down but we were tired and
quite for the day.  I filled in my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>
