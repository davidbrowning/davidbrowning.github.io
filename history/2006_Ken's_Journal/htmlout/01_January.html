<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We set the
alarm to get up at 7:30 AM.  Mae got up but let me sleep in a little longer. 
Mae and I got ready for church and then prepared breakfast.  Because Bryce and
Deanna were speaking in Sacrament meeting today we attended their ward.  We
were able to see several members of the family; also Sister Moulton was there
so we were able to visit with her.  Bryce and Deanna gave very good talks but
Bryce was Bryce and very amusing.   We stopped over to their home and visited
and had some refreshments.  After getting home Roy and Linda prepared dinner. 
I helped them some but then took a nap.  Bob, Carroll and Mark were invited
down to eat with us.  Devin and Betsey came over this evening and we visited
with them.  Mae and I watch “Mr. Krueger’s Christmas”.  I helped Roy and Linda
transfer the pitchers from their cameras memory onto their computer.  Mae got
tired of waiting for me and went to bed.  I started this New Year journal
before going to bed.  It was 11:42 PM when I turned the computer off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and then went to back to bed.  Mae let me sleep until after 8 AM.  She prepared
breakfast of waffles and I helped her cook eggs.  Roy went with Bob to find
tires for his car.  Linda went with her cousin for the day.  We took down the
Christmas decorations.  About 4:30 PM I went over to Thompson’s daughters and
looked at a problem they are having in their bathroom.  Roy went over with me. 
I suggested that they contact the home owners insurance.  When we got back home
Mae had every thing finished up and ready for them to be taken to the shed.  We
did it with the pickup.  Mae and I watched a couple of JAG movies on TV this
evening.  I put the recorder on to record more series that are playing this evening. 
I updated our checking account and made this journal entry before we went to
bed.</span></p>

about 8 AM and started the day.  Mae made breakfast of oat mill cereal, eggs
and toast.  We set around the table and visited for sometime.  This afternoon
Roy and I went to S.L. to buy them a spare tire.  I didn’t look at the address
close enough and I had Roy take 13<sup>th</sup> S exit.  We came back north and
ended up on the west side of the freeway and had to back track, cross over the
freeway and then come north.  That made us late getting back and Bob had dinner
ready when we got there.  Bob and Carroll had Mark, Roy, Linda, Irven, Sandy,
Mae and I for dinner.  We played games after dinner.  I had to attend a High
Priest leadership meeting this evening at 7 PM but the rest stayed and played
more games for a while.  Roy and Linda left this evening to go stay with
Linda’s mother.  They said they would rather have stayed here but needed to
visit with Linda’s family.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7 AM and after a normal morning I went down to Randy’s and got a
treatment.  Randy isn’t able to give the treatments but he is giving another
man some help in learning the procedures.  Randy and I decided to go fishing
tomorrow so when I got home I spent most of the day setting up my ice fishing
tent.  This evening Mae and I went to Wal Mart’s and got our fishing licenses. 
We have been concerned about Wendy as she underwent surgery for a brain tumor. 
We learned this evening that all went better than was expected so we are very
glad for that.  I balanced our accounts with American 1<sup>st</sup> this
evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM and woke Mae at 5:45 AM.  Mae made breakfast and prepared a lunch so that I
could go with Randy.  We went to Strawberry reservoir ice fishing.  We had a
lot of fun although we didn’t catch many fish.  Randy caught 1 and I caught 2
and we had to let them go as they were between 18 &amp; 19” long.  Randy could
drive one snowmobile by following me.  With my black snowmobile suite against the
white snow he could see that much.  The parking lot had not been cleaned and we
got stuck.  Another man had got stuck and when he got someone to pull him out
it broke the tow rope.  I loaned them my chain and after they got their outfit
out I had them help pull my truck out.  It was 8:45 PM when I got home.  Bob
came down and wanted to know all about the trip.  Scott wanted me to call him
so I visited with him about the trip.  Time flies so it was almost 10 PM before
I got to take a shower and go to bed.  Mae is special.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did sleep
in this morning getting up just before 8 AM.  After breakfast I went out and
set up my ice fishing tent so it could dry.  I also worked on one of the snowmobile’s
taking the right front panel off as I had broken it when Roy and I used them. 
Mae and I went to town, getting a part for the snowmobile, getting some fishing
supplies, taking some items to the D. I. and going to the hospital to visit Pat
and Ron Bradfield and Pat’s father Robert Kleitches, her father is the one in
the hospital.  When we got home I worked on the snowmobile getting it ready for
tomorrow.  I also folded the ice fishing tent and put it in the pickup.  Mae
and I went to Sandy to a wedding reception for Janice and Ben, Jeff and Joyce
Underwood’s daughter.  We got home at 9 PM and it was after 10 PM before we got
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
3:30 AM and got ready to go ice fishing with David and Mike.  I picked David up
and we met Mike in Heber City.  Mike then road with us and we went to
Strawberry Reservoir.  We had a lot of fun even if the fishing was slow.  The
water was about 13’ deep in the area that we fished.  Being in a tent made it
possible to look down into the water and see the fish.  I caught a fish that
measured 19 ½” and Mike caught one that measured 18 ½”, David hooked one but
lost it before getting it to the surface.  It makes it hard to keep fish at
Strawberry because of the limit sizes but it is fun anyway.  Mike brought his
DVD player and we watched the movie “Batman” while fishing.  David and I took
the snowmobiles out for a ride and had a lot of fun riding them.  We quite
about 1 PM and packed it up for this time.  It was sure good to just hang out and
talk with my boys.  Mae and I were going to tend David and Shauna’s children
this even for them while they went out with some friends but Tyler isn’t
feeling the best so they didn’t go out.  After getting home I took a nap in the
chair while Mae prepared some dinner.  We relaxed this evening, going through
some papers and watching the Joseph Smith 200<sup>th</sup> Birthday celebration
that Bob had recorded for us.  I had quite a lot of stomach and had to stand to
watch most of the show.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                With our
block time changing to 11 AM starting time, it gave us time to sleep a little
longer, and we were able to listen and watch the Tabernacle Choir Broadcast. 
We also read the lesson for Priesthood and Relief Society lesson.  The block
meeting went well and was very enjoyable.  When we got home Bob invited us to
eat dinner with them but Sandi called to see if we were home for she, JaNae and
the children wanted to stop in to see us.  They had eaten already so we waited
until they left before we ate.  We sure enjoyed having then come and visit.  I
made a file on Uncle June and Margie’s obituaries this afternoon.  This evening
I also made a 2006 study schedule for the Priesthood, which can be used for a
book marker.  Time flew and it was 11 pm before I finished my journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was after
min-night when we got to bed.  I was having stomach problems so went into the
front room and went to sleep in the big chair.  At 3:30 am I woke with the
sound of a cell-phone indication it was low on power.  Before I got it Mae got
it on the charger.  I went back to bed and it was going on 9 am when Mae woke
me again.  I looked out the window and there was 500 to 1,000 starlings eating
there.  The full back yard was covered with them.  It was quite a sight.  We
ate breakfast and then started for Heber City to look for some property when we
received a phone call from Bob on my cell phone.  He gave the phone to a
Clinton Police Officer who asks for Mae.  He informed her that Cindi Porter had
taken her life.  We turned around and came back home to start making arrangements. 
We were on the phone all afternoon and the main part of that time was spent in
trying to find any of the family of the Duke’s.  We had no success in that
area.  With Terry’s help we made contact with Cindi’s Bishop and Mae talked to
him for some time.  She wrote up much of their conversation so that her
siblings would know what was said and the Bishop’s feelings.  A copy of this
report can be found in my Obituary file.  Bob asked for my help in repairing
his car.  That took about 1 to 2 hours.  This evening we met at Bryce’s home
with Kim, Georgia and Rick.  We discussed having her buried in the Morgan South
cemetery and Kim found that Jean had purchased three lots at the time of Hal’s
death.  We also decided that we will have her body cremated before we bring her
back here.  We concluded that Mae and I would drive back to Boulder and to go
through her personal belongings.  Mae and I called our boy this evening.  I
asked Mike about speaking at the memorial services.  He said he would if the
family was in agreement that he speaks from his professional view point.  Mike
also advised us to seek legal advice before claming her body as to the legal
implications.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting to bed so didn’t get us until 8 am.  Mercedes Dugan called this morning
and they want to be involved in the services both there and here.  They also
invited us to stay with them when we get there.  We made contact with Cindi’s
Bishop’s wife so that they knew we are coming back there.  Bishop Rayback
called shortly after and visited with Mae.  He said they would like a service
there also.  Mae and I went to Dr. Bennett and got a treatment.  I then went
over to a copy store and had then make copies of my “2006 Priesthood Study
Schedule” which makes book markers for the High Priest study manual.  Sister
Walker called and asked if I could give her a blessing.  Mae went with me and
we visited with her about her problems.  I checked the rear brakes on the car,
serviced it and made a set of tire chains so we would have them with us as we
travel this next week.  I then went to High Priest Leadership meeting.  Chelci
came shortly after 8 pm and we had dinner.  Chelci will stay her some nights while
going to school at Weber.  Before going to bed, Mae gave me a hair cut.  It was
almost 11 pm before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I again slept
in the big chair.  Mae woke me at 5 am and we started getting ready for
breakfast and packing to leave for Boulder Colorado.  It was fun having Chelci
stay with us last night and to eat breakfast with her.  It was just after 9 am
when we got away.  We traveled straight through with a stop in Evanston for gas
and a frozen yogurt, we stopped at a small station along the way to use the
restroom and then at Laramie where we got gas.  I also bought a western hat
there.  Mae has read most of the way except for a little while when she drove
and I slept.  We came on to Mercedes &amp; Bryan Dugan’s getting there at 5:45
pm.  Mercedes, Bryan, their son Leam and Sam all seemed very excited to have us
come.  They were so gracious to us and invited us right in and made us feel at
home.  It is good to see Samantha again.  She has grown so much and is very
well mannered and a very pretty young lady.  Mercedes prepared a very nice
dinner.  Bryan and I visited about a lot of subjects and enjoyed it.  Mercedes,
Samantha and Mae seemed to enjoy visiting.  It looks like the Dugan’s and
Bishop Rayback have most every thing in hand.  We visited until after 10:30 pm
before we started to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The alarm
went off at 6 am but I didn’t get us until 6:45 am.  Mercedes took their son
Leam to school and Mae prepared some breakfast.  Michael Murphy from the Murphy
&amp; Associates Mortuary came and we went over the plans for caring for
Cindi’s remains.  He was very helpful and we all felt very good about it. 
Samantha was in on all the plans and I was very glad for that.  Bryan took Mae
and I over to Boulder to Cindi’s apartment.  We checked it quite thoroughly for
inappropriate materials and started to clean the apartment.  I left about 2 pm
and went downtown looking for a sandwich shop.  It took me a while before I
returned.  Bryn &amp; Mercedes had returned with Sam by the time I returned. 
Sam wanted to go through a lot and would like to save most of the belongings. 
Bryn &amp; Mercedes have no objections.  They left about 6 pm but Mae and I
stayed for another hour.  We had some problems finding our way home and had to
stop at a gas station and get directions.  We ate late plus Bryan and I visited
quite a while.  Mae worked on getting a talk prepared for the funeral.  It was
well after min-night when we got to bed.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were a
little later getting up and by the time we ate there wasn’t much time left to
go to Cindi’s apartment.  Mae lost the antenna to her cell-phone so Samantha
went with me to the mall where we bought a new one.  As we left the mall area
Mae called to tell me that she had found the old antenna.  I told her that she
was $21.00 to late in calling.  We went with Mercedes, Bryn and Sam to a
funeral home where they had prepared Cindi for viewing.  I felt very pleased
the way she looked because they did this just for us to see.  Normally that
would not be done where the body is cremated.  We stopped at the Red Robin and
ate lunch.  It was a very nice dinner.  I picked up the bill and it cost me
$60.00.  After coming home Mae and I took Bryon’s car and went to Cindi’s
apartment and packed quite a few things and took a lot out to the trash.  Bryon
came and got us at 6 pm and took us to his parent’s home where we ate.  It was
a wonderful time and we enjoyed visiting with them.  Bryon’s brother also came
over and it was very good meeting him.  Mr. Dugan was enjoyable to visit with
but you could see the signs of age and Alzheimer’s disease.  Mrs. Dugan
prepared a very nice dinner for all of us.  Before we ate she had set a candle
by each plate and then had Bryon light his candle and comment on Cindi and or
Samantha.  He then lit Mercedes candle with his and she made comments.  This
continued around the table with each taking his turn.  We then ate and
visited.  It was very appropriate and was a wonderful evening.  It was late but
we still was up for a while visiting before going to our room.  I was so sleepy
that I was unable to finish my journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6 am and used the bathroom and read from the scriptures and then went
back to bed and cuddled with my beautiful wife.  I got up at 8:15 am and before
going down stairs I finished last night’s journal entry.  Mae and I prepared
breakfast of sausage, eggs and hot cakes.  After breakfast I taught Bryan and
Leam how to play Mexican Train dominoes and we played two games.  We helped
arrange pictures on display boards for the funeral services today.  We had to
stop at Kinko’s and make copies of Cindi’s suicide letter.  We then went on to
the chapel for the funeral.  The funeral went very good and there was a lot of
family and friends in attendances.  In fact the chapel was almost full.  Mae
did very well with her talk as well as Sam.  Bishop opened time for personal
expressions and there were many that came up and they did a very good.  Bishop
Rayback gave an excellent talk to conclude the program and I was asked to close
the meeting with prayer.  After the services were concluded many spoke to the
family in the foyer.  From there we went to Bryan’s sister and brother-in-law’s
home for a luncheon and to view a DVD of pictures of Cindy and Samantha.  We
enjoyed visiting with many there also Bishop Rayback and his wife.  Mae and I
had planed to go over to Cindi’s apartment this evening but it was to late when
we finished the lunching so we went home.  Sam invited some of her friends over
and we played Mormon Bridge and Knock with them.  We were late getting to bed
as I got answering questions and explaining some of the gospel teachings as we
understand them</span></p>

Associates Funeral Director, 4984 Idylwild Trail, Boulder, Colorado 80301 (303)
530-4111 were the ones that prepared the body for viewing, and did the
cremation.  They were very good to work with.  They normally do not have a
viewing when a person is cremated but they performed this service at no extra
charge.  The total bill for their services was $1,634.28.  That bill was added
together with all other charges for the care of Cindy and divided among Mae’s
siblings and also Brian Dugan wanted to pay a share.</span></p>

until almost 8 am.  I helped Mae prepare sausage, eggs and pancakes for
breakfast.  Bryan was going to go to church with us but his brother called and
said that a tree had fallen on the family’s cabin and did some roof damage, so
he felt that he had better help there.  We enjoyed the Sacrament meeting at the
Boulder Ward.  We didn’t stay for the rest of the block meetings.  I spoke to
the two High Councilmen and asked both to e-mail me their talks.  We visited a
minute with Bishop Rayback and his wife before we came home.  We stopped at
Prospect Village and saw the homes and looked through one of them.  I really do
not see why any one would want to live in that area but the homes are very
expensive.  The one we went through was on the market for $850,000.00 Wow!  The
weather turned very cold and a storm was coming in so we went back to the
Dugan’s, packed our things and left for home at 3:30 pm.  Mae read most of the
way home and we sure enjoyed it.  At Evanston I was very sleepy but we got a
frozen yogurt and went on.  We finally stopped at a rest area and slept for 45
minutes before coming on home.  We got here at 12:30 am.</span></p>

apartment but none of those numbers are still in use.  I got to hurting about
11 am so laid down and slept for almost 3 hours.  Time seems to fly by in a
hurry and I am not sure if I have accomplished very much today.  We got on the
inter-net but really just spent time we didn’t have.  We turned the TV on for a

helped Mae design the program for Cindi’s funeral services to be held on the 28<sup>th</sup>. 
Mae had her book study group here tonight.  I attended High Priest Group
Leadership meeting this evening.  I got back before Mae’s sisters left so I
went upstairs and watched part of the Jazz basketball game with Bob.  We
watched a Jag movie that we had recorded before going to bed.  I am having pain
in my chess again tonight.  I slept in the chair again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
5:30 am and Mae was up by 6 am.  After a normal morning we went to Morgan where
we met with Kim.  We went over to Walker’s Mortuary and met with Bishop Walker
and discussed the funeral arrangements.  We purchased the vault and ordered the
head stone.  We needed to know what Hal &amp; Jean’s head stones looked like so
Bishop Walker had us take his camera with us to the cemetery.  We stopped at
the Morgan City offices and made arrangements for the opening and closing of
the grave.  The cemetery sexton went with us to the cemetery to show us the
location.  Bishop Walker had sent artificial grass and boards for the grave
which we left with the sexton.  We came back to Kim’s and Jeanenne went with us
to pick out and order the flowers.  We believe that everything is now ready. 
It was snowing hard as we returned to come home.  We stopped and deposited a
check given to us by Kim &amp; Jeanenne for their share of the expenses.  We
also got change to give Jeff and Scott each $25 for their birthdays to pay for
a day of skiing.  Mae made some lunch while I entered part of this journal
entry.  We then went over to Dr. Francis to see if he could tell what the pain
is I am experiencing in my chest.  He ran some and wants me to have some more
tests but doesn’t know what the problem is now.  We were there for 3 hours.  We
stopped and saw Scott had his family, giving Scott a birthday card with $25 for
him to go skiing with.  We then went over and gave Jeff a Birthday card also
with $25 for him to go skiing with.  Scott and he plan to go skiing this
Saturday.  We came home and got something to eat.  Grant Young called and they
would like me to change their patio door.  I told him I couldn’t do it until
after this month.  David called and talked to me about tending their children
next week while they are on vacation.  I entered some items into our checking
account before finishing this entry.  Mae has been on the phone quite a lot
talking to family about the funeral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
started packing.  We had some phone calls to make and then got away about 10
am.  We stopped and got gas then went into Ogden to get the medication that Dr.
Francis wants me to take.  We got to Lava about 12:30 pm.  while trying to
enter the motel parking lot I got stuck and the hotel manager helped me get out
with his four wheeler.  We enjoyed the afternoon and evening.  It is good to
get away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
going for breakfast at 11:30 am.  We went up Pebble Road and went snowmobiling
up to Pebble Camp Grounds.  It was a very enjoyable ride.  We came back about
3:30 pm.  As we were driving back I chanced to see quite a way up the mountain
a large moose breaking through the snow drifts.  I stopped and we watched for a
few minutes as he made his way under a large pine tree.  Further down the road
was a deer eating the salt from the road.   We slowed and stopped and watched
four more deer just off the road way.  They were beautiful and full with their
winter coat.  The battery in our camera was discharged so we missed pitchers. We
went to the grocery store where we bought a few items and then came back to the
motel.  Mae is so special and so good to me.  We watched two shows on TV, “The
Man from Snowy River” and “The Last of The Mohicans”. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
until 7 am, and then got in the hot tub for one more soak before we have to
check out.  We went out to eat breakfast at 11 am and then headed for home.  We
stopped to get gas in Ogden and while there we washed the truck and
snowmobiles.  Mae read most of the way home from our book “Prelude to Glory”
vol. 1.  We are almost through with this volume.  We covered the snowmobiles
and unpacked the truck.  Mae ran to the store for a few items.  Roy and Linda
came about 4 pm and then Bob had us all come up for diner.  Scott and Mishelle
brought Kylan and Ashley over about 5:45 pm for us to tend this evening.  Roy
and Linda stayed until about 9 pm.  We watched Snow White &amp; the Seven
Dwarfs with the kids.  I fell asleep about the end of it.  Scott &amp; Mishelle
came about 10:30 pm and then Mae straightened up the house.  She stayed up to see
the end of a show but at 12:30 am she shut it off and came to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as our block program doesn’t start until 11 am.  That is quite nice.  Meetings
went well and it was our Ward Conference today.  I helped Mae prepare dinner as
we are having Mike’s family, Scott’s family, Jeff, Gail and Marcy over this
evening.  All came and we had a wonderful dinner.  After dinner we cleared the
table and played Mormon Bridge.  It was about 8 PM when they all left and Mae
and I put things back and got ready to go up to David’s to tend the children.  Vicky
and John were with the children and the children were already in bed when we
got there.  We read for a little while before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up at
5:30 AM getting started and getting Tyler off to school.  I went into Davis
Hospital at 9 AM and had a ultrasound.  After that I went home and got the snowmobiles. 
I helped Bob put some drain cleaner down the pipes.  That was a job getting to
the drain behind their washer and dryer.  I also helped reprogram their
thermostat.  When I got up to David’s I gave Emily a ride on the snowmobile.  I
checked with the neighbor across the street and she let us ride in the vacant
lot behind their house.  We were also able to ride along the side of the road
and go over to the park.  Tyler got home and I gave him a ride.  I also let him
drive the snowmobile for a little bit with me on behind him.  We had a lot of
fun with the children.  After dinner we held Family Home Evening with the
children and that went very well.  We were tired when we went to bed but we
still read a chapter from our book before we turned off the lights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I again went
into town to the Utah Cardiology for a stress test.  I stopped and bought a few
items at the grocery store before coming back to David’s.  I worked on the
program for the Memorial Service to be held for Cindi this Saturday.  We made
several calls to finalize the program.  Mae also called Bryon Dugan to find out
their schedule.  About 4 PM we looked out the back door and saw a deer.  With
in a few minutes we saw another and then more.  Before long we saw eight upon
the mountain and then another further away.  It was fun to see them.  Steve
Smith called me and said that this evenings meeting will be canceled this
week.  That left me free to be with Mae and the children.  Therefore we went
bowling in Morgan.  It was an interesting evening but I think the children had
fun.  It was after bed time when we got home so had to hurry getting the
children to bed.  Mae &amp; I took a bath before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke long
before 4 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  At 4:30 AM I got up and used the
bathroom and read my scriptures.  As I read the four Gospels it leaves you with
many questions was to the meanings that the authors are trying to portray.   I
am continually grateful for the Book of Mormon and latter day revelation and a
Prophet to guide the church.  I went back to bed about 5:30 AM and Mae let me sleep
until 8 AM.  After breakfast I worked with the entertainment until I found out
how to get the TV to work.  We watched “Spider Man 2” and then set it so Emily
and Conner could watch cartons.  I updated my journal and balanced the Wells
Fargo statement.  We made some corrections to the program for the Saturday
memorial.  I printed off a copy and took it to Georgia for her to review it. 
Bob and I went home teaching this evening and were able to visit with
Mitchell’s and Johnston’s but Jackson’s weren’t home.  The Mitchell’s are
interesting as the two boys, James &amp; Blake are quite active, and Bob can’t
hear anything that is said with that much noise.  Brother and Sister Johnston
seem to really enjoy visiting and that visit takes about an hour.  I came back
to David’s after Bob and I finished.  Mae had the children about in bed when I
got there.  We read some in our book but then Tyler came down and said that
Emily couldn’t get to sleep because she missed her parents.  Mae went up and
lay with her for a while.  I watched a Nova show while she was gone.  We read
for a few more minutes and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae’s phone
beeped about 4:45 AM and that woke Conner so Mae got up early.  I got up about
5 AM but then lay back down for a little while.  Roy called Mae and really bald
her out for changing the time we are going to come down to visit them.  I am
not quite sure if I should call him back right now but I hope something like
that doesn’t happen again.  This afternoon I worked on the house plans for Star
Valley.  Mae has been busy cleaning the house so it will look nice when David
&amp; Shauna get home.  They got home about 7:30 PM and we left for home just
after 8 PM.  We unpacked and put things away.  Mae did up some dishes while I
brought things in.  Mae gave me a hair cut this evening and then I took a
shower and finished my journal entry.  We soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM but let Mae sleep a little later as she wasn’t able to go to sleep because
of worry due to the phone call for Roy yesterday.  I prepared breakfast of
oatmeal cereal and toast.  After breakfast I started to the store but Mae
called and needed the car to go visiting teaching.  I turned around and came
back.  I took the pickup and went over to the copy store to have them make the
programs for tomorrow.  I also went shopping for groceries.  I helped Mae with
house work and changing furniture so that we have room for the Duggan’s when
they get here this evening.  I picked up the programs about 3 PM and a few
items from the grocery store for Mae.  I worked on my pickup this afternoon and
replaced the windshield wiper motor.  I had to buy a new wiper motor so on the
way home Mae called and asked me to stop at the store for a few more items she
needed. The problem is that when we got the truck but back together the wiper
blades were in the wrong area.  We had to take every thing back apart to adjust
the blades.  It was cold so when we redid the work we put the truck in the
garage to work on it.  It was almost 9 PM before we came in.  Bryon, Mercedes,
Liam and Samantha came about 9:30 PM.  We enjoyed visiting with them before
going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 5:30 AM then about 7 AM I started breakfast.  We had to leave right after
breakfast.  The Memorial Service for Cindi went very well although it was a
little long.  The Florist hadn’t delivered the flowers we had ordered so I
asked Kim if he would check on it.  He went down to the shop.  They had
forgotten us, so they quickly made us a nice arrangement and brought it over.  Most
of our family was in attendance.  Aunt Beth, Uncle Wayne, Jerry Degraw and
Kevin Porter also came to support us.  All that participated did a very good
job.  We had a good service at the cemetery and then came back to the church
and had a lunch.  When we broke up Bryon, Mercedes, Samantha, Liam, Mae and I
went over to Kim and Jeanenne’s where we visited and played games.  Kim
prepared some stew for us.  The weather turned quite bad so we started for home
in a heavy snow storm.  We had to travel slow as the snow was so hard that we
could hardly see the road. We were glad to get home.  We stayed up and visited
for a while before going to bed.</span></p>

I gargled with vinegar and salt water.  I slept until about 8 AM when Mae woke
me and said the Dugan’s were going to leave for home.  The storm had stopped
during the night but another one is expected to come in.  After they left Mae
got ready for church.  I haven’t felt good so stayed home today.  Bob prepared
dinner and brought us some down.  Time went fast and it was after 11 PM before
we got to bed.  I worked on my journal all evening getting years 2003, 2004
&amp; 2005 printed off and put in a binder.  We got word from Pat Bradfield
that her father died today.  He has been sick and in the hospital for over a
month.  We made several phone calls this afternoon.  Mae talked to Terry and to
Shellie for quite a while this evening.</span></p>

very little.  Most of the day I spent in bed resting or sleeping.  Mae went to
town about 3 pm and didn’t return until 6 PM.  I was just thinking that I might
call her to see where she was, when she came in to check on me.  We thought
about watching a show on TV but couldn’t find any thing worth watching.  I fell
asleep while Mae got on the inter-net.  We read another chapter of our book
before going to bed.</span></p>

and Mae got up about 8 AM but I slept most of the morning.  I did get a little
work done on the computer this afternoon.  Jeff called and wanted Mae and I to
go look at a couple of homes with them.  I felt much better so we went with
them.  They looked at one just two or three blocks above us and one in
Clearfield.  I liked the one in Clinton best but they are asking $135,000 for
it.  That is a lot of money.  This evening I met with Steve Smith and Mark
McPhee as a High Priest Leadership.  Scott was out of town so didn’t meet with
us tonight.  After returning home I checked with the Brethren under my Home
Teaching supervision as to the home teaching for this month.  It looks pretty
good.  I called and talked to Lois to ask them if they could sew a quilt for us
for Chelci’s wedding.  We will have to call them back with the colors when we
find that out from Chelci.  We read two more chapters from our book before I
did my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>
