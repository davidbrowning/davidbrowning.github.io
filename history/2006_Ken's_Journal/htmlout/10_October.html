<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6:30 AM worried about Randy’s job.  I made some plans and later called Randy to
have him try to siphon the water out of the tank down to the outlet pipe that
we installed.  We listened to the Spoken Word before the General Conference
broadcast.  Just as conference started Brother and Sister Fallis came over to
watch it with us.  It was a very enjoyable session.  Between sessions the
Fallis’s went home and then returned to eat dinner with us.  I took time to take
a short nap before dinner.  Mae kept busy fixing lunch of taco salad and got a
roast on for this evening when Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley will come
over.  We again enjoyed having the Fallis’s watch the last session of
conference.  It has been a powerful and inspiring conference.  Scott and his
family came over and we ate dinner.  Scott and I drove down to Randy’s to get
some things out of my truck.  When we got back we set up the computer and the
projector and watched the DVD that Scott and Mishelle had made of the Holms
Creek Stake’s youth handcart trip.  It was very well done and something that
Scott and Mishelle can be proud of their work.  Mark and Bob came down to watch
it also.  Just as I was putting the projector and computer away Jeff and Gale
came.  We decided that it was to late to set it up again this evening.  Mae got
most things packed so we can leave tomorrow to go back to Wyoming to Randy and
Judy’s cabin to finish that job.  Craig and Carla called and want me to
reconsider helping them.  I guess I will put the heat system in with Craig and
his son’s help.  I called Rich and told him that I will try to get back up
there Wednesday or Thursday.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and was at Home Depot at 7 AM.  I got some things I will need to seal the
water storage tank and some more building materials.  We got to Manor Lands at
8:15 AM but did not have the key.  Judy is going to have a key for us before 10
but we are early.  A family was leaving so they let us through.  I worked all
day on the project but it is going slow.  When I started to change the water
plumbing I couldn’t get the copper joints to separate, I had to cut them.  I
will need more materials so Randy and I went into Evanston thinking that we
could get them at Wal-Mart but they didn’t have them.  Everything else was
closed so we stopped and got some frozen yogurt before we returned.  It left us
without running water for the night.  We also added some more to the project
which will make it better for Randy.  We watched a DVD before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I tried to
solder the copper pipes but it just wouldn’t get hot enough for the solder to
run.  I tried to call Durk’s to find out the problem but we couldn’t get the
phone to ring through.  Randy and Judy went into Evanston and got me a propane
torch and when they got back I tried again and it worked much better.  I then
made some changes to the hot water heater and ran int trouble with that.  For a
while I was afraid that I would have to buy a new hot water heater.  Mae asked
me how it was going and I told her I needed her help by praying that I could
save the hot water heater.  She did and I did save it.  I was very tired when I
got water back into the cabin and the water heater working.  I took a shower and
then we played a game of </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Shanghai Rummy.  Judy ended
up the winner.  It was late when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 6 AM.  My back was really tight this morning so after doing stretch
exercises Mae rubbed me for a while.  Randy then came over and rubbed me and my
back relieved almost immediately.  Mae and Judy went home this morning.  Randy
stayed to keep me company.  I worked all day building the pump house and
hooking up the plumbing.  It was 3 PM when I stopped for lunch and almost 8 PM
when I quite for dinner.  I am concerned about the pump and pressure tank as we
are missing some parts for it.  I guess we will go into town first thing
tomorrow.   I played a few games on the computer before I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 6
AM, after fixing breakfast, I checked out the materials we needed.  Randy and I
went into Evanston and got some materials.  During the night, last night, I
thought about the door and suggested to Randy that we get a door made for the
pump house so that it sealed good.  He agreed so I will have to check that out
when we get home.  We didn’t get back from town until after 10 AM.  I worked
until 2:30 PM assembling plumbing and soldering.  Just as I finished the main pipes
I ran out of gas on the torch.  I framed a section of the walls but it got to
dark to keep going.  We came in and I heated the soup that Mae and Judy left
for us.  After eating I took a shower and then filled in my journal.  After
writing my journal entry I again played some games on the computer so my dinner
would settle.  Judy and Randy were able to make connections on the phone so I
had Randy ask Judy to call Mae and let her know that we will still be here
tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up at 6
AM and started work at 8 AM.  Randy put some fill in and got the tank completely
covered.  I finished the plumbing, ran the electrical, tested the pump (which
we have a problem that I will have to ask Steve Regan’s about), finished the
insulation, finished putting the ice &amp; snow shield around the pump house
and completed the sheeting.  By the time we cleaned up and tried the trailer
light (which are not working, so we will have to wait until daylight to go
home), it was after 8 PM before we came in and I fixed some dinner.  Randy’s
son and his father-in-law came up to stay the weekend while they go elk
hunting.  Visiting with them and entering my journal, it was 10:30 PM before I
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Judy called
and told Randy that Richard Barney had had a heart attack and was in the
hospital.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Randy and I
left about 7:15 AM to come home.  We had to stop in Evanston for fuel.  It
rained most of the way home.  It was 9 AM when we got to Randy’s.  I had forgot
that I had my truck at Randy’s so I had Randy call Mae when we got to the mouth
of Weber Canon.  When we got to Randy’s Judy told me that Mae had gone to a
Genealogy class so I didn’t hurry home.  When I got there Mae had stayed home
because I was coming home.  She is sure special.  Mae informed me that she had
got a e-mail from Joan and Ralf that told us that Ron Bradfield had fallen from
a ladder, landing on his head and was in the hospital not expected to live. 
Mae went to Sarah Porter’s baby shower with Sandy and Georgia.  While she was
gone I lay down and took a nap.  This afternoon we watched a movie on TV.  At 5
PM we went over to Ogden to eat at the Chuck-O-Rama.  Mae called Pat as we
drove to Ogden.  While she was talking to her their daughter Connie arrived so
Mae let pat go.  After eating we came back home and watched another show.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  RaNae Barney called Mae this morning about 8 AM to let us know
that Richard died during the night.  Gary Nelson called about 9 AM to tell us
that Ron had died just a few minutes after his daughter arrived last night.    We
attended church meetings.  Mae was asked if either she or I would help with the
Nursery today.  Mae said she would, for she know that I wouldn’t be excited to
do it.  Meetings went well.  Bob and Carroll invited us for dinner after
church.  Bob cooked a nice pork roast with the trimmings, very good.  We worked
on our journals and then went over to visit RaNae.  We were there about an
hour.  We got the viewing times and the funeral time.  We stopped at Irven’s
and Sandy’s to see them.  Mark and a girl friend, Angelina, were there.  We
visited for a while and then played a game of aggregation.  Mae called Pat and
got the times for Ron’s viewing and funeral services.  On the way home Mae
called Dennis and Eleanor to let them know about Ron’s passing.  She also
called Gary Nelson and tried to reach Joann and Ralph Peterson but just left a
message there.  This should prove to be an interesting week to see how the
schedule turns out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
around 6 AM.  We cleaned Mike’s rubber raft as we hadn’t done it since we used
it at Pason Lake.  It took quite a lot of scrubbing to get it clean.  I
assembled the distiller and turned it on and it seemed to be working ok but
then it shut it self off.  I tried a couple of things but it didn’t help.  After
lunch I went down to BMC West and ordered a door for Randy’s pump house.  I
also stopped at Durk’s plumbing and got an inline check valve to stop the back
flow of water after the pump turns off.  This should solve the pump problem at Randy’s
cabin.  I rolled up the boat and with some difficulty packed it into the caring
bag.   Mae made several calls in connection with the funerals.  She also was on
the internet for a while.  Bryce sent a letter expressing their sorrow at the
passing of Richard.  They asked us to give RaNae a love from them.  We also
received an e-mail from Anna Liza Buccay from Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch. 
They have a baby boy that is eight months old.  It was good to hear from them. 
This evening we did some studying of the CD that Mae received for the
conference she attended last Friday.  I called Steve Jones (the salesman who I
bought the distiller from) and told him the problems I was having.  He told me
how to adjust the water level.  I did so and the distiller seems to be working
ok now.  It was after 10:30 PM when we filled out our </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I realized
this morning that some how I had offended Mae.  It was the way I had commented
about dinner being late last night.  Sometimes I say things with out realizing
that I sound upset or criticizing but it show’s up in Mae’s eyes and actions. 
I really wish she wasn’t so sensitive or I wasn’t so strong in my speech.  I
apologized to her and we talked about it and things are better now.  After
breakfast I went over to Scott’s and got some mail that is still coming to
their place.  The main one that I have tried to get a change of address on
several time before, is my Home Depot Account.  After getting the statement
from Mishelle, I went across the street and returned a concrete marker to Kip
and of course we visited for a while.  I stopped at Home Depot and went to the
contractor’s desk and we think we were able to get the address corrected on my
statement this time.  I paid the balance off but I was surprised at the balance
total.  I stopped at Durk’s to get some help with Carla and Craig’s job but
Jarred was off today.  I will have to return tomorrow.  When I got home I did
some work on our bank statement from last months.  We had an error in our
previous months ending balance and this statements beginning balance of $500. 
Some where that error must have occurred when we changed the book keeping over
from my lap top computer to Mae’s desk top computer.  I just let the computer
enter an adjusting transaction and will not spend more time searching.  We
attended session in the Ogden Temple this afternoon.  We enjoyed the session
but I didn’t feel any inspiration as to some of the decisions we are concerned
about.  It sure wasn’t like the time I soughed for decision about building our
home in Wyoming and taking care of my mother.  After returning home I started
balancing this month’s bank statement.  I broke off to attend a High Priest
Group Leadership meeting.  After returning I continued with the statement.  It
was 11:30 PM when I completed the statement and we went to bed.  My stomach was
upset so I went to sleep in the recliner.</span></p>

AM and went into the bed for the rest of the night.  The alarm went off at 6:30
AM but it was almost 7 AM before I got up.  Mae had got all our things packed
last night that we need to take with us today.  We ate some breakfast and I
loaded the car.  It was 8 AM before we got away.  I stopped at Durk’s for a
while and worked with Jarred on the plans.  They need more work on them.  We
drove to Provo where we attended the viewing and funeral services for Ronald
Ray Bradfield.  Each of Pat and Ron’s children talked and Connie sang.  They
did a very good job and it was a special service in honor of Ron.  Joan &amp;
Ralf, Dennis &amp; Eleanor and Gary were also there.  Pat had requested that I
dedicate the grave.  We all went back to the church house for a lunch before
Mae and I came back to Mike &amp; Becky’s to tend the children while Mike &amp;
Becky went up to Park City.  We spent the evening with the children and stayed
the night.  After putting the little girls to bed we played “Knox” with Tayler
and David.  It was after 10 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

fixed breakfast and as quick as we could we left for home.  David called just
as we were leaving and asked if they could borrow the tent trailer.  Of course
we said they could and I explained some of the fetchers to him.  When we got
home I had (Mike’s) David help me and we pulled the tent trailer up to the
driveway.  We got the children settled at our home and then Mae and I went to
the viewing and funeral services for Richard Barney.  The services were good
but it went a little long.  When we got home David was just hooking up the tent
trailer.  His trailer hookup is backward to mine so I showed him how to make an
adapter for it.  Mae fixed lunch for us so we ate and then took the children to
S.L. where we went to the children’s museum.  Mae and the three girls had fun
but for David and I it was a bore.  David and I walked around and bought some
frozen yogurt.  We left the Gateway Mall about 6 PM.  We stopped a drive-in and
bought super.  We came on to Mike and Becky’s home and got the two little girls
to bed.  David, Tayler, Mae and I played some cards for a while.  David called
three or four times from Moab and had some questions about setting up the
trailer.  Thank goodness for cel phones.  I think I got them talked through the
set up.  It was after 10:30 PM when we got to bed.</span></p>

getting the family up about 8 AM, in fact it was Mattie that was up first.  She
went to sleep last night in the car and we just put her in her bed.  I went
down to The Home Depot and got some toggle bolts and came back and repaired a
shelf in Mike &amp; Becky’s closet.  Mae mixed up some pan cakes and David
&amp; I cooked some eggs.  After cleaning up from breakfast we got things
packed in the cars and drove up to Park City where Mike and Becky are staying. 
Sandy, Nick and Troy are also up there.  After taking the children to Becky,
Mae and I drove back to Salt Lake and went up to Snowbird resort.  We met Joann
and Ralf Peterson at their time share lodge and stayed with them there.  Gary
Peterson was already there.  We visited for a while and then took a ride on the
tram to the top of the mountain.  As we were coming down Dennis and Eleanor
called us and said they were at the condo.  We had left a key card there for
them so they could get in.  this evening we ate and visited and played a game
of 99.  It was a fun evening and a good time to get together.  It was almost
mid-night when we went to bed.</span></p>

packed.  By 10 AM we were out of the condo and ready to come home.  Mae and I
stopped in Bountiful and bought the 8<sup>th</sup> volume Prelude to Glory as
we are just about finished with volume 7.  We took a nap after getting
unpacked.  I did some work on my journal.  David and his family came to return
the tent trailer.  We had just eaten and so had leftovers and invited them to
stay and eat.  We visited for a while before they went home.  This evening Mae
and I went up stairs and played Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Mae and Carroll
won the game.  I finished catching up my journal and got on the internet to
check out the weather.  </span></p>

down and Bob had breakfast of biscuits and gravy about ready.  We brought the
fish up and put the two breakfasts together and ate with Bob, Carroll and
Mark.  I attended Priesthood but planned on coming home and taking a nap during
Sunday school but Irven and Sandy came over to attend meetings with us so I
stayed.  I sure had trouble staying awake both in S.S. and in Sacrament
meeting.  I didn’t get much out of either.  Bob fixed dinner for us and after
dinner we went over to Scott &amp; Mishelle’s for dinner this evening.  We left

I again completed the reading of the Book of Mormon.  As I completed the reading
of Moroni the feelings of testimony again came to me that with out question I
know this book to be true.  I know that it came forth as was said through the
gift and power of God.  I know that Joseph Smith was the one chosen and given
power to bring this translation forth from the records given him by Moroni.  I
have no dought of the account as it is given by Joseph Smith and recorded in
history.  My mind cannot conceive of any other purpose or account of the
creation of this earth than the purposes as described in this book.  I know
that there is a God in Heaven, who though His Son, Jesus Christ, created this

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Rich and I
started on the railing by 8 AM.  It was cold this morning and through out the
day but it did not rain.  We got quite a lot done.  I had Mae help with some
minor jobs but it saved us time.  She cut spindles for us and then drilled
holes in some of the railing brackets.  We ran out of screws to assemble the
railings.  At first I questioned why we should be short of screws but then I
remembered that I figured that we were going to put the spindles on 6 inch
centers.  However Rich and Lois changed their minds when Rex’s grandson got his
head caught in Rex’s stair railing.  The change doubled the number of screws we
needed.  I had Mae and Lois go to town for screws and some other material I
needed as well as to return some unneeded material.  I realized that we are
also short of railing materials.  These things have to be ordered so we will
not be able to complete the job until these materials come in next week.  It
was almost 6 PM when we quit for the day.  After dinner we watched a film about
back pain.  Mae watched the film but I fell asleep.  I took a shower this
evening before going to bed.  Mae got visiting with Lois and Elise so I think I
will go to bed with out her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast Rich and I started in on the railing.  We got three sections done and
then put finish trim on the stair way.  With the help of Rich and Mae I put all
my tools into the trailer.  Mae and I left at 11:30 AM, bringing the trailer
with us and came home.  Bob had called and said that the plain Roy and Linda
are on will be late.  Rich and Lois drove down to be with us to eat and visit
with Roy and Linda.  Mae and I went to the airport and picked up Roy and
Linda.  Rich, Lois, Bob, Carroll, Irven, Sandy, Roy, Linda, Mae and I were all
together.  We ate at the Chuck-A-Rama in Bountiful.  We did take some pictures
of all of us.  It is not every day we are all together as a family.  We took
Roy and Linda to Linda’s brother’s new home in west Kaysville.  After a while Mae
and I came home.  We will pickup Roy and Linda in the morning and take them
back to the airport in the morning.  We were sure tired tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5:45 AM and hurried to get to Mike Mayhue’s where we were to meet Roy and
Linda.  They were about 45 minutes late and though we hurried they did not make
their airplane.  We waited at the airport with instructions that they should
call us if they missed the flight.  They didn’t call by 8:30 AM so we left the
airport.  We were at the North end of 215 when they called.  They told us that
they were ok as they were rescheduled for 11 AM and were given $400 each for
the inconvenience.  They will also arrive at Fresno two hours earlier that the
other flight.  That all sounds ok to me.  When we got to Layton we stopped at
Dr. Bennett’s and Mae got a treatment.  I took a nap in the car.  We then went
out to eat at the Stare Café.  Before going home we stopped at the grocery
store for some groceries.  Mae went Visiting Teaching and I took a 45 minute
nap.  I went into Ogden to Roofer’s Supply and got materials for Sandi’s and
Randy’s jobs.  When I got home I arranged Home Teaching appointments for Sunday
afternoon, Mae took out the flowers from the planter boxes.  After eating
dinner we watched a TV show.  We worked on our journals before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM and got ready to go out to Grantsville to re-roof the carport on the South
end of Sandi’s duplex.  It was 10 AM when we got there.  Nick had taken off the
day to help me.  I sent Nick to town to get some material while I took off the
old roofing.  Logan also came over from school to help as he had a couple of
classes off today.  We put a slop to the roof so the water would not set on
it.  We laid Ice &amp; Snow shield over the new underlayment.  It was cold all
day and looked like storm this evening.  I was concerned that the wing might
blow the Ice &amp; Snow layer off so we tried to heat it with my torch.  It
worked some but was very slow.  Nick had to go to a football game so Steve came
out and helped me.  Sandi’s tenant bought us a week burning torch to use and
that worked much better.  We were able to get the roof completely dried in
before we quite this evening.  Sandy didn’t feel well so we stayed home from
the football game and watched a movie called “The Last of the Dog Soldiers”. 
It was a good story but the language was a little ruff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
after eating breakfast Sandi, Nick, Mae and I went over to Chelci’s and saw
their new home.  It is a nice home and the are decorating it very nice.  Chelci
then joined us and we went over to Brad and JaNae’s home.  It is very nice and
Brad has really worked at building a very nice home.  I do get a little
concerned as to whether or not the Lord is pleased with these large homes. 
After taking Chelci home we went to a Maverick and bought  a frozen yogurt
before going on home.  It has been warn with the sun shining so with the sun on
the South the Ice &amp; Snow really warmed up and sealed it self to the
underlayment.  I mopped on a “Top Coat Surface Sealant SB” to finish the roof. 
Nick and Logan cleaned up the mess and hauled the trash away.  We picked up all
my tools and Mae &amp; I came on home.  I took a little extra material back to
Home Depot for refund.  Mae had dinner ready so we ate.  I figured Sandi’s bill
and caught my journal up.  Mae worked on her journal for a while.  We went
upstairs and played Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Bob and I won tonight.  When
we got downstairs we took our showers so it was almost mid-night when we went
to bed.</span></p>

7:30 but Mae didn’t get up until 8:30.  Bob came down about that time and said
he would have breakfast of biscuits and gravy.  We sure enjoyed that and had
just started getting ready for church when the phone rang and I was asked if
Mae and I would teach the Sunbeams today.  I said yes and they told me that
they would run a manual over to us.  We had to hurry to prepare a lesson and
get to church.  It went well with the two of working together.  I had trouble
staying awake in Sacrament meeting.  Mae had to keep hold of me to stop me from
falling off the bench.  Bob invited us to eat dinner with them.  Irven and
Sandy also ate with us.  I took a nap after dinner.  Bob and I went Home
Teaching.  We visited with Brother and Sister Fallis, Patriarch and Sister
Johnston.  We then had a new family assigned so we found their home.  When the
husband answered the door he preferred that we not come.  I ask if we could
just stop to see if they were all ok and would not ask any more.  He agreed to
that arrangement.  Mae has been working on her journal while I was gone.  I
filled in my journal and we got ready for bed.  </span></p>

4:30 with the goal to be on the road by 7 AM.  We didn’t make it until 7:30 and
then stopped to get natural gas.  It was 9 AM when we got to Pocatello.   Rich
and I went into town to get the materials we had ordered.  The two post caps
were not on the order.  They will have to yet order them but they aren’t
critical.  We got a jig built to assemble the railing for the main stairs but
we needed longer screws so we went into Lowe’s this evening to get them.  We
stopped at Jeff and Joyce’s as Jeff is sick again.  Janet came out this evening
so after Rich and I returned we played a game of Mormon Bridge.  Before going
to bed we watched a DVD put out by the Constitutional Party on the issues that
are facing our nation.  It does not look very good.  It was 10:30 before we got
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Rich and I
worked all day building and installing the four sections of the main stair
railings.  It was dark when we came in for super.  We did walk over and look at
Ratlif’s house.  It certainly isn’t worth the $129,000 he is asking for it.  We
just looked at it and could see several cheap things in the construction.  I am
glad that we looked at so I have no questions as to weather or not we should
have considered it to purchase.  I took a shower after we ate super.  We then
played a game of Mormon Bridge and two hands of Knock.  I loaded the software
for Lois’s new printer onto my computer so I could print a copy of Elise’s
balance report.  I think that was a mistake as it took a long time and quite a
bit of memory.  It was 11 PM before I got to bed.</span></p>

breakfast Rich and I again started work on the railing.  It was about 1 PM when
we completed the job and started cleaning up.  Mae packed the things that were
in the house and brought them out to me.  it was after 2 PM when we started
home.  It started snowing just a few minutes before we finished the railing so
the worked out ok for us.  When we got home we unpacked and I took all my tools
out to the trailer and put them away.  We took showers and at 6 PM went over to
Charles and Carolyn Saunders for dinner and to play games.  Carolyn had made
Lazona and Mae brought a toss salad.  After eating we played a fun card game. 
We came home shortly after 9 PM.  Mae and Lois had gone to town to a grand
opening sale for Albertson’s in Pocatello.  Mae had bought some roast and
chicken so we sealed most of it in the seal-a-meal bags.  We filled in journals
before going to bed.</span></p>

about 7 AM and read my scriptures.  I went back to bed and we turned the TV on
and watched Little House on the Prairie and cuddled.  I cooked egg omelets in a
bag for breakfast.  It has been a lazy morning.  I helped Mark chop the corn
stocks to be tilled into the garden area.  I repaired the tires on the scooter
and road it a while.  Mae got on the computer and checked the E-mails for we
have several.  She answered many of them.  I went to town, filed the truck with
gas, bought a switch for Randy’s cabin and some filters for the car and truck. 
I serviced the car and then loaded some items that I need to return to Bryce’s
place.  This evening after eating dinner we watched a movie on TV.  I then
filled in this journal and we went to bed and watched a DVD that Roy and Linda brought
us.  Well I have to change that entry as our DVD player won’t read the DVD’s. 
we ended up watching “Night Ride Home”  which was pretty good but it sure made
you grateful that we have the Gospel of Jesus Christ to give us an
understanding of the purpose of life.  It was mid-night when we went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 7
AM for the bathroom and read my scriptures.  I am reading the D&amp;C and I
can’t help marvel at the consistence of the scriptures and the teachings and
function of the Church.  To me common sense gives reason to know that the
Church is true and complete.  Why my boys can’t see that is a mystery to me. 
Mae got up at 8 AM and we took showers.  Bob came down before we finished
invited us to breakfast of waffles.  Breakfast was delicious.  It was 10 AM
when we came downstairs.  Mae went to Dr. Bennett’s, walking and did some
shopping.  I took a nap and then got on the computers and played around,
backing up my palm and playing games.  After several games of Solitaire I won
one.  I worked quite a while on Mae’s history and found a second history almost
the same.  I was unable to decide which history Mae wanted so I had to wait for
her to review them.  Mae got on the two computers to compare the files.  I
returned several items to Bryce’s home.  Bob and I then cut up some of the
trees in the back yard.  We worked until we were tired.  I worked on Mae’s
files for a while.  We went upstairs and played Canasta with Bob and Carroll. 
Mae and Carroll won again tonight.  I finished transferring Mae’s history to
her computer and then filled out my journal for today.</span></p>

back and cut up more of the trees we had cut down earlier this summer.  Mae
went shopping with Tina Linderman to get material so that Tina can fix Mae’s
new dress.  They also went out to dinner.  I had planed on watching the BYU
football game but Scott called and ask for my help to run wires for a surround
sound system.  Mark came down and asks to use some of our books and asked about
the sealing power.  We visited for an hour before I went over to Scott’s.  I
had to leave Scott’s at 3 PM as I had an appointment to visit with Durk about
Carla and Craig’s heat system.  I need to do much more figuring on it.  We went
up to David and Shauna’s for dinner and to be with Tyler on his Birthday.  It
was 11 PM before we got home.  We then filled in our journals before going to
bed.</span></p>

change off of day light saving time we got an extra hour this morning.  After
breakfast I got a short nap.  We got a new Bishopric to day.  Brother Steve
Smith was called to be Bishop.  He chose Brother Mark McPhie and Brother
Thurman as counselors.  We don’t know Brother Thurman as he has been a clerk in
the Singles Ward.  After meeting we went down to the LDS Hospital in SL and saw
Sister Robin Walker.  She was involved in a auto accident last Tuesday and will
be recovering for some time.  This evening we went to Jeff and Gail’s for
dinner and played games after.  It was 10:30 PM when we got home.  I made a
call to Craig and Carla and to Randy after getting home.  Well I am tired so
will call this good for tonight.</span></p>

it was 79” over all and I needed 76”.  We decided to do all other items and
then take the door back tomorrow.  I worked until 6 PM when I stopped for
dinner and went right back to work.  I finished and loaded every thing up.  We

and when we did wake up we stayed in bed longer.  I tried to get reservations
at Strawberry Reservoir lodge for Friday night but they are closed for the
season.  I was able to get reservation at Daniel’s Summit.  I had several
things to go to town after so this afternoon was spent chasing.  Mae also did
some chasing this afternoon.  This evening Mae went over to Jeff and Gail’s and
spent the evening with them.  I went to help Scott run the wires to his speaker
but a lot of his time was spent in answering the door for Trick-or-Treaters.  I
got home before Mae and took a shower to clean the saw dust and insulation
off.  When Mae got home we tried to clean the DVD player but it still doesn’t
work.  We started to watch Perry Mason but both of us fell asleep.  We didn’t
get any Trick-or-Treaters at our place as we are in back.  Even Bob &amp;
Carroll only get a few as most of the children stay in the sub-divisions where
there are more homes.</span></p>
