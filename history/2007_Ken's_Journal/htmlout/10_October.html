<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and sure enjoyed being just the two of us.  It was 12 noon when we got away. 
Our camp host was upset with us that we hadn’t got out by 11 AM.  As we were
going through Springdale Mae saw some flowers that she wanted to have a picture
of.  I stopped and let her out to take the picture but she was out of power.  I
went over to the Service station and bought her some new batteries.  While I
was gone Mae went over to the church house and set on the lawn.  When I came
out she called for me to come over by her.  There was a large Tarantula that
she had almost set on.  It left the church lawn and crossed the sidewalk and
then started across the road.  We were afraid that it would get ran over so I
got a stick and chased it across the road.  I had to stop a couple of cars
until it moved out of the road.  One driver thanked me for protecting the
Tarantula.  We did take some pictures of it.  We also got the pictures of the
flower that Mae wanted.  We traveled on down the road and stopped at a Café
where we ate a late breakfast.  We traveled on home, stopping for gas and dinner. 
I have been in quite a lot of pain through out the day.  I am not sure what I
have eaten that has set it off.  It is always a worry to me when I have this
affect me this way, for I wonder if it will yet come back on me and Doctor
Warden’s predictions may yet happen.  It was 9 PM when we got home.  We stopped
for gas and had a detour through Kanosh as the freeway was closed because of a
dust storm and a wreck.  We also had three stops for natural gas and we stopped
for dinner.  It started raining just after we got home.  We got most things
brought in and put away.  Mae put things away and unpacked the suit cases.  I
caught my journal up to date before we went to bed.  It has bee a long day and
I am very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 4:30 AM for the bathroom and then went back to bed.  We got up a little
later and took showers.  Mae did some washing, unpacking and repacking to go down
to Mike and Becky’s tomorrow.  I put the tent trailer away and brought the boat
up closer to the house so we could use the vacuum to clean it our.  It was
really a mess and took a lot of work to get it clean.  I went over to Grant and
Stacy’s and checked out some problems they are having with their house.  I had
called Sandi about the work she wants done but she was not able to get the
information back to me until this evening.  after I left Grant’s I was going to
Scott’s to paint their patio cover but Mishelle called and they are not sure
yet if they will paint or stain.  Mae cooked a very nice dinner of fish, baked
potatoes and squash.  When I couldn’t do Scott and Mishelle’s I came back and
with Mark’s help finished cleaning and waxing the boat.  Bob made a delicious
apple pie and bought me some yogurt to go on top of it.  It was very good.  I
filled out this entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night so was slow getting started.  Mae was up early and
finished packing.  She wanted to leave early as she is concerned about the
morning traffic.  It was 7:30 AM and she had to stop for gas and her front
tires are a little low.  Bob prepared breakfast for me.  I worked most of the
morning on Sandi’s project.  I put the boat away and talked with Grant about
his needs.  He wants me to do the needed repairs.  I went to Home Depot and
priced out Sandi’s material list.  I worked on Randy’s estimate for a hydronic
heat system for his new home.  After getting some super I watch a show and
quite for the day.  I called Mae and told her I wouldn’t be down this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got ready,
took my trailer and went out to Tooele.  I left my trailer in Sandi’s garage
and went to Home Depot where I purchased the items for Sandi and Nick’s
project.  I took the purchase up to their new home, put a new electrical cord
on Sandi’s clothes dryer and then drove to American Fork.  Mae and I went to
the football game between American Fork High and Lehi High 9<sup>th</sup>
grade.  David played on American Forks team and really did well.  It was
special to watch him play.  American Fork won 26 to 6.  Mae had dinner ready
when we got home.  David and I went to Orem where I filled my pickup with
Natural gas.  We also stopped at the store and purchased a few items for Mae. 
I spent a little time on my computer to fill my journal with today’s data.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I drove out
to Tooele and worked about 6 hours getting the shelves and storage room
painted.  It took over four gallons of paint of paint to paint the one room. 
That is how much it took to paint all the walls in our apartment.  I guess there
is a lot of surface area with all the shelving.  I got home fairly early and we
relaxed and watched a show on TV.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 7 AM and Mae got up about 8 AM.  Mae went to work preparing to go out to
Sandi’s.  I went to the store and while I was there I saw some flowers so
bought them for Mae.  That made her happy.  We went out about 4 PM.  We had
watched the two session of General Conference and I thought that Brad, Nick,
and Logan would be going to General Priesthood meeting with me.  However just
Logan went with me and he was late getting ready.  When we got back to the
house Sandi and Mon were busy putting things away from the move and wanted
every thing ready for tomorrow.  It was after mid-night before they quite so we
didn’t have time to play any games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 7
AM but Mae and the rest didn’t get up until after 8 AM so we had to hurry to
have breakfast in time to watch General Conference.  All of our family, except
for Shellie’s family, came out after the morning session.  We had a nice lunch
and part of us watched the afternoon session of conference.  I don’t know if
Conference is a good time to get together as some wants to watch Conference and
others wants to just visit.  I don’t have the answer for it.  It was a good day
and we got home about 7:30 PM.  I worked on my journal trying to get it up to date. 
After listening to President Iring’s talk about his journal, I really wonder if
my journal is worth much.  It was after 9:30 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 AM to go to Sandi and Nick’s.  It was a little after 8 AM when I arrived. 
I worked most of the morning getting electrical wiring pulled.  At noon I
stopped for lunch and then started sheet rocking but only got two sheets hung
as I had to do some framing around a drain pipe.  Sandi called and said that
the company wants to move the hot tub on the 11<sup>th</sup>.   I went to
Grantsville and checked out the hot tub.  It is too heavy for me to move so I
got the electrical disconnected.  I helped move a couple of items before
starting home.  It was after 8 PM when I got home.  Bob had done some work on
his plumbing last week while we were gone.  He had shut the house water off and
when he turned it back on the tap leaked.  Mae went in the bedroom and stepped
into water.  Bob tried to vacuum it up but his vacuum isn’t strong enough.  Mae
called me and I brought my shop vacuum home.  I drew out another gallon and a
half and then inserted the hose under the carpet and turned it to blow.  I will
let it blow all night and see if it is dry tomorrow.  I worked on statements
for a while and then filled in my journal.  I will now take a shower and go to
bed.  It is almost 11 PM.  I am tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as I am not going to Sandi and Nick’s today.  After eating breakfast I went
over to Irven and Sandy’s where I assembled a shower stool and a handicap
toilet seat.  I was going to put up a railing but Sandy couldn’t decide where
or how she wanted it.  We will wait until Irven gets home.  Bryce came over
just as I was going to leave so we visited for a while.  I went over to the
Layton Shoe store to get my boots that I had taken in to have repaired.  They
weren’t ready so I will come back again.  I went over to Durk’s and bought some
parts for Sandi and Nick’s job.  This afternoon Mae and I went over to the shoe
store again and looked at new work boots.  The fellow that is working there
wasn’t much help so we came home.  They have opened the round-a-bout on the
corner for use now.  I watched a show on TV and Mae worked on her book club
preparations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30 AM and left before 7 AM for Sandi’s.  I went to Grantsville and finished
removing the electrical from the hot tub.  I worked the rest of the day getting
a new power line ran for the hot tub.  It required running 80 feet of new line
from the main power box to a box close to the hot tub.  I had to work with live
power as you are to be a licensed electrician in order to hook up to a main
panel.  I also ran some more lines inside and mounted some outlet boxes.  I
left for home about 4 PM.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home so I ate,
showered and went Home Teaching with Bob.  Mae also went Visiting Teaching this
evening.  I tried to work on my books and my journal this evening.  It was
11:30 PM when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up very early as it was late when we went to bed last night.  Mae and I talked
it over and we decided that I would stay at Sandi and Nick’s tonight as Mae
will have her Book Club tonight.  It was 9:15 AM when I got out to Sandi’s.  I
worked until after 5 PM when I quite.  I showered and changed and went to the
Grantsville girl’s volleyball game with Nick.  Sandi was already there as she
is keeping score for the game.  When we got home I called and visited with
Mae.  Sandi then help me with my book keeping form changing it to an Excel
form.  We got most of the form working now.  I filled in my journal and we went
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM and studied for a while before going in to get something for breakfast.  I
couldn’t find anything so I went to Mc Donald’s and go something.  I went on
down to Home Depot and got some sheetrock corners.  I finished sheet rocking
the room which took some adjusting the window seals as they were not even.  I
but on the corners and then after eating some lunch I put the first coat of mud
on.  It was 4:30 PM by the time I finished and got ready to go home.  Due to
heavy traffic it was 6:15 PM when I got home.  I showered and then Mae got me
some dinner.  Carroll had problems last night with her heart so Bob called the
Doctor who had him take her into the E. R. area of the hospital.  I guess she
will be there for a couple of days.  David and Shauna brought the children for
us to tend while they went out to eat with some of their friends.  It was about
10 PM when they came back.  We went to bed about 11 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning and got up after 8 AM.  I slept most of the night in the recliner
but didn’t sleep very well.  After getting something for breakfast I helped
Mark for a couple of hours.  I then went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and left
the blinds that we were going to use  in front of our windows.  They also had
the money they owed for there patio cover.  I stopped at the Layton Shoe Store
and got my cowboy boots that they repaired for me.  I then went to Irven and
Sandy’s to install some handicap bars but they didn’t want then installed.  I
check there water distiller and found that it was full of water and did not
turn on until it called for more water.  As soon as I removed some of the water
it worked just fine.  We went to Maddock’s in Brigham City this evening and
took Irven and Sandy with us.  When we came back to their place and played
games for a while.  We stopped at the grocery store for a few minutes and got a
couple of items we need.  I filled out my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
slept in and then we lay in bed and watched the Tabernacle Choir performance
and also a replay of General Conference.  I especially enjoyed President
Hinckley’s testimony and I felt that if for no other reason than President
Hinckley has lived such a perfect life that if he can say that he knows the
Church is true and that he can bear solemn testimony that Jesus is the Christ
and Savior of the world, then I can also know if for no other reason that these
things are true.  I do however have my own personal testimony that I have had
bourn by the Holy Ghost.  We attended the block program and was very tired when
we finished with nursery.  We had 18 children there today and it was something
else.  Even though I was tired I enjoyed the testimony’s that were given
today.  I sure love the Gospel and what understanding of life and the purpose
of it that the Gospel gives me.  I just hope that some how David and Jeff can
have their understanding opened and the Spirit return to them.  After meetings
we got some dinner and then Mae went with me to take a cake over to the Case’s
as tomorrow will be their Wedding Anniversary.  We then went to the McKay Dee
hospital where we visited with Jeanenne and Carroll.  Both are doing some
better although the Doctors don’t know what is causing Carroll’s problems. 
After returning home I took the garbage out to the street.  I called Grant and we
decided that I will go out to Sandi’s tomorrow and when I return I will bring
my tools back and repair Grant’s roof.  I will then go back to finish Sandi’s
project.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Almost
everyday I seem to relate my scripture study with my two boys.  Alma was
concerned for his son Alma and because of his faith and prayers the Lord sent
an Angle to awaken Alma the younger to his wrong doings.  I pray continually
that the Lord will soften the hearts of Jeff and David.  I worked at Sandi’s
today getting the second coat of mud applied, installed a expansion tank on the
water line and got the electrical done in the north basement bedrooms.  I also
worked on the hot tub getting it so we can change the position of the tub.  It
was almost 7 PM when I got home but I also stopped and filled up with gas.  Mae
had dinner ready and after eating I filled in this entry.  David called me
today and said that he had talked to the Doctors that are treating Carroll.  He
said the two Doctors are very complaint in their profession.  They told David
that they do not think that it is Carroll’s heart that is the problem.  She is
loosing blood and she has some kind of infection in the blood.  They are doing
test to try to find the problem.  Right now they are just guessing from the
symptoms, but it may be cancer.  We read from the Priesthood / Relief Society
manual some of the lessons we have missed as we are in the nursery and miss
Priesthood and Relief Society.  The on lesson and a comment Mae made left me
with some concerns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well and woke quite depressed.  That feeling stayed with me all
day.  We went up to Jennie’s which took a couple of hours and $250 less in out
account.  I tried to get with Grant to check out the needs for his project but
Stacy wasn’t home.  He said that she would be there in about an hour so I went
over.  She never did come so most of my time was wasted.  I am a little
concerned about doing this job but I don’t know how to get out of it.  I rented
a carpet cleaner from Universal rental and cleaned the carpet in the spare
bedroom.  Mae cooked some very good stew for dinner.  We invited Mark to eat
with us.  Brother and Sister Thompson came for a home teaching visit.  As mark
was Mark was downstairs we had him stay.  Bob came home from the hospital so we
invited him down also.  I worked on the computer for a while getting my mileage
charts up to date and set up a statement for Grant and Stacy.  I moved some of
the things that were in the hallway so we could get in our  bedroom and then
entered this journal entry.  I also wrote of an experience I remembered from my
youth and put it in with the some of my other memories.  We were late getting
to bed.</span></p>

after 6 AM but Mae hadn’t slept very well so I let her sleep until 7 am.  She
got up and got my breakfast and a lunch for me to take.  It is raining this
morning so I went back out to Sandi’s.  it was 10 AM when I got there but I
worked until 5:30 PM.  I left my trailer there as it looks like we will have
rain again tomorrow.  It was almost 8 PM when I got home.  Mae had the freezer
cleaned out but hadn’t got the food put back into it when I got home.  She had
gone over to have her Temple </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae went out
to Sandi’s with me.  We took our clothes so we could stay over.  This way I
won’t have to drive back tonight. As Mae and I were looking out the back window
we saw two fauns running in the back area.  They were just having a great time
running and jumping.  Then the doe came running straight to them and suddenly
both fauns stopped.  They came back to where the mother was and followed her
back into the cover.  It was such a fun experience, watching the doe train her
fauns.  I worked until about 6 PM when we ate dinner that Mae had prepared.  We
then went to Sandi and Nick’s old home in Grantsville and helped them move more
of their things.  They have moved the hard way by trying to take a load at a
time.  After returning we went down to the Maverick where we bought some frozen
yogurts.  We played a game of marbles with Sandi and Nick before going to bed. 
Sandi and Mae won.</span></p>

3 PM.  it was just about 5 AM before we got to Jeff and Gail’s.  They had
invited us to spend the evening with them.  After eating a nice dinner we

where we enjoyed the evening eating, playing games and visiting.  It was almost
11 PM when we got home.  Mae and I stayed up and watched a John Wayne movie,
the Island in the Sky.  It was very late when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8 AM.  We mainly relaxed this morning.  We watched the Tabernacle Choir Broadcast
and then watched a BYU Idaho devotional in which Elder Oaks and his wife
spoke.  After that we watched a short movie of a young man that gets laid of
his job.  Discouraged as he drives home he sees an older lady with a flat
tire.  He stops and helps her but won’t except any money for his services.  The
lady thanks him and drives on.  The next scene shows the Lady go into a
restraint to get something to eat.  The waitress that helps her is very
pregnant and tired but service with pleasantness.  As the lady finishes a bowl
of soup and the waitress asks if she can get anything else the lady just asks
for the bill.  The lady hands her a $100 dollar bill and while the waitress
goes to get change the lady writes a note that says the change if for the baby
and have a good night.  The waitress returns to find the note and the lady
gone.  The next scene shows the waitress returning home late and her husband is
asleep on the couch.  When he turns over it is the young man that got laid
off.  It was just a neat show.  We next watched a rerun of a talk that
President Hinckley gave while President Benson was still alive.  We attended
our block program and served in the nursery for our last time as we were told
that we will be released from the nursery today.  At one point I looked over
and saw Mae with three children in her arms as she set on the floor playing
with several children.  We had 19 children between 18 months and three years
old in the nursery today.  This has been a good experience but a hard and
tiring one.  We had a simple lunch this afternoon but a very good one.  Mae is
a wonderful wife, home maker and sweetheart.  Julie Ann and Phillip came by to
visit for a few minutes.  They are up here on an anniversary / business trip
and took the opertunity for Phil to meet some of Julie Ann’s family.  We also
listened to part of the Republican Presidential debate.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went out to
Sandi’s again today.  The traffic on the freeway came to almost a stop right
after I got on the road.  It took me almost an hour to get to Kaysville.  I
still made it to Sandi &amp; Nick’s by 8 AM.  it took me most of the day to get
the three rooms prepped for painting.  I decided to stay over and work late
tonight so I could get the primer coat on before I quite tonight.  It was after
7:30 PM when I quite.  I took a shower in order to get the paint off my face
and hair.  Sandi and Nick had bought large chef salads for dinner tonight. 
Eating so late I know that I could not lay down to sleep so I slept in the
recliner tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got started
at 7 AM and painted the craft room.  I had enough paint to do the small play
room so I called Sandi and ask if she wanted it done.  She did so I painted
that and then started on the desk.  I got the main framing done and the top
almost cut out.  I was able to make some adjustments to my door jig and am able
to rout out the holes for the electrical boxes.  I cleaned my paint pump and
filled it with a protector.  I was able to mount the desk frame to the walls. 
I wanted to put the desk top in the frame but at 5:30 PM I quite and came home.
Mae was talking to Jeff on the phone when I got home.  He is sure having a struggle
with life and I don’t know how to help him.  I am sure that getting back to
building his testimony about the church and a purpose for life would shore help
him.  I think he needs professional help also.  Mae has been very busy while I
have been gone.  She has put up grape juice, done the washing, cleaned out the
storage room and just worked to hard.  Bob had made some noodles with chicken
so that is what we ate for dinner tonight.  We watch a show on TV.  I caught my
computer files and journal up to date.  Mae is going to go out Sandi’s with me
and we will plan on staying tomorrow evening.  I hope I can complete it by
then.  I am sure tired tonight.  I will take a shower, shave and go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30 AM and started getting ready to go out to Sandi’s.  Mae got up an prepared
breakfast.  By the time I ate I was so tired that I changed my mind and just
went back to bed.  We woke about 9:30 AM and relaxed in bed a while longer.  We
decided to attend the Temple and so went into town.  I took the boat into
Peterson’s and left it there to winterize for me.  we then stopped at Best Buy
and bought some ink cartridges for our printer.  We then went to the Red Wing
store and I bought a pair of work boots.  It was after 3 PM when we got to the
Temple.  I haven’t felt the best today but we enjoyed the Temple session.  We
went out to eat at the Sizzler and then got gas in the truck before coming on
home.  We visited with Bob as we don’t know just what the situation is with
Carroll.  Bob had me help give Carroll a blessing before we left today.  She is
really having difficulty moving at all.  Carroll is to large for Bob to carry
her so we are not sure just what or how to help.  Mae went up this evening and
mopped the bathroom floor and cleaned the bathroom.  I called Sandi and told
her I would be out in the morning but I am not sure if Mae will go with me or
not.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae came with
me to Sandi and Nick’s.  We left at 6:45 AM but had heavy traffic and so it was
8:30 AM when we got here.  I went right to work.  Mae worked on her scrap books
most of the day.  I took a nap after eating lunch so it was a hour lunch
break.  JaNae came over this afternoon with her children.  Mae had dinner ready
when Sandi and Nick came home.  It was 6 PM when I quite this evening.  I
didn’t get as much done as I wanted to.  Brad and JaNae left the children here
while they went out for dinner.  When Brad and JaNae came back they stayed and
visited until after 10 PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
thinking about the work I have to complete.  I worked on the table most of the
morning and then worked on the suspended ceiling.  My stud finder quite working
so I had Mae go to Home Depot and buy me a new one.  It took me a while to
figure out the square of the room.   I got the grid all hung but still have the
rivets to add and some more suspension wires to add.  I was installing some
support bracing and nailed a water line with my nail gun.  I was in luck and
had parts in my trailer to repair the water line.  Sandi and Nick were going
out to eat dinner so we decided to stay home and just have something light. 
Mae helped Sandi and Nick with some pictures and time soon went.  It was late
when we went to eat at Apple Bee’s.  It was very good but I will have to sleep
in the recliner after eating that late.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept most
of the night in the recliner.  We slept in but I started work at 8 AM.  Mae
called me when she had breakfast ready.  I worked all day getting the room
finished.  Mae came down and helped me several times.  After we finished with
the work we then had to clean up and load all my tools.  That took us over an
hour.  Sandi cooked some home pizza for dinner and they were really good.  It
was 10 PM when we got home.  We took showers before going to bed and then
watched a movie on DVD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early for a few minutes and then went back to bed.  I slept until after 8 AM. 
I received a call from Brother Francom our ward executive secretary asking me
to meet with the Bishop at 12:30 PM.  I got breakfast ready this morning while
Mae started dinner.  Mae went with me to visit with Bishop Smith.  I was called
to be a Ward Family History Specialist.  That will be a new calling for me that
I have need of training in.  It was nice to attend Priesthood Meeting and
Sunday School.  When we got home from meetings I help Mae get ready for
dinner.  Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley came over for dinner.  After dinner
Kylan and I throw the foot ball for a few minutes.  Scott, Kylan, Mae and I
played a game of marbles.  It was nice to visit with Scott and Mishelle and the
children for a while this afternoon.  I am sure tired this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 7 AM.  Bob and Carroll wanted to leave about 8:30 AM so that they could
be the first at the clinic and not have to wait so long as they did before.  I
helped get Carroll to the car and that was a job.  I told them to call me
before they left the clinic and I would be here to help get her back into the
house.  I ate breakfast and then started to build a temporary ramp when Bob
called and said they were on their way home.  I had to have Carroll wait while
I finished building the ramp but it worked and there would have been on way to
have got her into the house with out the ramp.  Mae went up and mopped the
kitchen floor and did some cleaning while they were gone.  I explained to Bob
and Carroll that Carroll’s leg may get some better but they couldn’t expect it
to be better than it was before this last problem occurred.  Even then it was
hard for Carroll to clime up the stairs.  Therefore I suggested that we build a
permanent ramp in the garage.  It will mean that we have to clean out some of
the things in the garage and move others but it can be done.  I guess we will
do that after I get Grant’s and Scott’s jobs done.  I went over to Scott’s and
replaced the GFI outlet in the bathroom as it had burned out.  It was 1 PM when
I got to Home Depot to get some materials for Grant’s.  I worked until 5 PM
finding the areas that leaked in the roof.  It looks like the problem all comes
from the valley not being shingled right.  After I got home and cleaned up we
went over to Jeff and Gail’s and had FHE with they and Scott’s family.  We had
dinner when we first got there.  After eating, the full time Elders came and
presented the lesson.  It was an enjoyable evening.  After returning home I
worked on my books and filled in this entry.  It was 11 PM before we got to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up but
about 7 I went back to bed for a while.  It was 9 AM when I left for work. 
Aunt Beth called me as I was driving out the driveway.  She has a water
problem.  The neighbor on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor left the water running in
the bath tub and it flooded the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> floors.  I
got fans and put under Beth’s carpet but the neighbor on the 2<sup>nd</sup>
floor was at work.  It was 10:30 when I got to Grant’s.  I installed more metal
flashing under the shingles in the valley and stopped the leakage in that
area.  I removed the swamp cooler vent pipe and filled in the hole.  I removed
shingles in that area and installed ice and snow sheeting over that complete
area.  I will now re-shingle that area of the roof.  I quite and came home at 4
PM.  I showered and changed then Bib and I went Home Teaching to the Fallis’s. 
When we returned home Mae and I ate dinner.  I worked on my computer for a
while.  Mae went with me as I went to check on Aunt Beth.  I had to set the
fans in another area that just got wet today.  I checked with the owner on the
2<sup>nd</sup> level and she has quite a bit of sheetrock damage.  Aunt Beth’s
is not that bad.  I recommended that they contact a restoration company for
bids on both units.  Also they could make contact with an attorney as to legal
responsibility.  It was after 9 PM when we got back home.  We soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM but Mae was not in bed.  That means the she didn’t sleep very good.  She
came in from the front room where she had slept in the recliner.  I had her go
back to bed and sleep longer.  She had already prepared my lunch and had
breakfast set out for me.  She is sure special.  I disconnected my trailer and
left it in the street in front of the house.  Bob parked his car in front of
the trailer so no one could hook on to the trailer while I am gone.  I went
over to Aunt Beth’s and got the fans and returned them to the rental company. 
Aunt Beth gave me a check for the rental amount.  I didn’t charge her for my
time.  I went to Roofer’s Supply in Ogden where I purchased the shingles for
Grant’s job.  I then went to Riverdale and picked up my boat from Peterson’s
Marine’s.  I had them winterize it and change the oil.  I next stopped at The
Home Depot and purchased a 10 foot step ladder so I could get to the ceiling in
Grant’s home.  It cost me $200.00 but if I were to fall that would be cheap.  I
worked at Grant’s and got the two areas of ceiling repaired.  When I was
repairing the ceiling in the small bedroom I bumped the ceiling fan and it
fell.  Grant had installed that fan and hadn’t put proper bracing to carry the
load.  I added bracing to the ceiling so that it will hold the fan this time. 
After putting the first coat of mud on the patches I carried the three bundles
of shingles up to the roof so I can start shingling tomorrow.  It was 5 PM when
I left the job.  I was very tired when I got home.  Mae prepared dinner while I
showered and shaved.  After eating we watched two shows on cable TV.  We didn’t
have anyone come Trick-or-Treating this evening but that is normal for where we
live.  I filled out some invoices and my journal before we went to bed.  Mae
was updating her Birthday Calendar and commented that the month has sure gone
by fast.  </span></p>
