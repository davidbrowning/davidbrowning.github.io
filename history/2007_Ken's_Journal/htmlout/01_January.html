<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
the recliner part of the night as I had eaten too much junk food at Irven and
Sandy’s last night.  I was able to get into bed about 2:30 AM and slept
better.  We got up about 7 AM and got some breakfast.  We packed the car and
went out to Sandi’s.  I went up to The Home Depot and picked up some
materials.  This afternoon I repaired the toilet and replaced the sink faucet
in the basement bathroom.  I left for home shortly after 5 PM.  I stopped and
got me a hamburger and some fries for dinner and to keep me awake as I drove
home.  Mae cleaned Sandi’s fridge and put her Christmas decorations away.  She
will stay out with Sandi for a few days while Sandi is recuperation from an
operation.  I watched TV for a couple of hours and then filled in this journal
entry before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
the recliner mainly because I didn’t want to make the bed this morning.  I got
some breakfast and then tried to call Randy.  They didn’t answer so while
waiting I worked on my construction files for the year end.  I also made a
revived statement that I will try this year.  I got my mileage for last year
caught up to date.  My phone is not working when I push the “0” key.  I had to
go to Home Depot for some material for the computer cabinet I an building so on
the way I stopped and got my slippers from the shoe shop.  I took my phone to
T-Mobil but they couldn’t fix it so they suggested I go to Global at the mall. 
He replaced the key pad for $5.  I set up tools in the garage and started
making the shelf for Sandi.  I quite after 6 PM and got me something to eat.  Randy
called and said that they had just got back from the cabin.  Last night I
dreamed that Randy had problems with the pump and it had frozen.  I asked him
how the pump worked and he said that the light had burned out and the pump
froze and broke.  I watched a show on the Hallmark Channel and then showered
before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM and was down to Randy’s shortly after 8 AM.  It took me until 1:15 PM to
finish hooking them up to the sewer.  I came home and fixed myself some lunch. 
Georgia called to let us know that Rick went in this morning to have his back
operated on.  He is doing fine and will be able to go home this afternoon. 
Georgia said that he has already been walking and doesn’t have the pain that he
has had for several years.   I finished building the shelf for Sandi.  While I
was working on that, Dennis Whimpey came and wanted to set up an appointment to
talk about final arrangements.  Mae had replied to an advertisement for more
information.  I set a time for Monday at 10 AM.  I finished up with the shelf
and cleaned up my tools and the mess in the garage so Bob and Carroll can get
their car in the garage.  I cleaned up and went out to Grantsville to be with
Mae.  Sandi still needs help so it is good to be there with her.  I put a coat
of cherry stain on the shelf.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did sleep
in although Mae got up to wake Logan for school.  It snowed today so I shoveled
the back porch off and part of the driveway.  I went downtown and bought more
parts for the downstairs sink faucet.  I had started to repair it but the parts
that I bought yesterday were wrong.  When I came back Mae had lunch ready so I
went to the kitchen sink and washed my hands.  When I turned the water on there
it back flowed and Mae hollered that water was going all over the basement bathroom.  
I hadn’t thought about that when I washed my hands.  We had to clean that up. 
After lunch I repaired the sink.  I put another coat of stain on the shelf but
this time I used a mahogany stain.  It came out pretty good.  This evening we
went over to JaNae and Brads for dinner.  Brad had prepared a Spanish dish that
was very good.  We then watched the DVD that we had given Logan as a Christmas
gift.  It was called the “The Invincible” and was taken from a true story of a
football player.  It was very good but I couldn’t understand most of the words
because of the surround sound.  I think the bass was too high.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Logan’s alarm
again went of at 7:15 AM but he just turned it off and didn’t get up.  Mae
again got up and woke him but he said he didn’t have to go to school until
later this morning.  After breakfast I capsulated a bottle of my Phyt-Aloe
power.  It is sure cheaper for me to put it in capsules than to buy it that
way. Today I installed a light switch in the center basement room.  It has
never had a light switch except for a string to pull for the fixture.  I
couldn’t find a drill bit so had to go downtown and buy one.  I also got Sandi
some prunes and prune juice to maybe help her out, while I was down town.  I
put a finish coat on the shelf and also on three shelves that Sandi had stained
but didn’t put a finish coat on them.  I needed another drill bit so I asked
Mae if she could go downtown and get it for me.  I got a kick out of it when
she returned as she had a pizza for dinner and screw driver tips instead a
drill tip.  Logan had a basketball game in Logan so Nike went up with him.  I
guess Logan did quite well in the game but Grantsville lost the game anyway. 
Mae and I went out in the hot tub this evening and enjoyed that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
fixed breakfast and got things ready to pack into the car.  I installed the
shelves for Sandi.  Sandi was also concerned about the wires that showed, so I
drilled a hole in the wall behind her TV and another one at the base of the
wall.  I then ran the wires thought the wall so they are hidden.  We packed our
things and came home.  This evening we went up to David and Shauna’s and tended
the children while they went out for the evening.  It was after midnight when
we got home.  It has been a busy day and we were tired.  I am not feeling the
best.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 8
AM but I couldn’t find my glasses.  I had left them up to David’s last night. 
I got out an old pair and will use them.  I still have a sore throat and I am
not in a very good mood this morning.  I guess I had better change.  Church
doesn’t start until 1 PM now so I have a little time this morning.  I filled
our water containers and did a couple of other things for Mae.  I caught my
journal up to date as I hadn’t taken my computer out to Grantsville with me.  I
lay down for a short nap before we went to church.  Today was our first day in
the nursery and it was very interesting.  I really have mixed feelings about
this calling but I will try it.  We had Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley come
over for dinner.  David, Shauna and their family came down so I could get my
glasses back.  I had left them at their place last night.  We enjoyed visiting
with all of them.  After they all went home Mae and I put on a western movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in,
getting up about 7:30 AM.  The morning went fast and we found our self eating
breakfast after 10 AM.  We got busy but I had a hard time getting going.  I did
assemble a set of storage shelfs that we had bought on Saturday.  That allowed
Mae the ability to do more cleaning and straightening of that storage area.  I
went to work on the cabinet I am building for our computer equipment.  Bob
prepared a nice dinner and invited us to eat with them.  It was very good. 
After eating I came downstairs and took a nap.  I worked until 7:30 PM before I
came in.  I shaved and took a shower.  We used this evening to study the
Priesthood and Relief Society lesson and to read the First Presidency’s message
in the Ensign.  I filled in this journal entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Neither Mae
nor I felt very well this morning.  I didn’t get going until almost noon.  Mae
called Shellie and they talked for over an hour.  We are very concerned about
Shellie and Roy and hope things can get worked out.  I worked on the computer
cabinet for a while but was having trouble with my old table saw so Bob and I
went looking far a new saw.  The one that I had wanted to buy at Home Depot is
no longer carried there.  We looked elsewhere but gave up and came home.  As we
got home Bob called me and said that there was some problems and I should come
inside.  Irven and Sandy had car trouble and needed help.  I just put things up
and went to Universal Rental and rented a trailer and cum-a-long.  I went to
North Salt Lake and found them.  The car loaded fairly well but we took the
back roads home as the traffic was bad on the freeway.  I unloaded the car in
their driveway and came home.  I did stop and get natural gas before coming
home.  Mae had gone to the meeting for nursery workers at 6 PM but I didn’t get
home until 7 PM.  Bob gave me some leftovers from diner yesterday that I warmed
and ate for super.  I turned a Hall Mark movie on but didn’t get too excited
about it.  Shellie and Roy called, I talked to Roy about a water softener for
his neighbor but I am really not interested in it.  Shellie then asked me about
our cruise as they have some friends that want then to go on a cruise with
them.  I filled in my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
7 AM but I really had to hurry to get the trailer returned by 9 AM.  After
returning home we got some breakfast.  I then spent the rest of the morning
looking at table saws.  After looking at Lowe’s I bought a saw at The Home Depot. 
It took me an hour to put it together after getting home.  I spent the rest of
the day building the computer cabinet and got quite a bit done.  Bob and I went
Home Teaching this evening and were able to visit with each of our families. 
Of course we were only able to visit with the Casey’s at the door just long
enough to ask if they were ok.  I don’t know if we are doing any good there but
we do stop.  Patriarch and Sister Johnston seem to enjoy us coming by but it is
hard to get away in less than an hour.  The children had gone to bed when we
got to the Fallis’s so we made a short visit with Brother and Sister Fallis.  Mae
and I have been sick the past few days but I think we are about better.  We
have been taking a lot of vitamin C and it seems to help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It snowed
this morning quite hard.  Mark and I went over to the church and helped Brother
Higley clean the snow from the walks.  When I got home I cleaned the walks here
at our place.  I spent the rest of the day working on the cabinet.  Before
cleaning up I decided to change the construction of the doors for the cabinet. 
Jeff brought Benjamin over at 1 PM for us to tend while he and Gale went on an
anniversary trip.  Mae is preparing for her book group this evening so I quit
early enough to eat and help set up.  I tended Benjamin while Mae’s group was
here.  We thought he was down for the night but he woke shortly after we put
him down and I had to hold him until the meeting was over and Mae got him back
to bed.  The Western DVD’s that Mae gave me for Christmas are a poor quality
recording and most are bad.  The 4<sup>th</sup> of 5 seems to be ok and I
watched a show from it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob had
breakfast ready for us before 8 AM.  We had an appointment with Jennie at 9 AM
and just made it on time.  Mae has made good improvement since the last
appointment but I haven’t made improvement but have regressed further.  Jennie
thinks that I have sleep aptnaphy and would like me to get it checked by my
doctor.  This afternoon I went to town to run a few errorns.  I helped Mae take
care of Benjamin this evening although Benjamin prefers grandma over grandpa.  I
caught my journal up while Mae worked on our checking account and some E-mails.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This morning
I woke at 5:30 AM with a dream that I was talking to Bruce R. McConkie about
the experience I have had with the church farms.  When I woke I felt so insignificant
and really wondered about what I have done and accomplished so far in life.  As
I thought on this I thought of the statement of President Benson “The most
important work we will ever do is the work with in our own home.”  With the
thoughts of my children and the problems some of them are having I really feel
like a failure.  At 8 AM I went over to the church with Bob and Mark where we
worked with others of the High Priest group to clean the building.   Mae fixed
breakfast when I got home.  I worked on the cabinet building the doors for it. 
I came in for lunch and helped Mae with Benji for a little while.  I took a nap
and was woke by Jeff and Gail returning home.  We visited and Mae made dinner. 
After Jeff and Gail left, I put things away in the garage and cleaned up so Bob
could get his car in.  Mae and I went upstairs and played a game of Canasta
with Bob and Carroll.  Bob and I won tonight.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM so that I could make it to Stake General Priesthood meeting at 7 AM.  I
tried to be quiet so not to disturb Mae but she was sleeping in the recliner as
she had been up most of the night.  Bob and Mark were up and we went together. 
When we got home Bob asked if he should make waffles for breakfast but I told
him that Mae was still asleep and I was going back to sleep.  I went back to
sleep in the recliner as I had Mae get into bed before I left and I didn’t want
to wake her.  The meeting was very good but it left me with a very concerned
feeling about my two boys and with Roy and Shellie’s problems.  I got up about
9:30 AM and Mae was already up.  I fixed breakfast while Mae visited with
Georgia on the phone.  Time went quickly and we had to hurry to get to church. 
Mae went into the nursery but I was able to attend Priesthood and Sunday School
classes.  Mae sure looked worn out when she came into the chapel and set down
by me.  After meeting I helped fold up the chairs.  When we were ready to come
home we couldn’t find Mark so I brought Mae home and then I went back and got
Mark.  I had Mae lay down and take a nap.  I thought I might also get a short
nap but the phone kept ringing so I finally started dinner.  I cooked some
halibut Mae had got out of the freezer.  I warmed some rice that was left over
from last night and opened a can of green beans.  Mae got up and we ate.  I
took the trash out to the street, including the packing box that my saw came
in.  We took a Birthday card up to Bob as today is his 75<sup>th</sup>
birthday.  We went over to Georgia’s as Bryan and Samantha were there.  We
visited and played a game of Mormon Bridge.  Kristy and Lindsay sang and played
some songs for us.  They are very good.  It was almost 11 PM when we got home. 
The weather has been very cold the past week or so.  Jeff and I are planning on
going ice fishing this next Saturday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke and
was up for a while by 6 AM.  I didn’t feel very rested and so I went back to
bed after showering.  It woke Mae when I got back in bed so she lay in my arms
for a few minutes before she got up to answer the telephone.  I think there was
two or three calls before I got up again.  Bob brought down the hot waffle
grill and batter he had prepared.  We had a nice breakfast.  Sandy called and
said that their distiller was not working and wondered if I could check it.  I
cleaned our distiller and changed the filter.   Mae went with me to Dr.
Francis’s.  Dr. Francis agreed that we should again have test ran to check me
for Sleep Apnea and he also froze the sore on my ear with liquid nitrogen. 
After visiting there we went to Durk’s plumbing where I purchased parts to
repair the pump at Randy’s cabin.  We stopped at Home Depot where I bought
material for the computer cabinet I am building.  I also bought a paint spray
gun that will handle small paint projects instead of using my large paint
pump.  We got some chicken for lunch and stopped to get me a screen saver for
my Palm Pilot, but they wanted $16 for two sheets.  I would not pay that
price.  We went to Irven and Sandy’s where I started to check out the problem
with their distiller.  It had some frozen water lines but the main problem was
that they have never cleaned the unit for over a year.  Mae went with me to
David’s where she stayed while I went to Jeff and Glenna Smith’s to look at a
remodeling job they would like done.  Both going and returning Mae read from
our novel “Prelude to Glory”.  We ate leftovers for dinner.  We read the
Priesthood, Relief Society lesson for Family Home Evening and then read the
final two chapters of the Prelude to Glory series.  I have learned more about
American History from the reading of that series than I every learned from
school.  It is late but it has sure been an enjoyable evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae woke
about 6:30 and I got up a few minutes later.  We ate breakfast and Mae went
over to the church where some of the Relief Society sisters did some back
exercises.  I went to the store and the Credit Union and then to Irven and
Sandy’s to work on their distiller.  I took it apart and took the tanks over to
a car wash and washed them out.  I strengthened the legs as they were bending
over.  They were really in bad shape.  I was unable to get the pump to work. 
It was 1 PM before I got home.  I fixed myself something to eat as Mae had
already eaten lunch.  I wasn’t feeling very well so I lay down in the recliner
and went to sleep.  Mae went over to Scott’s, where she played with the
grandchildren and then she was going over to Tina’s.  I worked on the computer
cabinet for a while and then got tools ready to take with me in the morning.  I
then fixed something to eat, did some book work and wrote my journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
2:30 AM and couldn’t get back to sleep until about 4 AM.  I got up at 5 AM and
had breakfast and was down to Randy’s about 7 AM.  Randy was ready so we put
things in his truck and left.  We stopped at JP’s for some propane before going
to S.L.  We went to Steve Regan’s and got the pump.  We then stopped at Lowe’s
and got some parts.  It was after 11 AM when we got to the cabin.  I was short
a copper fitting so we had to drive into Evanston for it.  I couldn’t get the one
copper fitting to sauter with the torches I have with me, also the pump
pressure switch line that was factory installed was wrong and I need a part for
that.  The water in the tank is freezing so we put a heater in the tank and
will let it run until we come back on Monday.  This way I can still go ice
fishing with Jeff on Saturday.  As we were getting things loaded up to come
home one of the bungee cords slipped and hit me.  I know2 that I was hurt in
the mouth area but it such a shock that I wasn’t sure how bad it was.  After a
minute I started spitting blood.  The pain slowly started to leave and I could
tell that my tongue was swollen.  We continued to get packed up and the four
wheeler loaded.  The pain in my face was fairly well gone when I got home and
there is a cut in the center of my tongue about an inch back from the tip.  I
had a lot less damage than I first thought I had when it first happened.  I
took a hot shower and filled in this entry before we went to bed.  When I was
ready to go to bed I started to chill.  I then got very weak and was not sure
if I was going to pass out or not.  Mae put two more blankets on me and turned
on the electric blanket.  When I finally got to sleep I seemed to sleep ok.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                  Mae had
gone to the School District office and visited with some of the people she
worked with.  She and Jackie went walking and visited for quite a while.  She
said that she had also called Sandy Peterson and visited with her this
evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep too good last night and when I woke she was sleeping in the recliner.  We
got up a little after 8 AM as Mae had an exercise program with some of the
Relief Society sisters.  I went down to Randy’s and he gave me a treatment.  He
worked on me well over an hour and then I fell asleep for a while.  Randy and I
talked about me drawing some house plans for them.  When I got home Mae fixed
me some eggs for breakfast although it was 12:30 PM.  I was tired so I lay down
and took a half hour nap before we picked up Larry and Diane Steele and went to
the Ogden Temple.  After a session we ate dinner in the cafeteria.  Even with
the nap and nap at Randy’s I still fell asleep in the session.  After taking
Larry and Diane home we stopped at a Maverik and I bought me a frozen yogurt. 
Mae then went to a Stake Relief Society program.  After filling in my journal I
played some games on the computer.  When she got home we watched the movie
“Operation Petticoat” with Carry Grant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were woke
by a phone call from David asking if he could borrow my paint sprayer.  I told
him that he could so he will stop by this afternoon to get it.  I woke quite
depressed.  After breakfast I repaired the dinning area light for Bob and
Carroll.  I worked on the computer cabinet and put my tools that I have had in
Bob’s garage away in the trailer.  Mae went to lunch with Georgia.  After
putting the trailer in the back yard I brought up the snowmobiles and serviced
them.  I also brought up the ice fishing equipment.  Bob and Carroll prepared a
cabbage casserole and invited me to eat with them.  When I came downstairs to
go over to Ogden, David was here to get the paint sprayer.  I ended up too late
to go to Ogden for a new torch tip.  I will have to do that Monday before Randy
and I leave for the Uinta’s.  Mae went with me to Riverdale to get new fishing
licenses and some bait for tomorrow.  We stopped and I got fuel in the truck,
the snowmobiles and for the ice auger.  We watched a show on TV before doing my
journal and going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 4
AM and got ready.  It was just after 6 AM when I left to pickup Jeff who stayed
over at Scott’s last night.  We drove to Scofield reservoir which took us 2 ½
hours.  We went out ice fishing until about noon without any success.  We then
took the fishing gear back to the truck and went snowmobiling.  Neither of the snowmobiles
are running properly.  Both are very sluggish and we have to keep the chocks
on.  I thought with running them we could work the old gas out but it didn’t
help.  We were able to take a nice ride and had a lot of fun.  We loaded up and
came back home.  On the way home we stopped and bought a couple of frozen
yogurts.  After letting Jeff off I stopped and got gas for the pickup.  While
filling the truck I called Rich and asked him about the snowmobiles but he
couldn’t offer me any suggestions.  I stopped at Dick’s in Clearfield and he
said it sounded like the carburetors are plugged with old gas so I left the machines
there to have them repaired.  That will cost about $300.  I came on home and
showered and we went over to Jeff and Gale’s for dinner and played some games. 
They had the movie “My Great Big Greek Wedding” so we stayed and watched it. 
It was pretty good and except for some language, was ok.  It was after 11 PM
when we got home.  Bob had a loaf of whole wheat bread on out cupboard when we
got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
7 AM and was up for an hour.  Mae got up at 8 and I tried to get her to come
back to bed with me but she stayed up to work on the lesson she is giving in
the nursery.  I again got up at 11 AM and could hear Bob talking to Mae.  He
just came down to see where we were last night.  He is cute but sometimes I am
tempted to say “Yes Momma”.  Mae and I discussed our budget as we are trying to
make a decision concerning buying this home.  We are not sure just what we
should do and we don’t know who we should get advice from.  I filled in my
journal and then got ready for Church.  I was asked to work in the nursery
today but there were enough sisters there that I was able to attend priesthood
and Sunday school.  Both were very good and Sacrament was our Ward Conference
with the Stake President and Bishop Smith speaking.  Mae went home with Bob and
Carroll while Mark and I helped put chairs away.  Bob had a nice dinner
prepared when we got home.  I called and talked to Uncle Lee this evening.  I
don’t think Aunt Welma is doing very well.  She can’t hear and her speech is
slow.  Uncle Lee just keeps talking as always.  He said that all their children
are doing well and are very busy.  He spoke of how proud they were of all of
them.  I resent a Christmas letter, adding a little on the back and a picture
to them as the one we sent before Christmas returned marked “Undeliverable”. 
Mae went visiting teaching to one of her Sisters this evening.  I finished my
journal entry and got ready for bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and after breakfast I went to get Randy.  We went to get a tip for my
soddering torch but was unable to get it.  I went to Durk’s and bought a new
torch and a container of Nap gas.  Randy and I drove to his cabin in the
Uinta’s.  it was after 11 AM when we got there.  When I uncovered the opening
to the water tank the heater that we had suspended in the tank last Friday was
not there.  It had became unplugged and had fallen into the water.  The water
had thawed and the temperature in the tank was quite warm.  Using a cane of
Randy’s I was able to fish the heater out of the tank.  I then went to work on
hooking the pump up and tried to get it to pump.  I could not get the pump to
draw water.  I found that the back flow valve was frozen.  I removed it and
took it into the cabin and thawed it in a pan of water on the stove.  After
reassembling the line again I found that I still had leak in the out let from
the pipe.  I disassembled the lines again and tightened the fitting.  I again
had to soder the line.  Still the pump would no pull water.  Again I disassembled
the lines and realized that the pipe from the tank still contained ice.  I
didn’t know how to thaw it but tried pouring water down the line.  It just set
for a few minutes and then the water went down.  I poured more water until it
flowed freely.  I then reassembled the pump and lines and tried again.  After
priming the pump a couple of times it finally started to pump water.  We let
the water circulate for several minutes and then drained all the system.  I
hooked up the heat line but when I finished the line didn’t work.  It was
getting so dark that I couldn’t see so we put the heater in the pump house and
set it low.  At 6 PM we packed things up and came home.  As we left for home I
was so tired and had worked in such an awkward position that I got cramps in my
side.  Although I hurt I was able to drive us back home.  I got home after 9
PM.  I showered in a hot shower before going to bed.  Mae also rubbed me with a
pine relief cream and I took some Tylenol PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM and was down to Randy’s at 8:30 AM.  Randy gave me a treatment that
really hurt.  I felt much better after the treatment.  I talked to Judy about
their house plans.  When I got home Rich and Lois were there.  Lois and Mae
went to Salt Lake to go to the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers Museum to get
some of our pioneer histories   Rich and I stayed home.  After eating lunch we
went to Durk’s plumbing where I picked up some parts, returned some parts and
ordered more parts.  Brother Fallus came over and I gave him $50 for the Boy
Scout Counsel.  Mae and Lois enjoyed their findings in S.L.C. and got home
about 5:40 PM.  Because Rich and Lois were here, Mae invited Irven, Sandy, Mark
and Bob to eat with us.  After dinner we played a game of Mormon Bridge.  Mark
said he didn’t know how to play it but we assured him that he could learn
fast.  He did and beat all the rest of us with a zero score.  Irven and Sandy
then went home and Mark went upstairs.  Mae, Lois, Rich and I visited for a
while and then Rich and Lois went to bed.  I stayed up and watched a TV show. 
Mae stayed up for a while with me but finally went to bed without me.  Doctor
Francis wants me to be tired for the test tomorrow evening.   After watching
the movie, I wrote in my journal.  It was about 1:30 am when I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our alarm
went off at 6:30 am and I woke Rick &amp; Lois at 7 as Bob had invited us all
up for biscuits and gravy for breakfast at 8 am.  Rich &amp; Lois needed to
leave at 8:30 to be at the airport to meet their granddaughter who was arriving
home after being on her mission.  She is Phillip &amp; Lisa’s daughter.  As we
were eating, I got a call from Brother Fallis asking if I could go work at the
Deseret Industries with him as our stake was supposed to have 50 people there
and no others from our ward were going to be there.  I finished eating and left
with him.  The Relief Society President had asked Mae if she would take a
sister to Ogden this morning at 10 am for her Chemotherapy treatment, so Mae did
that.  Mae called me as I was coming home about 12:30 to tell me that the High
Priest Group Leader had called to see if I could help a family who were moving
into a home in our ward.  Mae left to go to Dr. Jacobson’s to get a root canal
as she has had an abscessed tooth.  It will cost $710.00.  Wow!  I got some
lunch and then left to help the family move in.  I got home about 6 pm, very
tired.  Dr. Francis wants me to be tired when they take the sleep test on me
tonight and I will be for I am really tired now.  Mae &amp; I ate supper; I then
showered and left for the medical clinic to have the sleep apnea test.  I
filled out some medical sheets and got ready for bed.  I was hooked up with
several wires to a monitor and went to sleep.  I don’t know how long I had been
asleep when the clinic technician came back in and changed some wires.  He said
he could already see some problems.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The
technician came in two or three more times during the night.  I woke about 5:45
AM and he came in and took the wires off me.  The technician said that he was
sure that I would come back after my doctor looked at the test results and they
would fit a C-cup machine to my needs.  He said that the oxygen percent during
deep sleep should be 92 to 94 % and I was as low as 76 – 78 %.  He said that I
didn’t have the standard apnea symptoms but when I went into the deep sleep my
brain just seemed to tell my body not to breathe for close to 45 seconds at a
time.  I got home about 7 AM.  About an hour after getting home I looked for my
Palm Pilot but couldn’t find it.  I finally knelt in prayer and ask my Heavenly
Father for help finding it.  I had no sooner ask for help when in my mind I
could see where I had laid it down when I got dressed this morning.  I know
that the clinic would be closed but I felt sure I would find it ok.  What a
wonderful feeling to know that I have A Father In Heaven that will help even in
small maters like this.  I serviced the pickup and the car this morning and
early afternoon.  I came in about 3 PM and when I did I was excused so I took a
nap.  We called the clinic and they found where I had left the Palm pilot.  I
went over and got it.  I then went to Jeff and Gale’s where I did some planning
for an addition to their house.  Jeff and I then replaced the front brake pads
on Jeff’s car.  I got home about 8 PM.  Mae was watching a show on TV so I
watched the end of it.  I filled in my journal, Mae gave me a hair cut, I then
took a shower and went to bed.  Mae is sure a sweetheart and is so good to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t wake
until about 8 AM and then went back to bed for a little while after using the
bathroom and reading my scriptures. Shellie called and invited us to go to
Israel on a tour with them in March.  It would cost $7,000 for the two of us to
go for 11 days.  We have discussed it throw the day and I just don’t think we
can afford to do it.  Bob came down a little later and said he had waffles
ready.  I got up for that.  We had trouble with the electrical circuit breaking
the tripping.  I didn’t feel very good so laid down in the recliner and slept
for a while.  I got up about noon and started drawing house plans for Randy and
Judy.  Bob made home made bread and gave us a loaf.  We had turkey stew and
bread for super.  Mae and I went to a special fireside that the Stake
Presidency asked us to attend.  It was on finances and budgeting.  It was good
to review that information.  We got home at 9 PM.  I wanted to watch a show but
decided to check out our bank statement on Quicken.  Something is wrong with
our balance and we spent some time trying to detect the problem but gave up for
this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
4:30 AM and was up for a while in the bathroom and reading the scriptures.  I
went into the front room, spent sometime on my knees in prayer; I then used the
recliner to rest as I was afraid of waking Mae if I went back to bed.  The
alarm went of at 6:30 AM and woke Mae.  We lay back down for about ½ hour
before getting up.  We went up to David’s for breakfast of biscuits and gravy. 
David prepared breakfast and it was very good.  At 10 AM we went over to
Morgan’s elementary school and watched Tyler play basketball.  Tyler is pretty
good but it is amazing at the skills some of these boys have at 8 years old.  The
one area that was amusing was the referees didn’t call for double dribbling. 
We visited with David for a few minutes after going back to their home.  Mae
and I then came home.  Mae got ready and went to the Temple.  I worked the rest
of the day on our Quicken file getting it restored.  At 5 PM Mark and I went
over to Irven and Sandy’s for dinner.  Mae met us there as she was late getting
out of the Temple session.  For desert Sandy had bought me a ½ gallon of
Maverick frozen yogurt.  We then went to the Layton City building where we
attended the first of three classes on the Constitution.  The class lasted
three hours but kept me totally interested.  I am also disturbed at some of the
things that were presented.  It was after 10:30 PM when we got home.  I entered
this journal entry before going to bed.</span></p>

early and went to the Sacrament of the Country Creek Ward at 9 AM.  After
meeting we went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and left Scott’s Birthday
present.  We then went over to Tina Linderman’s where I gave her a Priesthood
blessing.  We visited with her for a little while and then came on down to Mike
and Becky’s.  We got there before their meetings were out but Becky had stayed
home with the little girls.  Mike and Becky soon left for St. George for a
conference that Mike is to attend.  We held F.H.E. this afternoon so that we
could have an activity with the children tomorrow evening.  This evening I
watched the movie “It’s a Wonderful Life” on TV in Mike and Becky’s bedroom.  I
stopped for Family Prayer and then played a game of Rummy with Tayler and
David.  I then finished my movie.</span></p>

up some turkey stew and made scones for diner.  We took the kids bowling but
had to wait for a lane for almost an hour.  We all had a good time.  It was
late when we got home so the children went right to bed.  I caught my journal

school and Mattie off to pre-school but she let me sleep until 9:45 AM.  I
fixed my own breakfast and then started working on the Porter’s house plans.  I
had to do some changes to the layer layout that I had.  That took me over and
hour.  I worked a little over 3 hours on them but then had to quite so we could
go to a basketball game that David played in.  It was a good game and David
played quite well.  If you ask his grandparents he did exultant but them they
have no favorites.  We stopped at a grocery store on the way home for a few
things.  Mae soon had dinner ready when we got home.  I gave her a helping
hand.  David and Taylor got ready and left for Mutural.  Taylor made it there
but David got side tracked somewhere.  After they got home and Mae had the
little girls to bed, we played some games.  After Taylor went to bed David and
I got talking about religion.  Mae finally said I had to let David get to bed
for school in the morning.  We sure have some great grandchildren.  I filled in

earlier this morning and had breakfast about 7:30 AM.  I did some work on the
plans through the day but we got ready to go home.  We took the little girls
over to Becky’s sister about 11 AM.  We were going to visit Pat but Mae called
her and she is recovering from a fall.  She didn’t feel like company today.  We
got home about 1 PM.  After eating some lunch I lay down for a few minutes.  I
asked Mae to wake me in 20 minutes but 50 minutes later Bob came down and woke
me.  Mae had got talking to Georgia and forgot me.  We called the sleep center
and got me an appointment for a c-pack test Sunday evening.  I went to the
Credit Union and opened an account for my Handyman work.  I got a bank check
for the cost of the tickets for the Jerusalem tour trip and mailed it.  I
chased around trying to find 200 clean, crisp one dollar bills for us to take
on the trip.  I was able to get about 100 and the Clearfield and Wingers Cr.
Union are going to try to save me some one dollar bills this next week.  Mae
fixed me some dinner but she didn’t eat before going to a meeting on Visiting
Teaching.  She is to do a workshop during the meeting.  When she got home she
said that there weren’t very many sisters that attended.  I got a little more
drawn on the plans but I stopped and watched the movie “The March of the
Penguins”.  I finished my journal and went to bed about 10:30 PM.</span></p>
