<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Both Mae and
I woke about 1 AM so we turned the show back on and watched it before going
back to sleep.  I again woke about 4:30 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so
finally got up.  I started working on my journal entries.  Mae soon came out as
she couldn’t sleep either.  Mae made breakfast about 8 AM.  After breakfast I
worked more on my journal entries.  At 10 AM we watched General Conference.  I
then took a short nap.  Mae woke me and I took a shower.  Bob called us for dinner. 
He had made a nice roast dinner with potatoes and gravy  David and his family
came over and got the tent trailer to use this next week end.  We visited with
them for a while after they got here so we missed about half of the last
session.  We watched the last of the session.  I fell asleep on the floor for a
few minutes but then Mae woke me so we could go to Scott and Mishelle’s for
dinner.  After dinner we watched the two videos we had taken in Iasrel.  After
we got home I made this entry while Mae worked on pictures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM so didn’t go back to bed.  I worked on getting my journal caught up
from the trip.  Mae got up about 8 AM.  I called Lois to see how she is doing. 
She said they still have more test to conduct but things are looking pretty
good.  I called Craig Sherman to see how they are coming.  He was visiting with
his contractor when I called.  He would like to change the bathrooms on the
main floor so that they have there own heat zone.  I spent quite a while making
those changes but I was interrupted by Mark three times and Sandy once.  Mae
was busy all day and seems that she got a lot more accomplished than I did.  I
called Scott and he will help me download a PDF conversion file this evening. 
I went over to Scott’s place but Nolan was still there visiting so that took
time.  Scott was successful in the download for me but now I have to figure the
paper size for it.  I stopped and got gas for the car, on the way home.  It was
almost 10:30 PM when I got home.  I filled in my journal entry before going to
bed.  I also played a game of Solitary before closing down my computer.  It was
about 11:30 when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
4:15 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  Mae was also awake.  At 4:45 AM I got
up.  Mae took some Tylenol and went back to bed.  I stayed up and read my
scriptures, then burned a CD for Shellie.  Mae had gone through the pictures
that we had taken while on our trip to Israel and copied to a file, the ones
she thought Shellie might want.  That was ok but I decided to check the CD to
be sure I had copied the file ok and ended up watching it.  It was 7 AM when I
got back to my journal work.  Mae got up just as I started back on my journal. 
I worked on my journal until noon getting just one day entered.  Irven and
Sandy came over and they want me to do some work on their Snowie building.  I
really don’t have the time right now but they are pretty insistent about it.  I
worked on Craig and Carla’s heat plans and got those printed this afternoon. 
After dinner this evening we went upstairs and played a game of canasta with
Bob and Carroll.  Bob and I won by a large margin this time.  I filled in my
journal for today.  Mae entered some items into our Quicken program.  We
started to bed before 10:30 tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept much
better last night.  I woke just after 5 AM.  I studied for almost an hour.  As
I did I realized how Satan seems to find one weakness and that is where he puts
pressure.  Laman and Lemuel main weakness was not being able to have some one
else with more authority than they had.  It proved their total downfall.  I
fear that David has a problem with reading and studying the scripture and Jeff
has a problem with understanding the Temple ordinances.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob had came
down yesterday to tell us that he was going to prepare waffles for breakfast,
but Mae had already made our breakfast, so this morning he came down earlier. 
He is sure good to us that way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked on
my journal entries that took in the days we were in Israel and got another day
entered.  That day took me until 11 AM so I had better get to work on other
projects now.  I received a check from Craig’s contractor for the parts they
Craig and his son Collan picked up.  I made some corrections to Craig &amp;
Carla’s plans and got them sent to them, worked on some ideas for Randy &amp;
Judy’s plans, considered Jeff &amp; Gail’s plans and worked on Irven &amp;
Sandy’s project getting some prices.  Bob received some new chairs but had to
assemble them.  I went up to see them and ended up helping with some of the
assembling.  One part had a hole drilled in the wrong place so I used my drill
press to drill it in the right place.  All these things take time and running
around to find prices and materials.  The day was gone much to quickly and we
were late going over to Jeff &amp; Gail’s.  I had planned to be there before 7
PM but it was after 7 PM before I just turned the computer off and we went. 
Little Benji was already to bed so we missed him.  That was a disappointment! 
We did enjoy visiting with Jeff &amp; Gail and got some more information for
their project.  It was 10:30 PM when we got to bed so I let my journal go
tonight and finished it in the morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, April 05, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM and spent an hour in scripture study.  Chapter 2 of 2 Nephi was so exciting
to me this morning.  I don’t know how many times I have read that chapter but
it took on greater meaning and excitement to me this time.  As I continue to
study and contemplate the scriptures and the plan of life, I just keep getting
greater Spiritual confirmations.  The preparation and studying we did for our
trip to Israel and then the unbelievable experience of being there has really
opened my understandings.  Our reading of the scriptures will never be the
same!  We are reading the book “The Infinite Atonement” and I had a concern of
disagreement with the author that bothered me.  I gained greater vision and an
understanding from our trip.  I have found that when I have questions that come
to me or teachings from others that I don’t feel right about, that if I study,
pray and even go to the Temple with these questions, that the Spirit whispers a
conformation to me.  Oh how grateful I am to my Lord for his love and concern
for me.  I cannot help but wonder in gratitude, “Why me dear Lord”!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked on
my journal again this morning.  I stopped for breakfast and then continued
until 9:30 when I stopped and took a shower and shaved.  After that I continued
until 11 o’clock to get one more day caught.  I am slow at transcribing my note
book notes back in to my computer.  I laid down with my feet in the Chee
machine and fell asleep for a few minutes.  I worked for about 3 hr on Craig
&amp; Carla’s statement and a letter to mail to them.  I helped Bob pull a
fizzer bush out of the front.  I called and visited with Randy about their
plans.  I helped Mae with some of her house work for this evening.  I worked on
Jeff &amp; Gail’s plans this evening.  Mae has been busy all day preparing for
this evening.  Her group seemed to enjoy the evening.  I was sure tired by 9
PM.  Our printer is out of ink so I will have to get some tomorrow.  Good
night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, April 06, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I studied
from 2 Nephi 4 this morning and it caused me a lot of reflection of a fathers
love and concern for his children.  As weak as I am I have been greatly blessed
of the Lord.  I have hoped that I could so teach my children so that they would
rise up to be great servants unto the Lord.  I am especially concerned for
David and Jeff who have such great abilities but seem to be held back because
of the philosophies of men of so called high education.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae prepared
a great breakfast and then I went to Office Max and bought some ink cartridges
for our printer.  I stopped and paid my bill at Durk’s and got gas for my
pickup.  When I returned Mae had dinner ready, in the crock pot, to be cooked
at Jeff &amp; Gail’s, she also had a lunch prepared for us as we drove to
Heber.  Jeff had gone with Nolan on a overnight mountain climbing trip and
hadn’t returned by the time we got to his house.  We enjoyed visiting with Gail
and playing with Benji.  Jeff and Nolan came shortly and we prepared to leave. 
We took Benji with us as Gail has to go to school to prepare her class room for
the next quarter.  Benji went to sleep shortly after we left the house so Mae
was able to read as we drove.  It was a good trip and Jeff was excited with the
products and prices we got from Heber Valley Log Works.  After returning back
to Jeff’s we ate dinner and then came on home.  We were tired but Mae got on
the internet to see if I had received a return on an inquiry I had made to
Quad-Lock Building Systems.  There wasn’t a reply yet.  We decided to watch a
show before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> Saturday, April 07, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and after reading my scriptures I went back to bed.  Mae got up and let
me sleep.  She went to work making preparations for dinner this evening.  After
getting up and eating breakfast Mae went with me to Scott and Mishelle’s where
I dug up some starts of Bishops Weed.  Bryce called from Spain to ask me for
Roy’s phone number.  He has concerns about his taxes and needs some advice.  I
didn’t have my day planner with me so I told him that I would E-mail it to
him.  He said that he is really having difficulty with members with trivial
problems and complaints and asked me for advice.  I didn’t have much to give to
him.  It was good to visit with him for a few minutes.  Mae and I came home and
started planting the Bishops Weed in the front yard.  Bob and Carroll’s family
came for Easter dinner and we were invited to eat with them.  Bob had prepared
a great lunching and his children added to it with special dishes.  Mae and I
then finished the planting while their grand children had a Easter Egg Hunt.  We
only had time to relax for a few minutes before Margo Gallegos and Gary Nelson
came for dinner.  We set up an evening with them that they might meet and
become acquainted with each other.  The evening went very well and we enjoyed
eating, playing games and visiting.  It was after mid-night before they left. 
We were tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t wake
up until almost 9 AM.  Mae had got up just a little earlier.  Bob came down to
see if it was Fast Sunday for if it wasn’t he would prepare biscuits and gravy
for breakfast.  It is Fast Sunday.  I thought I would get a lot done on my
journal but spent the time getting an e-mail of to Bryce and Deanna and
entering yesterday’s journal entry.  I did get my scripture study in.  It’s now
time to get ready for meetings.  We had 12 children in nursery today and they
kept us going.  Fast and Testimony meet went well.  After meetings I helped put
the chairs away.  Bob had dinner ready shortly after we came home.  At 6 PM
Irven and Sandy came over and ate and then came downstairs and we showed they
and Mark some of our pictures from Israel.  They went home at 8 PM as they had
some of their children coming over.  Mae and I watched a TV show and I filled
in today’s journal entry.  Mae is typing and scanning some of her Grandmothers
papers and pictures into the computer to try to preserve that information.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
shortly after 6 AM but was quite slow at getting going.  I studied for a while
and then worked on my journal.  This has sure taken a lot of time to work on
the journal entries from our Israel trip.  I called the Dr. office and they had
the McKay Dee Sleep Center call me who were to again call me back to schedule
the delivery of my equipment.  I called HiCaliber Inc. and they will send me
information about their Styrofoam building blocks system.  I went into Ogden
and checked on electrical equipment needed for the heat system we are putting
into Craig and Carla’s home.  We got our bank statement balanced this
afternoon.  I also got all the pictures onto our desk top and then backed them
up on out external hard drive.  For F.H.E. we read the priesthood / Relief
Society lessons.  We played a couple of games before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:45 AM and by the time I study, do some exercises, say my prayers and then Mae
and I went walking.  When we got back Bob asked me to go to Sherries with him
and drive his pickup back.  I took some breakfast with me and ate it on the
way.  By the time I did all this it is after 10 AM.  Time goes by to fast or I
am getting slower.  I got another day of our trip to Israel entered into my
journal.  I went out and helped Bob cleanup some of the branches left over from
cutting the trees down last fall.  We got about half of them cleaned up and
hauled to the dumps.  Mae has been entering several items of her Grandmother
Porter’s into the computer to preserve a copy.  I took a nap and then did some
planning on Randy’s house remodeling.  We quite about 9 PM and watched a show
before going to bed.  Mae isn’t feeling the best this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t
sleep very well last night; Mae spent most of the night in the recliner.  I had
a horribly disturbing dream that woke me up and when I went back to sleep it
continued.  I was glad to wake up.  I enjoyed my scripture study time and
gained a better understanding of the priesthood plan and purpose.  Bob came
down and invited us for breakfast of biscuits and gravy.  That was a treat and
especially since Mae didn’t feel up to preparing anything.  Shannon from Valley
Home Medical came and delivered a sleep machine to me and showed us how to fit
it and take care of it.  Bob, Mark and I loaded the rest of the old tree
branches into Bob’s pickup and took them to the dumps.  I worked on Irven and
Sandy’s pump and water heater getting it to work.  I still need some more parts
for it.  Bob and I went home teaching this evening and visited Casey’s and the
Johnston’s.  When I got home Mae was watching the last of the Little House on
the Prairie so I watched it with her.  We then watched a very touching movie “A
place for Annie”.  We went to bed about 11:30 PM.  I hope both of us sleep
better tonight.  Mae still isn’t feeling well this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept pretty
well with the CPAP mask on last night.  I woke once during the night and took
it of for about an hour and then put it back on.  It really helps me breath
easier.  I also woke with out a terrible taste in my mouth.  After breakfast I
worked on the journal entries of our trip and got another day put in.  I went
to the bank and got cashiers checks for the IRS and the State taxes and then to
the post office where I mailed them.  I tried to find out more information
about the Styrofoam construction blocks but just got frustrated with the one
that I had information mailed to me.  It’s information system all seem to work
with the internet and without high speed it was a pain.  I tried this morning
to call Wade Sandburg in Grantsville but couldn’t get through to him.  I also
tried to reach Irven and Sandy with some questions but they were not at home. 
Mark and I went to the Temple this evening and enjoyed the session.  Our Stake
had a Temple night prior to Stake Conference this coming weekend.  Mae didn’t
go with me as she still isn’t feeling well.  I invited Bob to go but he had an
appointment at the VA hospital this afternoon.  Mark and I talked about our
trip to Israel on the way home and after we got here for a few minutes.  I
called Wade Sandberg at 9:30 PM hoping that I wasn’t too late and he just got
home from church meetings.  He gave me some information on a Styrofoam system
he has used.  I will make some more calls on that tomorrow.  Jeff had stopped
by and got the DVD on the --- system and while he was here I opened up to Mae
and upset her because of his views and stress about life.  I don’t understand
where he is coming from and why.  Mae also tried to write a letter to Dian
Steel about her use of the Lords name in vain.  I told her the letter was good
but she should talk to Bishop Smith before she sent it.  She did and he felt
like it would be a mistake to confront her even though she tried to do it in a
loving way.  Well its time for bed so I better end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae hadn’t
slept very well last night.  I got up after 7 AM and studied for a while.  Mae
woke about 8 AM.  After breakfast I received a call from Dick Zakotnik with
Jack Parson Co. about Eco Block Styrofoam building systems.  He will send me
materials about the product.  Irven and Sandy came and we discussed their
project.  We went over to Jeff and Gail’s and I watched the DVD on HiCaliber
product.  From there we went up to Kim’s where we ate and then played games. 
Georgia and Rick also came up.  Jeannine was in Salt Lake attending some
classes but Kim had us come up anyway.  It was 11:30 PM when we got home so it
was after mid-night before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
3:15 with my mask hurting my nose.  I removed it and when I lay back down Mae
started jerking her legs.  I turned my pillow around so I could rub her legs
and feet and did so until she felt better.  I slept in that position the rest
of the night.  Jeff called me and we talked for about a half hour.  Yesterday I
kind of got after him and told him to relax about this remodeling job.  I told
him it wasn’t the end of the world if this job wasn’t finished right a way.  He
thanked me for trying to get him to calm down.  We discussed items he and Gail
have to decide on and he made some decisions right then.  Bob made waffles for
us for breakfast at 9 AM.  They were sure good.  I went out and watered the
Bishop Weed in front.  Bob came down and ask about the storage awning I am
thinking about and we spent some time figuring what we will need.  I tried to
get on my computer but spent sometime trying to get past the messages that keep
coming up.  I don’t know if I solved the problems or not but will probably find
out when I start my computer up again.  I had to clean my C-Pack this morning. 
I then wanted to work on my journal and try to get another day of our trip
entered.  I did get the 25<sup>th</sup> entered before I started other things. 
This afternoon I worked on Randy’s plans and got them to the point to review
them with Randy and Judy.  I worked on Jeff &amp; Gail’s plans.  Mae had me
quite about 5:30 PM to help her prepare something for dinner.  I grilled a
sausage and fried some potatoes while Mae made a toss salad.  I got my things
cleaned up in between cooking so that we are fairly straight for tomorrow. 
After eating I hurried and got ready for this evenings Stake Conference
meeting.  It was very good and I thought that President Eringston gave a very
good opening address.  Bob recorded the show “Iron Will” while we were at
meeting so before going to sleep Mae and I watched that show.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We attended
Stake Conference held at the Ogden Tabernacle.  It was very good although I did
fall asleep during part of it.  Elder Samuelson of the 70’s was our visiting
authority and he followed the theme of I will follow him.  He spoke of being in
the Holy Land and I could relate to many of the areas that he mentioned.  After
the meeting ended we walked around the grounds and enjoyed the Spring flowers. 
We drove down to Mike and Becky’s and enjoyed the visit with them.  We played a
game, Mae played with the little girls, I looked at a couple of problems Mike
has with their house and David played some numbers for us on the piano before
we came home.  I was after 10 PM when we got home.  I entered my journal and we
went to bed.</span></p>

3:30 AM with the c-pack blowing air.  After I tried to adjust it for a few
minutes I took it off and slept the rest of the night without it.  I didn’t
wake until 8 AM so that put me behind and that seemed to be the way things went
most of the day.  I did get some scripture study in.  I called and reported the
problem I am having with the c-pack and Shannon came over this afternoon and
gave me another size mask.  Bob came down and said he is changing his TV
programming so we spent some time trying to find out if we wanted to have him
ass the High Speed internet so we can use it.  It would cost us about $50 a
month.  We are not sure that it is worth it.  Sandy came over and cleaned up
their Snowie Shack and I visited with her for a few minutes.  I drew a set of
plans for a storage shed and will now price it to see if we can afford to build
it.  I called Chad and he said that he would calculate the specifications on
the trusses.  It was after 9 PM when we ate dinner.  We read the
Priesthood/Relief Society lesson and then went to bed and watched a DVD we have
on the Galilee.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was able to
sleep through the night with my c-pack but it makes much more noise that the
other mask.  Mae didn’t sleep as good because of the noise.  I got on the
scales this morning and am still gaining weight.  I decided that I had to cut
down and watch what I eat when Bob came down to tell us that he would have
biscuits and grave ready at 9.  Mae and I went for a walk before breakfast. 
After breakfast I made some calls and priced out the plans for the shed I drew
last night.  It is way over our budget and especially to put that much into
something we don’t own.  We decided to get a awing for the boat and the camp
trailer.  It will cost a little more than two thousand dollars.  I took my
pickup over to Kaysville and got it licenses for another year.  I stopped at
our Credit Union and switched some money into a two year CD to get better
interest.  When I got home I spent the rest of the day changing the universal
joints on Bob’s car.  Gail had brought Benji over at 11:45 for Mae to tend
today.  Jeff came to get him at 5 PM.  We invited him to call Gail and have her
join us for dinner.  Jeff and I did a little work on their plans.  After dinner
I turned the movie on TV and we watched the show “Dave”.  Jeff and Gail stayed
and watched it with us.  After that show ended and Jeff and Gail left I watched
a second show.  Mae is sure a doll, I sure love her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up
and going about 7 AM.  Mae was busy all day with appointments and this evening
she went with Irven and Sandy to a political meeting.  I went down to Randy and
Judy’s and went over their plans.  I spent the rest of the day changing the
plans again.  I called Dr. Jensen’s office and asked them if they would call in
a refill for my prescription.  They said they would but they didn’t.  I finally
just borrowed three more pills from the Pharmacy.  Bob and I had an appointment
with the Fallis’s to go Home Teaching to them this evening.  We had just got
dressed up and ready to go when they called and asked if they could cancel this
evening’s appointment.  We rescheduled it for Sunday morning at 11 AM.  I
worked on Randy and Judy’s plans until 10:15 PM.  We will see if these plans
will be acceptable.  Mae didn’t get home until 11 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM and hurried to get away but it was still 8:20 AM when we left for Mike’s. 
We stopped at Durk’s and got a few parts.  Shortly after getting to Mike and
Becky’s, I started work on the drain line in the basement coming from the
kitchen.  It has been leaking every since I finished that area.  The area is
quite tight and hard to see but I thought that it was coming from a bad joint. 
I cut out the joint and replaced it.  I then went into the furnace room and
removed the water line that goes to the air conditioner, cut out another area
and soldered a tee in and installed a valve for the air conditioner.  We got
the water back into the house and tested the drain line.  It still leaked.  I
had to cut some of the wall apart and found that when I built the wall that a
nail had penetrated the drain line but had sealed until the nail rusted away
and let the water come out.  We had to go to Lowel’s and purchase two more
fittings and then with some work were able to replace the area that leaked. 
After those jobs were finished Mike, David, Becky, Mike and I played a game of
Kill the Rabbit.  I think it is a dumb game.  This evening Mike, David and I
went to a baseball game.  It was enjoyable but cold.  When we got home the
girls were watching a DVD on TV.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  Mae and I got up after 8 AM and while saying morning prayers could
hear the two little girls whispering.  That had come down to see if Grandma
could come and play with them.  I went into the Family Room and Tayler was
watching the show they had watched last night.  I thought I could see a little
more of the show and get a better understanding of it but it was at the same
place as where I got into it last night.  After breakfast we visited and looked
at a couple of projects that Mike has to do with his lawn sprinkler system.  I
gave him some suggestions.  Mae &amp; Becky challenged Mike and I in a game of
Rook.  It was a close game but Mike and I did win.  Mike and I drew the
upstairs bathrooms and the master bedroom closet onto my computer so I can look
a possible ways to remodel that area for them.  After lunch Mae and I started
for home.  We had to go south to 8<sup>th</sup> North in Orem to get natural
gas for my truck and then came home.  It was 5 PM when we got home.  We put
things away and watched two CD’s about Juice Plus, a product that I have agreed
to try for a couple of weeks.  I worked on my journal while Mae worked on scrap
books.  We then watched a show on TV before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
6:30 but just took the mask off and went back to sleep for another hour.  Mae
stayed in bed until 8 AM.  After breakfast I had Mae come out and help me move
our toys so I could lay out the footings for our shed.  Bob came out and helped
me.  After getting them laid out I started painting the out with spray paint
but ran out.  Bob went over to the store and bought two more cans of paint. 
While Bob was gone, I started cutting the edge of the footing trench with the
flat shovel.  When Bob returned he saw me cutting with the shovel and said that
we needed a knife that would cut the edge.  I thought about using my Saw Sal
and it worked much better than the shovel.  I also got out the rotor-tiller and
went down the trench area to loosen the soil.  With the cutting the edge and
loosing the soil it really helped.  We quite at 6 PM and went into the house. 
Mae has been busy trimming the yard, talking on the phone and going through our
72 Hour emergency kit and updating them.  We went upstairs and played a game of
canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Mae and Carroll really beat Bob and I this
evening.  Bob and I led the score at almost twice the score, then Carroll was
able to retrieve the discard pile which had over half the deck in it.  They won
with that hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was unable
to sleep with my c-pack as the bridge of my noise is to tender.  I woke shortly
after 6 AM but after studding for a while I lay down in the recliner and went
back to sleep.  The nursery was a busy place today as we had 15 children.  By
the time the 2 hours plus 15 minutes before and 15 to 20 minutes after, were
over I was beat.  Mae’s back sure hurt from holding many children.  That
calling is only on Sunday but I think it is the hardest to be positive as any I
have held.  I stayed after church and helped put us chairs.  After we got home
we changed clothes and then at 5 PM we went up to David &amp; Shauna’s.  They
had a nice dinner ready and after eating we visited and then watched the DVD
“The Galilean Experience”.  It was a good evening.  We got home about 10 PM and
was so tired that we just went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 7:30 and found that Mae was already up.  Bob came downstairs and said
that he would have waffles ready for breakfast.  After breakfast Bob and I
started on the footings for the awning for the boat and tent trailer.  About 10
Shannon came from Layton Medical Supply and checked as to how I am doing with
the C-pack.  She gave me a monitor to use tonight and she will pick it up
tomorrow.  Bob and I finished digging the footing trench and then went into
Ogden to get material to form the footings.  We were able to buy used lumber
for about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> the regular price and then we bought rebar from
Lowe’s at $0.51 off their regular price because I checked with Home Depot price
before buying.  It was 7 PM when we finished and came in.  Mae and I ate dinner
and then I took a shower.  We read the Priesthood / Relief Society lesson for
the manual and then watched a political DVD from the Constitutional Party.  It
sure doesn’t sound like our country is in very good shape and going down fast. 
We went to bed about 10:30 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
2:30 AM with my c-pack and monitor giving me trouble but I was able to get it
adjusted and after a hour or so was able to go back to sleep.  I got up early
and after studying was very tired so I went back to sleep for a hour.  Mae woke
me so that I was able to eat breakfast and then go down to Randy’s for a
treatment.  Randy really worked me over and took 1 ½ hours with me.  After
resting a few minutes Randy and I visited about the house plans.  I got home just
before noon so Mae made me a sandwich to eat before I went out to work.  Bob
and I worked until 5:30 PM and then put tools away for the day.  Mae had dinner
ready when I came in.  Brother Thompson came Home Teaching this evening.  After
he left we went back downstairs.  I turned on the TV and we watched a movie
before going to bed.  Mae has been sorting papers, cards and letters that we
have received from those we have met and became close to in the many places
that we have lived.  Some of them we still keep in touch with but many I am sad
to say we have not.  Sandi called and invited us to attend a baseball game that
Layton will be playing in Thursday evening at the Linquest Baseball Field in
Ogden, Thursday evening.  It’s after 11 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I made a
cushion of a cotton pad and Moleskin and put on my nose to cushion the C-pack
mask on my noise.  I had tried just the Moleskin Monday night and it helped but
when I removed it Tuesday morning it tour of some of the skin.  The pad last
night really helped and came off easier.  Mae cut some more pads for me today. 
Anyway with the pad I slept well and didn’t wake up until almost 8 AM.  It was
almost 10 AM before bob and I got outside to start work on the forms.  Bob had
to go down to the Veterans Hospital for some testing on his ears so he quit at
noon.  I worked until after 1 PM and then came in for lunch.  I took a short
nap and then went back out.  Mae then went with me and we went over to the rock
store in Sunset and checked them for Jeff &amp; Gail’s project then went to the
Davis North Library where I checked out a book on AutoCAD.  After that we went
into Ogden and reserved a concrete mixing barrel trailer for tomorrow.  I came
home and built a shut to help pour the concrete in to the forms.  Mae came out
to tell me that our meeting is at 6 PM and not &amp; PM.  I had to hurry in
order for us to get there on time.  It was a very good meeting; it was a
rebroadcast from the Church on teaching.  When we got home I ate some dinner
and then went out to get tools ready for in the morning.  Bob came out and I
mentioned that I would feel better if we had one more helper tomorrow.  He went
in and called Grant and grant said he would come over for a while in the
morning.  I also reserved a cement stinger that Mae will pickup from Universal
Rental in the morning.  I think we are ready!  I filled in today’s journal
entry before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM and was outside to start work at 7 AM.  Bob and I went to Ogden and got the
first load of cement but had to wait for another that came in ahead of us.  It
was 8:15 when we start home.  Grant came over to help us and I was sure glad
for his help.  We had trouble backing the pickup with the heavy load and Irven’s
vehickles being parked in the way.  Mae also helped by driving the pickup
forward as we needed it moved up.  After unloading the first load I sent Bob
back into town for the second load.  He had trouble with the girl in the office
and then he lost the paper work so he was a long time getting back.  With out
Grants help on the second load it took longer but we got the trailer back in
time.  Mae again help us unload by driving again.  I didn’t feel that I could
let Bob return the trailer so I went back to turn it in.  When we got back home
I really had to work to get a finish on the concrete.  It was 2:45 PM when I
put tools away and came in the house.  Coast to Coast Carports called me and
set up an appointment to install the carport next Wednesday.  Mae went down to
Randy’s and got a treatment this afternoon.  She had some lunch ready for me
but I couldn’t stop until I was finished.  After eating I took a shower and
cleaned up.  Mae got home but had to go Visiting Teaching this afternoon.  She
got some dinner started and in the oven on time bake.  I lay down and took a
nap.  This evening we went into Ogden to watch a baseball game between
Grantsville and Ben Lomond as Logan was playing in it.  Ben Lomond won 2 to 1
runs.  When we came home I filled in my journal. We then watched the movie, “A
Star is Born” and it was a three hour show.</span></p>

late so it was 11 before we finished breakfast and then Bob invited us up for
liver and onions at 1 PM.  Jeff came over and borrowed my truck and a few
tools.  I did get some of the forms stripped but had some interruptions.  Irven
and Sandy came over to tell us that they are not going to sale their Snowie
equipment this year because the prices are way down now.  They stayed and
visited for a while.  Mae picked up Kylan and Ashley this afternoon as we are
tending them so that Scott and Mishelle could get away for the weekend.  I
attended the “Evening with the Stake President” with out Mae.  It was very good
and talked about our marriages.  Jeff returned the pickup this evening and
stayed for a few minutes to visit.  I turned a TV show on and watched part of
it.  Mae got the children to bed and then we decided that the show would only
last another hour so we would watch it in bed.  The show lasted until after
midnight.  It ended up another late night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3:30 to use the bathroom but couldn’t go back to sleep because of what our
Stake President told us in the meeting last night.  He asked us to think of what
we did when we started courting our spouses that made us want to get married. 
This morning as I lay next to my sweetheart I began to think about these things
and had very fond memories.  Kylan woke up with a bad dream so I got up with
him at 5:45 AM.  I took him into the front room and rocked him by the
fireplace.  I visited with Kylan and Ashley until 20 to 8 before waking Mae. 
After breakfast David called because Connor wanted to tell us thanks for the
Birthday card we has mailed to him.  After visiting with Connor for a few
minutes we visited with David.  Mae prepared and took Kylan and Ashley to the
Dinosaur Park in Ogden.  I took a 1 ½ hour nap and then worked on my journal
from our Israel trip.  It was 3:30 PM when I finished another day’s entry.  I
did take time to check Bob and Carroll’s air conditioner.  I studied the
marketing information about ECO Block for about 3 hours.  Mae and the children
came home shortly after 6 PM.  After eating dinner I played Frisbee with
Kylan.  We popped corn and watched a video, I watched a show on TV.  We got to
bed before 10:30 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3 AM and had to remove the c-pack as it was too uncomfortable on my face.  I
slept until 6:45 AM and got up and studied the scriptures.  Kylan got up
shortly after 7 AM and Mae after that.  Ashley slept until after 8 AM.  Bob
came down and said he would make biscuits and gravy if I would cook the
biscuits.  That was easy enough so we set the table and ate down here.  After
breakfast we visited for a while.  Mark asked Bob and I to give him a
blessing.  Bob anointed and I sealed the anointing and gave him a blessing. 
Mark has been sick for over two weeks.  He feels that he ate some bad butter
and got sick from that.  The children wanted to play outside and I helped Kylan
fly his kite.  We got it up a couple of times but didn’t have enough wind to
keep it up.  I came in and worked on my journal.  Scott and Mishelle came at
12:20 PM to get their children.  Ashley was very unhappy and didn’t want to go home. 
Mae and I left before Scott and Mishelle but when I got out at the church I
realized that the children’s car seats were still in our car so I came back
home.  They were loading up and had also realized they didn’t have seats for
the children.  When I got to the church we only had two children in the nursery
and it was 1 PM.  Because of so few children I went into the Priesthood meeting
and also attended the Sunday school class.  I felt a little guilty in skipping
out of my job but it was sure nice to attend the other meetings.  Brother and
Sister Von Niederhouser gave their home coming address during Sacrament
meeting.  Mae and I stayed for choir practice after meetings but I didn’t enjoy
that because Brother Faulis likes to sit by me and he sings worse than I and
that’s bad.  Bob had dinner ready when we got home.  After dinner we went over
to Von Niederhouser where they had a lunching.  We just visit for a while. 
Bob, Carroll, Mae and I played a game of Canasta this evening and Mae and
Carroll beat us again.  This is beginning to be a habit.  I filled out my
journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up in
a depressed mod so after breakfast Mae and I went for a walk.  When we returned
I felt pretty good but then we stopped and visited with our neighbor and that
again depressed me.  I tried to get him to realize that if we don’t like what
is happening in our government then we need to do something about it.  Just his
non-complacent attitude was upsetting to me.  I went out back and finished
removing the forms from my footings.  Bob came out and helped me.  I then
leveled the dirt and backfilled the footings.  I worked on Jeff and Gail’s
plans and decided that I should start over on them.  Mae was working on
pictures and copied about 96 colored pictures in error as she copied them in
black and white. We watched part of the DVD that Shellie made of some of the
pictures on the trip to Israel.  They were pretty good pictures.  Shellie also
sent us a copy of the digital pictures that they took on the trip.  We will
need to select some of them to ass with ours.</span></p>
