<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We helped
Craig and Carla pack and load things from the house to be taken to their new
house.  Craig had six other people also come to help.  It was interesting that
some people just don’t know how to pack to move.  I guess all the moves we have
made, have made us more conscious of how to prepare to move.  Mae would have
most small items all packed with the boxes labeled as to what was in the
boxes.  This made it much easer to load and pack the moving trucks or trailers,
besides making it much easier to put things away in the new location.  Mae and
I then waited at the house for the FedEx truck to come.  At noon we got
concerned and tried to call.  However the first thing that they wanted to know
was the tracking number and this we are not able to get until Monday morning. 
Peter finally was able to make contact with a live person in the Idaho Falls
office and he said that they didn’t make deliveries to the Victor zip code area
on Saturdays.  I talked it over with Craig and Peter and they think that they
can install the part when it comes Monday.  Mae and I left at 3:30 PM for
home.  Although the roads were slick in the Valley they were ok once we got out
of the Valley.  We traveled straight home and got there at 8 PM.  Mae had read
about ½ of the book that Gail and Jeff had given us for Christmas.  It is
really very good.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in,
watched the Spoken Word and Tabernacle Choir broadcast and then other talks and
reports on the BYU channel.  We attended Tithing Settlement and then our Ward
Block.  We went from the Church to Jeff and Gail’s for dinner and played
games.  Marcy also vas invited.  Gail, Mae and I watched the First Presidency’s
Christmas Program.  Jeff went into the other room.  When we got home Bob sent
two pieces of Apple pie down to us.  They were sure good.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We over slept
and I woke at 8 AM.  I called Durk’s Plumbing and had them find the shipping
number for Craig and Carla.  I next called Carla and told what I had found
out.  Shellie called and visit with Mae for over an 1, which really doesn’t
matter except that it cost us minutes and we are often over out minutes.  Bryce
called and wants me to inspect his house and then he added that he wants me to
put in a lock set.  I am trying to get to Danny and Shanna’s and figure Randy’s
house for heat and air condition.  Mishelle called and their water heater is
going out so I need to replace that.  Bob has invited us to dinner at 1:30 PM
today.  I feel like I am loosing it.  I went back to Bryce’s and spent the rest
of the afternoon visiting with him as to what he can do to improve his home for
sale.  Most of this evening, I was on the phone with Peter.  We were working
out problems with the heat system.  We got to bed about 11:30 PM very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 3
AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I was worried about the problems with the
heat system.  I went over to Durk’s at 8 AM and visited with Jarred about Craig
and Carla’s heat system.  We called the factory and determined that I have the
water flow going in the wrong direction through the boiler.  Also I need three
transformers added to the electrical circuit.  Peter went to Jackson to get
them.  He made the corrections.  I picked up a water heater for Scott’s house.  At
11 AM Mae and I went to Standard Optical and got out eyes checked and new
glasses.  When we got home I took a nap.  I then went to Scott’s and changed
the water heater.  I was there about 6 ½ hours before I got the new water
heater installed and working. While I was at Scot’s, Craig and Peter called
me.  The water does not seem to be circulating through the lines.  I had them
shut the heat off, attach a water hose to the bottom of the main loop to force
water in and another hose to the top of the loop going to the floor drain. 
This will force water into the zones to clear out any air locks.  When I got
home Mae had a nice dinner cooked and warmed mine up again.  We watched a cute
Christmas story of the Walton’s and then I filed out my journal.  We then went
to bed but it was late.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8 AM.  Craig called me this morning to let me know that the system is
working and the house is now warming up.  That is sure good news.  He will keep
me informed.  Bob came down and invited us come up for biscuits and gravy.  Time
went fast and the morning went by.  After lunch Mae and I went shopping.  We
did our Christmas shopping and had a lot of fun being together.  Peter called
me and there is still some problems to work out.  I may have to go up again to
change some plumbing.  We bought a fish sandwich and two baked potatoes at
Wendy’s for dinner.  We came home and watched a DVD.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 7
AM and after reading my scriptures I laid back down with Mae.  I tried to
record Mitt Romney’s talk this morning.  Irven and Sandy had to go to S.L. at
that time and so missed the talk.  It was very good but I couldn’t get the
recorder to work.  I went to Durk’s and talked over the problem of Craig and
Carla’s heat system and decided that we would have to re-plumb the boiler
loop.  Jared also had Randy’s plans estimated, so I took them.  I went to
Love’s Heating and Air Condition but Rober was not in the office.  I will have
to come back tomorrow.  I talked to Craig and we decided that I will go back up
on Monday to re-plumb the boiler.  I helped Mae get our Christmas letter ready
to mail.  Bob and I cleaned the yard of the fall leaves this afternoon.  It was
late when we finished but we got it looking much better.  We tended David and
Shauna’s children this evening while they went to a company Christmas party. 
We watched a movie on Hall Mark this evening.  I worked on the computer for a
while before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM so that I could be at Robert Love’s Heating &amp; Air Conditioning at 8
AM.  I went over Randy &amp; Judy’s house plan to get a bid for the air
conditioner.  I had let Mae sleep in but when I got home she was up and ready
for Gail to come with Benji for her to tend while Gail goes to the Temple.  Benji
sure enjoyed having us play ball with him.  Gail stayed when she returned and
ate lunch with us and visited for a while.  This evening we picked up Irven and
Sandy and went to the Bell of Temple Square performance at the Conference
Center.  It was snowing when we got there so I let Mae, Sandy and Irven off at
the Conference Center and I drove to South Temple and 300 West where I parked. 
The performance was very enjoyable.  When we got out Mae went with me to get
the car.  It has really snowed hard and the cars were covered with snow when we
got there.  I should have had Mae stay with Irven and Sandy so they could of
stayed in the building until I arrived with the car.  Mae and I could have then
communicated by phone when I got close to the center.  But I didn’t and we were
a long time getting out of the parking lot and getting back to the center with
the car.  Irven and Sandy were very cold when we got there.  The roads were
very slippery and traffic was slow but we did well in returning home.  We did
stop at Slim Olsen’s in Bountiful to use their restrooms and for some treats. 
It was a very enjoyable evening.  We got home about 11:30 PM and to bed late.</span></p>

and had breakfast about 9:30 AM.  We went to a Senior Citizens lunching today. 
Bob, Carroll, Mark, also Roy and Linda went with us.  Roy and Linda arrived
here yesterday.  They came back to our place and visited until Mae and I had to
leave to watch Kylan play in a basketball game.  It was fun watching Kylan
visit.  We went from there to Gail’s mother’s home and from there Mae &amp; I road
with Jeff and Gail to the Hale Theater in West Salt Lake.  We saw the
production of Christmas Carol.  It was with out exception one of the best
performances I have seen.  We then went out to eat at Apple Bee’s and enjoyed
that.  We sure enjoyed being with Jeff and Gail for the evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob came down
and woke me as today is Stake High Priest meeting at 7 AM.  I had to hurry for
it was 6:30 AM when Bob came down.  We did make it to the meeting on time.  The
meeting was very enjoyable.  When I got home we went over to Jeff and Gail’s
for breakfast.  Jeff cooked omelets and added sautéed mushrooms to his and my
omelets.  It was very good.  After eating we played a game of Rook.  We had to
quite so that Mae and I could make it to church.  Jeff and I were able to set
the gals on the last hand so we quite with the highest hand.  When we got home
I took a 25 minute map before meetings.  Meetings were very good and the nap
helped me.  Bob invited us to dinner and that was very good.  I talked to Roy
this evening and he decided not to go with me to Idaho as he doesn’t have warm
clothing.  I couldn’t blame him with the weather being as cold as it is here. 
Mae and I were on our computers for a while before we finished getting ready to
go in the morning and went to bed about 8 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We left for
Idaho about 7 AM.  It was lightly snowing but the roads were ok.  After going
over the Malad pass the snow increased.  By the time we got to Inkom it was
staying on the roads so we had to drive much slower.  From Teton on the roads
were covered and it was still snowing.  Even with the bad roads and we also
stopped twice to stretch our legs, we still arrived at Craig and Carla’s at
1PM.  I went right to work on the boiler and got the pipes re-routed and the
furnace back before quitting this evening.  When I came upstairs Mae and Carla
was starting a game of Rummy.  I joined with them and we played until 11PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in,
having gone to bed so late last night.  I went Driggs for some more parts and
when I returned Mae had some breakfast ready for us.  I worked until 3PM
getting a valve installed on the distribution loop, so that I could force water
into the zone lines.  I then opened each zone valve separately and forced the
water through each zone until I was sure that the lines were full of water and
the air purged out.  While I was bleeding the lines I also changed the water
mate lines so that a re-circulating line can be connected from the furthermost
hot water destination back to the water mate.  This will allow them to receive
hot water faster to each outlet.  As soon as I finished purging the upstairs
zones we packed the pickup and left for home.  As we drove Mae read to me the
instruction manuals for Temple and Family History Work and A Member’s Guide to
Temple and Family History Work.  These were the two manuals were given me so
that I might learn how to fulfill my calling as a Ward Family History
Consultant.  The two manuals provide a lot of instructions as to how to do the
research, but my concern is that it often tells you that when you has a
question, ask your Ward Family History Consultant.  I am sure not ready to
answer questions.  We stopped in Idaho Falls ate dinner.  I then leaned back in
the truck seat with a pillow and blanket and Mae with me and I slept for about
½ hour.  Mae continued to read as I drove.  She read from the book “The Gift”. 
It is a novel but very good.  We got home about 9 PM.  When we walked in the
house, Mae noticed her poinsettia which I had bought her and it looked like it
was dead.  We were only gone two days, but without water for that long all the
leaves were wilted and looked dead.  It was a large beautiful poinsettia so Mae
felt bad.  She gave it some water and we will see what happens.  After getting
unpacked and some of the things put away we crawled into bed and continued to
read the last of the book.  It was mid-night when we went to sleep.  I need to
add some place that I have sure enjoyed having Mae come with me on this trip. 
She is sure special.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM but went back to bed.  We then slept until 8:30 before we got up.  By the
time we got through with our morning routine I prepared breakfast and we ate at
11 AM.  I worked on my journal getting it caught up.  Mae was excited to see
that the poinsettia was beautiful again.  I guess it just needed water, but we
didn’t think it would make it.  We were both happy to see that it did.  My Palm
day planner will not work.  I don’t know what happened to it but there is just
a black mark on a silver screen and all the information seems to be lost.  I
was going to take it back to Staple’s where I bought it as I bought a warranty
with it.  I went to the bank to deposit Scott’s check.  I also had Mae’s
prescriptions refilled at the Pharmacy, bought some groceries for Mae and
filled the car with gas.  I decided to wait until tomorrow to take the Palm
back.  I will be in Layton tomorrow anyway and it is to cold and too much
traffic to go today.  Bob and I went Home Teaching this evening.  we were able
to visit all three families.  With the Casey’s we only get to speak to them on
the steps, the Fallis’s weren’t feeling well so we just visited for a minute on
the door steps also.  Patriarch and Sister Johnson is always a nice visit.  Mae
had made pumpkin bread for me to take to each of our families and Bob brought
each of them a Christmas cake.  Mae tended Kylan and Ashley this evening while
Scott and Mishelle went shopping.  They sure enjoy their Grandma.  Scott isn’t
feeling very well this evening so they didn’t shop very long tonight.  After
they picked the children up and went home, Mae and I watched the 1933 Holiday
version of the Christmas Carrel.  I filled in my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

early so that I could take our car over to Dee’s Service and have it tuned up. 
This is the first time we have had a turn up on this car.  I had no idea how to
do a tune up on this car.  Bob followed me over and brought me back.  I took my
trailer and went to work at Linford’s.  on the way I stopped at Staple’s and
got a new Palm pilot.  They said that mine was damaged by pressure being put on
the screen.  I am not sure how I did that unless it was when I carried out my
tools from Craig and Carla’s.  Staple’s still replaced it on warranty.  I next
went to The Home Depot and got some supplies for Linford’s.  I worked 7 hours
today.  when I came home there was several accidents on the freeway so it took
me over an hour to get home.  Bryce and Irven came over and borrowed on of my
nail guns and some staples.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  She had her
Book Group this evening.  I watched a movie staring Clark Gable called “Across
the Wide Missouri”.  After it finished I made this entry.  I came down with a
head cold today.  I think I got it when Scott came to get the children last
night.  He wasn’t feeling well then.</span></p>

down all day and this evening I stayed home from the High Priest social.  Mae
went and enjoyed the evening.  I did work on the computer and restored my new
Palm Pilot.  I had to download some additional programming witch without high
speed internet took several hours.  When I did get it restored even the
scriptures were there.</span></p>

last night but still stayed down.  I did some work on my computer and set up
every member of our family on a birthday calendar.  I started watching a
western series directed by John Langdon Jr. at 10 AM and we watched it all
day.  Scott and Mishelle brought Kylan and Ashley over today so they, Scott and
Mishelle could do some Christmas shopping.  Scott didn’t come in this time as
he didn’t want to take the chance of infecting me more.  I think there is
either 5 or 6 shows in the series and we watched all of them and the first one
a second time.  It was after 11 PM when we got to bed.   I went to bed before
Mae was ready and I was out before she came to bed.</span></p>

and was up for at least ½ hour.  I almost went into the living room to set in
the recliner but decided to try going back to bed.  I did go back to sleep and
slept until almost 8AM.  We laid in bed and watched The Mormon Tabernacle Choir
and The Spoken Word.  Today they also had The Bells and Orchestra along with
some dancers.  We next lessoned to some Fireside talks on the BYU channel.  I
did some figuring to see if we needed to pay more tithing but found that until
we get some money from Sherman’s and Linford’s then I have gone in the hole
with my extra work.  That is a little discouraging to realize.  We attended our
Block program and then returned home.  Bob had prepared dinner for all our
family.  We had Roy and Linda, Irven and Sandy, Bob and Carroll, Mark and Mae
and I.  The dinner was very good and then Bob had made pumpkin pie and apple
pie for desert.  We set around for a while and just visited.  We broke up about
9 PM.  Roy and Linda had given us a special Christmas card with a lot of
meaning with it.  It was a 12 inch spike to be hung on the tree.  As we didn’t
put up a tree this year we laid it with the Nativity setting.  I filled out
this entry of my journal while Mae called and talked with Mike.  We then each
played a game of spider solitaire on the computer before we went to bed.</span></p>

early and I went to work this morning as I feel much better.  While I was
saying my morning prayers I heard Mae shout “Oh No! and several other
explanations.”  I excused myself and rushed into the kitchen.  She had turned
the wrong burner on and melted a measuring cup.  I told her I didn’t think it
was worth the heart attack she about caused me to have.  I really had to
chuckle over her excitement.  I worked until after 5PM.  Sandi was going to
come out but she had to many things going so she called and canceled.  I called
Mae to let her know.  She had dinner already so I had her ask Georgia and Rick
but they had other plans.  She invited Bob, Carroll and Mark to come down.  She
had a lovely meal and then Bob, Carroll, Mae and I played Canasta.  We didn’t
have time for a complete game but when we quite the girls were ahead so we gave
the game to them.  I filled out this entry and we went to bed. </span></p>

rang.  When I saw that the call was from Mae I wondered what I forgot.  Mae
just called to tell me how much she is enjoying the Poinsettia that I had
bought her.  She is such a wonderful wife and sweetheart.  I worked all day at
Danny and Shanna’s.  Deanna came over after lunch to tend children for Shanna. 
She came down and visited for a few minutes until the baby woke and she went to
take care of her.  It was good to visit with her about their mission.  I was
really tired when I got home.  Mae had dinner ready after I showered.  I
relaxed in the recliner for a few minutes and then we turned the TV on.  The
Hallmark show called “The Note” was just coming on so we watched it.  It was
really a good story and we sure enjoyed watching it.  I filled in this entry
while Mae took a plate of goodies to the Larsen’s.  Sister Larsen is going into
the hospital for cataract operation tomorrow.  She has sure had her share of
trials.  She is also fighting cancer for the sixth time.  Good night!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked at
Danny and Shanna’s today.  I stopped on the way this morning for a texturing
brush and a drop cloth.  I finished at 3 PM so I had time to pick up Randy’s
plans from Robert Love’s on the way home.  Mae had a Relief Society Enrichment
Night this evening.  Sandy came over and went with Mae.  Irven came over and
spent time with me.  We watched a show on Hallmark “Grandpa for Christmas”.  We
then were going to play a game when Mae and Sandy came so we played a game of
Knock and a game of Harts with them.  It is late so we will go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep very well so I let her sleep and I got myself off to work.  She had
prepared my lunch for me while she was up.  I worked hard all day and quite at
3 PM.  I will have to come back tomorrow.  I showered and cleaned up after
getting home.  I then laid on the inversion table for a few minutes and then on
the Chee machine.  I fell asleep while on the machine.  We ate dinner and then
we watched a show on Hallmark that was cute.  Mae has been busy getting things
ready for our Family Christmas party tomorrow night and getting clothes
cleaned, pressed and packed for going to Arizona.  She worked all day and all
evening.  It’s now 9:30 PM and I think we are about ready to go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went to
work at Danny and Shanna’s and worked until 1:30 PM.  it snowed last night and
the roads were very slippery this morning.  I finished and cleaned up.  I ate
my lunch on the way home.  When I got home I showered and cleaned up.  I then
went down to Randy’s and he gave me a treatment.  Mae has been very busy all
day getting things packed and ready for this evening and for our trip to
Arizona tomorrow.  She is about beat already.  I stopped on the way home and
deposited my checks from Sherman’s and from Linford’s.  We quickly packed the
things into the pickup for the family party tonight and went up to David’s.  We
had all our family, except Shellie’s family, at David’s this evening.  We had a
nice dinner, played games, sang Christmas carols and had the Christmas
nativity.  As we are not going to be hear for Christmas we exchanged Christmas
gifts this evening.  Mae got a electric grill, some jewelry and a wagon.  I
received a gift certificate for a Flaming Gorge Fishing Guided Lake Trout
Chartered Service.  Wow! What a gift from all of my family.  I will be looking
forward to that trip.  We got home after 10 PM.  Sandi and Nike stopped by and
got the snowmobiles and Mike came home with us and I gave him the snow blower. 
He used my truck to take it home.  We were tired so I filled out this journal
entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep too well and got up at 4 AM.  I slept in the recliner for a while before
getting up and again trying the bed.  After a couple of hours I went back to
bed.  We slept until almost 8 AM.  Mae woke up very discouraged over not having
gifts for our great-grand-children at the party last night.  I held her in my
arms and she cried for a while.  I told her we could drive out to Tooele and
take gifts if she wanted.  We ate breakfast and got packed but didn’t rush.  It
was noon before we left.  We tried to call JaNae but she wasn’t home.  We
stopped at Chelcie’s but they we also gone.  We then decided to just leave them
at Sandi’s.  We were glad that we did because it gave us a opportunity to see
Sandi’s decoration.  She does have her home decorated very nice.  We went south
from Tooele towards Delta and then South east to Fillmore.  We went across
highway 20 to highway 89, stopping at Panquige for gas and then we went to Page
Arizona.  Just as we were going to turn into Page a police car light turned on
behind me.  the officer said that the light on my license plate was out.  Also
I had weaved across the center line three times since he had been following
me.  He checked the apple juice that I was drinking, asked if I was tired and
asked if I was on medications.  He suggested that we stop and get some rest
which was our intent anyway.  I think that the three times that I weaved was 1<sup>st</sup>
I pulled onto the center line to show Mae the vibration markers, 2<sup>nd</sup>
as we crossed the dam there was a decoration in lights on the dam that I was
trying to see and the 3<sup>rd</sup> was I was debating on where the turning
lane was to go into town.  Anyway we stopped at the Motel 6 and stayed the
night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
us until after 8 AM, so we were to late to make the 9 AM Sacrament meeting.  We
got ready and went to breakfast.  After eating we went to the 11 AM block
meetings.  It was a Lamanite Ward with Bishop Whitehorse conducting.  We first
met the Bishop of the earlier Ward and visited with him for a few minutes.  We
next met a sister that had over heard us tell the Bishop where we were from. 
She said that she know where Clinton was as she had been on the Indian
Placement Program living in West Point.  We told about us having Grace Upshaw
with us on the program and she said that she had met Grace and that her and her
husband had given Grace a ride to Newgallip New Mexico where Grace lived. 
Attending the Lamanite Ward was a very enjoyable experience.  From there we
stopped at the Maverick gas station so I could get a frozen yogurt but the
station was under total remodeling and closed.  We drove on to Flag Staff and
stopped at a Maverick there where we got gas and some frozen yogurts.  We drove
on to the Phoenix area and stopped to stretch our legs before driving on to
Shellie and Roy’s.  While we were stopped Mae called Mike to let them know that
we arrived ok.  Mike said that he had spent most of the day working on the snow
blower in order to get is repaired and running.  He was really proud that he
could do it.  We visited with the family for a little while before going to
bed.</span></p>

although I had got up earlier but was able to go back to sleep.  I decided to
cook biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  I took a shower and shaved and then
started breakfast.  Shellie came in and helped me.  We visited almost more than
we cooked but finally got breakfast ready.  Roy worked on his truck most of the
day.  I tried to find parts for our car to get the license plate light repaired
but will not be able to get the part until Wednesday morning as they are
closing for Christmas Eve.  We helped wrap Christmas presents.  I helped Roy a
little with his truck.  Mae and Shellie went shopping.  Mae was able to buy her
some sweaters at Mervin’s where Garrett works, so not only were they on sale
but we also got Garrett’s discount.  This evening we help deliver some presents
to a single mother and her daughters that are friends of Shellie and Roy.  They
need the help.  The gifts were delivered anonymously.  By the time we got
presents wrapped and set under the tree and I entered my journal it was after
mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke just
before 6 AM and had asked myself why no one was up by now on Christmas morning
when Quint came over the intercom and said, “Mom and Dad it’s now 6 o’clock! 
When can we get up?”  We were soon all up and it was a very enjoyable Christmas
morning.  The children were very good at watching others open their gifts and
were excited to give others a gift from them.  I got a pair of new pajamas, a
new jump suit, a tie, an adjustable ranch, a DVD, a bottle of peanuts and of
course the fishing trip from all my children and the picture album that Shellie
made for us of the Israel trip.  I gave Mae a dress, a sweater and a DVD plus
all the gifts from the grandchildren.  As the gifts concluded the last gift for
the children was a large box.  They all gathered around while it was opened. 
It had bricks plus a note in the box.  The note inside the box, lead them on a
treasure hunt that all the children participated in.  It was fun to see them
include Jase in the fun.  It ended up taking them to the toy hauler in the
driveway and inside was a sandy buggy.  Mae and I took a nap as did Roy and
Shellie.  Garrett also took a nap but the other boys just kept going all day. 
Cheryl called us to wish us a Merry Christmas and to thank us for our Christmas
letter that we sent to her.  Mike called to wish us a Merry Christmas and said
that they had got several inches of snow and he sure enjoyed using the snow
blower to clean his walks and driveway as well as several other peoples in the
area.  I help Roy get the sand buggy out and everyone enjoyed a ride with it. Garrett
and I drew on plans for Randy’s house for a while.  There is some things that
Garrett was able to show me with the AutoCAD and some things I showed him.  Shellie,
Garrett, Mae and I watched a movie but it wasn’t that good.  Mae and Shellie
got visiting and I fell asleep.  It was after mid-night when I finished this
entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

and then Mae and I took showers and I shaved.  Shellie cooked omelets for
breakfast.  Roy worked most of the day getting his machines ready to go to the
sand dooms.  I went to a Chevrolet dealer in Chandler and got the parts to repair
the light over the license plate and when I got back home I replaced the broken
one.  It was almost 5 PM before we were able to get away.  We drove to Yuma and
then crossed the Arizona, California state line.  It was about another 20 miles
to the sand duns.  There were quite a large number of camps but we found a spot
that Roy liked and set up the camp.  </span></p>

The day was spent with Roy and the boys riding the sand machines.  Mae and I
did go out for a little while with the new sand buggy.  I was surprised that
the boys spent quite a few hours watching videos.  I got pretty tired of them
and went for a walk.  This evening Roy was trying to repair the muffler on the
new sand buggy when the trailer gas supply tanks ran to empty.  I volunteered
to go to Yuma to get more propane.  Shellie wanted to go with me.  We only had
to go about 10 miles when I saw a Shell service station and took a chance of
them having propane.  They did and the also had most of the items that Shellie
wanted.  Roy was surprised when we returned to camp so quickly.  </span></p>

a happy birthday.  Mae and I had decided to go shopping for her a birthday gift
after Christmas but She and Shellie went Wednesday afternoon and bought her 4
sweaters for her Birthday gift from me.  Oh well it saved me some shopping. 
Again the boys and Roy went riding.  Shell and Roy went out together for a
while.  The boys again spent a lot of time watching Gilligan’s Island on DVD. 
Mae and I took a long walk.  I took a map for a while.  Shellie cooked Mae a
Birthday Cake.  </span></p>

was about the same with the boys playing for a while on the machines and then
coming back and watched more DVD’s.  I went outside and read for a while.  Mae
and I went for a longer walk today.  I laid down and took a nap and about 1 PM
was woke up.  We packed up and left about 4 PM for home.  We stopped at Yuma
and got something to eat.  It was about 9 PM when we got home.  We unpacked and
put things away.  Mae and I were tired so after showering we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
after 8 AM and soon started getting ready for church.  We attended meetings
with Roy and Shellie.  The boys road to church with us.  Mae had asked me it I
know where the church house was and I said that I did.  How ever as I started
to go to the church Garrett ask me why I was going the direction that I was.  I
was then told that they attended a new building since we were here last.  It
was a good thing Garrett road with us as I think Quint and Kevis would not have
noticed that I was going the wrong direction until we arrived at the wrong
chapel.  We arrived just as the meeting was starting.  We enjoyed the spirit
that was in the sacrament meeting.  The testimonies and speakers did a very
good ob.  I was especially impressed with the Sister that spoke as she told of
an experience that happened to her in her senior year at high school.  She was
on the golf team and towards the end of the tournament her ball went into a
sand trap.  It took her 14 strokes before she got out of the trap.  I can’t
imagine still having the courage to finish the game.  Shellie teaches the
Gospel Doctrine class and did a very good time.  Veldon and Pattie Seymore also
attended Shellie and Roy’s ward.  We enjoyed attending the Gospel Doctrine
Class as Shellie is the teacher.  She was well prepared and got good class
participation.  We were very proud to be her parents.  After the meetings
Shellie cooked a very nice dinner.  Roy’s parents also came over and had dinner
with us.  Before they left Roy’s father read us an experience of his 2<sup>nd</sup>
cousin who served as a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam conflict. It was a very
interesting experience.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and after getting up I showered and shaved.  I had a call from Nike that we
missed yesterday so I called it back.  I couldn’t reach either Nike or Sandi
but Sandi soon called me back to let me know that the Flaming Gorge fishing had
to be scheduled or loose it so they scheduled it for August the 7<sup>th</sup>. 
We will try to work a trip out of it for more than Nike and I.   Shellie cooked
hot cakes for breakfast.  Roy prepared his hot cakes and as he went to pour
syrup over them the bottle separated for the lid and handle.  The bottle
dropped onto his plate but syrup splashed all over Roy, Shellie and Mae plus
the table chairs and floor.  Everyone stopped all activity and set very quiet
but my mind remembered getting mad at the cow for kicking over the bucket of
milk.  I jumped up with the bucket and slammed it over the back of the cow. 
The milk that had remained in the bucket splashed back into my face.  Mike and
David held their laugh for a minute and then roared with laughter.  That is
just what I did with this instance and it did break the tension as I told my
experience.  After breakfast I helped Roy empty the sewer tanks on the trailer
and return it to the storage lot where he keeps it.  This afternoon Mae and I
went to the grocery store to get a few items.  We then took the car to a car
wash where we washed and vacuumed it out.  We came back home and waxed and
polished the car.  It sure looks much better now.  Roy and Shellie went over to
some friends for a New Years Eve party.  Mae and I stayed home with the kids. 
The kids were playing video games so Mae and I put on a DVD.  It was one that
we had watched before but we still enjoyed it.  I am disappointed that Shellie
and Roy’s children just want to watch or play the selection of entertainment that
they do.  They don’t watch TV because of the pour selection of shows on it but
I am not sure that a lot of these selections are not just as bad.  I don’t know
and only time will tell.  I came in and worked on my journal rather that watch
the show Garrett had put on.  Garrett went to a party with some of his friends
so I put the DVD of “The Times and Teachings of Joseph Smith” volume 1 on and
we watched it.  Shellie and Roy came home and we played games until just before
mid-night.  We then stopped and prepared for a count down and wished the New
Year in with noise makers and a toast of non-alcoholic wine.  I finished up
this journal entry and started 2008’s journal.</span></p>
