<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7:30 although I had been up earlier.  I tried to get started on our
canning project with Mark, Bob, Irven and us.  This became frustrating trying
to get cost and weights figured out in order to make up some labels.  While I
was working on this I received a call from Utah Sleep Institute to schedule
another test my doctor wants done.  I scheduled it for this Saturday but they
again called me to tell me that there company will no longer be paid by my
plan.  I called Larry Saiz to see what the program that he talked to us about
in which we will pay.  He wants me to let him know what the results are.  If we
changed with him now it wouldn’t become affective until 1 April.  I spent over
1 ½ hours on the phone and so far haven’t got things worked out.  I went to
Kitchen Kneeds and got more canning items.  From there I went to the Church
Home Canning and purchased more cans, boxes, lids, air packages and some
refried beans for Sandy.  I also got the canner.  I stopped and got gas for my
pickup.  I visited with David about his investments and suggested that I might
see if Charles Hyer would meet with him and give some suggestions.  I would
also like to be with them if he does.  I will visit with Charles about it.  Mae
has been gone since before noon to visit with Georgia and they went through
some of their Grand Mother Porter’s things.  It was late when I got home so
when I found out that Mae would be after 6:30 PM before she got home I got
something to eat.  I was able to get 4 hours drawing time from 7 PM to 11 PM on
Randy’s plans.  Mae didn’t get home until 7 PM from Georgia’s.  They had a good
time going through old papers of their Grandmother’s.  She was able to find a
wallet size picture of the picture she first gave me of her.  It was a copy she
had given to her Grandmother.  My 8 x 10 picture has been lost for many years
so I am glad to see this one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today was
spent canning food storage in Bob’s garage.  We has borrowed the can sealer
from the Ogden Home Canning Center and also purchased the cans and other needed
materials from there.  We had bought some of the foods from Kitchen Kneads and
some dried refried beans for the canning center.  All of us also had some items
that we wanted to can along with the wheat that Irven had purchased for Mom
before he got married.  I had moved it from Sunset to Idaho Falls to Layton to
Bob’s.  Several times I had treated it with dry ice to keep the insects
(weevil) out of it.  It was still good so we wanted it canned.  We decided that
we would just divide the wheat up among all of us.  We got a lot done today but
quite about 4 PM and cleaned as we were tired and Mae and I had plans for this
evening.  Mae and I showered and changed and went to David’s where my children
gathered in honor of my Birthday.  David had bought food from a Japanese
restraint in Salt Lake.  Mike stopped on his way and picked it up.  When we got
to David’s we found that Tyler is sick so Shauna stayed with him upstairs. 
Mike came with out Becky as she is sick.  Scott came with out Mishelle as Kylan
is sick with an ear ache.  Jeff, Gail and Benji made it.  Sandi, Nick, Chelci
and Steve were able to come also.  We ate and visited and then played games. 
Jeff and Gail gave me another gift certificate from Maverik and the rest went
together on a gift certificate from Penney’s so I can buy another set of dress
coveralls.  As we were visiting Mike told us how his David is letting studies
wait until they are due and when they ask him about it he just says “I have it
under control or I am thinking about it” and then at the last minute pulls it
off.  He also told how Taylor is always working way in advance to have her
school work done.  Both are caring a 4.0 average.  Although Mike was
criticizing David he was also quite proud of all his children.  When we started
to break up, Jeff wanted to stay longer.  Gail road home with Sandi and Nick
and Jeff stayed with Benji.  We stayed as Mae wanted to clean up.  I went
downstairs with David and Jeff and visited with them while they played ping
pong.  They are very good a ping pong and they remind me of the way Hale
played.  I am afraid that they have several things in common with Hal.  Mae
hade the house cleaned up before long and we came home.  She amazes me as to
how fast she can clean things up.  I was so tired that I went right to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up
and going with the canning by 9 AM.  We were completed canning and got Sandy’s
sorted out and loaded in the pickup for her.  Sandy left for home and the rest
of us went in and had soup that Carroll had made for us.  Carroll also made
cabbage for us for lunch yesterday.  Both meals were very good.  It took the
rest of the day to sort out each of our shares.  Bob and I helped Mark take his
items to his storage shed.  I borrowed a dolly from Mark to take my items to
our storage room.  Bob was able to put his items in the garage where we had
removed the wheat.  I was sure tired but we all were glad to have the job done
and the added food storage put up.  After showering Mae and I watched a show on
TV and then started watching a documentary on the Old Testament.  I got to
sleepy to watch more so we turned it off to watch later.  I did learn one thing
that really interested me is that the Old Testament or Torah was not written
down until after 587 BC while the Jews were in captivity in Babylon.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in until
8 AM.  I got part of my journal caught up to date.  At 11 AM we had an
appointment with the Bishop for new Temple recommends.  We went to meetings a
little early to meet with Sister Smith to discuss the nursery.  We then had
children start coming in.  it seemed that most of the time I had at least one
child on my lap and quite often I had two on my knees.  By the time the two
hours were up I was tired.  Mae and I were asked to give the prayers in
Sacrament meeting.  We had a large attendance today as one family was having an
adopted daughter blessed.  After meeting Mae and I were set apart in our
nursery calling.  Bob had dinner prepared when we got home from meetings.  Mae
and I worked on the assignment that Brother Barrett gave us and wanted us to
have done for tomorrow night.  We worked on it as we had spare time today and
was able to complete it.  I called Jeff to ask his help and he invited us over
for a while.  We got on his computer and use the world search.  With this
program we were able to find the location of the last two cities on the
assignment.  Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played a game of marbles and a game of
Rook.  Both teams were with-in one hand of winning and then we each went back. 
The score was 255 to 255 so we called it a draw and quite.  Mae and I got home
at 10:30.  I filled in my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up about
8 AM.  This morning I scanned the Birthday card into my journal.  I called Dr. Francis’s
office and told them that the Utah Sleep Institute had called me and told me
that they could not give me the test that Dr. Francis had asked for.  The nurse
said she would make some calls and I should hear back today or tomorrow.  I
then scanned the picture of Mae that she found and work a while.  I worked on
the plans for Craig and Carla for a couple of hours.  The McKay Sleep Institute
called me and made an appointment for me to come in Friday evening for the next
test.  I then went over to Penney’s to get a jump suit but they didn’t have any
now.  I bought a suitcase for our trip.  Traffic was terrible getting home.  Bob
called when I got home and said that he had banana cream pie ready for us.  As
soon as Mae got home he again called so we went up.  The pie was delicious and
I had two slices of it.  We had to leave before 6 PM in order to get to
Providence for the meeting with Brother Barrett.  It was a very informative
evening and as we left he reminded those going to Egypt that he would see them
on Wednesday.  The time has gone so fast and it is about time for us to leave
for Israel also.  It was 10:30 PM when we got home.  I finished this entry and
we went to bed.  I have eaten all the way home to keep awake so I may not sleep
very well tonight.</span></p>

before 8 this morning but by the time we get through getting going items it was
after 9 when I got on the computer and started on Craig &amp; Carla’s plans. 
Bob came down and reminded me that I was going to return the canner this
morning.  I am glad he did as I had forgotten it.  I returned those items and
then got right back to work on the plans.  I worked until we went to bed at 8
PM.  Mae has been busy all day going through her Grandmothers scrap books and
collectable items.  She has really been excited with what she has found.  We
watched another segment of the Old Testament DVD that we have.  It was
interesting to realize just how the Jewish Leaders put the first Torah together
and then how the changed and reinterpreted it as to their needs, such as no
fighting on the Sabbath.  They had the Greeks attack them on the Sabbath and
latterly slaughtered most of them.  They then changed the Torah to say that
they could not start a fight on the Sabbath but they could protect themselves
if others attack first.  This DVD is not by LDS authors but it is still very
informative.  We got it in preparation for our trip to Israel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After I got
going the first thing I had to do is to enter yesterday’s journal entry.  It
was after 9:30 AM before we ate breakfast.  I got on the computer about 9 AM. 
By noon I was about ready to go to Durk’s to visit with Jarad.  Mae had me move
some of our storage so that we had room for our safe.  Mae has sure been busy
trying to get ready for her Book group, pack for our trip and everything she
has to do. After visiting with Jarad I went to Penney’s to check on getting
another set of coveralls.  On the way to Penney’s I stopped at Pet Mart and
gave them some brochures on N.A.I.P.    I then went to C.A.L. Ranch to see if
they carried any nicer coveralls but they don’t.  I also left them some brochures. 
Bob and I went Home Teaching to Patriarch and Sister Johnstun.  As we left
their place we had planned on visiting the Fallis’s also this evening but they
called and ask if we could stop by Sunday.  Mae did her Visiting Teaching this
afternoon also.  Mae and I went over to get our Temple Recommends signed by our
Stake Presidency.  I had a good visit with President Mitchel and after the
interview we discussed Family Preparedness and we are to suggest that we should
store guns and ammunition.  We discussed our mission and our present callings
also.  We watched some more of our DVD on the Jews and their history before
going to bed.  Mae did some ironing while we watched the DVD.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went to
Randy’s and did some discussing of the plans on there house.  It looks like we
are going to remodel their home rather than build a new home.  I looked at
their garage door and after making some calls set things up with a company to
repair the door springs.  I called on the hydronic heat system for Craig and
Carla and made arrangements for Craig to pick up the first of the materials on
Monday March 12<sup>th</sup>.  This after noon we met Georgia in Roy and she
road with us to the Ogden where we attended the Ogden Temple and had Hal and
Jean sealed to each other as husband and wife and then sealed Cyndi to her
parents.  There was a great spirit there as we did the Temple ordnances for
them.  We help with the sealings of other parents to children, while we were
there.  We met Kim and Calab just as I came out of the dressing rooms.  We
visited with them for a few minutes.  After we returned home Mae was busy
getting ready for her book group this evening.  I worked on plans this
evening.  It was 10:30 before we headed to bed.</span></p>

Randy’s and he gave me a treatment.  From there I came home and took the
snowmobile back into the shop to have them check it.  I went to the viewing of
Debra Lynn Higley Allred.  She is the sister of Glen Higley who is the High
Priest Group leader.  The thing we remember most about Debra is that she was
our baby sitter when we lived in Clearfield.  If we called her she would always
be available when we wanted her even if she had to cancel other plans to tend
for us.  we have special memories of Debra.  I did some checking on materials
for Craig and Carla’s job.  I got home just in time to change and we went to
Bountiful where we met Bob and Pauline Hines at the Chuck-A-Rama for diner and
to visit about their and our mission experience.  I went to the McKay Dee
health clinic in Layton for another sleep test.  I got there at 9 PM and the
technician had me fill out the paper work and got me wired up for the test.  I
then had him put the DVD, which I brought of “Kingdom of David”, on the
player.  I watched the last segment of the series before I went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 5
AM to use the bathroom.  I had to have the technician come in and unplug me.  I
thought I might come back to bed but by the time I got through with being unplugged
I was fully awake so when I came back I just had the technician remove the
wires and I got dressed and came home.  It was 6:30 AM when I got home.  Mae
was still asleep so I did my scripture study and then took a shower and went
back to bed.  Mae let me sleep until 9:30 AM.  I worked on Craig and Carla’s
plans quite a bit today.  I went shopping at the grocery store for Mae and it
gave me a break.  David &amp; Shauna had us tend Conner this afternoon while
they took Tyler and Emily skiing.  Jeff and Gail also had us tend Benji while
they went to a play in S.L.  Both boys were a delight to have and were very
easy to tend.  Mae prepared food for tomorrow.  I spent a little while with Bob
trimming some fruit trees.  We enjoyed the boys being here.  When we ate dinner
I fed Benji. Mae then changed his dipper, gave him a bottle and but him down to
sleep.  Mae played games with Conner.  When David came to get him about 9 PM he
didn’t want to leave.  David asked him if he wanted to stay with Grandma and he
said yes.   After they left Mae and I quit and went to bed to watch a show.  It
was about 11 PM when Jeff and Gail came and got Benji.</span></p>

said they would be ready about 9 but Mae reminded him that it was already past
9 and would soon be 10AM.  Breakfast was great.  We had to hurry to get to
church.  Mae gave the lesson today in nursery.  I came up with the idea of
popping popcorn for the children to watch and they did get excited with it. 
Mike’s family all came up for dinner this afternoon and that was a good time. 
We played the game 99 and enjoyed that.  Mike tried to download the program to
create an PDF file but he was unable.  It didn’t work for me either when I
tried it yesterday.  I did a little to Carla and Craig’s drawing and then
filled in my journal while Mae made some calls and cleaned up the house.  This
daylight saving time kind of throws thing off.  </span></p>

AM when we got up.  Bob came down and wanted me to go with him to Sherrie’s to
check her furnace.  He brought down hot waffles for our breakfast.  I got some
tools and went with him.  The pilot light was out so I relit it.  After
lighting it every thing seemed to work.  Bob helped me reload my snowmobile onto
the trailer.  I tried again to get a program that will allow me to create a PDF
file but was unsuccessful again today.  Craig called and is on his way down to
get the first load of parts for their heat system.  I did some work on their
plans in preparation of Craig coming.  When Craig and Collin arrived Mae had
lunch ready.  I showed him the plans for his heat system and we went over to
Durk’s where we got the materials.  Jarad had the items all palletized and
ready to load.  We then went to I.C.S. and bought two rolls of 6” grid wire. 
It was after 3 PM when Craig and Collin left for home with a large load.  I
went to C.A.L. Ranch and bought three pair of Wrangler dress pants.  I then
went to Dick’s in Clearfield and got my snowmobile.  They found a leaking
gasket that was letting air enter below the carburetor.  Mae has been busy
getting ready things ready for our trip.  We found out that our carry on case
was too large.  It took some time to find two that were within the limits.  We
borrowed one from Carroll.  Mae also tried to clear out the E-mail file.  I
made up some capsules of my Mannatech supplements.   We had one e-mail to
answer for the missionary reunion on the 30<sup>th</sup> of March.  There was a
survey to fill out for it and that took some time.  It was mid-night before we
got to bed.</span></p>

Mae hadn’t slept very well so I tried not to wake her.  After using the
bathroom I came into the computer and started on it.  I did get several pages
of the student handbook copied so I don’t have to take the hole book with me to
do my daily studying.  Mae soon woke anyway.  I suddenly remembered that I had
an appointment with Randy for a treatment.  Mae was saying her morning prays,
so I just ran out and went to Randy’s.  He worked on me for over an hour.  Mae
had breakfast ready for us shortly after I got home.  We worked all day getting
things about ready to go in the morning.  We did a little more shopping for
last minute items.  Mae got a treatment from Dr. Cordova.  I tried to back up
my computer onto the external hard drive but got confused and gave up for now. 
Mae gave me a hair cut this evening.  It was 10:30 PM when Mae was ready for
bed so I joined her and will let less important things wait.  I am going to
write my journal in a note book on this trip and then copy it back to my

before 11 AM.  Bob went with us to the airport so he could return our car.  We
stopped at Dr. Cordova’s for Mae to get some pain relief cream to take with
us.  We flew United Airline to Denver where we had to make connecting flights. 
At the Denver airport we met up with Shellie, Roy, Garrett, Quint and Kevis and

enjoyable to see the Temple and be guided by two Sister Missionary’s around the
grounds.  We then went downtown Frankfurt and found it very interesting to see
the old and new city.  During the II World War Frankfurt was 75% destroyed so
most of the buildings have been rebuilt during my life time.  Frankfurt is
called the banking capital of the world and you soon realize that there is a bank
on almost every block of the downtown area.  This is where the Rothschild’s are
from and others that you hear of with their names being attached with the
control of the financial industry of the world.  By the end of the day I was
tired and finally found a bench where I could rest and wait for the others to
finish the tour.  We went to a German restaurant for dinner and then to the
Airport to check in for our continuing flight to Israel.  The check in security
was very strict and when they found that I had something inside my boots they
were sure that I was trying to smuggle something in.  I had to remove my shoes
and socks and they took the money belts back for a security check.  The guard
acted almost disappointed when he returned it to me with finding nothing except
money.  After getting through that gate of waiting in lines we only went a
short distance where we had to go through the search a second time.  This time
I removed the money belt before I went through the check.  When I went through
the gate they tried to give me the wrong basket.  I objected that it was not
mine and was treated some what rudely until another lady returned the basket
she had been given by mistake also.  That upset me to have to go through two
different screenings within the same airport to get to our check in gate.  We then
found that there were not water fountains or restrooms available in that
terminal.  I had to leave every thing with Mae and then return to the outer
area for those facilities and then go through the screening a third time.  We
left Frankfurt at 10:35 PM to continue to Israel.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was 3:30
AM when we arrived at Tel Aviv Jerusalem.  We had to wait there for about two
hours until the group that went to Egypt arrived.  We toured Tel Aviv which is
a new city, by bus.  Most of it has been built since 1968 so is quite modern. 
We then went to Joppa.  According to Jewish legend, Noah’s son, Japheth found
this city and port after the flood.  Joppa is where Jonas was when he was
commanded to go to Nivevah to call the people to repentance or be destroyed. 
Jonas didn’t want to so he boarded a ship going else where.  A storm arose and
the ship was about to parish so Jonas had the crew throw him over into the
sea.  He was then swallowed by a large fish and spent three days in the belly. 
The fish then throw him up onto the shore and he went to Nivevah and warned the
people.  After warning then he went upon the hill where he could watch Nivevah’s
destruction.  The people decided to repent and when the Lord didn’t destroy Nivevah,
Jonas was upset.  Peter was also in Joppa when he received the vision of the
sheet coming down from Heaven with all kinds of foods that the Jews had been
taught were unclean for man to eat.  When the Lord commanded him to eat he
replied “not so my Lord for they are unclean and he had never eaten of unclean
food.”  The Lord then told him that what the Lord had cleansed he should not
call unclean.  Then he was interrupted by three men coming in search of the
Gospel that were not of the Jewish Faith.  We visited some excavations at
Caesarea where Herod the Great built a city in honor of Augustus.  We then went
to Haifa where we visited the graves of two Mormon missionaries that died
there.  They were not missionary companions and were on separate callings but
they took sick and due to the expense of having them returned to the U.S., they
were buried there.  Most of our group went for lunch there but I wasn’t feeling
well so stayed on the bus, resting and sleeping the rest of the afternoon. 
Arrangements had been for a nice hotel there in Haifa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, March 17, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up
early and had breakfast at 7 AM and loaded the bus by 8 AM and off for another
day.  We went first to Mount Carmel and oh what a beautiful area.  This is the
sight where Elijah challenged the priest of Baal.  Off course we do not know
the exact location where the alters were placed but do know that we were in the
area with in a hundred yards.  It was so inspiring to look down from that area
on the valleys below and know that we were on sacred ground.  On the way up the
mountain, and that was quite a ride up there, Brother Barrett explained about a
city there where the Druse are active.  They are a break off from the
Israelites that believe in reincarnation, they believe that Christ will yet be
born of a man.  They do not proselyte but are very secretive about their
beliefs and organization.  A person must wait until they are an adult and then
he has to come to them to get information about their organization and beliefs
and then go through a couple of years of testing before he will be accepted
into their faith.  Brother Barrett also pointed out several Kuibutes which is a
communal village.  They are no longer like the original were but are a form of socialism. 
We next went to Tel Megiddo.  (A <i>Tel </i>is a hill made up of one city being
built on top of a previously existing city.)  Also in Israel all of the towns
and cities are built on the mountain tops and sides so the valleys can be used
for agriculture.  (This makes good since too me.)  At this dig (a dig is an
archaeological uncovering of ancient ruins.)  I believe that here they have
found possibly 9 civilizations that have existed in this spot.  From the city
Megiddo, we overlooked the Valley of Megiddo, where the last great battle Armageddon,
will commence at the second coming of Christ.  It seems so incredible to be in
this area.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our next stop
was at Nazareth at a KFC where we had lunch.  Nazareth is now a very large city
that is well over 2,000 families.  In the Old Testament Nazareth was not even
mentioned and in the New Testament it was a very insignificant village of maybe
200 families.  I couldn’t help thinking of the song “I Walked Today Where Jesus
Walked” and the verse that mentions “those little paths, they have not changed”
and couldn’t help thinking “those little path, oh how they have changed”.  We
went to an area that has been preserved and rebuilt to show how Nazareth would
have looked.  I am not sure if the buildings are from a dig or just
reconstructed.  We were taken through by a guide that explained the olive trees,
the vineyards and the buildings.  There was an olive press, a synagogue, houses
and also sheep and donkeys.  There were people dressed in the clothing styles
of New Testament time and they gave us samples of unleavened bread and olives. 
I really enjoyed this area and it gave me a good feeling as to how Nazareth
would have been at the time of Jesus youth.  We think of Joseph being a
carpenter but a carpenter was also a worker of stone.  Stone is the main
building material in Israel with wood only being the trim and roofing
materials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After leaving
the village we went to the Church of the Annunciation.  This is a Catholic
Church built in the 1<sup>st</sup> century.  It was built to commemorate the
announcement to Mary and later to Joseph, by the Angel Gabriel, that Mary would
be the mother of Christ.  Brother Barrett said that he was first shown this
sight by Father Raphael, a Catholic Priest.  It is interesting that the chapel
has a baptismal font in it.  We next went to the Church of Joseph where it is
believed was the place where Mary and Joseph lived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We stayed in
a very nice hotel in Nazareth.  It is neat to think that we walked, ate slept
in the town where Jesus lived but oh how it has changed!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, March 18, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Brother
Barrett had arranged for a room in the hotel so that we might meet with all the
members of our tour.  There are a total of 34 members in our group.  Brother
Steve Miller, a Stake President, conducted the meeting.  We had an opening song
and prayer, then four had been called on to speak, Brother Gary Sorenson (a
former Mission President), Brother Ralph Brisco (a former Bishop), Sister Patsy
Seymore and our son-in-law Roy Seymore.  They all gave very good talks.  We
then went to breakfast in the dinning area.  We loaded the bus at 9 AM and left
for another day of touring.  We went to an archeology dig called Sepphoris or
Zippori as it sits on the top of a hill like the bird Zippor.  This is a large
sight where they are finding great historical information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We next went
to Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee.  The Sea of Galilee is 200 ft. below sea
level.  We ate lunch a McDonald’s which is on the sea shore.  We could see
several men fishing off the shore which of course interested me.  From there we
went to some hot springs where Herod had built some hot bath houses.  That
seems to have been one of there favorites activities at the time.  We next went
to the Jordan River where the river leaves the Sea of Galilee.  Some feel that
John baptized in this area but Brother Barrett does not feel this is where he
baptized Jesus.  At this area facilities have been built where they perform
baptisms.  There are dressing rooms and seating areas near the river, walkways with
railings for people to enter into the water.  Here baptisms in the Jordan River
are being performed daily.  We were able to watch several groups that seemed to
have their own ministers that talked to their group and then took them in to
the river to be baptized.  It was interesting to watch but somewhat different
than our baptisms.  They didn’t seem to have witnesses, the arm was not raised
to the square, care was not taken for complete immersion and no authority was
used.  But it was neat to see sincere people wanting to follow after Christ.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We next came
to Ein Gev Kibbutz where we stayed at the Holiday Village.  Ein Gev is at the
foot of the Golan Heights.  The Golan Height range has been and still is a strategic
military command as there is so much area that can be overlooked from there. 
There is an electronic surveillance station that Brother Barrett said they
monitor all electronic communications.  I asked if they could hear him speaking
over the bus microphone system and he replied that he was sure they could. 
After getting settled in our rooms we went to dinner and after dinner Mae,
Patsy and I went to Roy and Shellie’s room and played cards for a while.  Roy
had lain down and fallen asleep.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, March 19, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up
early this morning.  In my personal study I caught hold of the thoughts of how insignificant</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I am.  I guess that if you
combined all the oceans together and then removed a teaspoon of water, it might
represent the total membership of the church in comparison to all humanity that
has and do live upon this earth.  I am then caused to reflect “Why me?”              </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had
breakfast at 7 AM and were to be on the bus by 8 AM.  Brother Barrett kindly
chastised all of us for some of us were late getting on the bus, which holds
everyone else up and costs us time from our sight seeing schedule.                As
we traveled Brother Barrett pointed out the areas, telling us about the Golan
Heights and so much history that I can only remember small amounts.  We stopped
at the Tel of Bethsaida which has only recently been excavated.  Here is where
Jesus fed the 5,000 and where Jesus cast the legions of evil spirits out of the
man and they entered into the herd of swine, which ran to the sea and drown
themselves.  This is the area where Jesus gave the Beatitudes.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Brother Gary
Sorenson interrupted to tell a joke; the old man said, “I don’t know much but
if you want <b>peace</b> in this life you need to learn two words – Yes Mame.” 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                As we were
walking through the Tel, a guide from another tour group told us that someone from
our group was walking into a mine field.  We quickly found that Garrett had just
got ahead of our group but had seen the warning signs.  Brother Barrett
cautioned us about the warning signs.  There are many areas that had been mined
during recent conflicts between the Jews and the Palestinians.  It was easer to
fence and place warning signs than to clear the mines.  We were all more
cautious  and aware of these areas after this experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Dallia is our
guide, and maybe I need to explain about having a guide when Brother Barrett is
our tour leader.  Shortly after Brother Barrett starting taking tours to Israel
he was told that if he was to be checked as a “Tour Guide” his passport would
be stamped, he would be escorted out of the country and he would never be
allowed to return again.  Tour Guides must be Israelis.  He now has to hire a
guide and he is a group leader.  Anyway, Dallia told us that in the book “Our
Man in Damascus” it states that it doesn’t rain in Israel from May to October. 
It has sure been raining since we got here and most days are cold.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We traveled north
to Dan,  the furthest north city in Israel.  On the way we could see Mount Herman. 
Its elevation is 9,000 to 9,400 feet and is now covered with snow.  In the
winter months they do go skiing there.  We had to pass through Kiryat Shemona. 
Brother Barrett said that we were in the most dangerous area that we will go
into.   Many homes have concrete bunkers and when the alert sirens go off the
people go into the bunkers.  LeBanon is located on the west and Syria is on the
east and quite often rockets will be fired at this town.  However, the people
go on about their daily life.  At Tel Dan there are some large springs that
come out of the ground and provides 220,000,000 cubic meters of water annually. 
This is at the head of the Jordan River.  The area is a National Park and game
preserve.  We went to the “High Place” where Dan put one of the two Golden
Calves, which they stole from Mount Ephraim.  It lead the people into
idolatry.  We went to the dig of Laish where they are uncovering the main gate
and where Abraham may have passed through when he went to rescue Lot and his
family from the kings of Mesopotamia.  That would have been 5,000 years ago,
after Sodom was destroyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We then went
to the Golan Heights and as we drove, we could see many areas that were fenced
with warning signs on them because of mine fields.  We stopped for lunch at
Birkat-Ram.  A stand had apples that the lady was juicing.  It was rather
expensive ($4.00 for a small cup),  but the juice was so sweet and delicious. 
After lunch we drove on to the top of the Golan Heights where we stopped just
above the cease fire line in the Six Day War of 1967.  Below we could see the
road to Damascus where Paul was visited by the Lord.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When we got
back to the motel, some of us changed into swimming suits and went for a swim
in the Sea of Galilee.  The water was cold but after Roy dove into the water,
Garret and I also dove in.  Quint was kind of forced to go in but Veldon, Kevis
and Mae just waded.  Shellie came in swimming after she took pictures. 
Although the water was cold I wouldn’t have missed this swim.  After getting
dressed Mae and I wanted to see the ostrich farm but when we asked at the front
desk we were told they no longer had many ostriches, just one or two.    We
decided not to go as it was over a mile away and we might miss dinner.  We
walked down to the sea shore and sat for a while just taking in the privilege
of being on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.  At 7 PM we loaded the bus and
went to a Fish House ran by the Kibbutz for dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast we took the bus to the boat dock.  There we loaded a boat and went
across the Sea of Galilee.  As we got underway, the crew hoisted the American Flag
and we all stood with pride for our country and sang the Star Spangle Banner. 
The crew then raised the flag of Jerusalem and we all applauded.  About half
way across the lake the crew stopped the boat and Brother Barrett related the
account of Jesus calming the sea and Jesus walking on the water.  We then sang
a Hymn that is no longer in our Hymn Book, “Memories of Galilee”.  I remember
that Hymn from my youth.  This was a very spiritual and moving experience.  We
stopped at the Kibbutz Nof Ginnosa and viewed a film of the finding an ancient
boat from the time of Jesus.  It showed how two brothers found the remains of a
old boat buried in the mud in 1996 when because of drought the seas waters were
very low.  They soon recognized that this was an archaeological find and called
for help.  The boat was successfully brought out of the mud and is now
preserved in a museum.  The construction methods, the nails, the wood jointing
and pattern, a pot and a lamp all gives evident that it was a boat dating back
to Jesus’ time 2000 years ago.  As we were loading the bus for our next
destination, a young man came selling souvenirs.  I bought 6 caps for $15, the
same caps that inside the museum they wanted $9 each.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We next went
to the dig of Capernaum.  What a spiritual experience this was.  Thirty years
ago Elder Bruce R. McConkie said that we didn’t know where Capernaum was located
but these digs are now proof of the important events that took place in this
city.  Some of those events were, after Jesus was rejected by his home town he
made Capernaum his home, Peter lived in Capernaum, Jesus healed his
mother-in-law here, Jesus called Peter, James, Andrew, John and Matthew here,
Jesus taught in the synagogue, cast out devils, healed the sick, caused a blind
man to see, healed the centurions servant, a sick man was let down through the
roof to Jesus and healed, a woman who had “an issue of blood” touched Jesus’
robe and was healed, Jesus raised the daughter of Jairus from the dead, he
healed the son of the nobleman and a multitude of sick and lame were brought to
Jesus and were healed.  Though this dig is controlled by a church yet we are
indebted to them for preserving this sight.  We stopped at another church whish
claims to be where Jesus fed the 5,000.  Brother Barrett questions that this is
the exact sight but it is a memorial.  We went to another church about 500 feet
north to the Church of St. Peter’s Primacy where; after his crucifixion and
resurrection, Jesus met the Apostles when they had gone fishing.  Jesus called
them from the shore and asked if they had caught anything.  When they replied
that they hadn’t, Jesus told them to cast their net on the other side of the
boat.  They filled their net with 153 large fish.  Peter jumped out of the boat
and swam to shore, knowing that it was the master on the shore.  At this time
Jesus gave Peter the assignment to feed My sheep.  When Elder LaGrand Richard
visited this area, he waded out into the sea to his knees, raised his fist into
the air and shouted “Hurrah! This is where missionary work first began.”  We
went into the church and sang “As I Have Loved You”.  The acoustics in this
chapel was great.  Tabgha lies just to the west.  There is where the Church of
the Miracle of the Loaves and Fish is located.  This dig was found in 1932
finding ruins with mosaic tile depicting the fish and loafs.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We stopped
for lunch and then continued to Chorazin.  Chorazin is one of the three cities
cursed by Jesus because of their unbelief in him.  (Bethsaida and Capernaum
were the other cities,)  Also this city is built in a very rocky area.  We next
stopped at the city of Tiberias, a city that was built by Herod Antipas, son of
Herod the Great and ruler of Galilee during the life of Jesus.  We stopped at
the Church of the B-Attitudes.  Although Brother Barrett dose not believe this
is the exact location it is a beautiful place to remember and review the
sermon.  Tiberias is still an active city.  We viewed a film about the
B-Attitudes, but I was so tired that I fell asleep and missed most of it.  We
did buy a DVD of the film so I can later re-watch it.  As we left the theater
Garrett saw a sign advertising frozen yogurt and pointed it out to me.  I had
to buy one and then bought another for Mae.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae has kept
the “group journal” today.  It was really quite a job and this evening she
worked on it until she went to bed.  She was very tired tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our motel is
ok but we have single beds.  Two of the men in out group are very tall and I am
sure the beds are very uncomfortable for them.  Our shower leaks and floods the
floor when we use it.  The food is fairly good but I have noticed that all the
food here is quite bland.  They do have a very good yogurt that I use for milk
that is good.  It reminds me of the yup we had in France.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up
early and ready to go, as usual, at 8 AM.  As we start each morning we have a
spiritual devotional.  Brother and Sister Al Harris took their turn this
morning.  Brother Harris told us how his family came into the church.  It was
very interesting.  His Great Grandfather, Alma was a brother to Martin Harris. 
When he heard that his brother was going to mortgage his farm for this new
religion he left his home and traveled some distance to visit Martin and try to
talk some sense into him.  However Martin gave him a copy of the Book of Mormon
and he read it, joined the Church and brought several of his family into the
Church.  Although Martin left the Church for a while, Alma never did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                From where we
are staying at Holliday Village to Jerusalem is 125 miles and Nazareth is still
further north.  It would take at least a week to travel this distance by foot. 
With Mary’s condition it probably took a couple of weeks or more.  <i>Just a
thought I wanted to enter.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our first
stop was Mount Tabor.  On the way Delia sang us a song in Hebrew.  She first
explained the song that a young man that was born in the Galilee always dreamt
of leaving the Galilee to find adventure in the great outside world.  The day
came when he became a airline pilot and flew to foreign lands.  Then he
realized that there was no place that he would rather be than back in his home
in Galilee.  Mount Tabor is 1883 feet above sea level.  We drove to the base of
the mountain but there had to take taxies up the mountain as the road is so
windy and steep that a bus cannot drive it safely.  Steve and Gary from our
group walked up the mountain.  They were late getting to our gathering and
Brother Barrett was telling us about the history of Mount Tabor.  Besides many
other historical events, and the most significance to us, is tradition has it
that this is where Jesus took Peter, James and John and was transfigured before
them.  Additionally the three apostles were also transfigured, there they were
given the keys of the Priesthood, and they were endowed, and were shown the
transfiguration of the earth at Christ’s Second Coming.  <i>That information
will certainly give greater importance to the mural you see as you enter the
Ogden Temple.</i>  As we left the mount, Shellie and Garret jogged down to the
bottom.  They were tired when they got there but they had done it.  They
actually got down before all of our group were able to get down.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our next stop
was at the Spring of Gideon.  This is a lovely spot where a small spring comes
from under a rock.  This is where Gideon’s army drank from the spring.  The
lord told Gideon to chose only those men that drank with there spears in ready,
to fight Midianites.  This is also the area that 220 years later King Saul, and
his crown prince Jonathan, were killed in the battle of the Israelites and
Philistines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                On the way to
the Kibbutz Bet Alpha, we stopped at a Burger King for lunch and just enjoyed a
little time to visit with our group members.  The plans were to go to Bet Shean
but because of the conflicts between the Jews and the Palestinians, who hold
this area, we were unable to enter.  Palestinians are Arabs that were born in
Palestine.  The name of Palestine was given the land of Israel by England.  The
Jews do not like Israel to be refereed to by that name.  The Palestinians that
presently live in this area are also referred to as Bedouins.  They are nomads
and their homes are generally tents made of goat’s hair or tin shacks.  A joke
is told: “If you don’t like that one, we will find you a Bedouin.”  We drove on
to Jerusalem to our hotel, the Olive Tree.  As we got off the bus, Delia (our
tour guide) commented that she thought it was cute that Mae and I walk together
hand in hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                                As
with each morning we had wakeup call at 6 AM.  I have to have more time than
that so I get up by 5 AM.  We had breakfast and were on the bus by 8 AM.  We
went to the Temple Mount or now The Dome of The Rock, a huge Al-Aksa Mosque. 
This is a very sacred spot to Jews, Christians and Moslems alike and is an area
of great political concern.  It is owned and controlled by the Moslems but is
policed mainly by Jewish police.  Jewish tradition holds that this is the area
where Abraham brought his son Isaac to make an offering to the Lord.  It is of
great interest to the Christians because of the many ties with Jesus.  The
Moslems hold that this is the sight where Mohammed made a miraculous night
visit to Jerusalem in which he ascended to Paradise and conversed with Allah. 
Jews are not allowed within the walls of the Temple area for fear that radical
Jews might try to blow up the Dome.  The Jews want to rebuild the Temple so
that they might again offer sacrifices to Jehovah.  No Jewish tourist are
allowed to enter the temple area after going through strict security check.  We
were allowed to take pictures and see the sights but at 11 AM we were told that
we had to leave.  The interesting thing that took place is Mae and several
others had just gone to the restrooms.  When the guards started to clear the
area we were told to leave and pressure was put on everyone to leave now! 
Brother Barrett talked to the guards and got permission for us wait for those
in the restrooms if we continued to move slowly towards the exit gate.  Mae was
the last one to come out and by that time we had been pushed almost through the
gate.  I was getting very anxious that I was going to lose my wife on the
Temple Mount.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We again went
through a security check and into an area, now referred to as the West Wall or
Whiling Wall.  To the Jews this is the most holy sight in the world.  The wall
is not part of the Temple but only the greatly expanded retaining wall built by
Herod the Great when he rebuilt the Temple.  The grounds were expanded from the
15 acres when Solomon built the temple to 40 acres by Herod.  The West Wall is
the closest that Jews can come to where the Temple originally was before the
Temple was completely destroyed after the time of Christ.  In this area the men
are separated from the women.  Tourist, (the men) are able to see where the
archeologists have gone down to the original footings for the wall, about
another 20 feet deeper.  In this area Jews and Christians come daily to pray. 
Also there are Jewish wedding performed and the Bar Mitzvahs is performed when
a boy turns 13 years old.  We saw several Bar Mitzvahs performed and the young
man now gets to carry the Torah.  Brother Barrett says that he believes that
the Jews will some day rebuild the Temple as is told in prophecy, but now he
doesn’t see how it can happen because of the great controversy that exists
between the Jew’s and the Muslims.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We next went
down to the South West corner of the Temple Wall where excavation has gone down
to the original base.  This is where the road would have been at the time of
Jesus.  You can see where the road was broken up by the falling of the great
stones when the Temple of Hared was destroyed.  The top of the walls had been
broken off and the Temple was completely torn down until there was not one rock
left on top of another.  Some of the corner stones in the walls were 40’ long
8’ wide and 5’ thick.  It is hard to imagine how those stones were moved and
put in place.  We walked down the roads that Jesus walked and on the South
corner stood on an original base rock stone that those entering the temple gate
would have walked on.  We took pictures of us standing where Jesus walked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                From there we
went to The City of David which is the oldest part of Jerusalem.  There we climbed
down the excavated entrance to Gihon Spring which is outside the city’s wall
and then went to Hezekiah’s Tunnel.  This tunnel was cut through solid rock to
allow the spring water to come into the city’s walls.  Many of us walked
through the tunnel.  We had to wade in water that was as deep as my legs at the
first and then shallowed to below my knees.  Many places I would bump my head
on the ceiling and most of it was just wide enough for me to walk through.  Some
of the taller ones hit their heads often.  It took us over an hour to go through
it.  We had to take our own lights in order to see.  It was very interesting as
the tunnel didn’t go in a straight line but made many curves but remained on a
constant slope for the water to run through.  It is presumed that the digging
of the tunnel was done from both ends at the same time.  From the tunnel area,
we road the bus back to our hotel.  On the way Brother Barrett pointed out
special areas and gave explanations.  The Jews stop the Arabs from coming into
Jerusalem to work by making them have a work permit.  However they have to get
the work permit at the Consulates office in Jerusalem and they don’t have a
permit to go into the city.  Brother Barrett said that they had to replace half
of the staff at the Jerusalem Center because they couldn’t get these permits. 
He also told us that all construction had to get a permit.  You have to pay for
the permit in advance and then they may never get around to issuing the
permit.  If you build with out the permit and especially if you are Arab, the
city will have men bulldoze your building down and fine you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and
several of the others went shopping when we got back to the hotel but I just
laid down and took a nap.  They got back a 7 PM in time for dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, March 23, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4
AM and couldn’t get back to sleep so I got up and wrote up more notes from
yesterday.  By the time I finished it was time for my scripture study.  I noted
that Nephi read the Scriptures to his brothers, trying to build their
testimony’s but those that didn’t read and study for them selves, soon lost
their testimonies and eventually their blessings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went to
Hebron this morning.  When Sarah died Abraham purchased a cave Ephron, from the
son of Zohar as a family burial sight.  Here Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob and Leah
were buried.  Rebecca died in child birth of Benjamin and was buried in
Bethlehem.  There is a mosque built over the cave but from outside you still
see the cave opening although it is fenced off and no one can go in.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                As we
traveled we noted the rocky terrain.  Dilia said that tradition has it that
when the Angel of Rocks flew over Jerusalem, his sack broke!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When the
Turks conquered Israel, the king taxed the people by how many trees were on
their land.  So the people chopped down and burned all the trees.  That left
the land barren for many years.  Since the Jews are returning, they have
replanted many forests.  Israel now has a holiday similar to Arbor Day in the
U.S. and many go out to plant trees.  Shellie said that there are at least 2/3
more forest and trees that when she was here 20 years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We stopped at
a couple of digs that I didn’t recognize Lachish and Mareshah.  This area is a
National Park.  At the second there were several manmade caves, Bell Cave’s,
that were very interesting.  Here we met an Israeli family and visited with
them.  They had visited the U.S. and while there they visited with some people
that had visited Israel.   When they were asked about sights in their own land
they hadn’t been to them so couldn’t answer the questions.  Now they are home
they decided they should visit their own lands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When we came
back to the bus Dallia’s husband had sent fresh strawberries and bananas for
our lunch.  Micah (our bus driver) also passed around a date roll.  He
announced that he had received his first granddaughter this morning.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our next stop
was at the Valley of Elah, this is where Goliath the Philistine, was
challenging the army of Israel to a fight.  David with a sling shot made quite
an impression on Goliath.  It was a very special feeling to be in the valley,
imagine where the army of Israel was and where the army’s of the Philistines
were, also to walk to the creek bed where David selected his rocks.  There are
many tourists picking up a rock and I suggested that they probably had to bring
in another truck load of rocks each week.  We next stopped at Bet Shemesh
(“House of the Sun”).  At this dig, archeologists have uncovered the remains of
the cities Hyksons and Canaanite, across the valley is the city Zorek, where
Samson was born.  Brother Barrett retold that story to us. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Other areas
were pointed out to us as we drove.  As Brother Barrett would explain various
areas I couldn’t help but realize that in the U.S. we think of history being 200
to 300 years ago but here history starts at 2,000 or 3,000 years ago.   I was
interested in the forest and agriculture areas South West of Jerusalem.  The
area is very rocky and dwelling areas are very close together.  Most of the
living areas were very trashy.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                As we
returned to Jerusalem the highway dipped into a small valley.  Motza is located
at the bottom of this valley and is believed to be where Jesus appeared to two
disciples on the road to Emmaus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, March 24, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our first
stop this morning was at the Orson Hyde Memorial Park.  This park is located on
the Mount of Olives, across the Kidron Valley and overlooking Jerusalem.  Not
only is this a beautiful area and very well maintained but I could see in my
mind the painting of Jesus sitting on the Mount of Olives and saying “O
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are
sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen
doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! (Luke 13:34)  To me,
this area is where I felt the spirit the strongest of anywhere we visited. 
Brother Barrett gathered all of us together and rehearsed to us the story of
Orson Hyde’s trip and dedicatory pray as a land of the gathering of the Jews.  Afterwards
all the men assembled and consecrated some olive oil.  As today is the Jewish
Sabbath we attended church services at the Jerusalem Center.  After Sacrament
service our group held our own Sunday school class and Brother Barrett led that
lesson.  We then joined the centers Relief Society and Priesthood meetings.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
meetings we returned to our hotel for lunch.  I would have liked to have taken
a nap but we were soon off to see Bethlehem.  We stopped on a hill that
overlooked Bethlehem to the south.  On the top was a monument of three pillars,
at least 20 feet in height and each had an olive tree on the top if it. 
Richard did not know exactly the purpose but it might be in remembrance of a
Kibbutz near here that was completely destroyed during the 6 day war but has
now been rebuilt.  It was a very interesting sight and gave me question as to
how they watered the trees.  At this sight we also saw Shepard’s tending their
sheep.  Brother Barrett retold the story of Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem and then
we joined together in song and sang “Oh Little Town of Bethlehem” and “It Came
up on a Mid-Night Clear”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We then
traveled on to Bethlehem and went to the church and area where it is believed
was the cave where Christ was born.  As normal in these areas there are many
street mechants.  Mae has a hard time getting past them but I found that if you
won’t look at them or their wears but just keep walking they will try the next
person.   I had hopes that we would get back to the hotel early this afternoon
but many wanted to shop in Bethlehem so Brother Barrett had Majia stop the buss
for a shopping spree.  We just walked around and looked.  The store that we
looked in was a very beautiful arranged store.  They had some large and
beautiful Nativities and I checked the price of the one.  It was over four
hundred dollars but he would come down to the high two hundreds plus shipping
cost to get it home.   Another almost twice the size as the other, I just took
a picture of it but didn’t dare to even ask the price of it.  We had to hurry
when we got to our hotel as it was dinner time.  When we got to our room I was
beat and soon went to sleep.  Mae had to stay up longer and wash out a few
clothes by hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, March 25, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up
early as normal and off by 8 AM.  We started at the Jaffa Gate which is located
at the South West area of the Old City.  We first went to the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher.  This is revered by most Christians as the site of Christ’s
crucifixion, burial and resurrection.  Brother Barrett gave us some reasons
that he doesn’t accept that belief:  1<sup>st</sup> with the excavation that is
being done, he thinks that this area will be found to be within that walls of
the Old City and the Scriptures defiantly says that He was taken outside of the
city.  2<sup>nd</sup> the description of the site does not coincide with the
description in the Scriptures.  3<sup>rd</sup> when President Lee visited the
area said that he felt good about the Garden Tomb but totally rejected this
area.  It was about 9 AM as we went through the Old City.  The shops were just
starting to open and it was exciting to see the city start to life.  We did do
some shopping at a couple of stores.  We went to David’s Tower.  This place had
nothing to do with David but was built by Herod the Great in 24 B.C. as a
palace.  Much of it still remains.  We went into some areas that have been
excavated below the current city and were as much as 20 feet below the present
street level.  We ate lunch at some of the street venders.  We went into the
Wohl Archeolical Museum which is built over a dig and saw the remains of homes
that were from Christ’s time.  As we continued through the city and saw the
back of the building where the last super and the visit of Christ to the 10 and
then later to the 11 Apostles occurred.  Brother Barrett says that this is
fairly certain to be the place.  We will come back and see inside tomorrow.  It
is amazing to see sites that are 2000 years old and older as we think of
American history is a little over 200 years old.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We are such a
blessed people and have passed through comparably few serious trials.  As
Brother Barrett told us of a friend, Jimmy who lives here in Israel, and the
experiences he had during the war of 1947 and then the Six Day War in 1967,  I
stand all amazed and ask in gratitude, “why me”?  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today was a
shorter day so I took a nap when we got back to the hotel.  When I woke up Mae
wasn’t to be found.  I met her coming back when I went to the lobby.  She had
taken a walk and in the lobby met a Lady from Africa.  They soon became acquainted
and had a good visit.  Mae and I had dinner and then soon went to bed being
very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Yesterday
Sister Lola Briscoe and Brother Steven Miller were both sick and did not join
us.  Today both are feeling better and are with us.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Brother
Barrett arranged for us to meet in a room on the 8<sup>th</sup> floor of the
hotel to start this day’s tour.  We started the meeting with a song, “I Stand
All Amazed”.  Mae gave a scripture and I give a prayer.  Brother Barrett then
talked to us about the final week of Jesus Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>[ Try to get a copy of
Brother Barrett’s notes.]</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                In the notes
that I took<i> (and I am not the best note taker)</i> on the 10<sup>th</sup> of
the month of Abive, Jesus came to Jerusalem.  The Passover starts the night of
the 14<sup>th</sup>.  The sacrificial lamb would be inspected or purchased on
the 10<sup>th</sup> of Abive.  The lamb would then be sacrificed on the 14<sup>th</sup>
of Abive.  <i>(The 14<sup>th</sup> of Abive is the 6<sup>th</sup> of April 30
AD our calander.) </i><b>]                </b>When Brother Barrett told of
Jesus and His Apostles singing a Hymn we sang “As I Have Loved You” feeling it
was very appropriate at this point.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After the
short meeting we loaded the bus and drove to the southern side of Jerusalem. 
We went to the Upper Room of a building that Orthodox Jews revere as the “Tomb
of David”.  This could not be because David was buried in his city.  However it
is respected as a memorial to David.  The second floor is believed to be the
room where the Last Supper was held, where Jesus came to the 10 Apostles after
his resurrection and then the next day to the eleven.  It is also likely that
this area is the site of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on the Day of Pentecost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We next went
to one of the two traditional sites, the Palace of Caiaphas, where Jesus was
tried.  Brother Barrett said there are many evidences that make him feel good
about this area, including the high security cell where Jesus was held illegally
with out a trial until early the next morning when an illegal trial could be
held.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                  After
leaving this area we had some time before our appointment to visit the Garden
of Gethsemane.  Many of our group wanted to go shopping.  My feet were hurting
to much for a shopping trip so I just remained on the bus and rested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our next stop
was the Garden of Gethsemane.  When Jerusalem was conquered the Romans cut down
all the Olive trees for fire wood to burn the city.  However when you cut down
an olive tree new sprouts come up from the roots.  Thus the olive trees now in
the garden may well be from the roots of the original trees when Jesus went
there with his Apostles.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We walked
from the Garden to the Antonia Fortress where Jesus was brought to be judged by
Pilot.  Pilot finding no fault Jesus was taken back to Hared.  New charges were
brought against Jesus and returned, this time to be scourged, mocked, and
crowned with the wreath of thorns and lead out to be crucified.  We then walked
to Golgotha one of two disputed sites.  At this sight you can see the form of
the scull in the lime stone hill.  It is believed that it was unlikely that
Jesus was crucified on the top of the hill but rather to the side and bottom as
the Romans wanted a crucifixion to be where travelers would pass by and realize
the consequences of disobedience to Roman laws.  Just a short way from Golgotha
is the Garden Tomb.  At this site, when President Harold B. Lee visited it, he
said he felt good about this area.  It was exciting to see the empty tomb.  We
went to a secluded area and talked about the events that unfolded here.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was
evening when we left the garden area and we were warned, by the guides at the
garden, to be careful as pickpockets were noted in the exit area at this time
of day.  We had no problems.   When we returned to our hotel I was very tired. 
We had done quite a lot of walking today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, March 27, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had a big day
ahead of us so we were up early and was on the bus and left just after 7 AM. 
We left Jerusalem where the altitude is 2500 feet above sea level and traveled
south to the Dead Sea about 10 miles distance and dropped to 1300 feet below
sea level.  When we reached sea level M-- stopped the bus and we got off. 
There was a man with a camel there and for a couple of dollars I had Mae ride
the camel.  We traveled on down to the valley floor and along the side of the
Dead Sea south to Masada.  This is a fortress built by Herod the Great.  The
Masada was built on a bluff that is several hundred feet higher than the valley
floor.  We took a tram to get to the top and to come down.  Some brave hikers
hiked up the winding trail.  Shellie, Quint and Kevis did hike down it.  On the
top Herod had build a three-tiered Northern Palace, storerooms, administration
building, large water cisterns, Roman bath houses and exercise area.  On the
North side still remains the siege ramp built by the Romans.  The Romans were
only successful at building this ramp because they used captured Jews as slaves
and when they got with in striking distance, the Zealots in the fortress would
not kill their own people.  When the Romans did break through all the Zealots
inside had committed mass suicide rather than be captured.  It was an amazing
sight to see and my first comments were, “It could not have been possible for
an enemy to take such a fortress.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We next
stopped at the Dead Sea and most of us went in for a float.  The water is so
salty that there is no sinking in it.  We were warned that to swallow some of
that water could be deadly.  I got one drop splashed into my mouth and it was
very bitter.  As we came back north we stopped at Ein Gedi.  Here you can see
some caves that in 1949 was found some pottery that contained what is now know
as the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These were found by a Arab boy who was herding his
sheep in the area and trying to locate wandering sheep, threw a rock into a
cave to scare the sheep.  Instead of hearing sheep he heard pottery breaking. 
Many ancient writings were found including the first five books of the Old
Testament.  Sadly scholars offered rewards to those that found parts of these
scrolls so the finders would break the scrolls into smaller pieces to receive
more rewards.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We next went
to Jericho.  In Jericho is a dig where has been uncovered possibly the oldest
remains in the world.  It is believed that it is part of the original wall of
Jericho that fell when Joshua marched around the city and the walls came
tumbling down.  The archeologist that found this site said that the site proved
that the Bible was false because she dated the wall as being 400 years before
Jericho.  Another archeologist said he didn’t want to disagree with her but it
didn’t prove anything except that the wall was built before Jericho.  As we
came back to the parking lot Mae tripped over the curb and not only scrapped
and hurt her knee but through her back out of place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                From
Jerusalem to the Dead Sea Valley the terrain is what I expected the whole area
of Israel to look like.  It is very desolate and baron.  This area is the
wilderness of Judia where Jesus fasted after his baptism for 40 days.  Also to
the East of Jericho is possibly the Mt. of Temptation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                On the way
back to Jerusalem we stopped in Bethany and went to the tomb of Lazarus. 
Although a church has been built over the tomb, by going around to the back
side of the church is the original entrance to the tomb.  To get to the tomb is
a narrow passage but then to get into the tomb you have to crawl in.  It was
very interesting to get a different prospective of the tomb.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                At some shops
near by we purchased a sling shot and some jars of Frankincense and Mir and
some mustard seeds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It has been a
wonderful day.  After dinner Mae and I took showers and cuddled in bed and
watched a show on TV before going to sleep.  I have worn a blister on my left
foot today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Each morning
as we got on the bus a couple would give a short devotional.  This morning Garrett,
Quint and Kevis took their turn and did very well.  I think all the adults were
very impressed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We started at
a museum that displayed some of the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Also at this area was a
model of Old Jerusalem that was very good.  It was large enough to take up
about ½ acre.  I tried to take pictures but am sure that they will not do it
justice.  If I understood Brother Barrett right this model was built by a man
for his son.  Originally its site was on the west side of the present city of
Jerusalem.  Later it was disassembled and relocated in this museum.  I would
have liked to had more time to study the model.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We next went
to the Yad Vashen (Hill of Remembrance).  This area was built in 1957 as a
memorial to the 6 million Jews that were killed by Adolph Hitler and the Nazi
Regime during the 2<sup>nd</sup> World War.  As we viewed the many displays one
visual show really made me feel bad to see a news reel where the U.S. refused
to allow a ship load of Jewish families trying to find refuge, to enter into our
country.  We were at the memorial for over two hours and verily began to see
all of it.  What a sad time in the history of man kind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We returned
to the hotel where I stayed and rested as my feet were hurting too much to walk
anymore.  Quint also stayed in the hotel and read a book.  Mae went with
Shellie, Roy, Garrett and Kevis.  They went to the Mount of Olives and to the
Garden of Gethsemane, back into the Old City and did some more shopping.  I
watched three movies while waiting for them to return.  After Mae returned we
did some packing, went to dinner and when we got back to the room finished our
packing before going to bed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke
before 4 AM and were packed and on the bus by 5 AM.  Madgi drove us to the
airport at Telivive.  That was the start of a long day on airplanes and in
airports.  We had been prepared for a difficult time with inspections at
Telivive but that went fairly well.  Free bottles of water were passed out to
waiting patrons.  At London I came away with a much different feeling.  There
security treated us like animals or criminals.  Why don’t they prosecute the
guilty instead of persecuting the innocent?  We had to go through two or three
security checks before arriving at our depart area.  As we walked down the ramp
way Mae saw some hand lotion that she wanted.  We bought two bottles of it and
went on.  Later we found that to be a mistake.  We flew from London to
Chicago.  At the Chicago airport we had to go through custom, then back through
check-in and through security check.  We were tired and again guards shouted
orders.  The one area was roped back and forth for a crowd but there was no one
in line a head of us, so one person suggested that we just duck under the ropes
instead of walking back and forth.  When he attempted to do that, guards
immediately screamed orders to stop.  Then to add to the rest, when we went
through the security gates, they stopped Mae and said that she was trying to
take something through Security that was illegal.  It was the two bottles of
lotion that she had bought inside the secured area in the London airport.  They
were liquid and each bottle weighed 5 oz.  Had she bought three bottles of 3
oz. it would have been ok, but because it was 10 oz. in two bottles they gave
us the choice of paying to have it held in security until we drove back to get
it, pay for postage to have it mailed or throw it in the trash.  The first two
options were more expensive than what the produce cost us so I told them to
throw it in the trash.  What a humiliating experience this Homeland Security is
becoming.  The seating that we got on the next plane was in front of an
emergency exit so the seats would not lean back.  We were very uncomfortable
and tired when we got to Salt Lake.  When we went to get our baggage we were
missing one suit case.  Others of our group were also missing luggage and one
couple were short their entire luggage.  We had to fill out a report and were
told that they would get our luggage tomorrow and would deliver it to us.  we waited
for quite a while before Bob and Carroll came for us.  They had been waiting at
the waiting area but our flight never did show up on the arriving schedule.  It
was 1 AM when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today was
quite lost.  We tried to sleep in.  Mae made some Angle Food cakes and we went
to the Clark’s this afternoon.  We road with Grinn and Kathleen to Provo, where
we attended a Philippine Angeles Missionary reunion.  It was good to see
President and Sister Brimhall and many of the Elders and Sister Missionary’s
that we know while we were there.  Brother and Sister Charles Hyer were also
there.  it was a good evening but we were sure tired when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
4:30 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so I got up and started entering my
journal notes that I took while we were in Israel.  Mae got up later as she
couldn’t sleep either.  I did go back to sleep before 8 AM and slept until Bob
had breakfast ready.  He cooked biscuits and gravy for us.  Mark Browning had
came over last night and slept here as he had brought his girl friend from
collage with him for the weekend.  Bob invited Irven, Sandy and Sarah (Marks
girl friend) to also come for breakfast.  We finished breakfast just in time to
turn the first session of General Conference on.  We really enjoyed the
conference messages.  Jeff came over and returned my truck keys.  He said that
he and Trent had a good time last Saturday with the snowmobiles.  He said the
machines ran great.  After the first session I downloaded our pictures to the
computer files.  I made an error on the second chip and lost all those
pictures.  There would have been about 180 pictures on it.  I called Best Buy’s
technicians and was told that they were sorry but it was an unrecoverable
error.  I was successful at downloading the other two chips and we still have
about 1,000 pictures that we took while on our trip.  We watched the second
session of conference and after that I took a nap.  Mae woke me in time to get
cleaned up and I attended the Priesthood session of conference with Bob, Grant
and Mark.  Mae worked on getting many E-mails taken off the received file. 
Roger Silvia again wrote asking for more money.  Mae replied and told him we
can’t continue to help him.  We went to bed about 9 PM and started watching a
movie, but by 10 PM we were so tired that we turned it off and went to sleep.</span></p>
