<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:45 AM and was up long enough to study the scriptures for ½ hour and do some
stretch exercises.  Mae then got up but I went back to bed and slept until
after 8 AM.  When I got up I showered and shaved and then fixed some
breakfast.  Gail brought Benji over for Mae to tend at 11:30 AM.  I filled out
a form for us to take our savings out of my Roth IRA account.  We will use that
money to pay for the remodeling, painting and carpeting of the apartment.  Also
it will be used to pay for the pressure pump that I installed on the lawn
sprinkler system.  We had told Bob that we would pay for the humidifier on the
furnace which cost over $300 and Bob and Carroll would normally pay ½ on
pressure pump but they about equal out.  I had to take the forms to the Credit
Union to have the Signature Guaranteed and that took some running around.  I
also had to go to Durk’s to get an invoice on the material that I got last
Monday for Craig and Carla.  I then went to the post office to mail the form,
the statement and some other letters.  It was after 3 PM when I got home.  We
left at 3:20 PM to take Benji over to Gail and then go to a meeting with Real
Property Management.  David met us there and we met wit Kirk McGary and Dug Oler. 
They are the President and Vic-President of the company.  We met for two and a
half hours discussing the possibility of purchasing a franchise in the
company.  They left us with a lot to consider and think about.  Mae and I then
went to a meeting of the Constitutional Party of Davis County.  We were a
little late getting there but go in on most of the meeting.  We both were able
to register as members of the Constitutional Party.  They had a guest speaker,
Mark Hudson, who really gave us some things to think about and some suggestions
of things we can do to help preserve the Constitution of the United States of
America and our freedom.  I am sure we will be highly criticized if we take
some of these steps.  I am somewhat concerned that maybe the time for action is
almost too late.  I do believe that if we don’t do something then our Nation
will fall as a free Nation.  We came home and got some super.  I then worked on
my journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
the recliner until 2:30 AM and then I went into our bed with Mae.  It was 8 AM
before we got up.  We just started breakfast when Aunt Beth called and talked
to Mae for over a hour.  After breakfast I started work on the mudding of the
sheetrock.  This afternoon I had to go to Home Depot for more mud and a few
other items.  Mae has started removing all items form the walls and other items
off the furniture so we can move the furniture out.  We are still not sure how
we are going to clear the hours out.  This evening I did watch part of a show on
TV.  Mae has been working on her presentation for the Porter Reunion.  I did
call Randy to apologize for our missed fishing trip.  I called Patriarch
Johnstun to see how he is doing.  He informed me that Sister Johnstun will be
coming home tomorrow.  He thinks that the Doctor has got his nose bleeds
stopped.  Anyway he will know tomorrow when they remove the last of the
packing.  Carroll went into the hospital today and they will try to clear a
blockage in the kidneys.  Bob and I administered to her before they went to the
hospital.  Bob came down after he returned for the hospital and said that it
went well and they think she will come home tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7:30 AM but things didn’t go to good after that.  We seem to get one
interruption after another that stopped us for going the direction we had
planned.  Aunt Beth called and talked to Mae for 1 ½ hours, so I fixed
breakfast.  David called and Mae answered that call as I was on the phone with
someone.  That call lasted quite a while and sent our conversation and concerns
on to the franchise opportunity.  We went for a walk while we discussed that
situation.  We started moving furniture and clothing out.  I called Sandy to
borrow their dolly so she brought it over.  She stayed and that lead to a
political discussion that took quite a while.  Mark came down and helped me
move some furniture to the lawn mower shed but I am afraid that we talked as
much as we worked.  Bob came home with Carroll and that discussion took a while. 
Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley were in our area so they came by just to visit but
as it was lunch time we invited them to stay for lunch.  My back was hurting
quite bad so I called Randy and he had me come right down.  I got home about 6
PM and Bob was having trouble with the sprinkler system so I spent some time
resetting the system.  Mark came and that lead to another discussion between
the three of us about the mismanagement of our city.  I decided that I should
write to the mayor about this construction that is taking place at the 100 W
and 1300 N intersection.  When I came in Mae had removed the electrical plates
from the switches and outlets.  She then started work on her presentation for
the Porter Reunion.  I changed close and did more dry walling.  The corner
going from the front room to the sun room was not level so I removed part of
the corner bead and replaced it.  I also finished our bedroom ceiling and
patched some holes.  Some of my time was also spent helping Mae with some
pictures for her presentation.  It was 10 PM when I quite and wrote in my
journal.  Oh well maybe tomorrow will go better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
7 AM and I felt that we would get a good start today.  In the reading of the
scriptures I couldn’t help wondering just what we should do with the way the
government is destroying our Constitution.  I am also concerned with the city
government and feel that I should write a letter to the mayor.  As we set to
eat we were discussing the possible buy the franchise of the property
management company.  At that time Bryce called and talked to Mae.  He asked to
speak to me.  We talked for over an hour about purchasing property and building
a home.  I advised him not to sale there home until after they come home and
look into the situation more closely.  By that time Bob had came in and said
the sprinkler system wasn’t working right.  I took time to check and he was
right.  The zones were running but the pressure pump was not.  We also had more
than one zone running at the same time.  This completely puzzled me.  Time was
gone so fast and with all these unexpected interruptions I was completely
perplexed with life and really depressed.  Mae was so good to me and tried to
encourage me.  We went shopping for paint, floor tile and needed tools.  We
decided not to worry about the time, so after shopping, we went out to eat at a
Chinese restaurant and relaxed.  When we got home I started the sprinkler
system and let it run completely through the cycle.  I checked it every cycle
change and it ran totally ok.  I worked until 8:30 PM doing drier walling.  We
went to bed and watched a good movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
until 8 AM and then got up for a few minutes.  We turned the Presidential
debate on the TV and not only watched it but also recorded it for Irven and
Sandy.  That didn’t give us much time until it was time to go to church.  I
helped get set up for the nursery and then I went into Priesthood meeting and
also attended Sunday School class.  After Sacrament meeting I helped put up the
chairs and then I paid our offerings.  I went into Bishop Smith and got my
Temple recommend changed.  Bob and Carroll had dinner ready when I got home. 
It was sure good.  I wrote a letter to the Mayor of Clinton concerning this
turn-about.  I needed the Mayors name so went upstairs to see if Bob know it. 
He didn’t but he gave me David Pearson’s number who can tell me his name. 
Irven and Sandy were upstairs and we got visiting so most of the evening was
gone.  By the time I filled out my journal entry it was time for bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7:30 AM.  Bob came downstairs and said that he would cook waffles for
us.  after breakfast we started work on the basement.  I did some touch up on
the sheetrock.  We removed the carpeting out of the sunroom, removed the glue
from the area where the wood flooring had been and I patched the cement where
the doorway was.  It is about ready to start painting.  Mae and I went for a
walk this evening along the railroad trail.  We then went over to Maverick and
bought use a frozen yogurt.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We worked all
on the house.  I set up the tent trailer for us to sleep in as we are removing
all of our furnishings so we can paint and recarpet the main part of the apartment. 
Mae made several calls to Real Property Management franchise owners to see how
they are doing and to get a feeling as to whether or not we want to get a
franchise.  This evening we visited with David and I think we came to a
conclusion that we will not purchase a franchise.  It was late when we went to
bed.  We had worked late and then Mae and I went over to Wal-Mark to buy me
some white tennis shoes and a few groceries.  It was 11:30 PM when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM so that I could get ready to go to the Ogden Temple.  I and Glen Higgley are
to fulfill an assignment to help with some cleaning.  Last night, Bob said he
would make biscuits for breakfast but when I went to the house he was still
asleep.  I got me some cold cereal and let Mae sleep a little longer.  Glen and
I were with others from our Stake and we cleaned the kitchen area of the
Temple.  We worked from 8 AM until noon.  Mae and I worked on the apartment
until 6 PM at which time we ate dinner. Bob and I then went Home Teaching.  We
were able to visit with all or our families.  Mae and I then laid two areas of
tile in the apartment this evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was 2 AM
when Mae went to bed and I was another ½ hour before I was able to finish the
tile and go to bed.  We woke with the roosters next door crowing at 6 AM.  Then
Bob started mowing the lawn and it sounded like he was right outside the tent
trailer.  We got up and Bob had breakfast ready just after 9 AM.  We worked all
day on the apartment.  Mae had to quite at 6 PM and get ready to go to her book
study group.  Mark went to Home Depot for some parts for me.  They didn’t have
all I needed so he went to Lowe’s for the rest.  Bob and I finished getting the
old carpet and pad out and then I fixed me some thing to eat.  I took a shower,
shaved and called it a day.  I went out to the trailer and caught my journal up
to date.  Mae got home shortly after 9 PM and we quite for the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob prepared
breakfast for us and after eating we went to work.  We got the ceilings painted
and grouted the tile.  By the time we got through with those jobs it was time
to cleanup and go to Karen and Joseph Delo Santos’s wedding reception.  The
Clark’s had it at their home.  There was a good attendance of guest and I very
nice reception.  They are so happy and we just hope they can remain that way. 
We met one Brother that had served his mission in the Philippines and had been
one of the missionaries that had converted the Delo Santo’s family.  Joseph had
looked him up when he came here and asked him to be one of the witnesses at the
wedding.  He told us that he was so happy to know that the Delo Santos family
had remained active.  It was late when we got home so we soon went to bed. 
Mark had wiped the grout film off the new tile for me as it needed a couple of
hours more setting time before that was done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up
early and again Bob prepared breakfast for us.  We had to hurry and leave for
Morgan for the Stanford Porter Family Reunion.  Kin is the Vic-President and
had asked our help with a Walk – Run Marathon.  It started at the Porterville
Chapel and went to the Porterville Cemetery and returned again to the Chapel. 
We took the manning of the cemetery water station.  It was enjoyable to
participate in the event even though we didn’t run or walk in it.  The reunion
dinner was nice.  Mae and Aunt Beth participated as speakers on the program. 
Mae had prepared some Power Point pitchers to go with her talk but I couldn’t
get the program to work.  She did well with out it but I felt bad that it
wouldn’t work for her.  We left as soon as we could so we could get home and
set up for the High Priest Quorum’s Summer Social.  Bob prepared the baked chicken
and he also made a large pan of Brownies.  We had a good turn out and many
brought food items to go with the meal.  Everyone gave a hand with the cleanup
after it was over.  Many sisters had Mae take them in to see what we were doing
to the apartment.  We were very tired when we finally quit and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:15 to use the bathroom and read my scriptures for the day.  Mae was awake
when I went back out to the trailer.  We went back to bed for a while and then
Mae got up and took her shower.  I slept for a couple more hours and then I got
up and showered.  I said prayers and then caught my journal back up to date.  It
is sure good to have the Sabbath come and rest from our normal work.  I helped
get the nursery started and then I went into Priesthood.  After church we
planned to stop home long enough to change clothes and then go to Mike’s. 
However Jeff called and he had taken a ride on his motorcycle and the clutch
cable broke.  Gail had gone to Huntsville and brought him home but he needed to
get his bike home.  I got the pickup and trailer ready for him to take.  He got
to our place before we left.  We were late getting to Mike’s but they waited
dinner for us.  after dinner Mike help me with my Palm but he was unable to get
Mae’s presentation to work on my computer.  We transferred it to Mike’s
computer and it worked just fine.  Don’t know!  We had a good evening with
Mike, Becky and the family.  It was late when we got home and we went right to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We worked all
day on the house.  We cleaned the fire place brick with muratic acid and washed
it with water.  Mae would use me shop vacuum to suck up the water.  It sure
looked good when we finished.  I had Mae go to Home Depot to get me some supplies
and one of then was some quick setting sheetrock mud.  The girl in the paint
department said that I should use some wall patch.  Mae called me and then had
the girl talk to me.  I told her that I had a 3 inch hole to patch and she
assured me that that is what would work.  When Mae got home with it, it is just
a spackle and will not work.  It really upset me and I went back and got what I
needed.  I didn’t take the time and beside that I was to up set to tell the
girl what I thought at this time.  We worked until late.  Mark helped with some
trimming and Bob did some painting.  It was late when we quite and went to bed.</span></p>

biscuits and gravy for us this morning.  Bob has been cute at cooking meals for
us.  We worked all day on the house again today.  We got most of the walls
painted.  Mae went to town and changed the trim paint and got a better color. 
Mishelle went with her.  Mae went to Jeff and Gail’s and tended Benji for
them.  Normally Gail’s mother would have done that but she is sick today.  Jeff
picked me up after he got off work and took me to his place.  Gail had prepared
dimmer for us.  we found out the Marcy is in the hospital with gale blatter
infection.  She is scheduled to be operated on tomorrow.   We stopped on the
way home for some more parts.  This evening I put the toilet back together and
had trouble getting it to seal.  I was really upset when we went to bed over
the toilet problems.</span></p>

8 AM when we got to work.  Bob prepared waffle for use this morning.  We got
the walls finished and I started on the trim.  At noon we quite work and
cleaned up.  I took a shower.  The toilet still leaks so that needs more work. 
Gary Nelson came and we went to Provo where we met Pat Bradfield at Sizzler’s
and had lunch.  Dennis and Eleanor were to go with us but they didn’t show up. 
It was an enjoyable afternoon.  When we got home I changed clothes and painted
trim.  Mae went to Home Depot and got me some more supplies.  Bishop Smith and
Brother Higgley came over to visit this evening.  Mae hadn’t got back when they
came but got here just as they were leaving.  We finished a few things and came
to bed.</span></p>

8 AM working on the house.  Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley came over about noon and
Mishelle showed Mae how to do a paint texture on the walls and the two of them
did one wall in each of the bedroom, dinning room, front room and sun room.  It
really looks good.  Mark came down and worked most of the day masking walls for
me to paint the trim.  That was a big help. Bob fixed dinner for us this
evening.  Mae and I worked until 10:30 PM getting the trim painted and the
house ready for the carpet layers to come tomorrow.  I took a shower before going
to bed.  It’s been a long day.</span></p>

I tiled the seal on the arch way above the kitchen sink and the window seal in
our bedroom while the carpet layers worked.  It was 9:30 PM when they finished

breakfast for us at 7:30 AM.  Bruce was here and had to get away shortly after
8 AM.  We started putting the house back together.  Jeff brought Benji over and
helped us move furniture.  Scott brought his family over and also helped.  Mae
spent the morning tending or playing with Grand Children.  It was shortly after
noon when our family left.  We continued working until 6 PM when I ask Mae if
we could stop and watch a show.  She said that I could but she wanted to do
more.  We kept working until after 9 PM.  I was upset that she wouldn’t stop
until we had everything done.  It rained hard and had a lot of water in the
awning of the tent trailer.  I decided that I had to get it out so while I was
working on that Mae came out and went into the trailer to get things carried
into the house.  Just as I dropped the awning Mae opened the door and the
awning tour on the corner of the door.  I finished putting my tools into my
trailer so they wouldn’t be in the house.  Mae was upset with me because I was
upset.  I guess we will be over it in the morning after we have had some rest. 
Mae gave me a hair cut and I showered before we went to bed.  We did talk and I
told her that I was upset over the fact that she had to get so much done and
can’t stop and just let things wait.  I also told her that I didn’t see why
when we were so tired and she had to invite the family over for dinner
tomorrow.  I don’t think it will change her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
2 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I tried the recliner but still couldn’t
sleep.  I tried the TV but there wasn’t anything on worth watching and the Comcast
didn’t work.  About 4 AM I took some Tylenol and that finally relaxed the pain
until I went to sleep.  I woke about 8 AM but after being up for just a little
while I went back to sleep and sleep until noon.  We attended our block meeting
schedule staying in the nursery just until things got started and then I
attended the other meetings.  I did stop in to help with the room set up.  The
Sacrament meeting program was very enjoyable.  I went with Brother Fallis after
church to take the Sacrament to some shut in’s.  Mae had dinner ready and
Scott, Jeff and their families were all there.  Mae had a wonderful and after
eating and cleaning up we visited while Grandma played with the children.  She
loves being a Mom and a Grandmother.  Kylan and Ashley stayed the night and had
a sleep over with Grandma in the tent trailer.  I stayed in side and watched a
movie on TV named Raising Helen.  It was a cute movie.  I filled in my journal
and went to bed shortly after 11 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
7 AM and in place of my regular study read the Priesthood Lesson.  Mae came in
about 8 AM and said that we were eating breakfast in the tent trailer.  I got
to work on doors and spent most of the day just getting them prepped for
painting.  I installed an electrical outlet in the lawn mower garage so we
would have a closer source for power.  The front door I have decided to reverse
the swing as Bob had hung it backwards when he put it on originally.  Mae had a
Doctors appointment in Ogden so I had her stop at Home Depot on the way home
for some materials.  Again I had trouble with Mae not knowing what I needed and
the help there at Home Depot knot knowing or caring about how they treat their
customers.  At 7 PM I quite work for the day and I watched some TV.  Mae had
enjoyed having Kylan and Ashley stay over last night so she invited Tyler,
Emily and Conner to stay over tonight.  Shauna was late getting here and part
of the reason was the road detours.  Our carpet layers returned about noon and
laid carpet on the stairs.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 7
AM and had finished reading and was in the shower when Mae and the children
came in.  Mae hadn’t slept very well last night.  We ate breakfast and I
started working on the front door.  I filled in all the door jamb cuts with
Bondo so I can change the door swing.  I had to repair the bathroom door
because the bottom door style was cut to thin and it broke.  I also needed to raise
the threshold 1/4” to give us more clearance.  Bob helped me spray paint all
our doors.  Mae had an experience last night when Tyler hurt Emily.  It brought
back memories of when Hal used to hurt Mae and her mother did not do anything
about it.  It really upset her even to this day  to think about it.  It was
after 6 PM when Bob and I finished and put things up.  Mae went Visiting
Teaching.  She then went to the church and got her Temple Recommend changed
over.  We watched a show on TV before taking showers and going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
shortly after mid-night and didn’t go back to sleep until after 4 AM and then
only for a few minutes.  I took Tylenol and tried to find something on TV but
that was a joke.  The Comcast is not working so I couldn’t search the movies. 
I got one movie on CMF called the “Black Widow” but it only took 5 minutes of
the start until the language caused me to shut it off.  I thought I was to help
Sandy move her Snowie over for storage but when Bob and I got over to their
place Sandy said it is tomorrow.  We went to Home Depot and bought a few more
items for the apartment.  I finished painting the trim and hung the bathroom
door.  Mae was busy with getting announcements and invitations ready to mail
about a open house for Chelci baby.  I laid down and took a couple of hours
nap.  I did a few more repair items and thought we could quite for the day and
watch a movie but Mae was trimming yards.  I went out and took over the
trimming and then with Mae’s help we put the tent trailer down.  I finished my
journal entry before we went to bed about 10 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke before
5 AM and went to the bathroom and read for a while before going back to bed. 
We then woke at 7:45 AM and got up.  After eating I went over to Irven and
Sandy’s.  I talked them into keeping most of their Snowie equipment there in
their garage.  I showed then how to arrange it and it left them plenty of
room.  We did take their one drink dispenser over and put it in our shed.  I
got started putting in our doors about 1 PM and worked until 7 PM.  Bob helped
me quite a while this afternoon.  I quit and we watched a show on the Hallmark
channel.  After the show I entered my journal for today.  Mae isn’t feeling
very good tonight.  I think she has over done and it is catching up to her.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep very well last night.  I know that Jeff and Gail were expecting Mae to
tend Benji today so I got up and went to their place to tend him.  Benji hasn’t
been feeling so it was good to tend him at their place for more than one
reason.  Jeff had talked to his boss and was told to make a short day of it so
he could take Benji into the Doctor.  Benji had gone back to bed when I got
there.  He slept until 10 AM, when I got him up, changed his clothes and feed
him some breakfast.  I played with him for a while and then I put him in his
stroller and we went for a walk.  Nolan was over when we returned.  His
daughter played with Benji for a while and we visited.  Benji got tired about
11:45 so I put him down for a nap.  Both earlier and later when Benji was
asleep I got some pills made up.  Jeff came home about 12:30 so I came on
home.  Mae is quite sick so she slept most of the day.  I did get the front
door trimmed and then I did some painting touch up.  We watched the movie “War
Games” on TV this evening.  I read the article in the Ensign and also some of
the article in the news paper about the Mountain Meadow Massacre this evening. 
I have read the account of this tragedy several years ago.  Mae went to sleep
about 9 AM but I am afraid that she won’t sleep well again tonight.  I stayed
up a little longer and filled out my journal entry and played some games on the
computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 7
AM.  this morning I finished King Benjamin’s address and then enjoyed reading
the commentary and explanation of God the Father, Jesus Christ the Father and
our earthly Father.  What a thrill I received to review that explanation.  Bob
came down and said he would prepare biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  He sent
us down some food and we ate here as Mae still isn’t feeling good.  She does
feel much better this morning than she did yesterday.  I finished installing
the door hardware and installed the byfold doors in our bedroom closets.  Next
I grouted the window seals.  I picked grapes and tomatoes and went up to David
and Shauna’s.  All my boys and their families came up and we had dinner
together, played a game of Crochet and then watched a movie in David’s
backyard.  Mae did not come up with us as she still isn’t feeling good. 
Shellie called and asked me what it is like when you have a heat stroke.  She
is having trouble with her face control.  I had her get into a Doctor to be
checked out.  Shellie called me back this evening and said that she saw a
Doctor and she diagnosticed her condition as Cherya Pulse.  It was 11:30 PM
when I got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae slept
most of the night in the recliner but she did sleep.  I got up and studied the scriptures
and then got us some breakfast.  We turned the TV onto the Tabernacle Choir and
then went to BYU and listened to a Young Women’s conference in which Liriel
Domingaco from Brazil was featured.  It was an amazing story of her success.  I
took a nap and then went to meetings.  The nursery kept us busy as we had about
13 children there today.  Mae didn’t come because of sickness and another
sister was gone this week.  I gave the lesson in Mae’s place today.  It went
pretty good.  I fell asleep in Sacrament meeting and I really wanted to hear
the talks.  Bob prepared dinner and had me take our plates down stairs so Mae
didn‘t have to come up.  I took a nap this evening and then was going to take
the boat down to Randy’s but the battery was dead.  I ended up changing the
battery with one from the camp trailer.  I prepared some sandwiches for me for
tomorrow.  We went to bed about 9:30.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
3:30 AM to go fishing with Randy and Mark.  Mark and I were late leaving and
when we got to Randy’s I had some trouble with the hook-up to Randy’s truck. 
We drove up to Strawberry reservoir.  The wind was blowing but we started and I
felt good at the way my boat responded.  As the morning went on the weather
became better.  We all caught fish but I was the only one that caught one small
enough to keep.  It was 14 ½” and they have to be under 15” or over 22”.  All
the rest were in between those measurements.  We quite at what time we figured
we would need to in order to get home in time but while we were preparing the
boat to return, a fishing and game officer stopped to ask us about our
fishing.  I expressed my concerns at the limit regulations and explained that I
didn’t feel that it was right to catch and release as to many of the fish die
after being released.  He agreed with me but said I was talking to the wrong
person and that I should send my information to the head of the Fish and Game
in Salt Lake City.  Using that time put us behind schedule on returning home. 
Then we got into traffic in Clinton and lost quite a bit of time there.  I got
home and hurried to get cleaned up and over to the Byron and Mary Porter Family
Reunion.  To my surprise David, Scott and Jeff’s families were at the reunion. 
When I got home Mae was watching “The Ice Princes” on TV so I watched the end
of it with her.  I then filled in my journal for today and took a shower before
going to bed.</span></p>

breakfast I hung the last of the pictures and put the hardware on one last
door.  We measured the left over carpet pieces and Mae took them into the store
to have them bound into throw rugs.  Mae took them into the store.  She also
did some shopping for a carpet to put under the dinning room table.  I stopped
at Home Depot and checked out some material to build some shelving for Mae.  I
went over to Scott’s and checked out the patio and found that I had not put
reinforcement footings under the patio when I poured it.  I will have to do
that first before I can construct the cover for it.  Mae had dinner about ready
when I got home.  After eating Mark and I went out and put the cover on the
boat.  Mae and I watched a show on DVD this evening.  It was 11:30 PM before we
went to bed.</span></p>

5:15 AM to get started.  Bob cooked fish, biscuits and fried potatoes for
breakfast.  I stopped at Valley Glass and got an estimate on getting a mirror
cut and three glass shelves.  I dug footings at Scott’s today.  I worked about
5 hours and then quite for the day.  I stopped at Home Depot and bought some
shelve standards and then went back to Valley Glass to place the order.  It was
4 PM when I got home.  I took a shower and shaved and then laid down and took a
½ hour nap.  Mae cooked a nice cabbage casserole for dinner and then I went to
the Ogden Temple as it is our Ward Temple night.  I sure enjoyed the temple
session tonight.  It was 9:30 PM when I got home.  Mark had given our neighbors
to the East of us, a sack of tomatoes and a little later they responded with
three sacks of fruit form their trees.  I filled out my journal entry and we
went to bed.</span></p>

stopped at Burton Lumber and ordered materials for Scott &amp; Mishelle’s.  I
then went to Valley Glass and got the order placed for Mae’s mirror and
shelves.  I went to the pharmacy by Tanner’s clinic and bought me a back support
as the one I have had for almost 30 years has lost its strength. I went back to
Burton as they called me to tell me that they had my post bases in so I went
back to get them.  I got a call from Valley Glass with a question about my
order so I went back over and got that taken care of.  I went into I.C.S. and
bought some sauna tub for Scott job.  I stopped and got gas in my truck and
also washed my pickup.  I figured the amount of concrete that we will need for
Scott’s and made some calls on that.  I then went back to Scott’s and got the
sauna tubs cut and set in place.  it was almost 6 PM when I came home.  Mae had
dinner about ready when I got home.  After eating I helped Mae set some
lettering that Mishelle made for Mae.  I then did some work on the computer
before taking a shower and shaving.  Mae went outside and trimmed the lawn.  I
hope she doesn’t over due and get sick again.  Mae came in about 8:45 PM as I
was just finishing with my computer work.  I shaved and took a shower before we
went to bed.</span></p>

waffles for breakfast for us.  my first stop was to go to I.C.S. and get the
rebar I had them make up for me.  I went to Scott’s and got the sauna tubs placed
and tied the rebar.  About 11 AM I went to Ogden and got a yard of concrete. 
Bob came over and helped me pour the concrete and clean up the tools.  Before I
took the trailer back to Ogden I had Bob help me carry the lumber to the back
yard and stack it there.  after returning the trailer I went out to Nut &amp;
Bolt Supply and bought a long 5/8” drill bit.  I went back and got my trailer
and then went to Valley Glass and got Mae’s mirror but they had forgot to cut
the glass shelves.  It was after 5 PM when I got home, very tired.  Mae had me
help her with some preparations for the Baby Shower she is giving for Chelci
tomorrow.  We then watched a movie on TV before going to bed.  We also played a
couple of games on the computer.</span></p>
