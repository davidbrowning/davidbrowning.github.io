<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke and
got up at 6:15 AM.  I read D &amp; C 134 &amp; 135 and re-read 134 which is the
account of the murder of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum.  I
really am amazed at what and why that took place.  To have it happen in this
country and that there was no recourse.  I took a shower and shaved and then
crawled back in bed with my sweetheart.  Bob brought breakfast of waffles down
to us about 10 AM.  I called and talked to Scott.  He will come over this
evening with his family for dinner and then he will show us how to use the Excel
program.  I worked most of the day on Randy and Judy’s house plans.  Scott and
his family came over at 6 PM and after eating Scott and I worked on creating
new forms.  We got a new statement form made for my Handy Man records.  Scott
and his family left after 9 PM.  I worked until 11 PM on getting a new budget
form made up.  I got a good start on it.  I filled out my journal entry and we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM, read my scriptures, took a bath and woke Mae when I went into the
bedroom to dress.  I started on working the house plans for Randy and Judy. 
Mae has been busy all day.  I worked on the plans until lunch time.  After
eating I took a 20 minute nap and then worked on my cabinet.  I had to quit
that at 4 PM and take a shower and get ready.  Mae went over to the Credit
Union branches and got some more one dollar bills.  Gary Nelson, a lady from
Hooper “Ann”, Mae and I went out to eat at the Little Orient in Kaysville.  We
then came back to our place where we visited and played games until after 11
PM.  I filled in my journal after they left and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM and read my scriptures.  I got quite involved and before long it was
time for me to be at Randy’s.  Randy was going to give me a treatment and then
I was going to go over the house plans with them.  Randy worked on me for 2
hours and then Judy and he had a ball game of one of their grandchildren to
attend.  I came home and got some breakfast.  Mae was very upset when I got
home.  She had talked to David and then Mike and told them that we were going
to go to Jerusalem and they were upset.  David had really upset Mae.  I was
upset.  After eating I went over and got my snowmobiles.  I was pleased with
the price.  I had tried to call Mike on the way to Clearfield but he was busy. 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mike called
me and we discussed the calls made to Mae and I expressed my feeling that it
was our decision and they could agree with it or not but I wasn’t happy with
them upsetting Mae.  I told Mike that I was too upset with David to call him at
this time.  I was concerned that I would say too much.  He agreed that now
wasn’t a good time.  The comment has been made that David feels that we didn’t
follow through with him on a financial agreement.  As I recall that agreement,
it was made when David and I were called into the Bishops office for his
interview to go on a mission.  At that time I told David that he would have to
wait until Mike came home as we couldn’t afford to have both of them out at the
same time.  David didn’t want to wait and suggested that he could pay for three
months with his money.  I told him that if he did I would try to repay him when
he “David” returned home.  When David returned from his mission we had bought
the home in Layton and we did not have any extra at that time.  David said that
was ok and not to worry about it.  Evidently that was not his understanding and
he has carried a resentment ever sense.  Also, I thought that because David
thought that the possibility of buying Bob’s home was such a good deal and that
I should make ever effort to buy it.  I thought when I talked to him I was
offering him a way to get in on the good investment.  That isn’t the way it
came back now.  Instead I was trying to get David to buy the house so Bob,
Carroll, Mae and I could live in the house free the rest of our life.  Another
back fire!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After bring
the snowmobiles home I went back to Randy and Judy’s.  Judy isn’t too pleased
with the drawings so I will change them.  This evening Mae and I watched a show
on TV.  After the show I worked on our budget forms.  It was late when I got
them finished.  I said prayers with Mae and had her go to bed.  I then made
this journal.  It was after mid-night when I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was
concerned that if I went to bed, as late as I did last night, that I would wake
Mae, so I slept in the recliner until 5 AM.  I then got into bed for a while. 
As today is Fast Sunday we didn’t eat breakfast.  We decided that in as much as
we couldn’t hold our F.H.E. this evening that we would watched the DVD titled
“To Form a More Perfect Union.”  It was produced by BYU and is an excellent
reenactment of the writing of the Constitution of The United States of
America.  We were thrilled with it.  I took a copy of it and the book “The
First 5000 Year Leap” and gave to Bishop Knudsen.  I also gave Glen Higley a
copy of the book and asked both of them to read then.  I really enjoyed the
meetings today and felt the Spirit there.  I didn’t have to stay with the
nursery today.  I wish that I felt better about that calling than I do but it
just doesn’t excite me.  Bob and Carroll had a nice dinner for us shortly after
we got home.  I took the DVD that Craig and Carla had sent to me, over to
Brother Mitchell, to see if he could pull the drawing off.  I then went to the
Layton Medical Center for another sleep test.  This time I used the C-Cup
machine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, February 05, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept
fairly well but was awaken two or three times during the night to have the
equipment adjusted.  The mask was a little uncomfortable but I slept ok.  I
woke at 5 AM and was unhooked from all the wiring.  The technetium said that
the test went well and my oxygen level stayed above 85% and better all night. 
He is sure my Doctor will put me on the machine.  I got home by 6:30 AM.  I
didn’t want to wake Mae so I worked on my computer.  Mae left me a note telling
me that Brother Mitchell was unable to bring up the drawing of Craig &amp;
Carla’s on his computer.  When Mae got up we discussed some letters that she
wrote to our boys.  Bob came down and invited us for breakfast of biscuits and
gravy which we of course readily accepted.  After breakfast Bob, Mark and I got
into a discussion.  At noon the three of us went over to the church and helped
set up tables and chairs for a dinner for the family of Daisy Alice
McDaniel’s.  Daisy was a member of our Ward and passed away on February 1.  After
setting up the tables and chairs Glenn Higgley, Mark and I got into a
discussion of the things to come in the near future.  I expressed my feelings
that I to expect the Second Coming to be soon and the down fall of our nation
to be soon but I feel that our direction will come by the Lords chosen way. 
This discussion lasted quite a while.  Mae and I had decided to attend the
Funeral this afternoon and when it was time to get ready we had to jokingly say
that today will be chocked up as talking.  We did attend the funeral services. 
We then changed and went over to Jeff and Gale, who had invited us and Gale’s
mother to have dinner and F.H.E. with them.  It also gave me an opportunity to
make some more measurements that I need to have in order to draw the plans they
want.  We had a good evening with them.  By the time we were ready to leave, I
wasn’t feeling very well.  As we drove home Mae read from our book on the
Atonement and we were thrilled with new and deeper thoughts.  At home I felt
miserable and my stomach was very upset.  I slept in the recliner this
evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                At 4 AM I
went to the bed and went back to sleep.  Mae let me sleep until 8 PM.  After morning
study and prayers we ate breakfast.  I completed the reading of the Doctrine
&amp; Covenants.  I then worked on my journal.  Mark called to let us know that
on KBYU TV, Truman Madson and Steve Young were speaking of the Holy Land.  We
turned it on and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I worked some on Jeff and Gale’s
addition plans.  I went out in the garage and did some work on the computer
cabinet.  It is now ready to stain and finish.  I visited with Chad and will
take the ramp to the snowmobile to him tomorrow.  Jeff stopped by and we spent
a few minutes looking over the plans that I have drawn.  We watched a show on
TV this evening.  We also read more about the changing of the United
Constitution and the National Animal Identification System.  It really leaves
me mind boggled as to what we can do.  We did get on the internet and order 20
brochures to distribute and made a $10 pledge.  It does not seem like much but
maybe it’s a start.  It’s after 10 PM and we are not ready for bed.  Mae
checked the e-mail and Craig &amp; Carla had sent the plans so I spent a while
getting them downloaded and moved to a DVD.  It was mid-night when we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4:45
AM and spent the next hour studding with the student handbook for the Book of
Mormon.  It was great!  Mae had me come back to bed and it was 9 AM when I got
up and had breakfast.  I started working on the plans for Randy’s house and
after a couple of hours I did something wrong and lost my work and fouled up
the location of my tool bars.  I did get out and set up the cabinet and then I
sprayed them with a stain and finish.  Bob took the DVD over to Kinkos and got
me a set of prints.  I turned the doors and shelves over and sprayed the back
sides.  I took the ramp to the snowmobile trailer over to Chad’s to get him to
repair it.  This evening Bob and I went home teaching and were able to visit
Sister Casey (at the door) and Brother and Sister Johnston.  We were going to
watch a movie but just as we got it started David called and the two of us
visited for quite a while.  He is concerned about the company he is working
for.  He thinks it is in for some serious trouble.  He also suggested that he
had been thinking of he and I doing crown molding in upper class homes.  It
could work but I suggested that if he changed to an occupation such as that he
would have to forget ever going back to a field like the one he is currently
in.  He also told me of a complement he received today by one of the best
doctors in Utah.  The Doctor is writing a booklet for all the HMO hospitals in
the state and he will have it finished in a week or so.  He would then like
David to come over and review it before he has it printed.  David really felt
honored at that request.  It was after 10 PM when David hung up so we just
turned the TV off and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
until 7:30 PM and by the time I did my scripture study it was going on 9 AM.  I
am not a very fast reader so it is going to take me some tine studding the Book
of Mormon in connection with the study manual.  I worked on plans and did more
finishing on the computer cabinet I am building.  I had to clean things up as
Mae is having her book group this evening. Jeff stopped by after work and we
went over some changes they want in their plans.  Bob and I went Home Teaching
to the Fallis’s but they were not home.  I had to sit upstairs and watch
nothing on TV until Mae book group left.  We did stay up and watch “Hell
Fighters” with John Wayne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up a
little earlier today but the time still went by fast.  I didn’t get much done on
the plans today.  I did get one coat of finish s[rayed on the cabinets today. 
I took my old table saw over to Mishelle’s for her to have.  Chad called and
said that the ramp was finished so I went over and got it.  I was to take a
dish of Lazona to Mishelle and Mae told me not to forget it.  Mae had gone to
the store for me while she ran some other errorns.  She told me not to for get
the lazona but I was almost over to Scott’s when I remembered the lazona.  Mae
had to make a special trip over to take it.  I got home just in time to clean
up when Mae got home.  Sandi and Nick came and we went out to eat at
Chuck-a-Rama and then over to Ben Lomond High School where we watched a
basketball game with Grantsville High playing against Ben Lomand.  Logan played
most of the game and is really a good player.  Ben Lomond won at 52 to 58 but
it was a good game.  We enjoyed the evening being with Nick and Sandi.  It was
after 10 PM when I finished my journal and we went to bed.  Mae is sure a good
wife and sweetheart to me in every way.</span></p>

about 7:30 AM but it seems to take a while to get the day going.  Mae worked on
our bank statement during the day.  Jeff and Gail went to a movie and so we
(Mae) tended Bengi for them.  He is so good with us and very adorable.  Bob
cooked liver and onions for lunch and invited us up there.  Scott came over and
borrowed Bob’s pickup to haul trash to the dumps.  Rich, Lois and Elise came as
they were going to Phillip and Lisa’s so that they could hear their daughter
report on her mission.  They also brought me 10 filters for the distiller and
some chemicals to keep it clean.  I worked on Craig and Carla’s house plans for
the heat system and I also got another coat of finish on my cabinet.  We worked
right up to 7 PM and then had to hurry to get to the Tri-Stake dance held in
Kaysville.  It was a very nice dance and well attended.  The decorations were
nice but they took up too much of the dance floor.  The orchestra was on the
floor instead of on the stage and then students from Davis High came to sing
with the orchestra and they stood on the dance floor so it was really crowded. 
I think many left early because of the crowded condition.  We left before 11 PM
being very tired.</span></p>

7:30 AM and spent sometime studying.  I filled in my journal from yesterday as
I was too tired when we got home last night.  We had breakfast and then it was
time to go to choir practice.  I was too tired so I took a nap while Mae.  I woke
just in time to get ready to go so we went up to Morgan.  Caleb gave his home
coming report.  We went over to Kim and Jeanenne where we visited and ate.  Jeanenne
was sick so she was quarantined and stayed in her bedroom.  David told me that
one of his associates has been having great luck fishing up in Idaho about 30
miles East of Lava.  Jeff and I got talking about the ice fishing and decided
to give it a try.  We thought of taking our wife’s with us and stay in The Home
at Lava.  Scott said that they would like to join us.  I called and found that
all the motel rooms are full for next weekend.  This evening Mae, Bob, Carroll
and I played Canasta.  Bob and I won tonight.</span></p>

of the morning working on our budget and statement.  I did get part of the last
coat of finish on the cabinet.  I didn’t get the second side of the doors and
shelf’s done.  Our statement balance is off again and I don’t know why.  I
haven’t figured out how to get it corrected yet.  We left before 5 PM for
Providence Utah to attend a meeting on our Israel trip.  It was very
interesting and we found that Brother Barrett is very knowledgeable with the
history from Old Testament times to current events.  I sure felt uneducated. 
It was 10:30 PM by the time we got home.  Mae read itinerary and instructions
as to what to bring and what not to on the way home.  We have a lot to do
before we leave in a month.  I hope this is the right thing for us to do.   </span></p>

Kaysville to get it inspected.  It passed emissions but has a problem with the
rear brakes.  I thought I could get the Quicken Statement going and spent all
morning and into the afternoon trying to work the problems out.  Mae got upset
with me and I gave up and went outside.  I finished painting the cabinet and
then put tools away.  Mae fixed lunch and I worked longer on the statement
getting it finished, “I think!”  We went over to Diane and Larry Steele’s for
diner and to visit.  We got home about 8:30 PM.  It was a very interesting
evening.  I filled out this journal entry and then we watched the 1<sup>st</sup>

walking this morning.  When she returned she made breakfast.  I went in after
breakfast and went to bed.  I slept for about an hour when I woke up with acid
reflex.  I went back to sleep and slept another 1 ½ hours when I again woke. 
Bob helped me carry in the cabinet.  I called and ordered parts for the car. 
When I went to get the parts I stopped at Checker Auto and dumped my use drain
oil.  I then went to Durk’s and paid my bill and got information on the heat
system.  After getting the arts I got gas in my pickup and stopped at Winegar’s
for a few groceries, transferred some money from one account to another and bought
Mae some flowers and a card.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  We watched

said he had breakfast about ready.  He prepared biscuits and grave.  I then
went to work on the car.  There is a rubber boot over the end of the ram and
the tie rod that was factory installed.  I couldn’t see a way to get it off so
I called the parts house.  They said that I would have to cut the clamp somehow
and then when I put it back I would have to find a way to secure it.  I had to
make a special cutting tool in order to reach back to the strap.  I then
couldn’t get the tie rod off as I couldn’t get a wrench into the area.  I spent
the rest of the day chasing around trying to find a crows foot wrench that
would fit it.  I finally found one at Herrick Industrial supplies and came home
to try it.  At first I couldn’t get it to break loose but with Bob’s help and a
3 foot cheater bar it came off.  I gave up for the night.  Bob and I went home
teaching to the Falis’s this evening.  As the car is not repaired I drove Mae
over to one of the Sisters for her to give her a Birthday card and gift.  When
I backed out of the driveway I turned as I normally do and about ran into Bob’s
car that was left outside because our car is in the garage being repaired. 
Earlier today I felt impressed to remove the trailer hitch and put it in the
truck.  Had I not it would have hit into Bob’s car.  I sure appreciate that
inspiration.   Mae and I read for a while this evening before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae woke me
at 1:10 AM as she was getting back into bed.  She hadn’t been able to sleep and
had gotten up.  I finally convinced her to let me rub her legs and feet.  That
relaxed her and she went to sleep.  I got up at 5:30 AM.  I let Mae sleep until
7 AM when she woke to fix breakfast and go to visit Georgia.  She had a hair
appointment also this afternoon.  I had an appointment with Ed Sorsen to give him
our information on last years tax information so he can prepare our tax forms. 
I updated our quicken files and the morning was gone.  I got me something to
eat for lunch and then went to work on the car.  It was after 5 PM when I got
the car repaired.  I put tools away and by that time Mae was home and prepared
some dinner.  Scott and Mishelle brought Kylan and Ashley over for us to tend
while they attended a Ward Social.  I took a shower and cleaned up.  Mae played
with the children all evening.  I watched a show on TV.  Scott and Mishelle
came for the children about 9PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6:30 AM but didn’t have my glasses with me in the bathroom so was unable
to read.  I read later and then we had breakfast.  Maggie and Bill Klaas called
and asked me if I would check a couple of items about a house they are planning
on buying.  We went over and looked at the problems and gave some suggestions
as to how to repair the problems.  We then took the brake shoes that I didn’t
need to put on the Buick, back to the auto parts.  We came home and I started
work on the cabinet.  Bob asked if I could go to Sherries and help him unload a
piano from a dolly.  I went with him and got that done.  I got the doors
installed on the cabinet.  I had to move the old computer cabinet over to allow
room for the new one.  When I moved the new cabinet into place I realized that
I had not built it high enough.  I will have to make some modifications to it. 
I decided to run an electrical out let to the computer area so that will take a
little time.  I helped Mae clean up as we are having family over tomorrow for
dinner.  We are going to watch a movie this evening that is based on the
anti-Semitism towards the Jews.  We have read some articles concerning it that
were given to us from Brother Barrett.  We watched the show “Sunshine”.  Mae
hadn’t noticed it when she ordered the show but it is rated R.  I figured that
it was mainly the cruel treatment that was given the Jews but it also had
several sex scenes in it.  It did show how the European and Asia countries went
from one government to another and the Jews always seemed to get the bad end of
things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t get
up until 8 AM.  We didn’t have very long until we had to go to choir practice. When
we got back home Bob had cooked some waffles and sent one down with me so we
ate them with peanut butter and jam on them.  Before long it was time to go to
church.  The nursery was short on help today so I stayed in there today.  It
was cute when Brother Saunders brought his daughter Brylee in, she through her
arms in the air and ran right over to me.  Then her twin brother Nathan came
over and was with me most of the time.  The children are interesting.  I fell
asleep during Sacrament meeting.  We stayed for choir practice after meeting
also.  Jeff, Gail, Benji, David, Shauna, Tyler, Emily and Connor came for
dinner.  After dinner we played some games.  Bob and I went to the viewing of
Elizabeth Stucki Thomas Royle.  She was the wife of Dee Thomas, my nephew.  The
kids were just leaving as I got home.  I made my journal entry before we went
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae was
already up when I woke at 8 AM.  By 10 AM we had breakfast and I was ready to
start on Randy &amp; Judy’s house plans.  I couldn’t find the original prints. 
We spent the next hour looking through everything we could think of to find
them.  I finally gave up and started with the partial drawing on the computer. 
I worked until 7:30 PM before quitting for something to eat and to watch a
movie on TV.  Bob came down with a banana cream pie that he had made with raw
sugar so I could eat it, about 3 PM.  We had a nice large slice and it was
good.  About 7 PM Bob again knocked and he had some chicken noodle soup that he
asked if we wanted some.  I quite with the plans at 7:30 PM and we ate while
watching the movie.  Mae was still working on a scrap book so I cleared up the
dishes and made up some whey.  I wrote this entry during commercials.  It was
11 PM when Mae finished the scrapbook that she was working on.  I started
watching “Mighty Joe Young” but turned it off and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
6:30 AM and before I realized it, it was after 9 AM.  Mae had to leave about
8:30 to go to Aunt Beth’s and then did several other errorns.  One was to get
the car re-inspected and the other was to stop at Home Depot to get some
electrical parts for me.  I worked on Randy &amp; Judy’s house plans and then
went to their place about 10:30 AM.  We spent the next 5 hours going over their
plans and really didn’t come to very much of a conclusion.  Judy is having a
lot of problem leaving her present home.  When I got home I was hungry and
beat.  Mae had just got home so we ate some lunch and I took a nap for a couple
of hours.  I started working on the electrical for the computer area and found
that the wall is filled with scrap sheetrock.  I gave up for tonight.  Mae felt
like we needed to read more of the books we have so we started on “Awaken to
our Awful Situation”.  It depressed me and when I tried to explain my feelings
Mae got upset with me.  I made this entry.  I feel very confused and depressed
this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early but then decided to watch a movie.  We watched “Facing the Giants”.  It
was a very spiritual movie and really impressed both Mae and I.  After the shoe
we decided to go to the Temple.  We took the computer stick with us and went to
the Family History Center in Ogden and there we were able to get help and get
the paper work to have Hal &amp; Jeans Temple Sealing done and Cindi’s
Endowment done and then to have her sealed to her parents.  From there we went
to the Temple where Mae did the Initiatory and then the Endowment for Cindi.  After
going through the Temple we went over to Dennie’s and had breakfast at 4 PM.  We
stopped on the way home and bought some speakers that will work on my laptop. 
I did some work on the plans for Randy and Judy and then we watched two movies
on the Hall Mark channel.  Sense we left the Temple I have been coming down
with a cold.  Mae is giving me lots of vitamin C to try to overthrow it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke not
feeling very well.  It is just a head cold but I was going to sleep in to try
to shake it.  Randy and Judy called and we talked about their house plans for a
while.  I about got back to sleep and Mark came down wanting to go after the
food and canner so I got up.  It took a lot longer than we thought it would. 
When we got home we got the garage set up to start canning but I decided that I
had better rest some today.  Mae had to go to get her drivers license renewed. 
She made and took dinner over to a family in the Ward.  She went over and got
our tax return forms and that was a very pleasant surprise for we had figured
that we would owe about $10,000 but when it turned out we only owe $1,287.00!  We
had Home Teachers this evening but I didn’t feel up to going upstairs but Mae
went.  I had slept a couple of hours and then watched a couple of shows on
video.  We did some price figuring on the food we will can tomorrow but didn’t
have all the prices of the product we purchased.  The girl hadn’t listed the
items separately but had just listed them as food.  we did make up labels for
the wheat we will can.  I filled in this journal before we went to bed after 11
PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I haven’t
felt good so Bob and Mark returned the canner and we decided to reschedule for
next week.  Mae took care of me, got the prices of the foods that we bought
yesterday, and visited with Sandy on the phone.  About noon David came and
borrowed the snowmobiles and gave us $125.00 for the use of them.  We did visit
with a man about the supplemental insurance we have.  I still do not feel very
good tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When I woke
this morning I had lost my voice.  We had breakfast and then Mae went to a
woman’s conference at the Clearfield Stake.  I worked on Craig and Carla’s
plans, designing a heat system for them.  I also called and talked to Durk
about some questions I have about the heat system.  Mark came down while I was
eating some lunch and visited for a while.  Mae came home for a little while. 
Bob brought us down some cinnamon rolls and some whole made bread.  We ate
those and some chicken soup he had brought to us yesterday.  Mae went to a
meeting on the Constitution and didn’t get back until after 10:30 PM.  I
watched two shows on TV and was in the middle of a third one when Mae came
home.  We watched it to the end before going to bed.  I got up and wrote this
entry.  It was a little after mid-night when I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was sick so
I stayed in bed most of the day.  Mae had to manage the nursery short handed
but she said it worked out ok.  I watched several church programs and enjoyed
them.   Before going to bed we watched the movie “King David”.  Mae hadn’t
realized that it was an animated movie but it was ok anyway.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I spent quite
a lot of time in bed but did get up and ran the electrical wiring to the
computer area.  Mae went to town and bought a 8” X 8” X 16” cinder block that I
used for a base to the cabinet that I had built.  I got the cabinet installed
and the computer desk put back into place.  I sure got tired in a hurry and
would have to rest.  We watched a movie that Bob had recorded for us but it
wasn’t the best that I have seen of Burt Lancaster’s.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 3
AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so I got up and drew on Randy &amp; Judy’s
plans.  I couldn’t get them to work out like I thought I might.  At 7 AM I went
back to sleep for a little while.  Mae didn’t sleep very well last night.  Bob
prepared breakfast of biscuits and gravy for us this morning.  I worked most of
the day on plans.  Sandi called to wish me a Happy Birthday.  Mae had a
Birthday gift for me of three pair of garments and two white shirts, plus a
nice card.  Irven and Sandy called and wished me a happy birthday.  Sister Hyer
called and they want us to go to lunch on Thursday with the Clark’s and them. 
Our auto insurance co. called to wish me a Happy Birthday.  Meliah called to
see if I was feeling better and to wish me a Happy Birthday.  President
Brimhall called to congratulate us on our upcoming trip.  He said they have
always wanted to take the Israel trip.  I enjoyed visiting with him for a few
minutes.  David called to wish me a Happy Birthday.  We visited for a while. 
He lost over $10,000 today in the stock market.  Mae prepared a nice Birthday
dinner for me and invited Mark, Bob and Carroll down.  We visited and
reminisced about Mom and Aunt Vida.  As we concluded we wished that we had
recorded our conversations this evening.  I caught my journal up to date as I
didn’t have the computers hooked up until this morning.  It was after 10 PM
before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM but went back to bed shortly after 7:30 AM and didn’t get up until 9:30 AM. 
Bob brought us down some hot waffles for breakfast.  We had just eaten when we
got a call from Sister Hyer inviting us to go out to eat lunch with them and
the Clark’s.  We met then at 12:30 PM at the Clark’s.  It was an enjoyable
lunch and we visited until 3 PM.  When we got home I went to the bank and
bought $500 in currency and $500 in coin.  I then went to Wal-Mart and bought a
fire proof and water proof locking box to keep our money in.  Jeff called and
wanted to borrow my pickup to get a new ping-pong table in.  I told him that
Mae was home and she could tend Benji while he was getting the table.  Mae
decided to go with him.  They were ready to leave when I got home.  They called
me from the store for they had used Mae’s keys to take the pickup and she
didn’t have a key to the back cab.  I drove the keys over to them.  I told Jeff
to take the pickup home this evening and return it tomorrow.  I repaired a cord
to our computer and we finished getting the computer cabinet back together.  I
made up labels for canning food storage this weekend.  It was late when we went
to bed.</span></p>
