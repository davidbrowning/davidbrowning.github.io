<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got over to
Grant’s by 8 AM and worked until 1 PM getting the second coat of mud on the
ceiling patches and shingled the roof where I removed the swamp cooler duct.  I
came home and ate my lunch, showered and took a nap.  Mae and I went to the
Ogden Temple as our Stake Conference is this week end and our Stake asked us to
attend as a Stake.  After the session Mae and I went to Farr’s Ice Cream and I
bought Mae a Banana Split and I had one also but mine was made of Yogurt.  I
worked on the computer for a few minutes and then we watched a show on DVD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well but slept in until 8 AM.  Mae prepared breakfast and I put a
few tools in the truck and went to Grant’s.  No one was home so I used the key
and went in.  I completed the job  I about 1 ½ hours and went to Scott’s.  I
spent the rest of the day getting ready to paint and painting their patio
cover.  It was almost 5 PM when I returned home.  Mae had gone to the school
where Ashley and Kylan attend.  It was Grandparents day for Ashley so Mae and
Mishelle’s mother attended.  Mae brought my lunch and we ate together.  This
evening I had Mae stop and get some take-out at the Little Orient for dinner. 
We watched two movies on cable again this evening.  the one was “Christmas
Division” and the 2<sup>nd</sup> was “Denial Boone”.  Mae worked on her scrap
books while we watched the movies.  I filled in my journal before we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  Mae gave me a hair cut this morning.  I cooked breakfast of
boiled egg omelets.  We kept busy most of the day with little odd jobs.  The
day seemed to go by quite fast.  Jeff and Gail brought Benji over for us to
tend this evening.  we took him with us to the 100 year birthday calibration of
the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup> Ward.  We remembered a few of the ones that were
there.  A nice dinner was served but we left before the program started.. 
Benji was very good for us and we enjoyed showing him off as our last born grandchild. 
After coming home I changed clothes and attended the evening session of our
Stake Conference.  we watched a movie on TV before going to bed this evening. 
I tried to record a movie on the Hall Mark channel but was unable to get it on
our TV in our bedroom.  I became quite upset over it.  We found out when Jeff
and Gail came back to get Benji that Gail’s mother said that as of Nov. 1<sup>st</sup>
the Hall Mark channel has to go through a special receiver and the old TV will
not be able to receive it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 8 AM but the daylight saving time changed back so it was really 7 AM.  I
went back to bed and slept for a hour.  We went out to Stansberry where we
attended church.  As we drove out to Stansberry, Mae read a Pro and Con to the
Parent Choice in Education Act.  Chelci and Steve blessed their baby today. 
Steve gave a very good blessing.  I was privileged to be able to stand in the
circle for the blessing.  After the meeting we were invited to go to Steve’s
parents where we visited and had a nice lunch.  We went upstairs and played a
game of canasta with Bob and Carroll.  When I first asked Bob and Carroll if
they wanted to play Bob said that Carroll wouldn’t be able to.  Carroll
immediately spoke up saying that she would like to play.  It was a very close
game this evening but Bob and I ended up winning.  I think Carroll really
enjoyed this evening.  I read a print out of the law that we will vote for on
Tuesday of the Parent Choice in Education Act.  I really do not understand what
I read.  I have very mixed feelings as to which way to vote.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, November 05, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae made
breakfast of cooked cereal.  It is ok but has the texture of wall paper past. 
I have a hard time with that type of cereal.  I then spent some time working
with AutoCAD to draw some plans on building the ramp for Carroll.  Bob is
cleaning out the garage so we will have room to install the ramp.  This
afternoon Bob and I went over to Nolan’s and got three heavy plywood boards to
be used for the ramp.  We then went to Home Depot and bought some lumber.  It
was late so we will get started on the ramp tomorrow.  After dinner Mae worked
on the computer for a while.  I called Bishop Knudsen and ask him about the
candidates that are running for Clinton city council.  He said that all those
that are running are well qualified and would be good in that position.  I took
the news paper back to Bob and Carroll.  Mark was in the kitchen so we got in a
discussion concerning politics.  That is a useless and long subject.  Mae and I
read a couple of lessons from the Priesthood and Relief Society manual.  I
worked on my journal getting two months printed of and in a binder.  It was
after 10 PM when I finished this entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, November 06, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 2
AM and at 2:30 got up.  After reading from my scriptures I still wasn’t sleepy
so I turned on a movie.  I watched “Hart Sounds”.  It was really a good movie. 
I heard the clock strike 6 AM and I went to sleep.  I got up at 8 AM.  Mae got
breakfast ready while I got ready to start to work.  About the time I was going
out the door Robin Porter called.  He wanted to get the pictures that Mae had
scanned into the Byron Porter file.  I copied them to a DC and showed Mae how
to do it.  She made more copies.  Mae was also busy all morning with washing. 
I called Craig Sherman and they will be ready for me to finish the installation
of the heat system into their home by the end of next week. Mae and I then
decided to go vote as the poles are now open.  We stopped at the bank and
deposited some money.  Bob went after some materials for me, while I removed
the old steps and started cutting material.  This afternoon we got the two
platforms framed before we quite for the day.  Mae and I went over to Ro and
purchased some empty capsules.  This evening after Mae cooked dinner and we ate
I filled 200 capsules.  We turned the TV on and the show of “Pollyanna” came
on.  We watched that show.  I filled in my journal and took a shower before we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept much
better last night and we got up about 7:30 AM.  I started work while Mae went
to the grocery store for some items.  I worked all day on the ramp getting
quite a lot done.  Bob help me until he went in to help Carroll.  He then had
to go to Salt Lake to the V.A. Hospital where he got a new hearing aid.  Mark
helped me while Bob was gone.  I made some car ramps and Mark changed the oil
in his car.  He then had to get ready to go to the Temple.  He had an assignment
to attend the Temple today.  Before I quite working today my 16 penny mail gun
quite working.  I guess I can’t complain as that gun has served me for almost
35 years.  The last time I had it repaired I was told that they could no longer
get parts for that model of nail guns.  Mae cooked a pot of beans with a ham
hock for dinner and they were very good.  We turned on the TV and watched
“Swiss Family Robinson” on the Hallmark Channel.  We got a e-mail letter from
Roger today and he wasn’t asking for us to send them money this time.  It was
after 10 PM when we went top bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, November 08, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up
early and read my scriptures.  I was in a depressed mod this morning.  I
checked my 16 Penny nail gun and found that a small plastic part in the trigger
assembly was broken.  After several calls I reached Air-o-fasteners and found
that they can order the part.  It will take at least a week to get it so I
bought a new gun.  With the new gun I was able to continue with the project. 
Bob cooked a cabbage casserole for lunch.  I worked until after 6 PM and then
Bob and I cleaned up the area as Mae is having her book group this evening.  I
loaned Mark our camera as he is unable to get his camera to work.  After
showering I watched the BYU vs TCU football game.  At first it looked like BYU
had a easy win but TCU put up a good fight and the final score was BYU 29 TCU
22.  Good game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
later than usual but still ate about 8 AM.  we needed some materials so we
loaded the trash and materials that we need to return.  We went up to the dumps
and unloaded the scrap material.  We then went to Home Depot and returned the
extra material.  We looked for other materials that we need but they didn’t
have it.  We sent quite a while trying to find someone to help us.  we finally
went to Stock’s and got what we needed.  We then went to Durk’s and got the
slant fin base board for Sherman’s.  we gust got home when Craig Sherman called
to let me know that they won’t get gas hooked up until after Thanksgiving.  I
worked the rest of the day in order to get finished.  Mae had her hair done
this afternoon.  We got com cast added to the TV in our bedroom .  I watched a
show on TV this afternoon.  Mae and I watched a show this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I thought
that I would get my tools put away and the car and truck serviced but Mae asked
me to cook breakfast, I then packaged the box of chicken that we bought
yesterday.  Mae came over and helped me and that sure sped the project up.  I
then tried to get our computer and power point projector to worked together. 
After trying several ways with no success I called Jeff.  Jeff couldn’t walk me
through it with out seeing my screens.  I finally packed up my equipment and
took it over to Jeff’s.  In just a few minutes Jeff showed me a way to
synchronize the screen and the projector.  I came home and it was time to go to
the Porter Cousins Party.  It was a good evening and had a good showing of
Porter cousins.  We missed Randy and Judy but they gad another family gathering. 
Robbin &amp; Jennie, Bryce &amp; Deanna and Mae &amp; I reported on our
missions.   We got home about 9 PM.  Mae and I stayed up and watched a movie on
the Comcast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then enjoyed a relaxing morning.  We attended Priesthood and Relief Society
in out Ward and then came home.  Mae got dinner ready for the ovens while I
took a short nap.  We attended Sacrament meeting in Clearfield so that we could
hear Bryce and Deanna’s report on their mission.  They did very well; in fact I
think it was one of the best talks I have heard Bryce give.  We took a plate of
Texas cake over to Bryce’s house but we didn’t stay.  David, Shauna and the
children came over for dinner with us.  Mae had a lovely dinner ready.  After
dinner we set around and visited.  David and I discussed the fishing trip to
the Palisade dam.  It looks like all my boys and David and Tyler will be
going.  We are trying to figure out the sleeping.  I called <br>
Sandi to see if Nick wants to go and bring their trailer.  David also is
interested in my truck and the natural gas.  The truck sales are really going
down as the gas prices are continuing to rise.  Mae and I played a game of
rummy before we went to bed this evening.  it was close but I won.  I filled
out my journal and we went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I planned on
servicing the car and pickup today but instead help Bob.  I also help Mark get
his carpet cut for his room.  I also worked on my water storage.  At 3:30 PM I
went over to RaNae Barney to give her some advice about a shed she wants to
build.  My first understanding is that she was just adding a roof cover but
before we were through visiting I realized that she was making a complete
enclose.  I went over to Irven and Sandy’s and checked out their kitchen range
but could find nothing wrong with it.  I also turned their outside water off
for the year.  I came home and we ate but in a few minutes I began to have
quite a bit of pain.  I slept for a little while in the recliner.  I didn’t
feel very good when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 10:30 AM.  Mae and I did go for a walk and looked at the progress of the
park across the street.  Again I thought I would get my car and pickup
serviced.  I got my tools all gathered up and put back in my trailer.  I then
helped Bob get some trash loaded up and I helped him with the garage.  It was
cold and late when we quite for the day.  I am afraid that we may get snow
tonight.  Mae went visiting Teaching this evening.  I called RaNae and I am
afraid that I now have a (free be) job to work in my schedule.  I caught my
journal up to date and got a bill ready for Aunt Beth.  She called me and said
that an insurance company is going to pay the bills and asked me for a printed
billing.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, November 14, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
4:30 AM and read my scriptures but was too wide awake to go back to bed.  I was
also afraid that I would wake Mae, so I set in the recliner and about 7 AM went
back to sleep until 8 AM.  I took Mae out for breakfast at Denny’s.  We stopped
on the way and left a bill for Aunt Beth.  She thinks that an insurance company
is going to cover all the expenses.  We next stopped at RaNae’s and measured
the area that she wants to put a shed in.  I don’t know how we would get cement
back to the area with out using a pump truck.  I wish that she would just consider
getting rid of a lot of un-needed and un-used items.  It would save her a lot
of money and me a lot of time.  From RaNae’s we went to the grocery store for a
few items and some water softener salt.  This afternoon I serviced both the
pickup and the car along with helping Bob and Mark.  Bob and I went Home
Teaching this evening and were able to visit the Casey’s and the Johnston’s. 
Mae and I watched a movie on Comcast before going to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
until 7:30 AM but I woke having a mixed up dream and felt exhausted from the
dream.  Bob came down and said that he had waffles ready for breakfast.  After
eating Mae was working on the computer.  I got the wheat grinder out and ground
some flour for Mae.  I called Rich and Lois to ask if they could help me get
some RV Rental dealers in Idaho Falls.  Lois said she would call me back later
this afternoon.  I started getting ready to go out and help Bob but I didn’t
feel the best so I laid down on the couch in the sun room.  Mae came in and
read me an article and while she was reading I fell asleep.  She let me sleep
for over an hour.  I then helped Bob load some more junk on the pickup.  While
he was sorting through things I cleaned our water distiller.  Bob and I took
the trash up to the dumps.  Mae made a batch of bread and had hot home made
bread when we got back.  She had me come in and she had a hot slice ready for
me.  It was really good bread.  I finished the distiller and then came in for
dinner with hot scones and soup to eat.  This evening Brother Thompson came
Home Teaching to us.  Mae worked on the budget for a while.  I turned the TV on
and found a show that we watched.  I filled in this journal entry and we went
to bed about 10:30 PM.  We are trying to get some wheat sprouts growing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7:30 but let Mae sleep in as she left me a note telling me that she had not
been able to go to sleep until after 2 AM.  I read my scriptures and then
worked on the computers.  I down loaded the pictures that mark had taken with
our camera and made him a copy of them.  Bob came down and wants to go to Salt
Lake to find shelf.  It was after 2 PM when we got back.  I finished pricing
RaNae Barney’s job and printed of a copy for her.  We were to meet Irven and
Sandy at 5 PM so we took the price list over to RaNae on our way.  She would
like me to build the shed.  We went out to eat with Irven and Sandy and then
came back to their place and played games until 11:30 PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM and Mae got up right after that.  Mae went to the Temple with the Relief
Society Sisters.  I slept for another ½ hour and then got up.  After showering
and shaving I fixed some breakfast.  I called RaNae and told her that I could
start on her shed on Monday.  I helped Bob take some trash to the dumps.  We
also took the motor scooter up and left it there.  When we got home we started
loading more trash.  I was surprised that Bob had more trash and now would have
to make another trip.  We could have loaded more before we made the trip. 
While we were loading the trash I realized that my eye glasses had fallen out
of my pocket.  After looking for them I am quite sure that they must have
fallen out at the dumps with the last trip.  There would be no use to go back
to look for them.  I went shopping at Sportsman Warehouse to buy equipment for
our fishing trip this next week.  I also bought an electrical cord for the Chee
machine.  This evening I watched a show on TV.  Mae tended Connor for David and
Shauna this evening as they were taking Emily out to a special program for her
Birthday.  Tyler went with another friend and his family to some other event. 
Connor was really cute and enjoyed the undivided attention that Mae was able to
give him.  Mae had bought him some chicken nuggets and I saw just one setting
on the cupboard getting cold.  It was just getting cold and I was cleaning up
the cupboard from some mess that I had made while repairing the Chee machine. 
I just ate the chicken nugget with out thinking.  A little while later Connor
said “Where is my Chicken nugget?”  He almost cried when I told him that I had eaten
it.  Mae satisfied him by making him a hot dog.  It was 9:15 PM when David and
Shauna came back to get Connor.  I tried to visit and watch the end of the show
at the same time.  They left just as the show ended and while saying goodbye to
them I missed the end of the show.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until almost 8 AM although I had got up a couple of times and used the bathroom
and read my scriptures.  We showered and then went back to bed and watched the
BYU channel with the Tabernacle Sunday broadcast, BYU Idaho devotional with
President Monson and then another special fireside on being perfect parents. 
That was sure good.  It was then time to go to church.  Priesthood and Sunday
school were very enjoyable and for the Sacrament program we had the Primary put
on the program.  Bob invited us for dinner and that as always was very good. 
This evening Mae made up invitations for our grandchildren for a Christmas
party and I worked on my journal.  Bob gave me an old pair of eye glasses but I
think that Mae’s work a little bit better although neither will do for long.  I
made Mae some labels for her letters and printed them off.  I made them on the
Microsoft Word program this time as we have been using Word Perfect program. 
We will try to watch a short family DVD before going to bed.  We put on some of
our Family DVD’s that Mike had made for us then we put on the first of three
DVD’s that David had made for up.  He had found a man that could convert our
old 8 millimeter home movies to DVD.  We got through about ½ of the first DVD
and quite for tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up just
before 5:30 AM but let Mae sleep longer.  I had to get my trailer ready and
tried to get to RaNae Barney’s shortly after 8 AM.  However I stopped at
Bryce’s to see about getting a pair of glasses from him.  It always takes
longer than I had planned on when I stop and visit with Bryce.  It was 8:50 AM
when I got to RaNae’s.  RaNae took off today from work to help me.  Bryce came
over for a few minutes but they were looking at real estate today.  I stopped
for a quick lunch and worked until almost 5 PM.  We got the railroad ties laid
to use as a footing, the flooring laid and one wall framed.  Mae had me stop at
Bryce’s and get some potatoes that Kim had sent down for the Thanksgiving
dinner.  Again it took longer than I planned on.  Mae had dinner ready when I
got home.  I then took a shower and changed into my suit.  Mae went with me and
we visited Sister Fallis.  Bob and I couldn’t visit her the other night because
she didn’t feel comfortable having us visit with Brother Fallis away.  I filled
in my journal and I think we are going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up
before the alarm went off at 5:30 AM.  Mae got up a little later and made
breakfast and my lunch.  I was up to RaNae’s at 8 AM.  Bryce came up later and
worked with me most of the day.  We would have had the walls all up and sheeted
but about 4 AM my stapler quite working.  We cleaned up the tools and I took
the gun to Air-O-Fasteners.  They will check it out in the morning.  It was
after 6 PM when I got home because of evening traffic.  Mae soon had a nice
dinner ready of tuna casserole, baked squash and hot parker house rolls just
out of the oven.  Mae baked over 6 dozen rolls for the Holiday.  After eating I
showered and shaved.  Larry Saez came this evening and explained to
supplemental insurance programs to us and we elected to change to Altius
Insurance Company.  I talked with David and with Jeff about our fishing trip on
Friday.  We soon went to bed after I entered this journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked up
at RaNae’s all day today.  Bryce came up and helped me.  With his help I was
able to finish the shed.  I rented a staple gun from Universal Rental to finish
stapling the siding and to lay the sheathing on the roof.  I used every shingle
that was bought in order to cover the roof plus I had some ridge shingles for
the ridge.  It was dark when I went home.  Mae had some dinner for me and then
we prepared the turkey for cooking.  We watched a show on TV before going to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got the
turkey started cooking about 6 AM in the roaster set at 325 degrees.  I covered
the cooker with aluminum foil, then put on the lid and then covered the cooker
with a bath towel.  The turkey was about 18 lb. and was stuffed with dressing. 
It cooked until 11 AM when we went up to the church house to finish preparing
for dinner.  Mae and I also prepared our pressure cooker full of peeled
potatoes which we cooked at the church.  I used a new mixing beater and my
heavy drill to mash the potatoes after they were cooked.  All the family’s
brought dinner items and we started dinner about 1 PM.  We had all the Glendon
and Mildred Porter in attendance except for Terry’s family and a few from our
family.  I believe that the count was 68 out of 82.  we had a good day.  Many
of the family joined in some volleyball games.  Our son David hurt his leg
quite badly from landing on it wrong.  We are not sure if it sprained, torn ligament
or a break.  He stayed off it the rest of the day and had to be helped to his
car when he left.  I think his big concern it our fishing trip tomorrow.  We
were tired when we finished cleaning up and got home.  We had to bring things
in and put them away so we were very tired when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We couldn’t
sleep in very long as we have our sons and their family’s coming for dinner
today.  Mae cooked a ham adding parker house rolls and dish’s that our
Daughter-in-laws brought along with some leftovers from yesterday to it.  After
dinner Jeff and Scott went shopping for groceries while Mike and David drove
down to Murray where they rented a RV for my four sons’, plus David and Tyler
and my self to use to go on a fishing trip.  It was almost 4 PM when my sons
and I left for Idaho.  Mae kept all of our Grand children at our place for a
sleep over and Christmas party.  We stopped in Idaho Falls and bought fishing licenses
and then drove on to the Palisades reservoir.  We went fishing at the spillway
from the electrical turbines.  My grandson David is the only one that didn’t
fish tonight.  We all had good luck fishing and brought back several large
trout.  The trip up was very enjoyable with all of us able to be in one
vehicle.  We slept quite well and the RV was warm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and when we got up we prepared breakfast.  Today was spent visiting, playing
games and watching videos.  Some of us took naps.  I got on the bed above the
cab and took a nap.  I was woke with my leg cramping.  I jumped up and hit my
head on the ceiling.  Mike and David had to pull me off the bed and lower me to
the floor where I could walk the cramp out.  This evening we went out fishing
again.  However Jeff and Scott didn’t go out.  Again all of us caught fish. 
Tyler caught the largest fish which was over 21 inches and weighed about three
pounds. David released of the fish that he and Tyler caught this evening.  I
think this was a problem with Tyler and he soon wanted to quite and go to the
RV.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Again to day
was spent relaxing and being together as fathers and sons.  The weather was
very cooled today with a wind so we didn’t spend very much time out of the RV. 
Although we didn’t attend church meetings we did enjoy visiting, playing games
and being together.  It was especially interesting to me to see the very
distinct different between each of my sons.  It sure makes me realize that we
each bring our personalities with us when we come to this earth.  David Mike
and Jeff had planned on fishing this evening but by late afternoon they changed
their minds and we headed for home.  After unpacking the RV and most heading on
for homes, Mike and I flayed and packaged the fish.  We brought home about 17
fish.  It was good to be in our warm and clean home.  I reflected several times
on the handcart pioneers that we caught in the winter cold in Wyoming.  They
had no RV to get into to get dried off, get warm or even enough food to give
them strength.  I am very concerned with the future of our country in the next
few years and can not help hoping that we are not out in the winter cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and when we got up I cooked two fish and some hash brown potatoes for
breakfast.  Bryce called and is laying some tile and wanted to borrow some
tools.  I had Mae take them to him while I cleaned the RV before returning it. 
I drove to RV to Murray and met David and Mike there.  we turned the RV in and
then David took Mike and I out to lunch where we figured out the expenses of the
trip and divided them out.  As I drove back home I got very sleepy so I pulled
off the road in Bountiful and parked for a while to take a nap.  When I got off
the freeway in Clearfield I went on down to Randy and Judy’s and got some house
plans from them to figure a heat system for them.  Mae has been cleaning and
changing the decorations in the house from Thanksgiving to Christmas.  I helped
her put some things away.  We ate diner and watched a pretty good show on TV.  We
did some loving and then Mae got up to send messages to out sons.  I fell
asleep and Mae was on the computer for some time.  She woke me and so I
showered.  As I have got behind on my journal entries I stayed up and entered
the last six days into my journal.  It is now 1:35 Tuesday morning and I am
tired so will go back to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I played a
couple of games on the computer before going to bed.  Good night!  I slept
until 8 am, so after 9 before I finished breakfast.  Bob &amp; I went over to
Home Depot and got the materials to put insulation into the attic.  It took us
until 12:30 before we got the materials picked up.  We ate some lunch and then
went to work on insulating the attic.  Mae went to Chuck A Rama in Bountiful
where she met her cousin, Joanne, for lunch.  We worked until 7:00.  We finally
gave up because my legs were cramping and my knees were hurting.  Mae cut my
hair and then I took a shower.  Scott called to say their water heater is going
out and wondered what to do.  I told him to light the pilot and if it kept
running all night then we would wait until I get back from Idaho to put in a
new one, but if it doesn’t I will need to pick up a new one at Durk’s in the
morning and install it for them before Mae &amp; I leave for Idaho.  We had a
light supper and then I had to sleep in the recliner since I had eaten so
late.  Mae rubbed my feet first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up so
that Bob and I could get started with the insulation shortly after 7 AM.  it
was after 10 AM when we finished and then had to clean up some.  It was 11:30AM
when we got away for Idaho.  I sure enjoyed having Mae with me.  When we got to
Victor we stopped and went through the home that we use to live in.  It was
fairly much the same as it was when we lived there.  We then drove around town
as I reminisced of days gone by.  We stopped at Craig &amp; Carla’s and then
went out to their new house.  On the way we stopped at Subway and ate.  It was
about 7:30 PM when we came back to Craig and Carla’s.  I had to call Bob and
have him call Brother Higgley as I will not be able to go to the Deseret
Industries in the morning to work.  I just got too many things going and forgot
this assignment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, November 29, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
left the house just after 7 AM.  We stopped and bought a power meter before
going to the house.  I worked on getting the base board heater installed and
hooking up all the other heat circuits that had not been ready when I came up
before.  When I was ready to fire the boiler it wouldn’t light.  I called Tec Support
at ECR International.  After visiting with a Tec representative we got the unit
to fire and it heated up the water.  A leak initially showed just a few inches
from the boiler.  I took the pipes apart, cleaned the joints and then
re-soldered.  I re-fired the boiler and after it got up heat another joint in
the manifold began to leak.  Again I shut the boiler down and repaired the
leak.  With the water spraying around, I got wet and cold.  I ran the boiler
for quite a while and tested the potable hot water heater.  It worked very
well.  Craig’s son-in-law, Peter, was here doing some wiring so he said that he
would keep watch on the system while he was here and then would shut it down. 
We came back to Craig and Carla’s and cleaned up and went to a play at Pierre’s
Play House and watched a the Christmas Carol.  Craig was in the play and this
was a dress rehearsal, so we got in free with Craig’s invitation.  It was very
enjoyable.  We soon went to bed after returning to the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, November 30, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early hoping to get things running but again this morning the boiler would not
fire.  I called the Tec and he walked me through some test.  The transformer is
burned out so we need a complete new rheostat.  After a few calls I got one on
order on Over-Night delivery.  I took a nap this afternoon.  Peter came by so
he and I went out to the house and did more checking of the boiler problems as
we were concerned that the electric starter may have been damaged.  We could
not be sure but it look like the starter is ok.  When I got back to Craig and
Carla’s Mae and I played a couple of games of Rummy.  After dinner this evening
Carla worked with us on Family History.  </span></p>
