<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had left my
glasses in the bedroom so when I got up I was unable to read my scriptures.  We
went up to Jennies and spent 4 hours there.  The tests show that I am doing
quite a bit better.  We stopped at a Sub-Way and bought lunch and then went to
a class about nursing home care and how to protect our assets.  Mae and I
signed up to go into a meeting with this group on Thursday morning at 8 AM.  When
we got back home the man from the com-cast cable TV was here hooking up Bob’s
cable.  We can get high speed internet through Comcast now for $33 a month but
I have to buy another unit first.  This evening was frustrating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4
AM with my c-pack mask giving me problems so I removed it.  I was afraid of
waking Mae so after using the bathroom so I slept in the big chair in the front
room.  I got up at 6 AM and studied for ½ hr. before getting Mae up.  The
installed for my carport called and will not be able to install it today.  I
went to the missionary’s apartment and help them with transfers at 9 AM.  I
took Elder Levett to the church in Clearfield where he is to receive his new
companion.  Elder Levett said that he didn’t know how long this would take so
if he needed more help he would call me.  I had just got home when Elder Levett
called and said they were ready to come back.  After bringing the Elders back
to their home I went over to Jeff and Gail’s with my computer and drew on their
plans.  Just after 4 PM the carport installer called and said they were now
ready to install my carport this evening.  I packed up my things and then went
to Peterson’s Marina and got my boat.  I got home just after the installers got
to our place.  They were through with the building by 8 PM and although they
got it on the footing a little crooked it looks good.  Bob help me park my boat
and camp trailer inside the carport and the snowmobiles to the side of the
carport.  Time went fast and before I could get my journal entry typed up today
it was 10 PM.  Good night!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke early
as we have an appointment in Ogden at 8 AM.  We met with Jeffrey Brown and Glen
Hampton and discussed a program that might help us if either of us should go
into a nursing home.  Mae when to Provo to attend the Women’s Conference, after
our appointment.  I got gas and then came on home.  Mark and I went shopping
for tomato plants.  I also bought two Lilac bushes for a gift to Mae for
Mother’s Day.  I then took Mark shopping for some groceries.  I had a Doctors
appointment to see Dr. Jenson at 1:30 PM and I then came home and planted the
tomato plants and the lilac bushes.  I didn’t do much else this evening except
eat and watched two shows on TV.  The Comcast installer came and repaired some
of our problems with our TV reception.  Mae called me about 9 PM and we talked
for a few minutes.  It was almost mid-night when I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was 8 AM
when I got up this morning.  By 8 I got a light breakfast and made some phone
calls.  I worked on Jeff and Gail’s plans for about an hour when Bob brought a
reprehensive from Barlow Heating to give us a bid for replacing the furnace and
adding central air.  It was after 1 when I returned to my computer.  I had not
saved my work and the battery ran low and the computer shutdown and I lost my
earlier work.  I decided to fill the jugs with water and while the first one
was filling I got distracted and let it overflow.  I got my wet vac and cleaned
up my mess.  I also cleaned the distiller which took some time.  At 3 PM Bob
invited me up for dinner of fried chicken and potatoes.  I worked a while
longer on the plans and then went to the Wedding Reception of Amber Stevenson
and Timothy Eldredge.  I was not impressed with Timothy when he was wearing a
tee shirt in the wedding line which read “now the fun is over”.  I had gone
over with Scott and Mishelle and the children.  I visited with several that I
know from the Ward.  Mae got home shortly after I did.  I got home about 8:30
PM and turned the TV on to see the debate of Rocky Anderson and -------, but it
wasn’t on TV.  Mae came home and we watched “Law and Order” before getting
ready for bed.  I filled in my journal before going to bed also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and studied for a while.  Mae finally got up and asked why I was up so
early.  I guess I read the clock wrong because I thought it was after 8 AM and
it wasn’t even 7 yet.  Bob had us up for breakfast this morning.  Time goes by
so fast that before I realized it, it was after noon.  At 3 PM Mae and I
started to watch the movie “The Great Escape”.  We turned it off at 5 PM and
went down to Salt Lake and attended a Constitutional meeting.  It lasted 3
Hours but was very good and very disturbing.  I left very depressed and
concerned as we came home.  Mae read from the book “The 5000 Year Leap” as I
drove which is along the same information.  When we got home we finished the
movie.  I would have liked to cutely with Mae and tried to forget the rest of
the world but Mae was too tired so we went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
and got right on the computer with e-mails.  She also read while working on the
computer so she got something done.  With the thoughts of last nights meeting
and reading the words of Isaiah’s words as I studed this morning I was again in
a depressed mood.  I worked on my journal for a few minutes before Church but
Bob came down and interrupted that time.  Nursery was busy today and I was
tired when we finished with the two hours.  Testimony meeting was good, Mae took
opportunity to bear her testimony today.  We went to Jeff and Gail’s for dinner
and then we played a game of Harts.  Mae lost the game.  We planned a family
get to gather for next Saturday for all our family that can come.  Mae called
the children after we got home to see if they can come on Saturday.  I finished
getting the entries into my March journal of the days we were on our trip to
Israel.  That has been quite a job and I now need to have Mae read over it for
corrections and additions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6:30 AM.  I tried to read and study from 2<sup>nd</sup> Nephi but found
my understanding of Isaiah is very shallow.  My mind is continual reflecting on
the class we attended Saturday evening.  I find my mind in a very depressed
concern over what has happened to our country.  I also find I have a shallow
understanding of many things in life.  I am concerned as to what we should be
planning in the near future.  Special concerns continually hunt me about my
children and what I taught them.  Bob came down and said that he was cooking
waffles and ask me to call him when we were ready for some.  We ate about 9
AM.  I got upset as we are not to eat bananas or yogurt and I am not to eat
honey.  I got upset and about left the table.  We went into Ogden to the
dentist at 10:30 AM.  We both had our teeth cleaned but the rest seams to be
ok.  I worked the rest of the afternoon on Jeff and Gail’s house plans.  Mae
had her hair cut and colored this afternoon.  I took time to pop some corn for
this evening.  When Mae got home we got things together and went up to Kim’s in
Morgan.  Kim had cooked salmon with Mae and Georgia bringing salad, vegetable
and potatoes.  Diner was very good, we then had a short Family Home Evening and
then played a game of Mormon Bridge.  It was a fun evening and good to get
together but we did miss Jeanenne not being there.  She had gone to Virginia
where Charity and Brian lives.  It was almost 11 PM when we got home.  I filled
in my journal entry before going to bed.  Good night!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
went walking before breakfast.  We walked down the new path that has just been
installed on the old Southern Pacific railroad track right-a-way between 1300
N. and 800 N.  It is very pretty, shady and quite.  We sure enjoyed it.  After
breakfast I worked on Jeff &amp; Gail’s plans.  Gail brought Benji over at noon
for Mae to tend this afternoon.  I suggested that we should go boating this
afternoon.  We invited Jeff and Gail to go with us.  I helped Mark with the
garden for a while this afternoon.  Bob helped me get Irven and Sandy’s truck
and car from in front of my boat cover.  This makes it much easer to get thing
in and out.  I got the boat ready to go and then went up to get gas for the
boat.  I then went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and bought chicken for us to eat
while boating.  It was 6 PM before we got away but the traffic was light on the
freeway so we made it in good time.  We boated for a couple of hours and had a
very enjoyable evening.  The water was completely calm and beautiful.  When we
got home Mae helped guide me back into the cover.  Sandi called and visited
with Mae for a while.  I made this journal entry and then we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early as we needed to be at the Davis Hospital by 8:15 AM.  It was 9:30 AM when
they took me into the procedure room.  The Anesthesiologist told me that I
might feel the medication moving into my arm, which I did and I remember the
nurse putting a piece into my mouth so I couldn’t bit down but that is the last
I remember until I woke up 1 ½ hours later.  When I felt like it and redressed
Mae drove me home.  We ate a light breakfast and then I took a nap.   I worked
on Jeff and Gail’s plans for a few minutes and then we went into Ogden where we
met with the attorneys that are setting up our living will, out truss and a
plan for us to follow if either or both of us spend time in a nursing home.  We
stopped at Sportsman Warehouse and got some fishing equipment.  We also went to
Wal-Mark and bought some garden supplies.  Mae fixed some super and then Bob
and I went Home Teaching.  The Fallis’s were not home when we got there.  Mae
was busy and I didn’t feel like going to bed so I turned a movie on and we
watched the “Horse Soldier.”  We have seen it before but it was still good.  I
discouraged me because of the realization that we lost a lot of the
constitutional right at that time.  Also there were a lot of lives lost because
of the desire for money.  Anyway I went to bed depressed.  I seem to be doing
that more often lately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  I helped Mae clean up the house for her book club this evening. 
I got the boat ready to go this afternoon.  It was about 1 PM when Jeff called
and said he was on the way home.  I finished helping Mae and then left.  I had
to go to Winegar’s where I got some ice.  I also went to the Credit Union and
got a copy of a check that went through wrong.  The boat came off the hitch but
remained with the truck because of the safety chains.  No damage was done so
that was lucky.  I picked up Jeff and we went out to Willard Bay.  On the way
we bought some Sub-Way sandwiches for this evening.  As we were going out into
the lake I decided to wipe down some of the boat that was dirty.  I leaned over
to get a towel wet and as I did my palm fell out of my pocket into the water. 
It sunk like a rock.  That didn’t make for a happy trip.  Again the water was
quite calm and we enjoyed using David’s wake board.  Jeff is quite good on it
and the boat pulled him just fine.  I tried using them and after 4 or 5 tries
did get up but then tipped the nose down and it was all over.  We tried fishing
but didn’t have any luck but I never have on that lake.  Jeff went out on the
wake board again.  We did some boating for a while before we came in and loaded
the boat up and came home.  It was 10:15 PM when I got home.  Mae said her book
group went well and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. I filled in my journal
and then showered before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and went into Ogden to meet with the attorneys on our truss, living will
and how to get our money secure if we need to go into a nursing home.  We then
went down to U-Haul Concrete and took the receipts to them as they had charged
us double for the concrete we bought for the boat shed.  We then went over to
see Jeff sanding the sheetrock.  It worked pretty good but doesn’t replace
skilled labor.  We came home and I took a short nap.  I started up the
snowmobiles and found that when Jeff and Trent had taken them out they didn’t
fill them back up on gas.  I took them down to a station and filled them along
with adding some fuel stabilizer to the gas.  I went to the Credit Union and
transferred $30,000 into our checking account to cover the check we opened a
investment on our program this morning.  We lost some because of early with
drawl but it should be covered because of a bonus given for opening the
investment.   I spent some time working on water storage and went to Durk’s for
advice.  I also bought me a new palm at Staples.  I was giving Staples a hard
time and told them their warranty didn’t cover the drowning of my Palm but they
told me that if I could bring the old one back to them it would be covered.  I
talked to Mark about the water storage also about putting a water distribution
system on the garden for him.  Irven and Sandy are having problems with their
garage door opener but by the time I called them one of their neighbors found
that the motor is burned out.  Mae has been preparing for our family to come
tomorrow.  After entering this entry we watched part of a movie on DVD, “The
Bridge on the River Kwai”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae gave me a
hair cut this morning before I showered.  I dug the grass from around Mae’s
rose bush and added some fertilizer and insect killer to the soil.  I went to
the store and bought some Tire Fix, starter fluid, ice, Kraft Single cheese and
some cat repellant.  I got the motor scooter running, sprayed the area that we
want to discouraged the cat from using, repaired the doll house, got tables and
chair set up, watered the tomatoes and helped Mae get ready for this
afternoon.  David and the children came came about 2:30 PM.  Then Scott,
Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley came.  Shauna came from a bridle shower.  Mike and
his family came next and Jeff and Gail we last getting here.  We played games
and road the scooter.  I think it was Tyler that tipped over on the scooter and
after that we couldn’t get the scooter to run.  We cooked chicken, hot dogs and
hamburgers for dinner.  Everyone brought food and we had a good meal.  Bob
helped me and we worked on the scooter for better than a hour but was unable to
get it repaired.  It was about 9 PM when all the children left for their
homes.  I wrote in my journal and we quite for the night.  Mike got my new Palm
reloaded.  We were so tired that we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 AM and found that Mae hadn’t slept much last night.  I had her go back to
bed and I went with Irven and sandy to Salt Lake where we attended the Central
Ward that Cheryl belongs to.  Cheryl has been asked to be the secretary of the
new Relief Society Presidency.  The Relief Society Presidency was also asked to
speak today in Sacrament meeting.  This will e the first time that Cheryl has
ever spoken in church.  We went down to support her.  She as well as all the
Sisters gave very good talks.  The President quoted from Sister Cherri Duke who
said that we mistakenly think that a mother is some one that has given birth to
a child, but when Adam called the woman that the Lord had given him Eve, the
Lord asked him why he called her Eve.  Adam responded that she was the Mother
of all living.  Adam and Eve were at this time in the Garden of Eden and had no
children.  Sister Duke said that a mother is a woman that loves, helps,
nurtures and directs another.  That was a new thought to me.  after the meeting
we said goodbye to  Cheryl and then went up to the University Hospital to see
if we could find Bruce and Mitchelan but was unsuccessful at that.  We came
back home.  I had a little lunch and then Mae and I went to church.  We had 10
children today in the nursery but even then it kept us busy.  I was sure sleepy
during Sacrament meeting.  I did wake up during Bishop Smith’s talk.  After
meeting I took Mae out to dinner.  Mae got lots of flowers for Mothers Day as I
gave her two Lilac bushes, also a bunch of assorted cut flowers, Cheryl gave us
a plant for Mae and Carroll from her Ward, our Ward gave out flowers to the Mothers
and Shellie, Mike, David and Jeff bought her a large planter box of flowers. 
Scott &amp; Mishelle gave Mae some hand made jewelry.  We watched the end of
our movie tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke a
little before 7AM but Mae was already up.  Bob came down and visited for a
while.  We ate breakfast and then went for a walk.  As we got back home the
Elders called and asked if I could drive them to the Mission Home for some
supplies they needed.  They were quite excited as they found 7 new
investigators that are looking very promising.  I spent most of the afternoon
getting supplies to install some water storage tanks and also a water
distribution system for the garden.  Sandi came out this afternoon and had
dinner with us.  She had to come out herself as Nick had games to cover and was
playing in one this evening.  Sandi had to leave by 8 PM but it was good to
visit with her for 2 to 3 hours.  Mae had made a nice dinner of corn beef
patties.  This evening we watched a show on TV.  Anyway I did as Georgia called
and visited with Mae most of the evening.  It was after 11 PM when we started
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When I got up
I had in mind that I would get more work done on Jeff and Gail’s plans.  I then
decided to put the water distribution system together and that took me until
noon.  Carroll prepared lunch of cabbage casserole for us and it was good.  I
took a 20 minute nap and then I decided that I needed to get some spraying done
so I sprayed the weeds in the driveways,  I then sprayed around the fence
lines, cleaned out the sprayer and then sprayed the fruit trees.  I came in,
showered and cleaned up before Brother and Sister Steel came to have dinner
with us.  We had a very enjoyable evening with them.  They left at 7 PM as we
had an appointment with Bryant Holt.  Irven and Sandy also came over.  Bryant
discussed a funeral plan with Sereni Care funeral services provider.  The price
for the services were more than just completive but about 1/3 the price of the
other providers.  It was 11 PM when we finished and then I filled in my
journal.  It is again very late when we got to bed.</span></p>

much longer.  I worked most of the day on Jeff and Gail’s house plans.  This
evening Bob and I worked on the sprinkler heads trying to get better water
coverage.  At 8 PM I came in and set down and watched a movie on TV.  Mae went

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
7:30 AM and got thinking about the investment change we made in connection with
the Nursing Home program we set up and became concerned.  I made some calls and
things seem to be ok.  We hope!  Bryant Holt came this morning at 9 AM and we
sing for the Pre-Planed and Pre-Paid Funeral Arrangement program that we
discussed with him Tuesday evening.  At 9:30 AM we met with Dr. Jensen to
discuss the results of the test I had last week.  The lab said that there are
no signs of cancer so we were excited at that.  Dr. Jensen discussed the
possibility of having an operation to reposition the esophagus and stomach but
we will wait on that as there is no urgent need at this time.  We went over to Robin
Walker’s and I got the stove to light but wasn’t able to find the problem with
the hot water heater.  We then went into the Ogden Temple and went through a
session.  After that we ate dinner in the cafeteria.  When we got home we
watched the show “The Guns of Navaron” on DVD.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7 AM.  Bob came down and ask if we wanted waffles for breakfast.  Of
course there was no questions about that.  At 9 AM Bob had a salesman come and
give a price of a new furnace and A/C unit.  It was much cheaper that the other
quote that we got and Bob and Carroll decided to have it installed.  The will
come next Wednesday to install it.  Mae and I went walking to Albertsons for
our exercise today.  That is about 2 and ½ miles round trip.  We did stop and
eat a sandwich at Albertsons and bought a few other groceries along with
getting some material copied for Primary.  I worked the rest of the afternoon
on Jeff and Gail’s plans.  About 5:30 PM David and Shauna brought Tyler, Emily
and Connor to us as we are going to tend them this weekend.  After dinner Mae
took the children across the street to the park and let them play for a while. 
When they came back we put the show “Where the Red Fern Grows” on our TV in the
bedroom and all of us watched that show.  We got the children put down for the
night, I entered my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 7
AM and studied for a while.  We prepared breakfast and then went up to Mountain
Green for Tyler to play soccer.  David and Shauna also came to the game.  After
the game David went to town and got some sprinkler parts.  The rest of us went
to the Morgan park where we had lunch and played with the children.  We came
back to David and Shauna’s.  Shauna, Emily and Mae went back to Morgan for a
dress rehearsal for Emily’s singing group.  The boys and I stayed with David. 
I helped David do some repairs to his sprinkler system.  We stopped at Jeff’s
to see how he is doing with the spray painting but he wasn’t doing the best.  I
helped him some and agreed to help him on Wednesday evening.  Craig Sherman
call me a couple of times with questions as he is starting to lay out the lines
in the basement floor.  We stopped and got a pizza for dinner this evening. 
Mae let the children play in the water outside on the lawn before it got dark. 
Tyler and I played a game of chess.  We then watched some shows on TV before
going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7:30 AM before getting up and starting the day.  As I studied this
morning I couldn’t help but wonder what make each of us have different
personalities and faith in God.  The Children of Israel, as we are told, came
through the chosen linage but seem to be so rebellious.  There is so much to
learn after this life!  Mae made breakfast while Tyler and I played Fox &amp;
Geese.  We then played a game of chess.  Tyler played a very good game and
almost beat me.  David and Shauna came for the children about noon.  We got to
the church about 12:45 PM and got set up for Primary.  We had 11 children in
the nursery today.  Sister Smith wasn’t there today so we had our hands full. 
It went well and Mae did very good with the lesson.  By the time we got into
Sacrament meeting I was beet.  I really didn’t get much out of the meeting as I
fell asleep several times.  Bob invited us up for dinner.  He had prepared a
very nice dinner.  Irven and Sandy came over this evening.  Mae and Sandy
discussed the Constitutional Party while Irven and I played a couple of games
of Dominoes.  It was 11 PM when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had
someone call us at 2 AM.  by the time I got to the phone they had hung up.  It
woke both of us and then we couldn’t go back to sleep.  I finally went into the
front room and slept in the recliner.  We didn’t get up until 9 AM.  it was
raining most of the day so we didn’t go walking.  I spent most of the day
working on Jeff and Gail’s plans.  This evening we went to Bountiful and ate
dinner with the Clark’s.  it was a very enjoyable evening and the Clarks have
us thinking about another mission call.  It was 11 PM when we got home.  I
filled in my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7:30 AM but Mae wasn’t in bed.  She had been up a lot during the night and what
sleep she got was in the recliner.  I had her go back to bed and sleep longer. 
I worked on our banking accounts.  Mae got up about 9 AM.  After breakfast we
went for a walk.  This afternoon and also some during the evening I worked on
Jeff and Gail’s house plans.  At 7 PM we watched a show on the Hallmark channel
called “What I Do For Love”.  It was a cute show and has been on the channel
several times but we had never seen it.  I have been looking for information
that I had been sent by companies that manufacture Styrofoam blocks.  Oh well I
will look tomorrow.  Mae has been working on picture books most of the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, May 23, 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
pretty good last night so woke feeling ok.  I am trying to reread Isaiah in 2
Nephi but still didn’t get very much out of it today.  We understood that the
company was coming to install a new furnace with central air and a humidifier
but they couldn’t make it so our preparation wasn’t needed for today.  We ate
breakfast and then went for a walk.  It was late because of the time preparing
for the furnace company.  I did look for the material that I couldn’t find last
night and found some of it.  What happened to the rest I do not know?  We saw
Brother Knutson working on a neighbor yard and when we talked to him it was
part of a Ward project.  We hadn’t heard of it as we are in the nursery and
usually don’t hear the announcements for the Priesthood or Relief Society. 
When we got back I thought I could get a short letter off about the Styrofoam
building block.  At the same time I tried to get some papers scanned that I
found while looking for the other papers.  Part way through the computer froze
up and I lost all my work.  I just quit and went down to help Brother Knutson
but by the time I got there he was finished.  I felt that this morning was a
bad start.  I took the boat and camper over to Wasatch Trailers to get their
advice on the sway problem.  He feels that the boat needs to be in front of the
trailer to work properly.  The hitch system to do that would be very expensive
so I probably will not have it done.  When I got home I worked on the boat
trailer fixing the skid bars so they will not turn sideways when we load the
boat.  I hope this will solve that problem.  We went over to Jeff and Gail’s
where we had dinner and then Jeff and I painted the inside of his garage.  Jeff
paid me $25 to help him but he didn’t realize that I spent over $25 for a new
tip for my paint sprayer.  Oh well!  It was almost 11 PM when we got home so I
wrote this entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We understood
that the furnace co. was coming to install a new furnace and A/C so Mae spent
some time in the morning getting things ready for them to come.  We went for a
walk.  The rest of the morning seems to be one interruption to another until I
was quite frustrated and upset.  I went to Ray City RV and to Home Depot and
got some parts to do some repairs on our camp trailer.  I also stopped at
Sportsman’s Warehouse and got some fishing gear and bait.  Bob and I had a Home
Teaching appointment with Fallis’s this evening.  I gave them a call to see if
they were home but only got the answering machine.  I left a message and
continued to work on the camp trailer.  When Fallis’s got home they called and
we went down and visited with them.  I came back and worked quite late on the
tent trailer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Randy and I went
fishing at East Canon Reservoir this morning.  We had a good day and both had
our limit and was off the lake by 11 AM.  When I got home the furnace co. was
here installing the new furnace.  We tried to pull an electrical line and a
water line down a abandoned vacuum line.  We spent over 2 hours trying with out
suggest.  I finally realized that they didn’t need the electrical line to the
furnace room but to the outside compressor.  It took two of us about ½ hour to
run the new line.  Jeff called and asked if I would be interested to go flying
with Nolan this evening.  He also asked if I would bring our projection
equipment and suggested that we watch a movie by projecting it onto the garage
wall.  Nolan took me up in his ultra light plane. We flow from the Morgan
Airport across the mountain to the monastery, then across Ogden Valley to Eden
then back across the reservoir to Snow Basin and back to the airport.  We saw
several deer, some pelicans and a young moose.  It was a great flight and I
felt very comfortable with Nolan fighting it.   After Nolan and I returned I
set up the projector.  Nolan brought his family and came over.  We watched the
movie “High Noon”.  It was mid-night when Mae and I got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up at
5 AM and went to the Temple with the Relief Society Sisters.  I slept until 8
AM before I got up.  Bob fried the fish I brought home yesterday and made
biscuits to go with them.  It made a great breakfast.  We had no hot water so I
worked on that for a while before I got that working.  Sandy and Mark also came
and got most of their Snowie equipment so they could clean it up.  They may
have a person that wants it.  When Mark and Sandy came over they had trouble
getting the truck to start so Bob helped them with that.  When they were ready
to leave, Mae came in and said that their truck wasn’t running very well.  I
went out and found that it was almost out of transition fluid.  I added two
quarts of oil to get it to register on the dip stick and then checked the water
level and had to add some antifreeze to the radiator.  It seems to be running
ok when they left.  I tried to re-run the TV cable down the abandoned vacuum
line but again was unsuccessful.  I didn’t get a cable ran in be cause I ran
out of time.  At 3 PM we finished loading the car and went to the Morgan
Cemetery.  We were soon joined by Sandi, JaNae and her children and Chelci,
Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley soon came.  Several from Georgia’s family and
their children came; several of Bryce’s family came as well as Kim, Jeanne,
Koleesee, Summer and Daniel.  We spent about 1 ½ hours at the cemetery
decorating the graves and visiting.  Most of us then went down to the Morgan
City Park where we ate lunch, played games and continued visiting.  David,
Shauna and their children and Jeff, Gail and Benji joined us also.  We had a
wonderful time during the next 2 or 3 hours.  After all the rest packed up and
left Mae and I went for a walk along the river before we came home.  I tried to
write this journal entry but I was so tired that I kept falling asleep as I
tried to type and it was just one error after another so I quite and went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob prepared
waffles for breakfast and we sure enjoyed them.  Bob was concerned because the
new furnace is not working so I checked everything I could and finally after no
response from the emergency phone number I called the salesman that sold him
the furnace.  Soon the repairman on call called and said that he had been given
the call yesterday but he had received the wrong number and no one was
answering that number.  He was sorry and should be here by 1 PM.  I then came
downstairs and corrected the errors in my journal entry from last night and
finished it.  I then started this entry.  Mae has been playing a talk given by
Emily Watts entitled “How to Survive Your Greatest Blessings”.  It is sure a
good talk and good advice for all of us to try to follow.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The repairman
came and checked the furnace and found that the fuse had blown.  That fuse is
as old as the old furnace.  I had taken it out and checked it but when he took
it out he said it looked ok but then he tested it with a voltage meter and
found it bad.  We were happy that that was all it took.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
went to church and set up the nursery to try splitting the children into two
groups.  This is a trial as we are expecting several more children in the next
couple of months.  We are not sure how to handle that increase.  It went fairly
well.  We were sure tired by the time the two hours were over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had Scott
and his family over for dinner and the evening.  Mae cooked corn beet patties,
corn on the cob and then finished up with beach cobbler.  It was sure a good
meal and an enjoyable evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got about 6
AM and have been going all day.  I got the TV antenna wires reran so that all
TV are receiving very good reception.  I also got a water line pulled from the
basement to the garage so that I can install.  I had to go to Home Depot for
some parts so I also stopped at Sportsman Warehouse for worms.  I did some
repairs to the tent trailer and checked that everything with the trailer is
working ok.  I got gas for the truck and some parts to hook up some lights on
my truck.  The remainder of the evening I finished Jeff and Gail’s house plans
and got a e-mail sent to Quad-Lock Building Systems.  It was mid-night before I
finished and we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Being that it
was so late when we went to bed, we slept in.  Mae gave me a haircut before I
took my shower.  Bob prepared breakfast of biscuits and gravy for us.  We
didn’t visit long but started packing.  It was 11:50 AM when we finished
packing and left with the boat and trailer.  We stopped at Winegar’s for a few
groceries and some ice.  We then went to Valley Home Medical where they checked
my c-pack for me.  It seems to test out ok.  We stopped for some lunch at
Wendy’s and then drove to East Canon reservoir.  We can only drive 40 to 45 MPH
or the boat begins to sway but we weren’t in a hurry anyway.  When we got there
we selected the camp site and set up the trailer.  We then decided to go down
to the boat ramp and let Mae practice backing the boat in.  After three times
and she did pretty good we decided to take a boat ride.  We road to the South
end of the reservoir and back.  We then decided to fish for a little while.  We
each had strikes and hooked some but would loose them before they got to the
boat,  I switched to a dark gray and silver repalla and as we came into the
boat dock I caught a nice rainbow trout.  As we got back to the camp sight Tina
Linderman called just to talk to Mae.  She just needed someone to visit with. 
I did some repair work on the tent trailer.  Mae prepared some dinner but it
was so late when we ate that I had to sleep in the recliner.  We are sure glad
to have a heater in the tent trailer as it is quite cooled outside tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up until late.  I cooked breakfast of fish, potatoes and eggs.  It was 11 PM
when we ate.  Mae worked on her scrap books while I started a material take off
list on Jeff and Gail’s addition.  Mae called Shellie and visited with her and
the kids as the kids just returned from school.  Today was the end of school
for this year.  Mae made us some lunch.  After eating we went fishing about
5PM.  We each had several strikes but I caught three.  It was 9:30 PM when we
got back to camp.  We had a cup of hot Postum and ate some water melon while we
played a game of Racko before we went to bed.  It has been a very enjoyable day
even if Mae beat me in Racko. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM and went fishing.  Mae slept in and enjoyed a relaxing morning.  I caught 3
fish and let one go as it was to small.  We ate when I got back to camp.  I
worked on the truck running an electric wire with a switch and a indicator
light for extra backup lights on the pickup.  These will give me light when I
am hooking up boats and trailers at night.  We went down the road and found a
bush that I could cut winner sticks to use this evening.  I then shaved and
showered and cleaned up.  Shauna and the kids came up this afternoon shortly
after 5 PM.  We prepared and cooked hot dogs for dinner.  After cleaning up we
took the boat out fishing.  Mae backed the boat and trailer down the ramp and
did it perfectly.  We fished for quite a while but didn’t even get a bite this
evening.  Connor had a small fishing pole to play with but he dropped it over
the side of the boat and I sunk before we could retrieve it.  He felt bad but
Shauna assured him that they would buy him another one.  When we went to load
the boat Mae backed the trailer down the dock and did a pretty good job of it. 
When we got to camp we made pop corn, hot chocolate and Postum which we ate and
drank before we went to bed.</span></p>
