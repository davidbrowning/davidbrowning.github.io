<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had
planned on sleeping in but at 6 AM the alarm went off.  Mae jumped out of bed
and came around and shut it off.  She came back to bed and in just a minute it
again went off.  I had to remove the battery in order to stop it.  We did go
back to sleep for a while.  When I got up I was going to catch my journal up to
date.  My computer has been coming up with an indication that I needed to
update our Fire Wall protection.  I hooked up the phone line to the computer
and turned on the inter-net.  After starting the download it took up the
computer time until we finally had to get ready for church.  The nursery was
busy today and so when church was over we were beat.  The Relief Society Home
Making committee gave me a package of “EXTRA  Sugar Free Gum” with a note on it
that read “Just a note of Extra Special appreciation for the help you gave
us.”   We came home and I took our tithing back as we hadn’t brought our check
book with us.  Bob had us come upstairs and get some lunch as they had several
of their family come today.  We then went over to Jeff and Gail’s and ate
dinner with them.  Gail’s mother, Marci was also there.  After eating dinner we
played games.  We first played “Mormon Bridge” which Gail won that game.  Mae
and I were then taught how to play “Scum” and we had a good time playing it.  It
was late when we came home so soon went to bed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up until 8:45 AM and so was behind in getting started today.  I caught up my
journal and printed off my journal for the month of June.  It is hard to
believe that the year is already half over.  I weeded the garden and did some
irrigation in the garden and set the water trying to cover the lawn.  We did go
for a walk but other than that the day was gone.  We watched a movie this
evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up but I did go out to work by 9 AM.  I showed Mark how to spray the
garden.  I made some changes in the hoses so that Mark has a hose for the
garden, and we have two hoses for the lawn.  With the secondary water pressure
we are having trouble keeping the lawns green.  I was able to get the return
side of the manifold for Craig and Carla’s heat system but to gather.  I was
tired when I came in at 6:30 PM so I took a shower and watched a show on TV.  Mae
and I then went out and got a cooler, a folding table and umbrella for
tomorrow.  We rolled out the Big Mable tub so that it will dry out.  I filled
out my journal and while I did that Mae called and talked to Shellie.  We went
to bed shortly after 10 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had set the
alarm wrong and it didn’t wake us up.  We got up at 6 AM and had to hurry to
leave at 7:15 AM.  We went to David and Shauna’s and when they were ready we
went to Morgan.  We took a large awning of David and Shauna’s and it really
helped to be able to set in the shade.  We got a breakfast that was served
there at the park and then watched the first of the Championship baseball games
for the little league.  We just set on the bleachers to watch that game. 
Tyler’s team lost their first game.  After the first game we set us the
umbrella.  A friend of David’s, asked if his father could set under the shade
also and we invited his parents to join us.  It was fun getting to visit with them. 
Each game lasted two innings per game so the games were quite short.  David is
the assistant coach of Tyler’s team and has been the coach in the previous two
years but with his work assignment this year had to turn the coaches’ passion
over to another father.  He sure helped with the team anyway.  The team won the
next three games so it put them in the play off with the team that beat them
the first time.  The final game was a four inning game and both teams played
very well.  Tyler’s teem did well and won that game which made them the
Champions.  We enjoyed the games but were very glad we had the large umbrella
to shade us.  after the games were over we went back to David’s.  Mae and I
stopped at a Sub Way and got some lunch and enjoyed relaxing with just the two
of us for a few minutes.  We went into the Browning store and bought Mae two
tee shirts and me a hat.  Scott and his family got to David’s about the same
time we did.  They had brought a water slide the inflated with air.  The
children sure had fun with it.  Jeff, Gail, Benji, Mike, Becky, David, Tayler,
Mattie and Jessica also came.  David grilled steak burgers and chicken breasts
and everyone brought other salads.  We had a great time and in the evening we
all went back to the park where the ball games were held this morning and
watched fire works.  It was 11:30 PM when we got home and after mid-night by
the time I filled in this journal entry, so we were late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7:30 AM.  it was about 9:30 when I went outside to start work.  I
repaired a leak in our water storage system, tested the water pressure on our
secondary water and it is running between 50 &amp; 30 PSI.  That is not enough
to operate our sprinkler system.  I rolled up the Big Mabel Tub and put it
away.  Also put the folding chairs that we had out for the 4<sup>th</sup>
away.  I worked a little while on the heat system manifold but some parts are
still missing.  I called Bryant Holt about fishing tomorrow but he has family
coming in from Colorado so he can’t go tomorrow.  I greased the pickup and car,
also got new windshield wipers for the car.  I was concerned about getting all
I needed to do done and still go fishing tomorrow.  With Bryant changing plans,
I shouldn’t have very much to do tomorrow.  That was a good relief.  Mae and I
went walking this evening and I got an e-mail off to Toni before we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 A.M. with my back hurting so I did some stretch exercisers and lay on the
vertical table.  Mae and I rubbed each others feet.  We got ready and went for
a walk.  We walked two miles this morning.  Bob came down with waffles for
breakfast.  I decided that in as much as I wasn’t going fishing today I would
start on the remodeling of the sunroom.  The project grow as the day went on. 
At 2 PM Uncle Van and Aunt Allison came to visit.  We were excited to see them
but they did catch us in a mess.  Jeff and Gail had also brought Benji over for
us to tend.  He was a gem while Van and Allison were here.  They stayed a
couple of hours.  It was sure good to see them.  Scott had called last night to
see if I would put a awning on their house for them.  Mishelle called today to
say that the awning was the wrong size so they would continue to look.  They
called and ask about building just a framed awning.  I told them I would draw
one up and we would estimate the materials cost.  I cleaned up some of the
remodeling mess.  Mae took Benji for a walk while I cleaned up.  We drew the
design that Mishelle wanted and figured the materials. I will still need some
prices before we will know for sure.  They left about 9 PM so I am now writing
my journal entry before we go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got started
on the remodeling about 9 AM and worked all day.  Other than stopping for meals
and then I went over to Lowe’s to get a sheet of sheetrock and I stopped and
filled my truck with gas, I kept busy with the house.  It was 11 PM when we
quite and went to bed.  Mae has been busy and quite a bit of her time was getting
things ready for me to go fishing with Jeff and Mike.  In the morning she was
also busy tending Benji.  She took him with her in a stroller for her walk and
went over to the grocery store.  After getting her shopping done she called me
and I went over and got them.  Jeff and Gail came for Benji and stayed for
lunch and to visited but I kept working.  Although it was late when we went to
bed and we were tired we watched the movie “Big Country”.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up until 9 AM and if it hadn’t been for Mae I would have stayed longer.  When I
turned on my palm to study the scriptures this morning I realized that I had
forgotten that this morning at 7 AM was Stake Priesthood Meeting.   Mae fixed
food for my fishing trip, including making zucchini bread for me to take.  She
cooked boiled eggs and peeled them; she sliced the olives for us to add to our
salad, got grapes for us and even picked them off the stems.  She has packed my
clothes and bedding and has tried to think of every thing I will need on the
trip.  She made up a menu for our meals.  What a special wife!  She really
spoils me.  I wouldn’t be near ready to go on this trip if it wasn’t for her.  We
attended the block and had mainly younger children in the nursery today.  It really
kept us busy and we were tired when we went into Sacrament meeting.  Bob and
Carroll had dinner ready when we got home.  Mae helped me finish packing.  Just
before I left Jeff called and said that when he got to the camp sight that it
was closed due to a bear problem.  We got Mike on the phone with us and talked
of an alternative plan.  We decided to go to a stream that is up Thistle Cannon
and then turning North up Diamond Cannon.  We found a nice camp ground and set
up the tent trailer.  We popped some popcorn and played a game of “Kill the
Bunny” until after 11 PM when we went to bed.  I had forgot to bring bedding
for Jeff so I let him use my sleeping bag and I used a bag liner of Mike’s and
a sheet and blanket that I had brought.  I had two pillows so let Jeff us one
of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM and went up stream a couple of miles and started fishing there.  I caught
two nice brown trout when Mike and Jeff found me.  Mike had caught two browns
also but Jeff hadn’t caught any.  We went back to the trailer and fixed some
breakfast.  Jeff and I drove down to Springfield and called the Forest service
and they told us that the camps were now open but that the bears had not been
caught.  When we got back we decided to go out fishing again.  Mike and Jeff
went upstream and I went down stream.  I caught two more browns and a cut
throat, all very nice fish.  Jeff caught a nice brown this time.  I did have an
advantage as I had hip boats and they did not.  When we returned to the trailer
Jeff set up his hammock and was going to take a short nap before he went on
home.  Mike and I decided to drive up to Payson Lake and take a chance on the
bear problem.  The camp was open so we set up the trailer and then went fishing
on the lake in Mike’s raft.  We caught about five fish that we kept as they
were much smaller that the fish we had caught earlier.  When we quit I fixed me
some salad for dinner but Mike didn’t want anything.  We were tired so soon
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mike and I
got up at 6 AM and went out fishing.  The fishing was slow this morning so at
11 AM we quit with having caught two fish that we kept.  We came back to the
trailer and cooked a nice breakfast of fish, fried potatoes and eggs.  After
cleaning up the trailer we packed up and came home.  It was 5 PM when I got
home.  I was tired but unpacked and helped Mae get ready for Shellie and the
boys as they should arrive about 6 PM.  I was just a little after 6 when they
got there.  We ate dinner and then Shellie gave us our Christmas present
early.  Shellie had made us a nice scrap book of our trip to Israel.  She used
the computer and really did a nice job with it.  It will surly be a treasure to
have.  We played a game with Quint, Kevis and Shellie.  We then read from the
scriptures and got ready for bed.  David called with a business proposition
that we will think about.  I filled out my journal for the last three days
before I went to bed.  All the rest were tired and went to bed with out me.</span></p>

7 AM when I got up.  Mae had breakfast ready about 9 AM.  Mae, Shellie, Quint,
Kevis and Jace went to Lagoon this morning.  I worked all day on getting the
drywall hung and the patching ready for mudding.  I also rewired the light switch
in out bedroom.  I went over to Shanna and Danny’s and went over the items
Danny had questions concerning the finishing of their basement.  Bob and I went
Home Teaching to the Johnstun’s this evening.  When I got home I finished
hanging the sheet rock over the area I had to cut in order to change the wiring
of our bedroom switch,  I put my tools away and cleaned up the trash and
vacuumed the floors before Mae, Shellie and the boys got home.  I fixed myself
a tossed salad for dinner.  I had just started a movie on TV when Mae, Shellie
and the boys got home.  We finished the movie and then had family prayer.  It
was about 12:30 AM when we got to bed.</span></p>

prepared breakfast of fish, biscuits and gravy.  Shellie said that she thought
we should have my Mother sealed to Leo.  I am not sure that is necessary or
should be done.  Shellie went over to Georgia’s to visit with her today.  I had
Bob go with us and we took Quint, Kevis, Jase and Cole fishing at the Clinton
Pond.  Kevis and Cole each caught a couple of cat fish but I wished that Quint
and Jase could have caught one.  We came home about 5 PM.  Mae was ready for
her book group and had dinner ready.  David called and wanted Shellie and the
boys to come up.  They went up and stayed the night.  I relaxed and watched a
western show on TV.  When Mae got home we watched a show on DVD.  It was
Anatomy of a Murder staring James Stewart.  It was nice to have an evening with
my sweetheart.</span></p>

until 8 AM before getting up and having breakfast.  I sure enjoy being with Mae
and I am so greatful for what the Gospel means in our life’s.  I worked out
back putting things away from the trip Mike, Jeff and I took Sunday evening,
Monday and Tuesday.  I went to Durk’s and returned some part, exchanged some
parts for Sherman’s project; and picked up some parts for the lawn sprinkler
system.  I finished assembling the distribution loop for Craig and Carla’s heat
system.  I now need to pressure test it.  I had to go for more parts so while
at Durk’s I got the things for the lawn.  Mae and all our daughter-in-laws and
daughters went out together.  At 7 PM I came in and quit for the day.  I warmed
some dinner up and we then watched a show on TV.  David and his children came
about 8:30 PM, Mae and Shauna came at 9 PM.  David and Shauna stayed for a
while and visited, they left about 10 PM.  Shellie and Sandi are going to spend
the night together.  I went over to the store and got some milk and bananas.  I
updated the statement for Craig and Carla; and then filled out my journal
before going to bed.  </span></p>

breakfast for us this morning of waffles.  I started about 9 AM and worked
until 8 PM on installing a buster pump on the secondary water.  Our water
pressure has been ranging from a low of 30 PSI and occasionally reaches 50
PSI.  the lawns are drying up and we just have to keep trying to get them
watered.  This pump should solve the problem but it is costing close to 600
dollars.  It was hot today and I was sure tired when I came in.  Mae took the
boys to Dinosaur Park and they returned about 4 PM.  Bob mowed the front lawn
this morning and started the back lawn.  I had him let Quint mow the center of
the back lawn.  Quint enjoyed using the rider mower.  When I came in I ate some
dinner and then took a shower.  We watched a good show on TV this evening.  It
was after 11 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

7:30 AM and hoped to go back to sleep but Mae was soon up and we got the day
started.  I cooked breakfast while Mae got dinner and other things started. 
After breakfast I down loaded some pictures from Sandi’s camera as her chip was
full.  It is nice to have Sandi, Shellie and her boys with us.  Mae and I went
into the nursery.  When the girls and Shellie’s boys came I showed them where
Jase attended Primary then I took Quint and Kevis to Priesthood.  I attended
the High Priest Quorum meeting.  I went back to the nursery and set up the
tables for snack time and then went to Sunday school.  We left before Sacrament
meeting and came home.  Mae had a nice pork roast for dinner.  After eating
Mae, Sandi, Shellie and I went to a reunion of those that went to Israel.  It
was good to meet these good people again.  We brought back more pictures that
Joann and Richard had taken while we were on the trip.  It was 8 PM when we
returned home.  All the rest except me went for a walk.  I popped some popcorn
while they were gone and did up some dishes.  We got the children ready for bed
and read the scriptures and had family prayer.  Sandi, Shellie, Mae and I
played Rook.  Mae and I won the first game then Sandi and Shellie won the
second game.  At the end we found out that the girls were using the mirror and
cheating on us the last two hands.  It was after midnight when we went to bed. 
It is sure fun having the girls here.  </span></p>

brought down biscuits to be cooked and a pan full of gravy.  I just cooked some
fish and soon had breakfast ready.  Shellie’s boys sure don’t eat much and with
only 12 biscuits we still had half of them left.  Sandi left her dog with me
today.  She had to meet JaNae in S. L. so she could tend Jayden and Kennedy
while JaNae had a Doctor’s appointment.  Mae and Shellie took the three boys
and went to Lagoon today.  Sandi brought Dawson back to Lagoon so he could go
on the rides with Jase.  I worked all day on the electrical for the pressure
pump for the lawn sprinkler system.  Bob took Carroll into the Doctor to find
out the results of the test last week.  He had to take her to another Doctor
this afternoon as she is having hart trouble.  It doesn’t sound very good.  It
was 9 PM when I got things put up and came in.  Bob fixed me a sandwich to eat
for dinner.  I took a shower and filled in my journal.  I played a game on the

and breakfast was started.  I started bricking a retaining wall around the
buster pump.  Mae, Sandi and Shellie went shopping at Cosco. for the groceries
we need for the family reunion.  I finished the pump walls and set the timer
clock.  Mark had picked all the string beans so he and I cleaned, broke,
blanched and vacuumed sealed them all.  Mae came home about the time we were
finished and was upset with me for doing them.  I thought it was because she
didn’t have time to do them but she just didn’t want them and had told Mark she
didn’t, so was upset that I spent the time doing this rather than doing
something with our grandsons.  She doesn’t like frozen string beans, she said
they don’t cook up good.  This evening we watched part of a show while we ate
dinner.  The children watched a show on Animal Planet.  I did get the boat
hooked up and brought to the front of the yard.  Also I returned some of my
tools to the trailer.  Mae and Shellie were busy preparing food and supplies
for the reunion.  We were late getting to bed.  Mae stayed up and showered
after I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
until 6:30 AM and then got up and started packing for our trip.  It was about
noon when we were ready to leave.  We stopped at Maverick for worms and I got a
yogurt.  We had to stop for gas but they only had one pump going and several waiting. 
It was about 4 PM when we arrived at the cabin at Harbor View at Bear Lake. 
The cabin is great and very roomy.  All our family got here this evening except
for Sandi, Nix, Logan, Chelci and Steve and they will come Friday morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mike, Kylan,
Tyler and I took my boat and went to the East side of the lake and tried
fishing.  We had two strikes but didn’t catch either.  David, Scott, Jeff,
Shellie and Shauna used David’s boat and went water skiing.  I came back in so
that we would be back at 10 AM for breakfast but the other group didn’t come in
until later.  After breakfast several of us took the children down to the
swimming pool and swam for a couple of hours.  Shellie and I played three games
of chess after we returned from swimming.  I won the first two games and we
started the third when some wanted to go out with the boats and pull toys.  It
was quite funny as when we talked about going, no one was interested except
Kylan.  When I blew up big Mabel all the children wanted to go.  We had a lot
of fun.  When we came back we ate dinner.  Shellie and I finished our game and
I finally won but it was a fight to the end.  I was so tired that I had trouble
thinking straight until I finally won.  We were late going to bed again
tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6:30 AM and soon Brad, David and Shellie got up and went out water skiing.  I
worked on my computer getting the pictures that Joann gave us of Israel copied
onto three more CD for Shellie to take to Patsy and Sharon in Arizona and a
copy for herself.  It was after 8 AM before others started getting up.  Jeff
and I drove to Montpelier where we bought some groceries, some fishing items
and some ear plugs for Jeff.  All the family went down to the lake this afternoon. 
We had fun with the boats and toys.  When we were unloading the boat and they
were waiting for me to park the pickup a man offered to trade a Big Mabel for
our Great Big Mabel.  Mae turned him down but I wish that she would have made
the trade as the Great Big Mabel is to big for our boat.  We had a lot of fun
and our family did enjoy our Great Big Mabel.  After we had enough of the sun
and water, we returned to the cabin and ate dinner.  Sandi had brought some
40”s Birthday decorations as she wanted to celebrate Shellie’s Birthday,
although it was last month.  I asked Shellie to go with me to check on our
motel room for tonight, get some house items and purchase some ice.  That way
she would be out of the way for the rest to decorate for her.  When we came
back everyone wished her a Happy Birthday and we had cake and ice cream.  I had
some yogurt that I bought while Jeff and I were in Montpelier.  This evening
Nike and Logan went with Mae and I to stay in the motel.  That way Logan, Nike
and I could go fishing early in the morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4
AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  Mike came down at 4:45 AM and met Nike,
Logan and myself and we drove around the south end of the lake and launched the
boat from the east shore.  We fished until 8 AM with out any action so gave up
and came back to the cabin.  It took us extra time loading the boat as the
braces on the skids bent and let them tip to the side.  I think I had better
weld them into position.  It was 9:30 AM when we got back.  Mae was gust
starting breakfast.  I started mixing the biscuits while Mae started the
grave.  Brad helped us by cooking the fish.  It was 10:30 when we had the
blessing and ate breakfast.  After cleaning up from breakfast mothers took the
children to the swimming pool.  Mike, Jeff and Nick played a game.  I fell
asleep in the chair.  When I woke up Jeff had me pop some corn.  He, Mike and
Nck were playing Risk.  I think it is interesting that they will play Risk for
over three hours put they won’t play me a game of chess.  After they finished
Nick said he would play me a game of chess.  We played for quite a while.  Mae
interrupted me as she wanted me to download Shellie’s pitchers onto a CD. 
David came and helped Nick but I was still able to win the game.  Shellie and
the boys left for home.  They will go as far as Mike’s and sleep there and will
go on home tomorrow.  Sandi made dinner but while the rest were eating I got
the boat ready for them to take out.  Most everyone wanted to spend this evening
out on the water but I decided to stay home.  I ate, fix some whey and took a
shower and shaved.  I then filled in part of my journal.  Gail stayed home with
Benji, Chelci didn’t feel well so she stayed home, and David (Mike’s son) also
stayed home.  Mae was busy most of her spare time trying to get all the prices
figured up so that it was fair for everyone.  She did a good job of it and I
think everyone felt good about it.  I could have gone to bed early but every
one wanted to stretch the day out.  We watched a movie of the “Work and the
Glory III”.  Chelci wanted to be administered to but none of us brought our
oil.  Scott went down to the store and was able to buy some olive oil.  I
consecrated the oil, Scott anointed Chelci and Steve sealed the anointing and
gave Chelci a blessing.  When we started to bed, Mae and I ended up with out a
mattress.  Scott and Mishelle came in as we were trying to come up with a bed
and they insisted that they take to mattress off a hide-a-way bed down stairs
and but their children on it and then we used their blow up mattress.  It was
almost 2 AM when we finally got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7 AM and were quite busy getting ready to return home.  JaNae and Chelci
prepared crepes for breakfast.  Chelci feels much better this morning and also
slept well last night.  After breakfast we all worked together to pack up and
prepare to leave for homes.  It has been a wonderful time with all our family. 
The only two that were not able to be with us was Roy and Garrett.  I believe
that everyone enjoyed the time together.  Mae and I enjoyed visiting and
enjoying the scenery as we came home.  We stopped in Logan and got natural gas
for the pickup.  It was almost 2 PM when we got home.  We had to hurry to get
the truck unloaded and then get ready to attend Sacrament meeting.  I did get a
15 minute nap before we went.  I stayed awake until after the Sacrament but Mae
fell asleep several times through out the meeting.  Bob invited us for dinner
then later we went up and played a game of Canasta.  Mae and Carroll beat Bob
and I again.  We were sure tired when we came down to go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 7
AM and had several things to do this morning.  I enjoyed reading Jacob 5 in the
Book of Mormon this morning.  I believe we are in the last days before the
coming of the Lord when he will prune his vineyard for the last time.  I am so
greatful for the light of the Gospel and the security that it gives to me.  I
just wish that David and Jeff could see it.  Gail brought Benji for Mae to tend
today while she goes back to school.  He is sure a easy child to tend and so
fun to see him continue to learn.  He is almost walking by himself now.  He
just holds on to your finger and then almost runs around the house.  I worked
all day in the yard making some changes to the sprinkler system so that it dose
a better job of covering the yard and automaticly waters the flower beds. 
Besides tending Benji Mae did the laundry and it was a big one after camping,
cleaned house and finished unpacking.  She then came out and weeded the front
flower bed.   It was 9:30 PM when we quit and came into the house, both very
tired.  However we decided to watch a movie so stayed up and saw “The Man that
Killed Liberty Vance” staring James Stewart and John Wayne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then watched the 24<sup>th</sup> of July parade on TV.  I worked on the
distribution manifold testing it for leaks.  Bob and I corrected a sprinkler
head but other than that the lawn watering system seems to be working ok.  I
started finishing the sheet rock in out apartment.  Gary Nelson came by to
visit at 7 PM.  We visited until 10:15 PM.  I wrote in my journal before we
went to bed.  I don’t feel the best this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 7
AM and got up still not feeling the best.  Mae kept me on vitamin C through the
day.  I worked on the mudding of the sheetrock most of the day.  Bob and I were
going to go Home Teaching to the Fallis’s this evening but Brother Fallis
called and said that Sister Fallis was not home and he was not sure when she
would be here.  Bob had visited him the other day so he said that it would be
best for them if we call that our visit this month.  Mae went to the Temple
this evening with Georgia.  I thought of going also but since I am not feeling
very well I decided to stay home.  I watched a show on TV.  Scott called and
they would like to get started on their deck cover as soon as posible.  I did
some figuring on that.  Mike called to let us know that David has got Bells
Pulsey and it has affected his face.  It has caused a partial paralyzed of the
face.  He can’t smile on the one side of his face and his eye won’t close. 
They have taken him into the Doctor and he does not know what causes this
condition but thinks it will last from a few days up to 3 months and thinks it
will go away.  My condition is settling on my lungs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 6
AM and got up for a few minutes.  Mae was sleeping in the recliner.  She had
problems with her legs so finally got us and went to the recliner.  Between the
two of us I think we are getting old.  I went back to sleep until almost 9 AM. 
We had breakfast and then Mae and Georgia went shopping for the reunion
groceries.  I called Mike to see how David is doing today.  He said that he is
ok but about the same.  I worked on Scott and Mishelle’s plans quite a bit
today.  This afternoon I mowed the lawn as Mae wanted it mowed before Brother
Morgan and the social committee met here this evening.  Mae came out and
trimmed the lawn.  I watched the last half of a western on TV while Mae went
shopping for more items for the reunion.  I talked to David about his job and
he said that it didn’t look very good for the company he is now with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up
three times during the night but seen to have been able to rest of.  We got up
at7 AM and started packing to go to the Family Reunion.  Mae gave me a hair cut
and Bob came down and had me change the filter in the furnace.  It is almost
12:30 PM and we are ready to leave.  We went into Riverdale and returned the
carpet samples to R. C. Willie’s, then we went to Carpet 1 and signed a
contract for them to replace our carpeting.  We then drove to Heber Valley Camp
Ground that is East of Heber City.  We arrived there at 3 PM and was the first
of our group to get there.  Georgia and Rick , then Mike came with Tayler and
Mattie.  Out of a possibility of about 80 descendents of Glendon and Mildred
Porter there was just over 1/4<sup>th</sup> of them that came.  We were happy
for those that did make it and a little disappointed that more didn’t make the
effort.  Many had good reasons that prevented them from coming but it was still
disappointing that others didn’t bother to let us know and Mae and <br>
Georgia had planed on about 50% attendance.  We had a good time and the camp
physilities were very good.  We had four cabins that each had single bunks for
16 people.  They did not have mattresses on the bunks so we had to bring our
own bedding.  Some of us brought air mattresses that we used.  We had dinner of
hamburgers and hot dogs with all the trimmings and lots of salads and
watermelon.  This evening we built a camp fire and had a very enjoyable
program.  It was late when we started going to bed and some stayed up until
after midnight visiting (including Mae).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Many of the
parents did not sleep very well because of not coming prepared with proper
bedding or because of children not sleeping quietly.  I have had a cold for
several days and it really stuffed me up during the night.  I got up at 3:15 AM
and used the restroom.  I didn’t go back to bed as my head hurt to much to lay
down and I didn’t want to wake others in our cabin.  I finally went to the
truck and tried to sleep there.  That didn’t work very well and about 5 AM Mae
came looking for me.  she got into the truck with me and we tried to sleep some
more.  She had brought a quilt so that we got warm at least.  We got up shortly
after 6 AM.  David was soon up and he said that he hadn’t slept to well but
that Conner had kept Shauna awake most of the night with his tossing.  It was a
good day.  Kim went for a short hike to start the day.  We had a delicious
breakfast of hot cakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage along with all the trimmings. 
Most of the guys got involved in a volleyball game which ended when Nolan and
Kim both dove for a ball and Kim landed face first on Nolan’s cast and really
cut his face quite badly.  He later went to the hospital and got it cleaned up
and tree stitches to close the cut.  I took a nap while the volleyball game was
in progress.  That really helped me.  We had dinner about 3 PM and then the
reunion began to breakup.  It was after 5 PM when we got home and then had to
unpack.  I was really feeling ruff tonight so I slept in the recliner.</span></p>

couldn’t sleep laying down so go back up and slept in the recliner.  Mae slept
until 7:30 AM when she got up.  She woke me at 8:50 AM as Bob was going to have
breakfast for us at 9 AM.  Bob called us to eat at 9 AM.  He had made biscuits
and gravy and they were very good.  I really felt rotten so I stayed home.  I
watched a BYU Devotional but after it ended I turned the TV of for my eyes
burned to hard with the brightness of the TV.  I slept quite a bit today.  Mae,
even thought she was very tired, attended Primary and Sacrament meeting.  Bob
invited us for dinner but I stayed downstairs and they brought me something to
eat.  I didn’t want to expose them with any of what I have.  I again slept in
the recliner tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept until
8 AM and slept fairly good.  Mae prepared some breakfast and got some things
done around the house.  She went over to Jeff and Gail’s and tended little
Benji while Gail went to work.  About noon Craig and Carla came down.  I went
with them to Durk’s and got the rest of their material for their heat system. 
Mark and I had picked quite a few ripe tomatoes so I gave them a small sack of
tomatoes to take home.  I took the one heat vent cover off and removed a piece
of filter that Mark had placed there.  The filter stopped us from closing the
vent to its fullest.  I closed the vent and also covered it with plastic.  That
has helped keep it from getting so cold this evening.  I may have to put
plastic over the vent in our bedroom.  I watched the show “Airport 1975” of TV
and then when Mae returned home we watched it again.  We then worked on the
computers with Mae doing E-mails and I worked on my journal.  </span></p>
