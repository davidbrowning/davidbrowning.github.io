<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up
early and read for a while but Mae talked me into coming back to bed.  She woke
me about 9 AM.  I helped her some with perorations for Chelci’s Baby Shower. 
Sandi and Chelci came about 10 AM and other family came about 11 AM.  I worked
outside repairing a sprinkler fitting.  I had to go to Durk’s to get some
parts.  After most of the guests left I went in and visited with Sandi and
Chelci.  This afternoon I installed the mirror on the wall.  Jeff and Gail brought
Benji over this evening for Mae to tend while they went out this evening.  Mae
and I watched a show on TV while Jeff and Gail went out this evening.  They
came about 11 PM to get Benji.  We had just finished the movie.  I filled out
my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7:45 AM and after normal morning routine Mae and I laid in bed and rubbed each
others feet.  While doing so we turned on the Tabernacle Choir Broadcast and
then followed that by going to the BYU station and lessoning to Elder Henry B.
Iring of the Council of the Twelve Apostles speak at the BYU Idaho 2003.  It
was a very enjoyable morning.  We then got ready for church meetings.  Nursery
was very crowded with children and parents.  There was 22 children today.  I
helped get things started and then I went into Priesthood class.  I came back
after class and helped put away toys and set up for the snack time.  I then
came home and got our donation check and took a 30 minute nap.  I got back in
time for Sacrament Meeting.  Today being the first Sunday we had Fast &amp;
Testimony meeting.  Almost all testimonies were given by Melchizedek Priesthood
holders.  I bore my testimony, not only for my own self but hoping that I could
help others realize the importance of personal scripture study and prayer.  We
went straight from the church house to David and Shauna’s where we had been
invited for dinner.  They had prepared a nice roast, potatoes and vegetables. 
David and I talked most of the evening about the church.  I don’t understand
why or what has given David a fear of studding the scriptures as he has a fear
that he might prove the church is not true.  He said that he wishes whit all
his soul that he could believe it is true.  I don’t know if I helped him or not. 
It was about 9 PM when we got home.  We had to stop in Roy and get gas for the
car.  We didn’t want to get the gas on Sunday but I was afraid that we would
run out of gas before getting home or that we wouldn’t have enough to get to a
station tomorrow.  It took 13.5 gallons of gas on I believe a 13 gallon tank
capacity.  I started on my journal when we got home.  Jeff called or had called
and when Mae saw a missed call she returned his call.  They are again thinking
of the addition to their home.  I sure love my children and would do any thing
that will help them out.  You sometimes you wonder, what is the best way to
help them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I left for
Scott’s before 8 AM.  Mae brought me a role of plastic that I had forgot to
bring.  She stayed there for a while and then went to her Beautician and got
her hair done.  Scott was there to help me and later Jeff came over and
helped.  We were able to get the main beams cut and assembled and got them
standing and braced.  At one point I was showing Jeff and Scott how to do
something.  Jeff made the comment to Scott that Dad doesn’t think his son’s are
competent.  I left them to do the job and in a few minutes Jeff called to me
and said “Dad your son’s aren’t competent, come and help us.  It was cute!  It
was after 6 PM when we quite for the day.  Scott and Mishelle had planned on
taking Mom and I out to eat but when we finished Scott was so tired that he ask
if they could do it another evening.  I guess I worked them to hard.  I
showered and cleaned up and then Mae and I watched a DVD movie “The Green
Berets” before we went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I turned of
the alarm and went back to sleep for another ½ hour.  That put us ½ hour behind
our plans this morning.  I went over to Scott and Mishelle’s again today.  Mae
went up to Jenny’s for a appointment, then she went to the Ogden Temple and
went through a session.  Bob came over and helped me again today.  I had Bob
quite at 4 PM and when Scott came home he helped me.  We quite at 6 PM, not
quite finished, but I was tired.  I packed up all my tools and brought them
home as we will be going fishing the rest of the week with Randy and Judy.  Mae
had dinner ready when I got home.  I worked on my journal, getting it caught up
and printed off the past two months of entries.  I tried to scan in some news
paper articals but couldn’t get them where they were readable.  We gave up and
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got my
scripture study in and ate some breakfast before going over to Valley Home
Medical to an appointment with them to get a new mask for my C-pack.  I called
Valley glass as I was driving and they can’t get my glass shelves ready until
about 1 PM.  I told them I was leaving town by noon so I would have to get the
shelves next Monday.  I picked up some parts to repair Randy’s plumbing at the
cabin.  I then went over to Sportsman Warehouse and bought a port-a-potty to
take with us in the boat.  As I was returning Valley Glass called and said they
had the shelves ready so I went over and got them.  I stopped at the store and
got some groceries for the trip.  We ate lunch and got ready to go.  Randy and
Judy came about 1:30 PM and we left.  It was 4:30 PM when we got to their
cabin.  I went right to work on the plumbing problem but lacked one coupler
from being able to finish the job.  I was able to get the pump working so we
have water I the cabin.  Mae and Judy prepared dinner and we ate.  After dinner
we played two games of Mormon Bridge although they call it Screwy Luy.  It was
after 10 PM when I finished my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well with the new face mask.  I am not sure just what I am going to
do about the c-pack.  Randy and I left at 7:15 AM for Evanston to get plumbing
parts.  I worked on the pump plumbing but still needed more parts so we made a
second trip to Evanston.  It was 3 PM when I finished with the pump and also
installed a electrical switch for outside power.  We hooked up the fifth wheel
trailer and the boat to Randy’s truck.  We had to stop in Evanston for fuel and
then traveled on.  The outfit travels well and we drove about 65 MPH most of
the way.  It was 7 PM when we got the fifth wheel set up.  Mae cooked some
hamburgers for dinner and after that we set around and just visited and
reminisced about life.  We prepared for Randy and I to go fishing in the
morning about 7 AM.  it was after 11 PM when we got to bed.  It has been a very
good day even though it took longer than we had planned to get the work done at
the cabin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep the best last night because I ate dinner to late and I got cold.  I got
up at 6 AM and Randy and I went fishing.  It was a beautiful morning and we had
a good time.  Randy caught about several fish and I caught three but we were
only able to keep one because of the size limits.  At least ½ of the fish we
caught will die because of being injured when we removed the hook.  I don’t
like this limit control.  One fish that we let loose turned belly up and we
couldn’t revive it.  Soon a sea gull flew down and pecked at it and then
another chased it away and it pecked at it.  A pelican flew down and scared the
sea gulls away.  It took one peck at the large fish and tossed it into the air and
swallowed it whole.  It was kind of neat to watch nature.   We came back and
picked Judy and Mae up at 11 AM.  This afternoon Mae caught two fish and Judy
caught one fish.  We quite shortly after 5 PM and came back to the Marina. 
After loading the boat &amp; cleaning the fish we went out to eat at the marina
restaurant.  The food was pretty good and we didn’t have to prepare it.   This
evening we played a game of cards before we went to bed.  It has been a good
day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept much
better last night.  Randy and I again got up early and went out fishing.  At 9
AM we came back and got Mae, who went out fishing with us.  Judy didn’t feel
very well so she stayed at the RV.  Randy had caught two nice fish that we were
able to keep so we sent them back with Judy.  We fished until 11 AM with Randy
catching a couple more fish that we had to turn back.  Mae caught a couple of
fish that we were able to keep one of them.  I didn’t catch any today.  Judy
had lunch ready for us when we came in about noon.  After eating we packed up
and came home.  We stopped and got a frozen yogurt in Heber.  It was about 4:30
PM when we got home.  We unpacked and I put the boat away.  While we ate a
light dinner we watched a football game between BYU &amp; UCLA.   BYU lost due to
a bad first ½ and too many penalty.  Mae gave me a hair cut this evening.  We
took showers and went to bed very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our Sunday
morning was much lake last Sunday.  We had a light breakfast and then laid in
bed watched the Tabernacle Choir followed by a BYU Devotional.  I took a nap
and then we went to church.  Bob had came down and asked if I would help give
Carroll a blessing.  She hasn’t been feeling well.  Bob anointed her and Bob,
Mark and I sealed the anointing and gave her a blessing.  I was asked to be
voice in this ordinance.  Nursery went well although we were short some help so
I stayed in and helped until after we took the children into the other room for
the lesson.  I then set up the tables for snacks and I went into the adult
Sunday School class.  I returned after class and helped put things away and
clean up.  In Sacrament meeting the Four R’s gave the program.  They sang a
serious of spiritual songs.  After meeting Mae and I went over to Scott and
Mishelle’s for dinner.  We enjoyed the evening with them.  We stopped at Tina’s
and visited with her for a few minutes before coming home.  I took the garbage
out to the curb and then filled out my journal before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well because of my c-pack.  I got up shortly after 6 AM.  Mae hadn’t
slept very well so I let her sleep in a little longer.  Bob prepared breakfast
of biscuits and gravy.  I left just before 8 AM and went over to Scott’s.  Bob
also came over and helped me.  Mae did laundry, cleaned my c-pack, packed my
suit case for my trip to Idaho, bought a bushel of peaches, picked up the throw
carpets we had bound, bottled 21 quarts of peaches and prepared several peaches
for drying.  She also had dinner ready when I got home.  Bob and I finished the
framing of Scott and Mishelle’s patio.  Bob left about 4 PM for home.  I was
another hour picking up all my tools and getting things finished up.  I went
over to Durk’s plumbing to pickup materials for Sherman’s.  Jarred was going to
have my order pulled but he got sick and didn’t come in today.  Bill and I
pulled the things that we think I will need to install the rest of Crag and
Carla’s heat system.  It was after 6 PM when I left there.  I quickly showered
and shaved and changed clothes to go Home Teaching.  Our first appointment was
at 6:30 PM so Mark went with Bob to visit them.  Bob and I went over to
Patriarch and Sister Johnston’s and then stopped by Casey’s.  it was almost 9
PM when we got home.  Mae was still doing peaches.  I helped her a little buy
she did 99% of it.  I filled out Sherman’s statement and caught up my journal
before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:45 AM and started my normal morning.  I let Mae sleep in as she didn’t sleep
very well last night.  Bob prepared waffles for breakfast and then I started
getting ready to go to Idaho.  Before leaving I put the camp trailer under the
canapé and I put the blinds up in front of the sun room windows.  It was almost
10 AM when I left.  I stopped in Ogden and filled up with gas.  When I got to
Inkom I was sleepy so I pulled into the truck stop.  I called Mae and asked her
to set the timer for 30 minutes and when it went off asked her to call me.  I
slept for that 30 minutes.  I stopped in Pocatello at a Maverick and bought a
frozen yogurt.  When I got to Rire traffic was being diverted.  One of the men
said that I would have to go by the Rexburg rout as there was a bad accident at
the Snake River bridge and traffic would be held up for several hours.  Just
then one of the men received a phone call and he said to let us go through as
it was ok now.  It was 4 PM when I got to Victor.  Victor has sure changed
since I lived here.  Craig took me to their new house and we went over some of
the plans for the heat installation.  The contractor was there and he asked if
I needed the furnace room wall sheet rocked in order to start the
installation.  When I said I did, he stayed and hung the sheet rock.  I should
be able to start first thing in the morning.  I came back to their home in
Victor.  Carla was cooking dinner so I ate and then went downstairs to the bed
room where I will sleep.  Carla changed the bedding for me.  When I drove
through Swan Valley I thought on the experience Dad, Roy and I had with a bull
so this evening I wrote up the experience.  After getting it written I check
through my stories and found that I had already written it up.  By the time I
entered my journal and wrote the story it was after 9 PM.  I read my scriptures
this evening to save time in the morning.  I then went to bed after playing
three games on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke us
about 2 AM with my c-pack mask bothering me so I took it off.  I again woke
about 5 AM and stayed up.  I fixed myself some breakfast and was ready for work
at 7 AM.  Craig and I picked up a few items at the lumber yard and then went to
the house.  I decided to build a run for all the pipes so that it would look
neat instead of looking like a plate of spagitti.  I pressure tested all the
lines and the last line to hook up today has a leak in it.  When I got home I
visited with Graig’s son-in-law before washing up and eating.  I took a shower
and called Mae.  She was out to eat with our friends.  Mae called me back when
she was on the way home.  We talked for a while.  I was going to read my
scriptures tonight but I was too tired.  I played a game of solitary and went
to bed shortly after 9 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well with the c-pack on so about 12:30 AM I pulled it off and slept
the rest of the night without it.  I think I will try my old face mask
tonight.  I got up at 5 and used the bathroom so I slept until 6 before getting
up.  I made me some cooked cereal for breakfast.  I was at work about 7 AM.  it
went fairly well but I am short three parts.  Craig went to town to try to find
them but they are not in the valley.  I guess we will have to go to Rexburg
tomorrow to get them.  I got most of the boiler and potable water heater set. 
I don’t know how the plumber is planning to set his items.  Craig called him
and he acted almost rude with me an said he can’t get her today or tomorrow so
I will put my things the way I want them.  Craig’s contractor also said that I was
her first so to do what I want.  Craig’s son-in-law will run the main poser for
me.  I think I am in pretty got shape to finish tomorrow.  I quite work at 7
PM.  after getting something to eat and making me a new pitcher of whey, I went
down stairs and took a shower.  I called Mae but she was still busy with the
Sisters at the Book Group.  She called me back and we visited for a while.  By
the time I finished my journal it was bed time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
was ready to go by 7:15.  Craig and I went over to a couple of stores for
supplies but couldn’t get all I need so we went to Driggs.  I was amazed at the
traffic going through this valley.  The eight miles to Driggs was packed until
I couldn’t find one break in which you had time to pass a slow driver.  I told
Craig that they need a four lane road.  I find very few places that have
remained even similar to what they were when we lived here except for the
narrow highway between Victor and Driggs.  After getting what we needed we went
to the house and got started.  I got the system all assembled and one zone
completely wired so that Peter, Craig’s son-in-law, can finish that wiring.  On
the way back to town I drove around town a little to see what was the same and
there isn’t much that I recognize.  After getting back to Craig and Carla’s I
washed up and ate dinner.  I then came downstairs to my room and called Mae. 
She was out for a minute and when she came back in she called and we visited
for a few minutes.  I got most of my journal entry made and then took a
shower.  Elis came down and knocked on my door.  She had brought her parents
over so I went up and Craig, Carla, Elis, Rich, Lois and I played Mormon Bridge
until late.  We then set and visited until almost mid-night before we went to
bed.  It was a very enjoyable evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
until 7 AM and then started getting ready to go home.  Carla prepared a nice
breakfast and I enjoyed having Rich and Lois there.  After eating Rich and I
started over to Crag and Carla’s new home.  We drove around in town trying to
recognize some of the old homes and land marks.  There is very little that is
the same.  We went over to Carla’s new home where the woman had already got
there.  After taking some more pictures I left for Teton.  I called Mae and she
told me that the sewer line had backed up and water had spilled onto the floor
and some of the carpet had got wet.  Mae really sounded beat and tired.  I went
on to Teton to see Uncle Lee and Aunt Welma.  Uncle Lee was there but Aunt
Welma is now in a rest home in Afton.  I took Uncle Lee with me and we went
over to the rest home and saw Aunt Welma.  I don’t think she know who I was. 
It was really sad to see her so old and so near gone.  I hope she doesn’t have
to remain this way very long.  When I took Uncle Lee back home he had me get
some apples from his trees.  It was almost 3 PM when I left to come home.  When
I got to the rest stop near Blackfoot I called Mae and had her call me back in
30 minutes.  I got my pillow and went to sleep until Mae called me.  I drove on
to Pocatello where I stopped and got gas, a sandwich and a frozen yogurt.  I
drove on home getting there about 6:30 PM.  we soon went to bed but watched a
show on TV before going to sleep.  I am sure grateful to be home with my
sweetheart.</span></p>

and when we got up Bob cooked some waffles for us.  We went to another Wards
Sacrament meeting in another Ward at 10:50 AM.  We then came home for a ½ hour
before going back and taking care of the nursery.  We had about 15 or 16
children come today.  By the time nursery was over we were beat.  We came on
home as our family came for a back yard cook out.  We visited and played
games.  All the Grand children come to Grandma and have her play with them.  My
boys and I played horse shoes for a while.  We cooked hot dogs and hamburgers
and had all the trimmings to go with it.  It was a wonderful afternoon and
evening.  Sandi and Nix couldn’t come as Chelci’s water broke and they took her
to the hospital.  By 9:30 PM nothing had happened yet.  We are tired and will

for Mae to tend today.  after breakfast I took some return items back to Durk’s
for credit on the Sherman job.  Bob was going out this morning so I asked him
to pick up a battery for the boat for me.  While I was out I stopped at Home
Depot and got a new filter for my shop vacuum and some saw blades.  Sandi
called us to let us know that Chelci had a baby boy at 5:15 AM, he weighed 6
lb. 14 oz and all is well with both mother and baby.  We were excited for the
news.  I helped Mark for about four hours or more today.  I got the batteries
for the tent trailer charged up and reinstalled and the new battery put in the
boat.  Mae has been busy all day with Benji, house work and getting ready for
our trip.  Nike came and got the camp trailer this evening.  Mae when grocery
shopping this evening for the things we will need for our trip tomorrow.  I
replaced the brake pads in Bob’s car this evening.  Mae and I got most of the
things for the trip packed and in the pickup this evening.  It was after 11 PM
when I entered this journal entry.  I think Mae has already gone to bed but I
have still got to take a shower tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4:30 AM and hurried to finish packing the truck and connecting up the boat and
left about 6 AM.  We got to Heber city about 7:15 AM but was only about 10
minutes behind Nick.  We got a hot sandwich at the Sinclair station at the
north end of town.  I also filled the boat up with gas and got another 5 gallon
of gas for the generator.  We got to Strawberry reservoir about 9 AM and set up
our camp.  After getting everything set up Nick and I went fishing.  Mae stayed
and rested at camp and worked on a few of her items.  It was quite windy but we
had fair luck.  I caught 5 fish and Nick caught 6 fish.  We were only able to
keep one of them as they were too large.  We quit and came back to camp at 4
PM.  Mae had dinner ready.  After eating and doing a few things around camp we
played games until almost 9 PM and then went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Nick and I
got up early and ate breakfast and then went fishing.  We did quite well as we
caught 12 fish but because of the slot limit we were only able to keep one
fish.  The wind came up about the time we were coming in for lunch.  The one
runner on the boat broke loose and we had to repair it before we could load the
boat.  We did a temporary repair and it held even though we loaded the boat in
a wind storm.  After lunch Nick and I went to Heber for some supplies.  The
wind continued to blow all the rest of the day so we didn’t go back out fishing. 
I repaired the boat trailer and we refilled the water tank on the tent
trailer.  Mae made a nice dinner.  After dinner we played some games.  We quit
a little after 9 PM.  I shaved this evening before we went to bed.  Mae has
been able to relax most of the day.  She isn’t feeling the best.  After making
this entry we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Nick and I
went fishing this morning early so that we were on the lake before 7 AM.  The
hydraulic lift on the motor isn’t working right.  I got it down most of the way
so we could us it but when we came back in it wouldn’t life the prop.  We
worked on it at the ramp and found that it was due to corroded wires.  When I
cleaned it up it worked fine.  We didn’t do very well as we only caught 5 fish,
one was a chub and the other was just less than 15 inches.  It was 1:30 PM
before we left for Fish Lake.  We had to stop in Orem and also Richfield for
natural gas which held us up.  It was about 7:30 PM when we got to Fish Lake so
we were late setting up.  We went to bed after 10 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
cooked fish for breakfast.  Mae sleep better last night so she went out fishing
with us.  We all caught and part of the time we all had fish on at the same
time.  Most of the fish were small so we let all that were caught just by the
lip go.  We quite fishing at noon and came in with 11 fish.  After lunch we
rested and took showers and a nap.  We went out fishing again and again let
most of them go as they were small and we wanted to catch a large one.  We
quite and went out to eat at 7 PM at the Bower’s Store and Cafe.  After eating we
were going to go fishing in the dark but the wind had came up so we came back
to the trailer and played games until 10 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 5:30 AM and went outside.  It was still dark and the stars were so bright
and beautiful.  There is such a peace that I get from looking at the stars.  I
don’t know that I can explain just what it is but the realization that there is
a God that created all this with such precision and unchanging control.  It is
amazing to me to try to understand how someone can look up into the starry sky
and no believe in a God and a supreme creator.  As I stood looking at the sky this
morning I just felt so good to say my morning prayer to my Heavenly Father as I
stared at the stars.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
prepared fish and fried potatoes for breakfast.  Nike and I went fishing this
morning.  Mae didn’t go with us this morning but help us get breakfast before
we went.  We were on the lake at 6:50 and by 7:05 we had caught our first
fish.   We continued to catch fish for the next 2 ½ hours.  Any of the fish
that were hooked in the lip we just turned loose.  I don’t know how many fish
we caught but we sure had fun.  A storm came in about 9:30 AM and we got off
the lake.  It took us a while to get the boat off the lake and then we cleaned
our fish.  Mae had most of our things packed and ready for us to load up.  We hurried
and cleaned up the rest, but it started to rain before we could get the trailer
down, so the tent got wet.  Mae had also prepared a lunch for us so after
getting everything ready to leave we set at the picnic table and ate our
lunch.  It was noon when we left for home.  We had to stop at the sanitary dump
and trash bin before leaving.  We sent to Richfield where we gassed up and then
traveled on to Oram and again got natural gas there.  We met Sandy at Salt Lake
as she brought my paint pump back.  She road up to our place with Nike.  Nike
helped me put things away while Mae and Sandi prepared some dinner.  We then
played a game of marbles.  It was after 9 PM when Sandi and Nike left for
home.  I was to tired to enter this journal so I went to bed.  Mae stayed up
and cleaned up the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
until 8 AM.  Bob cooked fish, fried potatoes and biscuits for breakfast at 9
AM.  Mae and I had to hurry after eating as we wanted to attend Sacrament
meeting with the Clarks.  They will be leaving on another mission to Denmark. 
The meeting was very spiritual and I sure enjoyed being there.  After the
meeting we went to a park just a little ways from the Clarks house and had a
light lunch and visited for a few minutes.  The Hyers were there and we enjoyed
visiting with them.  They have been asked to go back to the Philippines and try
to correct the Perpetual Education Fund there as there is no money being
returned to the fund from those that are receiving it from that country.  They
are very apprehensive about what can be done.  The Philippines people just do
not have the culture custom of repaying anything that is given them.  I just
wished them the best of luck.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We returned
to our Ward and got there about ½ way through with Nursery and in time for Mae
to give the lesson.  She did very well and I think the children enjoyed the
lesson.  We returned home after Nursery.  We were so tired that we just laid
down and took a nap.  Bob brought part of their family down to see the
apartment.  We had already woke and had got some waffles for our dinner.  While
we ate we started to watch “Blood Alley” on a DVD, when they came down.  We got
up, got dressed and went upstairs and visited with Bob , Carroll and some of
their family.  Irven and Sandy were also there.  After the family left we came
back downstairs and finished our show.  I then made this journal entry.  It was
after 11 PM when we got to bed.  It has been a very enjoyable day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8 AM and after normal morning activity we ate breakfast.  My back is
really hurting me today.  Mae called the Doctor and went in to be checked as
she has had this cold hang on so long.  The doctor said that her lungs are
clear.  He feels that this is bacterial and gave her a prescription that should
clear it up.  I checked our fire place and the thermostat wire is shorted and
will have to be replaced.  Bob wants my help putting on the rear brakes to his
car.  I pulled the snowmobile trailer out and started up the snowmobiles to let
them run out old gas.  While they were running I cut down the weeds that were
growing around the area that the trailer set.  I asked Bob to go get me some
thermostat wire and I started the brakes.  I could not loosen the lug nuts on
the car and had to rent a power in packed wrench to get the rear wheels off. 
When I took the first side apart I found that the new brake shoes were not the
right ones for his car.  Bob took them back to where he bought them.  I
showered and went to Randy’s and had him give me a treatment.  Mae has been
busy getting washing from last week done up and started packing and planning
for this weeks trip.  It was after 10 PM when I filled out this entry and we
went to bed.  I did answer a E-mail that we received from Linda today.  Bob
also prepared liver and onions for dinner about 4 PM.  It was sure good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob prepared
breakfast of biscuits and gravy this morning.  After breakfast Mae went to the
Temple with Marna McPhee.   I repaired our fireplace as the thermostat wire had
shorted out when the carpeting was installed.  I replaced the old wire with a
new wire.  I then finished the replacing of the rear brake shoes on Bob car. 
That was a job mainly because it has been such a long time since I have changed
the conventionally shoe brake pads.  I then went over to Irven and Sandy’s and
shut of the water to their swamp cooler and put a pad in the ceiling vent.  I
came home and took a quick shower before going back to Randy’s for a follow up
treatment.  When I got home I helped Mae with the packing for our trip.  I also
loaded the software for our new camera and downloaded the pictures from the
camera to our computer.  It is almost 11 PM so we will go to bed now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up at
4:15 AM with the start of a cold.  As the day went on my cold got worse.  I let
Mae sleep until 6 AM and then we started packing.  It was 9 AM before we left
the house.  We stopped for natural gas and found that the electrical adapter
that I used on the trailer is not long enough and it comes unplugged when I
turn a right turn.  I tried to repair it but finally called Bob and asked him
to bring me the adapter from the boat trailer.  We had planned to visit Chelci
and her new baby but with both Mae and I having colds we called her and said we
would come and visit when we are feeling better.  We don’t want to expose
Chelci or the baby to these colds.  We met Sandi in Tooele and went to her new
home.  It is beautiful and large.  She would like me to come out and build a craft
room.  I will have to do it when we get back from this trip.  When we got to
Orem to get natural gas the pump wasn’t working.  We had to go on to
Springfield where we got gas.  We also stopped at Fillmore and Cedar City for
natural gas.  Just as we were leaving the freeway to go to the park, Jackie
Thomas called Mae and told her that the one secretary had fallen and broke her
leg very seriously and would be off work for at least two months or longer. 
they would like Mae to come back to work to fill in for her.  Mae will have to
decide in the next two days.  It was almost 8 PM when we got to Zion National
Park.  When we got our camp site we found that there are electrical hookups
only.  That does present a problem but there is nothing that we can do about it
now.  It was late when we got set up and something to eat.  After eating I
worked on my journal while Mae did up the dishes.  We then had to play games
for a while to let the dinner set before we could go to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well and was awake early this morning.  I napped several times
today.  It was relaxing to be here in Zion’s National Park.  Jeff and Gail got
here about 3 PM.  This evening we went for a walk just up to the ranger gate
and back.  after returning and putting Benjamin to bed, we enjoyed playing
games.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Although I
woke several times I was able to go right back to sleep.  We had a nice
breakfast and then went for a hike up to Zion’s Arch.  It was mile round trip hike. 
We sure enjoyed it.  We came back and relaxed at camp.  About 5 PM we went into
town and did a little shopping.  We bought some ice cream and they also had
some frozen yogurt for me.  Jeff and Gail’s friend, Stewart, Neisha and their
three children Kyler, Adderly and Mckye came this evening.  They are in a tent
camping area but we are inviting them to eat and spend time with us.  This
evening we fried hamburgers and roasted hot dogs.  Mae of course had all the
trimming and salad to with it.  The Baur’s had reservations for a tent area and
so was some distance from us.  We discussed going on a hike in the morning and
finally Jeff and I decided to hike Angels Landing.  Mae was quite upset that I
would try it as I haven’t felt well for the past three days but we decided to do
it.  We prepared before going to bed to leave at 7 AM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
5:30 AM and went over to the bathroom.  I got me some breakfast and woke Jeff. 
It was just after 7 AM when we left.  Mae did get up and help me get off.  It
was a beautiful morning and we enjoyed the hike.  It was a very enjoyable hike
and I was surprised how fast we made it to the top pf the switch backs.  It was
only another ½ mile to the top but it was the slowest part of the trip.  We sure
enjoyed the view and the feeling that we had made it there.  We stayed for
sometime there at the top and ate some snacks and visited.  As we returned we
found several people that gave up and returned with out going all the way.  We
returned to camp about 12:30 PM so we made good time.  I took a nap after we
ate some lunch.  The Baur’s came over and played games.  I took a nap.  This
afternoon Jeff, Gail, Benji, Mae and the Baur’s all went up to the river
trail.  I stayed in camp to cook the Dutch oven dinner for tonight.  I did go
to town and get Jeff some Lime Diet Coke and some ice.  I also bought me
another frozen yogurt.  I had trouble getting the fire hot enough to cook on
but I had dinner ready before Mae and all of them returned.  It cooled off quite
a lot this evening.  We sure enjoy having the heater in the trailer.  Mae and
Gail went to Springdale and paid to take showers.  They brought me a token for
tomorrow but it was to late this evening.</span></p>

being able to come down with us.  They went back to their camp and started
packing to go home.  I took a shower in the camp trailer.  Gail, Benji, Mae and
I attended Sacrament meeting in Springdale.  While we were gone Jeff filled the
water tank, did dishes and packed their things so they were about ready to
leave for home.  We ate the rest of the Dutch oven dinner left over from last
night.  After eating Jeff, Gail and Benji soon left for home.  I took a nap and
Mae read.  Mae and I then packed us a lunch and we went on the Park Shuttle to
the Narrows and took the River Walk.  We got off the shuttle where we could see
Angles Landing and I explained where Jeff and I hiked yesterday.  We then caught
the next shuttle and road on up to the Narrows.  We hiked the trail to the
nerror’s and returned back to the shuttle.  It was dark when we got back to our
trailer so we soon went to bed.  It is sure nice to be alone with my
sweetheart.  </span></p>
