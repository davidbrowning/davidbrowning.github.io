<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke about
6 AM and started getting ready.  We cooked fish, potato patties and hot cakes
for breakfast.  After finishing breakfast and getting cleaned up we all went
down to the lake.  Mae backed the boat into the lake and did a very good job
again.  Mae and Shauna kept Emily and Connor on the beach for them to play,
while Tyler and I went out in the boat fishing.  We fished for sometime with
out catching anything.  About 11 AM I caught a fish right after I said a prayer
in my hart that Tyler might catch a fish.  I let Tyler take my pole and bring
the fish in.  I caught two more and again let Tyler bring them in.  When I
caught the forth fish I brought it in myself.  Having four fish I called Mae to
have her come to get the fish.  She then called me back and said that she,
Shauna, Emily and Connor wanted to go out fishing with us.  We went out again
but didn’t find the fish in the area where we had earlier.  We did move further
South where Mae and Tyler had several strikes but didn’t get any into the
boat.  We gave up about 2 PM and quite for the day.  Mae backed the trailer
into the lake again to get the boat.  She is getting very good a doing this. 
While Tyler and I cleaned the fish, Mae and Shauna wiped the boat down.  We
fixed lunch when we got back to our camp sight.  After eating, Shauna and the
children left for home.  Mae and I took a nap for about an hour.  We then
played a game of Domino’s.  Mae beat me by 3 points after 7 rounds.  We then
cleaned out the coolers and prepared dinner.  It was late when we finished and
did the dishes.  I caught my journal up before we went to bed.  We also played
a couple of games on the computer before we went to bed.  It seems to be
relaxing to do this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up at
3 AM because the trailer was cold.  We had ran out of gas in the one tank so I
switched over to the other one.  The furnace came back on and I was able to
soon go back to sleep.  Mae however was not able to go back to sleep for quite
a while.  When I woke up I tried to let Mae sleep a little longer.  I worked on
the material take off for Jeff &amp; Gail’s addition.  Mae woke about 8 AM and
we prepared breakfast.  I worked longer on the material take off.  It was about
11 AM when we went out in the boat.  We searched for an area where fish showed
on the finder and then started fishing.  I caught the first 3 fish so I traded
Mae poles.  Mae then started catching fish.  She had caught three and then we
went quite a while with out catching another.  I asked her if we should call it
a day and she said we should stay a little longer.  it was cute that she wanted
to finish catching our limit before giving up.  She finally caught two more
fish which gave us our 8 fish limit.  We then started back in but it was so
pretty out on the lake that Mae wanted to go for a ride.  We rode around for a
little while before coming in.  Mae is doing very well at backing the boat now
but the dock was full of boaters loading and unloading so she asked it I would
get the trailer.  Mae cleaned the boat while I cleaned the fish.  I had a
couple of people ask me about our catch.  Three little girls and a little boy
came and watched me clean the fish and they had lots of questions about them. 
When we got to the camp we got some dinner and while eating we decided to pack
up and go home this evening.  It was about 8:30 PM for home and on the way
stopped in Morgan and Kim brought the artificial flowers that we had put on the
graves last Monday to us.  he had gone up and gathered them up as Monday the
care takers will just throw them in the trash.  We visited with Kim for quite a
while before we finally got in the truck and said that we had to get home. 
Again the drive was slow as anything over 45 MPH would start the trailers
switching back and forth.  It was almost mid-night when we got home and things
unloaded and put away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were woke
this morning by a phone call from Sister Smith.  She is not going to be here
for the first part of Nursery as they are going to attend a Priesthood
Ordination in Salt Lake.  That put the pressure on to prepare for doing the
Nursery by our self.  Anny Provert was there and one of the mothers came in
with her son who is about old enough to come to nursery and her husband and she
helped us also.  We had 13 children there today but it went pretty good. 
Sister Smith got there in time to give the lesson.  We were tired when we
finished.  Fast meeting was good and although I was tired I did manage to stay
awake.  Patriarch Johnstun boar his testimony about ½ way through and there was
a better Spirit after that.  Several smale children had came to the podium and
really only came to play.  Parents should not let them do that until they are
old enough to know what they are there for.  The Mitchel boy boar his testimony
and though it was brief, he did a very good job of it.  Bob prepared a nice
diner that we ate after the meetings.  I was concerned about the weather so I
put the boat and the camp trailer under the canapé.  I worked on my journal
getting what I have written this year printed off and but in a binder.  I had
Mae edit the month of March as that consists of our trip to Israel and I wanted
her input.  That took some time in correcting, mainly spelling errors, miss use
of words and typing errors.  After that, I finished this entry.  The evening
was gone and almost mid-night before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I tried to
work on sending Jeff and Gail’s plans to Steve Vaughan of HiCaliber Inc. to
have them bid cost for the addition.  I had E-mailed them a set of the Auto Cad
files but they were not able to read the file.  I called there office and told
them I would send them a PDF file.  After hanging up, I worked for some time
trying to make a PDF file, with out success.  Jeff came over and got my
computer and took it with him to see if he could help fix the problem of making
a PDF file.  In the evening I gave up and went to the store and bought fishing
items.  I looked all over for some pop-gear and had little success with that. 
Mae trimmed the yard after Bob had mowed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 4:30 AM and got ready to go fishing.  I let Mae sleep in as she hadn’t
slept Monday evening.  At 5:45 AM Kip Michales and his son, Dallon, came and we
hooked my boat to his car.  We drove up to East Canon Reservoir and were on the
lake about 8 AM.  Kip and Dallon caught the first three fish and then I caught
the next 5 fish.  We were on the lake about five hours.  It was a lot of fun.  When
I got home I filleted the fish and packaged them.  I hadn’t finished very long
when Bob and Carroll came down stairs.  Irven and Sandy came a few minuets
later.  Mae had prepared a very nice dinner and invited them down.  Mark was
also invited but he went some where and didn’t return in time to eat with us. 
We then watched the Republican Presidential Debate on TV.  I was upset by the
time it was finished as I felt the CNN reporters totally controlled the debate
to move it in the direction they wanted.  Before going to bed Mae and I watched
the Nun Story on DVD.  Audry Hepburn stared in the movie and played a very good
part but the shoe left you with a funny feeling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Not having my
computer really put me at a disadvantage in trying to get the material take-off
as well as not being able to send the file to HiCalibar.  I called Jeff and he
said he would bring my computer over at lunch.  He didn’t come and at 2 PM I
called him and we met ½ way.  I stopped at the grocery store for some groceries
for Mae.  I then went to the gas station for gas and a frozen yogurt.  While
there Mae called and needed me to stop at the store for some salad.  She was
preparing dinner for when the Dugan’s came.  Bob helped me and we worked on the
water storage.  I came in just before Bryan and Sammy got here at 8 PM we ate
and then played games and visited until late.  Mark brought down a letter that
was in the mail today.  It was our investment policy from American Investors
Life Insurance Co.  That is very interesting as both Mae and I have been
worrying about that investment.  It was mid-night when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had to get
up at 7 AM as we had the furnace co. coming to clean the furnace ducts.  Mae
made a very nice breakfast that we all enjoyed.  The Elders called me and ask
if I could give them a ride.  Bryon went with me and after taking the Elders
from the chapel that they had held a meeting in, back to there apartment, we
went up to the 7-Eleven in Sunset to get gas in Bryon’s car.  We enjoyed the opportunity
to visit.  We visited and played games all morning and then this afternoon we
drove over to Kaysville to the Artic Circle and bought lunch.  When we returned
home, Mae had to leave to go Visiting Teaching and Bryon and Sammy then left to
go up to Kim and Jeanenne’s.  After they left I got on the computer to again
try to figure out the process of creating a PDF file.  After spending some
unsuccessful time I called Scott.  He asked if Mae and I could come over to
their place at 7 PM, and he could then help me.  We did and he was able to get
the program to work.   We got home just after 10 PM.  I made my journal entry
before we went to bed.  Mae isn’t feeling the best this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6:30 AM.  I studied my scriptures before taking a shower and shaving. 
Mae was up by then.  We took a walk this morning.  I then cooked fish for
breakfast.  I worked on the computer most of the day.  I was able to send Jeff
and Gail’s plans to HiCaliber for a estimate using the Quad-Lock building
system.  Craig Sherman called and said he was about two weeks out in being
ready for the rest of his order.  I worked on it quite a bit today.  He wants
me to build the distribution manifold so I will need to get started on that.  Mae
balanced the bank statements today.  I worked on Jeff &amp; Gail’s for a while
today.  This evening Mae and I watched two shows on TV before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When I read
my scriptures this morning I read 3 Nephi 8, 9 &amp; 10.  They were so
interesting that I could not stop.  This part is concerning the destruction
that came here on the American continent after the crucifixion of Jesus
Christ.  I couldn’t help but wonder if there will be many that will say as the
Nephi’s did, “Oh if we had only listened to the Prophets and not cast them
out!”  I feel that the time is drawing close to the second coming of Christ. 
Mae and I went walking this morning before we ate breakfast.  Bob came down and
asked for my help in repairing his cabinet draws so that took over an hour.  I
just started on our water storage when Gary Nelson came and visited for an over
a hour.  I worked on our water storage until almost 8 PM before quitting.  Mae
went grocery shopping and came home with some fried chicken for dinner.  This
evening we went upstairs and played Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Bob and I
won this evening.  It was 11:30 PM before we got to bed this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did sleep
in this morning but Bob called us as breakfast of biscuits and grave was ready
at 8:50 AM.  They were very good.  Bob and Carroll went to Roberts and then to
Bruce’s today so then didn’t attend meeting in our Ward.  After breakfast Mark
and I visited for a while.  I did take a short nap before we went to meetings. 
Nursery seemed extra hard today although we just had 12 children.  We had two
new ones today that weren’t happy with parents leaving them.  We had one or
more crying most of the time.  We are sure tired by the time the 2 hours are
over.  Even though I was tired I did enjoy Sacrament Meeting.  We stayed after
Sacrament meeting for choir practice.  I am sure having a hard time singing
anymore so I’m not enjoying the choir.  I just feel that they need the
support.  We left from the church house and went straight to Scott and
Mishelle’s.  We ate dinner with them and then they went to a special meeting
where there Stake re-organized all the Ward boundaries.  Mae and I , and it was
mainly Mae, tended their children while they attended the special meeting.  It
was 9:30 PM when we got home.  I took the trash out to the street and then came
in and entered this journal entry.  We went to bed about 10 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM and at 7 AM Durk Bailey called me. I had planned on finishing the water
storage this morning but with Durk’s call I told him that I would come to his
place.  I had called him last week and he returned the call.  I set a time of 9
AM to meet with him to go over the heat plans for Craig and Carla.  Mae really got
on me because I am still working on Jeff and Gail’s.  That really upset me as I
don’t know what else to do but to finish Craig and Carla’s.  I left very
upset.  I did get some help that saved quite a lot of work and also will save
Craig and Carla some money.  I went over to Durk’s Plumbing and ordered the
rest of the materials for the heat system.  I came home and spent the rest of
the day working on Jeff and Gail’s.  At 5 PM I quite and helped Mae finish
getting ready for Grinn and Kathleen to come for dinner and spend the evening. 
Mae made a nice dinner and we played Crocket.  We then came in and played a
couple of hands of Knock. Grinn is trying to get us to put in for a mission
call to Denmark as the office couple.  They will be going there in September
and the couple that is in the office will be returning in March.  I think I
would like to do that but whether or not the truss that Uncle Dale set up will
cover that or not we don’t know and Mae hasn’t decided.  It was a good evening
and we got to bed shortly after 10 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I needed to
make a change on Jeff and Gail’s plans which I thought of during the night.  I
was until noon getting my material list in order and after lunch I went
pricing.  I was until 5 PM before I returned.  We decided to quite for the day
and relax.  We watched a couple of shows on TV.  The one was “The Hiding Place”,
which is a true story of a family in Holland that when Germany came into Holland
and took over, this family helped Jewish people escape from the German police
force.  It showed the prison condition that took place after the family was
captured.  The torture and the living conditions that the people went through
are almost unbelievable.  It made you think as to the near future with the
degradation of our government and the loss of our Constitution.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep well last night and didn’t feel good this morning.  Bob, Carroll, Mark
&amp; I went to a breakfast for the Old Folks.  It was held at the Clinton City
Park.  It was enjoyable but poorly attended.   When we got back Mae was just
ready to go over to Georgia’s to spend the day with her.  Bob and Carroll had
places to go so they were off.  Mark asked about spraying the garden for
insects so I cleaned the spray tank and mixed the pesticide for him.  By the
time I got on the computer it was noon.  I filled in my journal catching it up
to this point as I hadn’t filled it in last night.  I worked most of the
afternoon on the material estimation sheets.  The last one was the main
material list and I had it just about completed and I pushed the wrong button
and lost it.  I hadn’t saved the document as I went along and it got me.  Mae
came home about that time from Georgia’s so I quite for the day and we ate
dinner.  After eating Mae and I went for a walk.  This evening we watched a
couple of shows on TV.  The one was ½ way through and the other was “Murder she
wrote.  While watching the shows I filled capsules with my Mannatech products. 
I finished my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

6:30 AM and let Mae sleep.  We went for a walk shortly after 8 and came back
and prepared breakfast.  We had fried some eggs and toasted some waffles just
as Bob came down and said he had hot waffles ready.  We traded and they were
good.  I worked on Jeff ands Gail’s plans and got them priced out.  I planed a
2 X 4 down for Bob so that he has a 15/16 X 2 ½ board to repair his cabinet
drawers.  I have nothing scheduled for tomorrow so I called Randy and we are
going fishing.  I got some worms this evening and then worked on my pickup
getting the lights mounted on the back of the truck so I can have more light
back there for hooking up trailers in the dark.  I finished about the time
Mae’s book group broke up.  Mae had worked all day on the house and yard in
preparation for the book group.</span></p>

AM and picked up Randy at 5 AM.  We went up to East Canon Reservoir fishing. 
We took Randy’s dog with us and he was very good in the boat.  Fishing was slow
but by 1 PM  I had caught 6 fish and Randy had caught 2 giving us our limits
for the day.  It was about 5 PM when I got home.  I had to shower and change in
a hurry so we could leave for Jeff and Gail’s.  we were to be there by 6:30 PM
but Gary called and visited with me for a while.  We still got there in time
for dinner.  Trent, Anna and their four children were there.  It was good to
see them as it has been some time since we have been with them.  After eating
and visiting Trent and his family left and Jeff then put on a movie.  I fell
asleep the entire time.  It was 1 AM when we got home.</span></p>

AM as Bob was going to have breakfast of fish and biscuits ready at 8 AM.  I
decided to let Mae sleep in so I disconnected the phone, closed the window
blinds and shout the door.  Bob knocked on the wall at 7:50 PM before I got up
to tell him not to knock and it woke Mae so she got up and came upstairs for
breakfast with us.  The fish was very good.    It was 9:30 AM before I got to
Randy’s so we could go up to his cabin to repair some copper pipe for him.  It
was 5 PM when I got home.  I was going to hook up a water line to fill our
storage tanks but I repaired my fishing reel instead.  The parts I needed came
in the mail today.  we then went to Artic Circle and had a fish sandwich for
dinner and then went to Scott and Mishelle’s.  Today is Kylan’s Birthday and
Ashley’s Birthday was Thursday so we took them gifts and visited with them for
a while.  It was 9:30 PM when we got home so I filled in my journal while Mae worked
on picture books.  We went to bed about 10:30 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 7:30 AM.  Mae was already up and in the front room.  I read 2<sup>nd</sup>
Nephi 29 this morning during my scripture study.  I thought of the family
across the street when we were on our mission.  The man visited very often with
me but his wife although she seemed friendly always seemed afraid to talk to us
because we were Mormon missionaries.  Anyway he asked me a couple of times
about our own Bible.  I tried to show him that we used the same Bible that he
used.  He said that our Bible was much thicker than his.  I showed him that we
had four books combined in one cover for convenience to carry with us but sowed
him the size of just the Bible compared to him.  He then asked about the added
foot notes and I show him how they were just commentary for added help but the
words of each verse were exactly the same as his Bible.  We never did get much
further with them than that but maybe some day.  As Nephi explained “A Bible, A
Bible, we have a Bible.”  I thought of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae gave me a
Lazer Measuring Tool for a Fathers Day gift.  I saw one of these tools used by
the salesmen that came to sell Bob and Carroll a Central Air unit.  I need to
play with it more but it is very interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                David called
to wish me a Happy Fathers-Day and we visited about his experiences with his
company and the assignment he is doing for the company.  He said he really
isn’t enjoying it and doesn’t want to do it again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                 Nursery was
busy today but Sister Smith asked me to wrap the hand prints.  She thought that
the children would enjoy helping but most of them did not like it at all.  I
wrapped most of them but it gave me something to do that was different.  I felt
a little guilty not helping with the children more but it was a relief.  I was
sure tired during Sacrament meeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mike was
trying to get the last of the dinner ready when we got home.  He hadn’t
realized that the stove had the one plate that had a switch on it and he
couldn’t get it to heat up.  With Mike hare, Jeff and Gail came and Sandi came
for dinner.  Scott and Kylan came over to visit and wish me a happy
Fathers-Day.  Shellie called to wish e a happy Fathers-Day.  Most of the kids
went together to buy me a fishing reel but Sportsman’s Warehouse was out of
them so Jeff just bought a gift certificate instead.   We played games for a
while.  Mike helped get some things worked out on my computers and my palm
pilot while he was here.  Sandi stayed after the rest left and visited and
looked through the photo albums Mae has been working on.  It was good to have
her here but we were concerned to have her drive so far this late at night.  It
was late when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
but after getting up we went the rest of the day.  Bob prepared waffles for
breakfast and after eating Mae and I went for a walk.  I then put pesticide
around Mae’s rose bush and sprayed the fruit trees and garden with pesticide. 
I treated the Lilac bushes as they looked like grub worms are getting to them. 
Mae was on the inter-net for quite a while today.  I took a nap after lunch and
then I worked on the water storage.  We had some leaks and also the air vent
lines are not working right so I will have to change the lines.  Bob and I
picked the peas.  Mae went to the grocery store and bought some strawberries
that we will have to put up in the morning.  Mae and I shelled about ½ of the
peas, blanched what we had shelled and put them in the freezer.  I just had
time for Mae to give me a haircut and then I took a shower before Gary Nelson
and Margo came to go out with us this evening.  We went to Sizzler to eat and
then came back to our place and played games and visited for a while.  Gary and
Margo left about 11:45 PM.  I filled out my journal before we went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM so that we might put up strawberry jam before we left this morning. 
Bob had put up his strawberries so we got our ready and I took them upstairs
and used Bob’s mixer to grind the berry’s the same as what Bob did.  He mixed a
clear jell into the sugar and then mixed it into the berries.  We made about 9
pints of no cook jam.  It only took about and hour total time.  Mae and I then
got cleaned up.  We went to Denny’s in Layton and had breakfast.  After eating
Mae drove the car while I took a nap.  We went to the Salt Lake Temple.  We
enjoyed a wonderful session.  As I was changing I noticed a young man and the
clothing bag that he had.  His father said that his wife had bought them from
the Deseret Store.  We went over to the store but they were a little on the
expensive side and Mae didn’t want one so we didn’t get them.  We went to the
Lion’s House and had dinner.  We then went to the Gate Way mall, to the Barns
&amp; Noble book store where Mae bought two DC sets.  We came on home and
changed clothes and then went over to Jeff and Gail’s to help celebrate Benji’s
1<sup>st</sup> Birthday.  It was 10:30 PM before we got home.  Bob had bought
three cases of Strawberry’s for me as Sandi wanted two cases of them and Mae
wants one more case.  I filled in this journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The Barn’s
woke us at 7:30 AM asking for directions to the onion patch.  I had to have
them call Mark for I haven’t been down there yet.  Bob and I went down to the
onion patch at 9:30 AM and weeded for about an hour.  I found the problem with
the TV antenna lines and repaired that.  I went over to Sportsman Warehouse and
bought a fishing reel with the gift certificate the kids gave me for Fathers
Day along with a few other fishing items.  I then went to Durk’s and bought
some parts to re-plumb the water storage tanks.  I got the boat ready to go for
tomorrow.  I re-plumbed the water tanks and brought the water distiller out to
the garage and hooked it up.  There are still some leaks in the tanks lines but
I think they will seal them self in time.  I went over to the church to help
set up tables and chairs for the Relief Society program this evening but when I
got there it was all done.  I watched a good show on TV this evening.  Mae was
gone to the Relief Society program.  Bryant Holt called and is unable to go
fishing in the morning because of his work.  I asked Mark if he wants to go and
he does.  Mae also has some changes in my schedule but she will not know what
those will be until Georgia calls her tomorrow.  I filled in my journal and we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 AM so I could be ready to leave for fishing at 7 AM.  I had woke at 1:30
AM the first time and thought it was 5:30 but I was able to go back to sleep. 
Mark had forgotten that his fishing license had expired so he ran down to
Wal-Mart and bought one.  We picked up Irven and were off.  We got to East Canon
Reservoir t 8 AM.  Fishing was slow, we fished all day and got of the lake at 8
PM.  I had caught three nice fish and Mark caught three fish but Irven did not
land one although he did have some good strikes.  I traded him poles and
outfits but it just didn’t woke for him.  I think he had a good day any way.  I
gave my fish to Irven.  It was 8:30 PM when I came in the house.  It sure made
it a lot easier to back the boat into the storage with the lights on my
pickup.  Mae has been gone most of the afternoon as she visited with Robin
Walker, Sandy Browning and Tina Linderman this afternoon.  She got home at 10
PM.  I took a shower and shaved before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I worked on
getting information for Randy most of the morning.  I went down this afternoon
and talked about his projects and while down there he gave me a treatment.  Mae
tended Benjamin this afternoon for Gail while she went into work.  This evening
we went up to Honeyville to Robert and Patty’s daughters wedding reception.  Rich,
Lois and Elise were there.  They had came down from Pocatello.  They are sure
very supportive of most family events.  We came home and watched the movie
“Funny Face” with Audry Hepburn and Fred Astair.  Although it was a older movie
neither of us remembers having seen it before.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob prepared
breakfast of biscuits and gravy this morning.  I helped Mae get ready to pick
peas and then I went over to Scott’s and painted their back fence.  With the
spray gun it went very well and quite fast.  I also helped Scott straighten up
the basket ball standard.  It had tipped guite a ways from being level and sure
looked funny.  I stopped at Durk’s and picked up quite a few supplies to start
on the distribution section of the heat system for Craig and Carla.  I was
tired and so when I got home I set down.  We watched a cute show on TV before
going to Jennie and Robin Porter’s sons wedding reception.  We stopped at the
store for a few groceries and at the Maverik station for a frozen yogurt.  I
filled out my journal entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 6
AM but soon went back to sleep.  It was about 7 AM when I got up and stayed
up.  I studied for some time.  After breakfast I called and made an appointment
with Fallis’s for Bob and me to go Home Teaching to them.  We went over at noon
and were there for a ½ hour.  We went by Casy’s but no one was home.  We have
an appointment with the Johnston’s to see them tomorrow.  Nursery went quite
well but we were still very tired when it was over.  After Sacrament meeting I
helped put chairs away and then I attended a meeting with the committee to plan
the High Priest social.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got home.  David,
Shauna and the children came for dinner and to visit for the evening.  It was
David and Shauna’s 13<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary today.  We had a wonderful
evening with them tonight.  After they left, I filled out my journal and we
soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
fairly early so that Mae could go to Randy’s for a treatment.  I enjoyed
studying for a while in 2 Nephi 31.  I am sure grateful for the Book of Mormon
along with the other scriptures that gives me hope and guidance in this life. 
I don’t know how anyone survives with the way things are going unless they just
close their minds to the things that are going around us.   I started working
on Craig and Carla’s distribution manifold.  I took my boat out of the storage
and set up my saw horses so I could work in out of the sun.  At noon I came in
and ate lunch and at 1 PM Bob and I went Home Teaching to the Johnstun’s.  they
are sure a neat couple to associate with.  Bob and I then went to Durk’s where
I picked up more parts for the manifold.  I worked on it until 6:30 PM when Mae
called me for dinner.  After eating Bob and I went over to Casey’s where we
made our normal visit from the porch.  I did get their birth dates again from
him after loosing them when I lost my palm pilot.  After going back home I
called and gave my report to Sister Murdock as Brother Murdock is out of town. 
This evening Mae and I watched “Phantom of the Opera”.  I had recorded it a few
nights ago, whoever the tape had ran out the last 10 minutes of the show so we
missed the ending.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM so that I could get Bob when he took his car over to have it repaired.  Mae
hadn’t slept very well so I was going to let her sleep.  However Bob called at
6:45 AM to see if I had left yet.  It woke Mae and she got up.  After getting
Bob I had some breakfast and then I worked the rest of the day on Craig and
Carla’s project.  Jeff came over and ate lunch with us.  He has some attitudes
about life that sure concerns us but I don’t know how to approach him.  Bob
helped me quite a while.  I had planned on going fishing with Kip but he called
and said that it was reported that it was very slow, so we decided not to go
now.  I was able to get the first half of the manifold put together and soldered. 
It was 7:30 PM when I went into the house as we had Home Teacher this evening. 
Mae and I went outside and finished up some yard work.  Scott called with some
concerns about Jeff and is going over to try to talk with him.  We then got
some super ready and went into our room and watched a movie.  It was titled “Behold
a Pale Horse” staring Gregoty Peck and Anthony Quinn but it didn’t end making
much since to us.  I filled out my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM although I had wanted to sleep longer.  As I studied 2 Nephi 32 I felt great
sadness and worry over Jeff and David.  I decided to fast for them but as often
happen this evening we planned to go to dinner and the Temple with the
McPhie’s.  I did fast until then.  I was busy getting things ready to go
tomorrow.  I changed the bladder in the Big Mable tub so we can use it Thursday
and Friday.  I also got other camping items ready.  I went over to Durk’s and
got a couple of items and asked some more questions.  On the way home I washed
the car.  I showered and changed and at 5:15 PM we picked up Brother and Sister
McPhie.  We ate dinner at the Temple cafeteria before going through a session. 
There were 25 from our Ward there in the session this evening.  After the
session several of us went over to Farr’s ice cream and after getting our order
we set out side at the tables and visited.  It was 10:30 PM when we got home. 
I filled out my journal and also down loaded the pictures that were on our
camera.  Mae got some more things ready for our trip tomorrow.  Bob called me
to tell me that Sheryl had called to let us know that she will be going through
the Temple Saturday afternoon.  I am sorry that we will have the conflict with
Brad being baptized at that same afternoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 6
AM so we could get ready to go.  We were packed and ready to go by 8:30 but
Rick and Georgia weren’t there yet so I ran down to Checker Auto and got a
hitch pin.  Rick and Georgia were there when I got back so we hooked the boat
on to Rick’s pickup and he pulled it.  We stopped to get gas and then came on
up to Camper World at Coleville.  After setting up camp we ate lunch.  We
enjoyed visiting and playing games.  We went to the swimming pool and enjoyed
that for a couple of hours.  We cooked hamburgers for dinner along with salads
and chips.  Rick cut some willows and we cooked some marshmallows before coming
into the trailer and playing more games.  It was after midnight before we got
to bed but we have sure had a good day.  We were sure glad that we had the
furnace as the evening got very cooled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up at
8 AM and went to use the rest room.  The rest were still asleep.  When Georgia
got up she went to take a pill.  I was typing a letter on my computer and
wasn’t really lessoning to her but she said something about Oscar Meyer being
made out of pig gut.  I said “No, they don’t make them with pig gut any more.” 
Georgia came back with, “Yes they do, I looked them up on the internet and that
is what it said”.  I then said, “No they haven’t made hot dogs with pig gut
since I was about 10 years old”.  Georgia then said “What are you talking about
hot dogs for; I’m talking about thyroid pills”.  We got quite a laugh over our
mis-understanding of Oscar Meyer.  We had fish, fried potatoes and eggs for breakfast. 
After breakfast was over Rick and I went up and got the boat.  Mae and Georgia
prepared a lunch to take with us and we went to the reservoir.  We blow up the Great
Big Mabel float tub and really had a good time.  We did have some problems when
we tried to get away from the dock as the wind was blowing us into the dock. 
Rick and Georgia got on the tub and I asked Mae to let the tow rope out as I
tried to maneuver the boat away from the dock.  With the wind blowing I was
busy trying to keep control.  Mae got the rope tangled around her foot and
while trying to get it undone it pulled her hand into the fishing pole holders
and tour the skin quite deep.  It was good that we had a first aid kit on the
boat.  We were able to get the wound cleaned and covered.  Later while Georgia
and I were on the tub and Rick was driving the boat, Rick turned a 360 and when
we hit our own wake it really jolted both Georgia and I.  after boating for a
while we dropped the anchor and ate lunch out in the middle of the lake.  Mae
and I actually set on the Big Mabel while we ate.   After eating we took the
tub back and deflated it and put it away and then went boating for a while.  We
then came back to the camp ground where we stored the boat.  We went swimming
in the swimming pool and took showers.  For dinner Rick and I roasted hot dogs
over a bond fire while Mae and Georgia got the rest of the food ready.  We ate
dinner and cleaned up.  We again played games until after mid-night.  This has
really been a good day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up
about 7:30 AM thinking that Rick must have an alarm that was going off.  I
don’t know where it was coming from but I was concerned that he wasn’t getting
up.  Mae finally spoke to him and he said he didn’t need to leave until almost
9 AM.  He has a Singles Ward activity to be to this morning.  Rick took the
boat down with him and the rest of us stayed longer and ate breakfast before
finishing packing to return home.  When we took Georgia home Rick was through
with the activity and cleaning up.  I hooked the boat on behind the camp
trailer.  Georgia had us stay for lunch.  When we crossed the Rail Road tracks
the boat trailer came disconnected for the camp trailer.  I am not sure as the
lock was still hooked but this is the second time this has happened.  Two men
near by helped me hook it back us and we came on home.  We had to hurry in
order to get ready to go out to Tooele to attend Brad Carrie’s Baptismal service. 
That was very special and most of our children came to support him.  Brad
invited every one to come to their home for hamburgers.  I volunteered to cook
the hamburgers for them.  It was a very nice time and they had many from their
ward come to support them.  Mae and I were the last to leave as we enjoyed
visiting with Brad and JaNae so much.  It was late and I had asked Mae earlier
if she could drive home as I was so tired.  When we started to leave I realized
how dark it was so I told Mae that she should stop and I would drive.  Mae
insisted that she was ok and continued to drive.  At the next stop sign I again
told her to wait and I would trade her places.  She again insisted that she
could do it and went on.  It upset me and I thought to my self that I would
just let her.  But at the next stop sign I felt instance that I should drive so
I got out of the car.  Again she said that she could drive at least to Tooele. 
I just walked around the car and opened the door for her.  I drove from there. 
Just as we came into Tooele a large car sped from a parking lot on the left
side of the road, in front of an on coming car and right towards our car.  I
saw the car coming out the side of my eye and instinctively whirled the wheel
to the right.  Our car started to skid and I saw obstacles and curbing coming
to my right and had to swerve back to the left.  The car made it between me and
the oncoming car and went on with out stopping or even slowing down.  All was
ok but I shook for the next mile or so amazed at how close we came to a serious
accident.  How greatful we were that I had felt prompted to take over the
driving.  We felt that Mae, with her bad night vision, probably could not have
maneuvered the car to have avoided an accident.  We came on home but at the
Lagoon area the traffic came to almost a complete stop for road construction. 
We were another ½ hour getting past that area.  We got home just before
mid-night and I had to do some more unpacking from the camping trip and then
move the truck and boat off the lawn so the water can come on.  We were tired
when we got to bed.</span></p>
