<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about 2AM
and didn’t go back to sleep until after Mae woke up and she talked me into
going back to sleep for a while.  I had set in the recliner and when that
didn’t work I tried to lie on the floor and use the Chie machine.  Lying that
way caused me to even have a greater headache.  I tried to find something on TV
but that was mainly trash.  I did watch a movie produced in 1950 so that was an
ok movie.  I then couldn’t find anything else so I watched a rerun of a BYU vs
USU Football game.  I was back up at 10:30 AM and took care of the animals
while Mae prepared breakfast.  Bob and I checked on a new package of services
for our TV channels.  I think we are going to change our provider.  This
evening Mae and I went to a lunching for those that served missions in the Philippines.  We picked up the Clark’s on the way.  We also met the Hyers when we got
there.  It was late when we got home and about 11:30
 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at 6AM. 
Mae went up to David’s to tend Connor and to get Tyler and Emily off to
school.  I fed the animals and then Bob and I got the boat ready to leave.  We
stopped and got fuel for the pickup and boat.   We then went to Dick’s Boats
and bought some oil for the out rigger controls as the reserve showed that it
was low.  We stopped at Stoddard where we bought some worms before going on to
East Cannon Reservoir.  I didn’t check the time but it was probably after 10AM
when we got on the lake.  Fishing was a little slow but by 2PM
we had our limits.  Bob had caught 5 and I caught 3.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> fish
that Bob caught was a very nice one that measured over 19 inches.  After
getting home Bob and I cleaned the fish and just put them in our refrigerator
for now.  Mae had dinner ready and after eating she and I left for American
Fork to watch our grandson David play football.  We left home before 5:30
 PM so thought we had plenty of time.  However when we got to the South end of
I-215 to merge back onto I-15 traffic became very congested and slow.  Even
when we got onto the highway to High Land the traffic was still congested.  We
had not remembered that there was a football game at BYU, so between that game
and road construction it took us until almost 8PM
to get there. They were playing Lone Peak High School at Lone Peak. 
American Fork isn’t having a very good year and that is really causing frustration
for Mike.  He had made a deal with David that if David would really get in and
work at football and keep his grades up, Mike would cover his school and
football expenses, let David use their pickup as if it was his own and Mike
would pay for the fuel and expenses on the truck.  Mike felt that David had the
talent and ability to earn a Collage Scholarship that would pay for all of
David’s collage education.  However David is not really trying because the team
is not really working together.  Mike feels that most of the teams problem is
due to the coach but David isn’t trying.  I have very mixed feelings about the
situation.  David has the size and strength to be a great football player but I
am not sure that his drive isn’t coming from Mike.  Mike loved the game but was
forced out of it because of knee injury in his senior year.  We left the game
early so that we might beat the traffic home.  Mike called us shortly after we
left and told us that the score ended the same as when we left, 24 to 6 in
favor of Loan Peak.  It was late when we got home.  I started to make this
entry but fell asleep at the keyboard, so we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until almost 8AM.  I got up and filet two fish and took them up to Bob.  He
made breakfast of fish, biscuits and gravy for the four of us.  Mark had gone
to check on his property down south.  He borrowed our camera to try and get
some pictures to show the court in this lawsuit over right a way to the
property.  Bob had a talk with Mark yesterday to let him know that they would
prefer that Mark make other arrangements for a place to live.  I am not sure
just what is right but I know that Bob and Carroll are getting tired of having
Mark with them.  After breakfast Bob and Carroll went to a funeral of a friend
of theirs.  Bob became acquainted with Duke when he worked at the hospital.  Mae
and I came downstairs and watched General Conference.  I filet the remainder of
the fish and sealed them for freezing.  I took 3 of them up and put in Bob’s
fridge for them.  We enjoyed conference both morning and afternoon sessions. 
Mae did some house work and we prepared some green peppers to dry.  Mae helped
me put the boat away.  We also checked the red hen and found that she had been
pecked and her come was bleeding.  I think it is the rooster that is doing this
to the hens.  We put her out of the run so it can heal up.  I think that we had
better butcher the rooster.  Also I checked the rabbits, as the doe hasn’t had
her kits.  I found that she was in heat so put her back in with the buck.  I
don’t understand what is happening with them but maybe the buck is sterile. 
This evening I went to the Priesthood Session of Conference.  When I left for
the meeting Mae was out side trimming the lawn.  When I got home Mae was busy
cleaning cupboards.  She finished and took her shower while I went out and
checked the chickens.  I couldn’t find where the red hen is.  Mae took her
shower and after she got out she realized that her wedding rings are missing. 
We looked around the house but they may have come off while she was trimming
yards.  They have become loose on her finger as she has lost so much weight.  It
is too late to look tonight so we just went to bed with a prayer that we might
find them tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, October 04, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
late this morning so while Mae prepared breakfast I took care of the chickens
and rabbits.  I am some what frustrated with our rabbits as I have put the oldest
doe in with the buck twice now and she still hasn’t had kits.  I am concerned
about the 2<sup>nd</sup> doe as she has been breed twice but hasn’t had kits
yet.  She is due on the middle of Oct. again.  We are also concerned with the
chickens.  Both of the white chickens have had their heads pecked until they
have been bleeding.  I put them outside the coop to let them heal but now I am
unable to find their nests.  Saturday the red hen was bleeding from her comb so
I put her out of the pen.  To night I couldn’t find where the red hen is
roosting.  I checked the white hens last night and both are laying eggs.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was
raining to hard this morning to look for Mae’s rings.  Bob had prepared dinner
between conference sessions and by the time we got back downstairs the
afternoon session was starting.  All the talks and music was great but Elder
Jeffery R. Holland gave one of the strongest testimonies of the Book of Mormon
that I have ever heard.  I would like that talk given at my funeral just for my
family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I want to
record what happened with Mae’s wedding ring set.  I mentioned that Saturday
when I went to General Priesthood meeting, Mae was out side trimming the yard. 
Not only did she trim the lawns but then she started pulling weeds from the
rose bushes in front.  She also dug out weeds and grass that was growing in the
cracks of the driveway.  She worked until dark and then gathered up the weeds
she had pulled and put them in the trash cans. When I got home she had just got
out of the shower.  As she got dressed she realized that her wedding rings were
missing.  It was to late to look much Saturday evening, so after conference I
went out and took all the trash out of the first trashcan.  Mae had put trash
in both cans, so after replacing the trash back in the first can I took it out
to the front curb as Monday Morning is trash pickup day.  On the way back,
planning to go through the trash in the 2<sup>nd</sup> can, I decided to look
around the roses in the front.  During this time Mae had gone in the bedroom
and knelt in prayer, asking Heavenly Father’s help.  She had said that we might
not know where to look but Heavenly Father know where her rings were.  I didn’t
have any luck around the rose bushes so started back for the 2<sup>nd</sup>
can.  As I got half way across the driveway, I felt that I should look out in
the driveway.  I walked about 10 feet down the driveway and there laid the
rings.  I had to look closely at them as they were covered with dirt and
weeds.  I brought them in and called Mae, she was just coming out from asking
the Lords help.  When she saw them she just broke into tears of joy and
gratitude for the Lords help in finding them.  I had said several silent
prayers but Mae seems to have an absolute faith in prayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I called and
talked to Roy this evening and found that Linda isn’t doing very well.  She is
loosing blood and the Dr. doesn’t know where or how.   I also called Rich and
visited for a few minutes.  I called Irven and Sandy to let them know how Linda
is.  This evening I put the two white hens back in the coop and took the
rooster out.  I couldn’t find where the red hen is roosting and I still can’t
find where they are laying eggs.  It was after 9PM
when I entered this entry but I have a bus route in the morning so we had
better get to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early this morning and took a bus run.  It was a special ed grade school run so
it didn’t last to long.  However we held an emergency evacuation drill when we
got to the school under simulation as to how we would get the children off the
bus if there was a engine fire.  With special ed. Students it is a little hard
to explain to them just what we were doing.  I went to the back of the bus and
the assistant brought the children back.  I helped the children get out through
the read door.  It went ok.  I was supposed to be in a training class at 9AM
but didn’t get back to the compound until 9:15AM.  When I went in the training
room I was the first one in.  The training was ok and it covered bus components
and pre-check and post-check procedures during the first half and loading and
unloading during the 2<sup>nd</sup> half.  It finished at 12:30PM. 
I came home and ate lunch and then took a nap.  I took the afternoon run of the
bus route.  That went well and we got back to the compound at 4:30PM. 
I felt that I should take a few minutes and get on the computer to enter my
last field trip and bid on next weeks run.  When I logged into the computer, it
told me that I had un-read messages.  When I checked the messages I had one
that said that I had 2 field trips assigned to me for this week.  I had only
got 1 field trip print out sheet.  By the time I finished everyone in the
office had gone so I will have to check on the 2<sup>nd</sup> trip tomorrow. 
Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  After eating she and I went for a walk. 
Bob came out just as we returned home and said that the weather report
indicated that we would get heavy frost tonight.  We decided to check for any
thing we might save from the garden.  We got quite a lot of tomatoes, corn and
strawberry’s.  I filled in this journal when we came in.  We then had a game of
Rummy and at the end Mae won that.  I finished this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Before we
went to bed last night Mae read me a report from Phyllis Schlafly that really
got to me and as a result I didn’t sleep very well.  I got up about 4AM
and found that Mae was sleeping in the recliner.  Then when I got up I read the
last of 3<sup>rd</sup> Nephi and that didn’t help as I see the same things
taking place today.  I was really a grump today and I think Mae was glad when I
was outside.  Mae and I got Jeff’s motorcycle out and Mae washed it.  We then
took pictures so that Jeff can get it advertised for sale.  Mae helped me get
the snowmobiles out and I started getting them ready to advertise for sale. 
Jeff and Scott came for lunch.  Mae read the Phyllis Schlafly report to them. 
Jeff took it as so what!  Scott felt to busy trying to keep up with what he has
now to do.  I went over to the bus compound to find out about a field trip that
I had been awarded and then it wasn’t on the print out.  It was one that
Roberta had to give to a full time driver so she gave me another route in its
place.  she also ask me to take a PM route this afternoon and a field trip
tomorrow.  I had time to go to Green’s feed store and get some chicken feed and
then back to the compound to make the run.  I got held up in construction
traffic, plus I went to the wrong grade school so I was quite late getting to
the school.  We made it ok.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home so we ate and
went to the Family History Center.  After leaving the center we stopped at Aunt
Beth’s and wished her a 85<sup>th</sup> Happy Birthday which will be celebrated
Saturday.  We will be out of town so will not be able to attend it.  She told
us of Mae’s cousin LaDeane Olsen Tingey that died from censor and the funeral
will be tomorrow.  On the way home Mae made arrangements to attend the funeral
with Bryce and Deanna.  At home I spent quite a while on Google Map, finding Copper
 Hills High School in Salt Lake.  I then entered this entry before going to
bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae prepared
breakfast so I ate and then took a shower.  Mae went with Bryce and Kim to
LaDeane’s funeral.  I took care of the animals and then took my boat over to
Dick’s to have it winterized.  I got natural gas for the pickup while I was in
that area.  I then went to Irven’s and drained the water from the swamp cooler
and shut off the outside water.  They wanted me to also put a cover over the
cooler and put a pillow in the down vent.  I told them that I didn’t have time
to do that and wasn’t sure when I could get to it.  I came home and ate some
lunch and finished putting the lunch together for my field trip.  I went to the
bus compound and got my bus and went to Davis High School.  We used two buses
to transport the total Davis High School Football team to Copper Canon High
even though only the JV team played tonight.  Davis lost 13 to 14.  After the
game the coach had us take them to Chuck-A-Rama on Redwood Road and 8800
South.  The coach took the complete team out to eat.  When we got back to Davis
High the 2<sup>nd</sup> bus driver didn’t set his brake and got up to do a walk
thru.  He didn’t feel the bus roll forward and it hit one car and shoved it
into a second car.  That sure made the trip end up on a bad note.  We had to
get a police officer over to get a report filled out.  We couldn’t call anyone
from the District so the driver will have to call in tomorrow.  This was the
driver’s first field trip.  I really felt bad for him.  I had to go with him to
the Farmington compound to leave his bus, then he brought me back to Davis
where I got my bus and took it to the Clearfield compound.  It was 10
 PM before I finished tonight.  Jeff came to get the camp trailer and waited
for me to get there to hook up the lights as I had the extra adapters in my
pickup.  Mae and I got something to eat and I filled out this journal entry
before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until almost 8AM.  Mae prepared breakfast and so after eating I took care of
the animals.  I went over to Dick’s and got my boat.  In next went to the bus
compound and talked to Roberta about the accident and the fact that security
would not help us when we called.  She suggested that I talk to Rosa,
so I went to her office and told her what had happened.  She said that she
would see that security know about the incident and explained that security did
have every person in management at the compound’s home and cell phone numbers. 
Anyway it looks like I may have stirred up a hornets nest. But if so I think it
needs stirring.  I came home and met with Chad and let him borrow some of my
tools and showed him how to install roof shingles.  Mae had lunch ready for me
and after eating I went to the bus compound.  I took North Ridge
 High School’s JV football team to Roy High School.  It was really a pathetic
contest as North Ridge one 42 to 7 and North Ridge pulled out all their main
players for the last half.  Mae was tending Benji and Rachel when I got home as
Jeff and Gale needed some time to talk with out the children’s interruption.  I
started on this entry and then went upstairs and visited with Mark as to the
changes with Comcast.  I came down and finished this entry and then went to bed
after a game on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early to take a special ed. route.  That went ok and the assistant was good to
work with.  After the AM route I went into the dispatch area and got on the
computer and entered payroll information.  I got home just before Mae was
leaving.  She went into Riverdale to the Health Food Store and then went to
American Fork to Mike and Becky’s to tend their family.  I fed the animals, got
some lunch and set down in the recliner to take a nap.  I had just got to sleep
when the Davis North Hospital called concerning Marks account.  I couldn’t go
back to sleep so went into the compound.  I had extra time so I filled the bus
with fuel before I drove the PM route.  When I got back home I ate some dinner,
took a shower and went to Bountiful to the viewing of Jacob Park.  Jeff came
just as I was ready to go and needed some things of his from our place.  I was
late than I had planned getting to the Mortuary and had to stand in a very long
line.  I saw and visited with several that I know from the old Ward including
Scott.  I stopped at a Kentucky Chicken and got some chicken to eat on the way
to Mikes.  I also got some natural gas for my truck.  Driving on the freeway to
American Fork I felt like I was driving in the Indianapolis 500 race track. 
Drivers are crazy as they drive on the free-ways.  When I got to Mike’s and
went in the house I vas very surprised to find Becky there.  They told me that
David had been injured in the football game and Mike had taken him to a Dr.
Office to be checked.   A ½ hour to 45 minutes Mike brought David home.  He had
no broken bones but they weren’t sure about ligament damage at this time.  They
well have to check more on Monday.  It was quite late when Mike and Becky again
left for Park City.   We were late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today seemed
to go quite fast as we enjoyed tending the family.  I played a game of chess
with David.  It was a good game but I won.  I worked for a while on a Walk through
Home Inspection Form.  We had brought the DVD entitled “Akeelah and the Bee”
with all the family.  This evening Mae and I took the little girls bowling.  We
just had Jessie and Mattie play and at the end Jessie won.  After getting the
little ones to be Mae and I watched a DVD.  It was an Alfred Hitchcock movie
with Jimmy Stewart but we were disappointed with the overall plot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8AM and then had to hurry to get ready to attend meetings.  We enjoyed
the Ward and the meetings had a very good spirit in them.  We ate soon after
getting home, in fact the David and Tayler we eating when we got home and they
had something for the little girls so they set right down and ate.  It took Mae
a few minutes to get us something.  I set down and started to watch a movie the
children had on but I soon fell asleep in that.  I woke when Mike and Becky
came home.  after they got their things in the house Mike, Becky, David, Taylor,
Mae and I played two games of Mormon Bridge.  Mae and I came home after that. 
Lois called me and told me that Nola Vance died this morning at 8:30AM.  She
has been sick for some time so it is a blessing for her to go.  Lois wasn’t
sure of the details but she thinks that they will have a viewing Friday evening
in the Salt Lake area and a viewing and funeral Saturday in the Rexburg area. 
I called and let Roy know; I visited with Bob and let him know when we got home
and I tried to let Irven and Sandy know but they weren’t home.  I went out
after we got home and caught the rooster and put him in an unused rabbit pen
and will butcher him tomorrow.  I also checked the rest of the chickens and all
of then seem to be laying eggs most of the time.  Mae fixed fruit and toast for
us this evening.  I filled in this entry and entered some information on my bus

4PM and after getting home I started typing the walk through report on the
computer.  I had several interruptions so didn’t finish the report until after
mid-night.  Chad returned my tools that I loaned him to shingle the roof of his
shed.  He paid me for the use of the tools plus paid for the nails and shingles
I sent with him.  We were very tired when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30AM so that I could take a field trip.  I was glad that I had given myself
extra time for when I got on my assigned bus it was out of fuel.  I field it
before leaving and it took 96 gallons of fuel in tanks that hold 100 gallons. 
I made it to the school just a couple of minutes late but they were later than
that before they were ready to go, so it worked out ok.  I took the kinder
garden children to the Aquarium in Salt Lake.  I got home at 12:30PM just as
Mae was leaving to go Visiting Teaching.  She had helped Sister Lois Neilson
with Family History this morning.  When I got home Mae had lunch ready.  I had
just started to eat when Roberta Wilson from the bus shop called and asked if I
could take a PM run today.  I asked her when it started and she said 2 minutes
ago.  That was a little exaggerated but I just put most of my food back and
left.  The runs went pretty good.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  After
eating I took a shower and got ready to go to the Family History Center.  I
wanted some practical experience so I tried to correct some information on
Mom’s record.  After a lot of time and questions I ask Mae’s help.  She was
unable to help me so I turned to the Help screens.  I couldn’t find solutions
there so finally called the Help Center.  The Sister on the line worked with me
for sometime with out success.  She finally had me shut my computer down and
turn to another computer.  It worked great but by then it was after 9PM so we
closed up and came home.  I entered yesterdays and this journal entry before we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8am and then started getting ready to leave for Zion’s National Park.  It
was after noon before we got away.  We stopped at Sub-Way for a foot long to
eat on the way.  With a couple of stops for gas, rest stop and something to
eat, we got to the camp sight 7:30PM.  After getting settled Jeff put on a DVD
that Mae had bought on the way down.  It was late when we went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept
fairly well and the furnace kept the trailer fairly comfortable.  Mae and I
prepared breakfast of pancakes and eggs.  By the time we had the children get
their naps it was almost noon.  We took lunches and went into Zion’s on the bus
shuttle.  We got of at the Emerald pool trail and hiked to the first pool. 
Jeff took Rachael and hiked on to the second pool.  After returning we came
back to our camp.  We tried to play some games but didn’t get very far into
them when the children would need attention.  I am a little concerned about Mae
holding the children so much and Rachael just wants to hold onto her all the
time.  We set around a campfire this evening and roasted hotdogs and marsh
mellows.  Oh, the left ear piece on my glasses broke of today so I am having
trouble reading anything.  That includes using my computer as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast we got a earlier start and again took the shuttle up the canon and
this time took the River Walk to the Narrows.  I got a call from Roberta
letting me know that I have a field trip on Wednesday and some of the time has
been changed.  It was a very enjoyable day.  This evening we again tried to
play some games but little Mathew is really having trouble with colic and take
a lot of care.  I cooked Ditch Oven chicken this evening but it took longer to
prepare and with little Mathew we were very late eating.  After we finished
with dinner we again watched at DVD “Ice Age”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast we helped Jeff and Gail get their things packed up and they left for
home soon after 12PM.  We took some time getting the tent trailer rearranged
and cleaned up.  I shaved and we took a rest.  I took a nap but Mae only rested
for a little while.  We went down town Springdale and checked on getting apples
at a u-pick, but they wanted 66 cents a lb if you got at least 30 lbs.  We
figured that was to expensive.  We decided to go out to eat but the one café
that was suggested to us was closed when we got there.  The next one we went into
was too expensive and the salad bar looked bad.  We checked on a move but again
felt that it was to over priced for what you got.  I guess I just don’t feel
like being ripped off.  We came back to the tent trailer and fixed our own
dinner.  We sure enjoyed just hanging out together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
7AM.  I checked with the guard gate about staying another night but they are
completely booked for today.  We packed up and went to church in the Springdale
Ward.  Sister and Brother Fisher were the two main speakers and I was very
impressed with there talks and the knowledge they displayed.  The Bishop read a
cute letter from a missionary from the Ward and a young deacon was asked to
bear his testimony and I was very impressed with him.  After the meeting, as we
were leaving, Mae spoke to a couple that were wearing Missionary Badges and
found out that it was Beverly Draper from the Sunset 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward.  We
didn’t catch her married name.  We left from the meeting and went to Hurrican
and found a Sub-Way where we got something to eat.  We drove on home getting
there after 9PM.  We did stop at Mike and Becky’s for a little while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
shortly after 7AM.  I helped Mae prepare breakfast and then I took care of the
animals.  Mae and I went over to Marcie Fairbourn’s and picked apples.  Marcie had
two apple trees that were very heavily loaded and so it didn’t take long to
pick all the apples we felt that we could use.  We also got some winter pears. 
On the way home we went to Roy to see if Standard Optical could repair my
glasses.  They couldn’t but sent us to Aarons Jewelry to have the frames
soldered.  At Aarons I had them also check Mae’s wedding bands and we decided
to have them repaired.  I also looked at wrist watches and decided to buy one
if they could change the band from brown to black leather.  This evening we
went out to eat at McGrath’s Fish House with Bob and Carroll.  After returning
home I worked on the computer bidding for field trips for next week.  I then
caught up my journal for the past couple of days.  We also got on line and
filled out the registration for the new installation of the Quest dish, High
Speed internet and phone service.  There is so much to understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
shortly after 8AM.  If it hadn’t been for the installation of Qwest today, we
would have cuddled back up and gone back to sleep.  By 8:15AM installers were
here and I was asking and answering questions.  Mae and I started on apple
sauce, along with feeding the animals.  Bob and I emptied old fruit gars so
that they could be washed and reused.  About noon I was going to rotor-till the
old fruit into the garden but the tiller would not work.  Mark had put two
belts on the tiller as it had four pulleys on it.  I had told him that it only
took one belt but when he installed two belts, they each put pressure on the
other and they had heated and stretched.  I got Bob to go to the service shop
and buy another belt for me.  David came at 5:30PM to bring the small trailer
back.  I went to the Family History Center this evening and Mae attended the
Relief Society Visiting Teaching meeting.  While at the FHC I found that some
one is trying to have my mother sealed to Leo.  When I got home Mae helped me
find out what is going on and we will send a letter to the one trying to get
this done objecting to it being done.  I have got to visit with Irven, Bob and
Roy before deciding if this should be done now.  I don’t feel good about
someone else doing this with out consulting us.  I entered this entry and Mae
read e-mails.  The ones between Garrett and Shellie were very enjoyable to get
a copy of.  It was after 11PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30AM and got ready for a field trip.  While I was shaving a call came from
the dispatch asking if I would take a bus rout this morning.  I explained that
Roberta had me on a field trip and wanted me to leave by 9:30AM.  Sherri
decided that I wouldn’t be able to do both so to continue with the field trip. 
I drove to the Marriot Hotel in Prove where I loaded students and advisors
luggage onto my bus.  I separated the luggage by the North schools and the
South schools.  I then waited for the 2<sup>nd</sup> but to come at 2PM and we
transferred the South schools luggage to the 2<sup>nd</sup> bus.  We were then
informed that the program would not finish until at least 4PM.  By the time I
took the four schools home and returned the bus to the compound and got home it
was after 7PM.  Mae was just leaving for the Relief Society Book Group.  I ate
and watched a movie.  During the show I entered some of my payroll
information.  I then entered this entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning and due to that the time went by very fast.  It seemed that it was
time for me to leave for my field trip.  I drove the swim team to Highland High
in Salt Lake.  After the meet the coach had me take the team a couple of blocks
where they ate at some fast food dinners before I took the youth back to Davis
High.  It was after 9PM when I returned to the bus compound and went home.  Mae
has been busy all day putting up apple sauce.  She was cleaning up when I got
home.  I made this entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

4:30 am to get into work.  I let Mae sleep in and when I called her after my
run she said that she slept until 8AM.  I took bus 88’s regular route, it went
well.  After getting home I fed the animals and was going to take a nap but Bob
visited with me about Mark so I didn’t have time except to eat some lunch and
leave.  My afternoon went well also.  Mae didn’t get home until almost 6PM so
we went out to eat at Golden Corral.  When we got home we watched a movie on
DVD “Ultimate Gift” and we really enjoyed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was almost
8AM when we got up this morning.  I got a call shortly after 8AM to let me know
that the Universal Rental had a dump trailer returned this morning and wondered
if I wanted it.  Scott had not called me to let me know what he wants to do
with the room downstairs so I told them I would take it.  Mae fixed some quick
breakfast and I went up and got the trailer and took it to the Davis County
Dumps and bought three scoops, each scoop equaled 1 ½ cu. yards, of mulch to
put on our garden spot.  Mae, Bob and Mark were out cleaning up the garden when
I got back.  I dug up the potatoes while Mark picked them up and put them in
the wheel barrel.  Mark and I them spread the mulch onto the garden area plus
we put some on the flower beds.  I them returned the trailer to United Rental. 
Mae had lunch ready when I returned and then I took a 15 minute nap.  Mae and I
then went over to Sister Fairborn’s and picked apples.  We picked all the
apples that were left on the Delicious Apple tree which was over 4 bushel.  On
the way home we stopped at Brother and Sister Casey’s and gave then some
potatoes and apples.  When we got home I gathered the eggs and got a chicken
that had got out, back into the pen.  Mae prepared something to eat and we
watched a movie on DVD “Rescued”.  It was a cute show that was ok.  </span></p>

7:30 AM but my palm said that it was Day Light Saving time.  I turned our
computer on to check for sure and it didn’t indicate any change in time.  Oh
well!  I guess I have had enough sleep.  I prepared breakfast while Mae put up
her hair.  I fed the animals before getting ready for meetings.  Chelci sang
“How Great Thou Art” in our Sacrament meeting with Sandi accompanying her.  The
arrangement was not the standard arrangement that is in the Hymn book but much
more complicated.  Sandi has been practicing it for several weeks and was very
nervous, but she did beautiful.  I told them after that there was one problem
with it and that was that I had popped all the buttons off my shirt.  I love
that song and wish that I could have them play it at my funeral.  After the
meeting they stopped at home long enough to take some apples, potatoes, grapes
and a small squash.  They had to hurry home as Chelci had to do more studying
for school.  Bob invited us for dinner and it was delicious.  I did take a
short nap and then Bob and I went Home Teaching to Patriarch Johnstun’s and
Sister Fallis’s.  it took us a lot longer than I wanted but both were difficult
to close.  Mae had eaten by the time I got home so I had some fruit and toast
and then filled in this entry.  Mae is busy preparing for a talk she has to
give I a couple of weeks.  I had better get to bed as I have to get up about
4:30AM to keep and appointment with Chelci to clean my teeth in the morning.</span></p>

7:30AM so I called Mae and had her return my call about 7:55AM.  That way I
could sleep for 20 minutes before going in to have Chelci work on my teeth. 
Chelci really work on my teeth and the most time was in getting the x-rays.  It
was 11:30 AM before she finished and I will need to come back for her to finish
up.  When I got home we had some lunch and I lay down and took a nap.  I didn’t
get much done this afternoon except to take care of the chickens and clean the
coop.  Mae and I tried to set the timer but were unsuccessful and finally gave
up.  Our printer quite working and after checking on prices it looks like we
will just have to buy a new one.  This evening we went over to Scott and
Mishelle’s for dinner and to celebrate Kaden and Kaitlyn’s 1<sup>st</sup>
Birthday anniversary.  Mishelle’s parents were also there.  Mishelle and Scott
had prepared a very nice dinner.  Before leaving I went downstairs and checked
a leak in their water softener and found that the case on the timer was
cracked.  I will have to check on a replacement.  It was late when we got home
and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

with plans to go to Nancy this morning.  I took care of the animals and we had
breakfast.  I called to check on the water softener for Scott and we estimate
that his is over 30 years old so he will need a new unit.  We were just ready
to leave when Nancy called and said that her computer was having problems so
she was taking it to Provo for repairs and would not be able to keep her
appointments today.  I got on our computer and had some problems getting the
internet to respond so I finally called for help and was on line with a
technician for over an hour.  He told me that I needed to hook the router to
the computer and that would take me a little while so he would call me back.  I
did get the router changed to the desktop but the technician never did call me
back.  Scott came for lunch and while he was here he checked the computer and
the wireless router is now working.  This afternoon I took a nap and then I
went on errorns.  I got natural gas and regular gas in the pickup; I stopped at
Young’s Chevrolet and got a scamatic of the dash of the pickup.  I also checked
on the price of the switch and the cost of labor to install it.  The switch
cost $237.00 and $169.00 to have it installed, WHO!  I next stopped at Home
Depot and got some help on the timer switch that I had installed for the lights
in the chicken coop.  I will try again to set it.  I took a pair of cowboy
boots to Ray’s shoe repair in Kaysville, then went to Best Buy in Riverdale and
bought a new printer as ours quite on us yesterday.  I stopped at Aaron’s
Jewelry in Roy and picked up my new watch.  Mae had dinner ready when I got
home.  We ate and went to the Family History Center.  After returning home I
entered this journal entry and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

before 7AM to get things done before going to a Sub-Bus Drivers Round Table. 
That lasted from 9:30 to 11:15AM.  I then stayed to take care of some other
items.  I stopped on the way home and bought some feed for the animals.  After
getting home I took the feed out to the shed and unloaded it.  I got something
to eat and while I ate I watched the last of a movie on TV.  I tried to take a
nap but Bob called shortly after I got to sleep.  I decided to get the new
printer hooked up.  Six hours later and with 2 hours of a Qwest Technician and
then 2 hours of help from Scott, we finally got it to print in black and white
only.  The colored still doesn’t work.  I made this entry before going to bed. 
Mae has spent most of the day helping Mishelle with the children and letting
her get some rest.  Mae is sending a E-mail off to Erryn Tam’s for me

didn’t sleep to well last night.  I was concerned about the water softener for
Scott’s home.  I don’t feel very good at trying to get it to do until after
Christmas.  Mae went over to help Mishelle with the children and to attend a
Halloween Parade at Kylan and Ashley’s school.  I took care of the animals and
tried to reset the light program but still couldn’t get it set.  I called Best
Buy and told them about the trouble I am having with the printer that I just
bought and they want me to return it and if they can’t find the trouble they
will give me another one.  Now it is just finding time to take it back.  Mae
came back for Mishelle’s just in time to go help Sister Marie McEntire with the
New Family Search program.  I tried to take a nap and did get to sleep for a few
minutes when Sandy called and had a question about the possibility of Kristine remarrying
and possibility even marring in the Temple.  I told her my thoughts on it and
she felt ok with that.  Mae got home in time to fix me some lunch before I left
to take a field trip.  Mae is going to attend the Temple tonight as it is our
Stake’s Temple Night before Stake Conference.  I would have liked to attended
with her.  I took the Swim Team from North Ridge High to Bear River High in
Garland.  I was assigned bus #348 and it was really a nice bus.  It was a good
experience with the youth and the bus.  I didn’t get back to the compound and
finished with the bus until 9:35PM.  Mae had just got home.  I entered my
journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

recertification training today at the bus compound.  It is a State Law that all
bus drivers take this course yearly or they will not be able to continue to
drive.  It was ok but a lot was redundant information but I guess necessary. 
It does upset me that we are given certain things that must be done, yet there
are many drivers that do not do them.  Mea had put clothing and food together
for us to go out to Sandi’s.  When I finished the class and got home we got
things put into the truck and left.  We took the pickup because I also took
some tools and ladders so that I could hang some chandeliers for Sandi.  This
evening Sandi had invited all the family to attend a Halloween Party.  Everyone
was asked to wear costumes to the party.  Sandi had rented the club house at
Tooele Army Depot to hold the party.  Sandi had Chelci and JaNae help and it
was really a nice evening.  After the party Mae and I went back to Sandi and
Nicks where we stayed over night.  Before going to bed we had a game of marbles
and Nick and I won.</span></p>

and when we got up Nick had prepared breakfast of scrambled eggs and sautéed
vegetables with mushrooms.  After breakfast I started hanging the chandeliers. 
Sandi and Mae helped me unpackaged and assemble the chandeliers.  Nick went to
the store and purchased light bulbs for the chandeliers and then when we had to
use my saw horses to assemble some stair scaffolding and put my ladder on it to
get me high enough to hang the chandelier, Nick insisted on holding to the
ladder so that there was no chance that the ladder would slip.  It all went
well and we completed the job.  Sandi and Nick thanked me for doing it several
times before we left for home.  After getting home I went out and fed the
