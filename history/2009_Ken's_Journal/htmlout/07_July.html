<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Again we were
up at 6AM so we could get to Nauvoo.  We got there about 9AM and we first went
on the carriage ride into the North side of Nauvoo.  It was a very
inspirational ride as our guide talked about the people and trials they had as
they settled the area of Commerce and turned it from a mosquito invested swamp
into Nauvoo (The City Beautiful).  After that Spiritual and thrilling
experience we saw the “Remembering Nauvoo” film in the visitor center.  What a
beautiful film to see.  We next went to Land and Records, where we looked up
some of our Ancestors that lived in Nauvoo and where they owned property.  The
Sister there explained to us that when the Saints were driven out of Nauvoo
they did not pay their property taxes and so their property was sold on tax
auction and so they no longer had legal ownership to the properties.  I think
it was a legal way to steal the properties.  We went to the Browning Home and
Gun Shop.  As I am a third Great Grandson, we got rather special treatment
there We got some lunch at a café and then came back and went to the Brigham
Young home, Lucy Mack Smith home where she lived after the martyrdom of Joseph
and Hyrum, next we went to the Brick Yard and then to the Joseph Smith Sites
that are owned by the Community of Christ Church.  We sure recognized a
difference in the Spiritual feelings there although we were excited to see the
sites.  We then returned to the Nauvoo Visitor Center and saw the production of
“The High Hopes and River Boats” production.  After that show we went for
dinner at the Hotel Nauvoo where we had a full buffet and then returned to see
the musical production “Sunset by the Mississippi”, that was a great evening of
fun and talent.  It was after 10 PM when we got back to our motel in Keokuk. 
We were very tired but had a wonderful day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6am to get going.  We started off at the visitor center and got tickets to the
production “Just Plain Anna Amanda” and then attended the movie “Joseph Smith
Prophet of the Restoration”.  We had seen that movie before but it was just as
moving this time.  We then attended the production and enjoyed that.  We went
to the Seventies Hall, the “Trail of Hope” and the ox ride.  I found out that a
ox is usually a steer but can be a cow that is allowed to grow to be over 2,000
lbs.  We went for lunch and then came back and while I took a nap Mae went to
the Family Living Center, which had demonstrations of rope making, candle
making, pottery making, barrel making, weaving and spinning yarn out of flax,
cotton and wool.  When Mae finished at the Family Living Center we visited the
post office, printing shop, tin shop and Heber C. Kimball home.  We drove out
to the old Nauvoo cemetery and I walked through that while Mae talked to Sandi
on the phone.  After returning to Keokuk we stopped at an overlook where we
could see the Lock on the Mississippi River.  That dam raises the water level
over the rapids by 18’.  Before the dam and lock was installed loaded barges and
ships had to unload at Keokuk and transport the freight by wagon and team to
Nauvoo or vise versa to get over the rapids.  As we were there we could see the
water being let out of the lock and finally the gate opened.  We watched to see
a ship or barge come out of the lock but instead it was for two men in a
canoe.  We got quite a laugh out of that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  After checking out of the motel, we filled the car with gas and
got a car wash.  It was after 10AM before we left Keokuk to return to
Greenville Ohio.  We stopped on the way to get a Sub Way sandwich for lunch,
and at a Artic Circle to get Mae an ice cream Sunday and once for gas.  Mae
read most of the time as I drove.  It was 7:50PM when we got to Jeff’s but we
also lost an hour because of Day-Light-Savings time.  We went out to eat for
dinner and came back and played games until after 11pm.  I filled out my
journal for the past two days before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
6:40am and was up for a little while.  I finally lay back down with Mae and
dosed off.  We didn’t get up until 9am.  Mae prepared a nice breakfast of pan
cakes.  We had some laundry that needed done and so did Jeff so we all went to
the laundry mat.  Mae brought a book to read while we were waiting but when I
leaned back and closed my eyes I went to sleep.  I woke and Jeff and Mae were
in changing the clothes to the dryers so I helped.  We then went back to the
car and Mae started reading and I again got comfortable and went back to
sleep.  When we got home I worked on my computer for a while.  Mae made a very
mice lunch of spagitti.  This afternoon Jeff took us for a ride to see where he
lived when he first came out here.  He took us around the area and then out to
a flood control dam built in the 1920’s.  It was a series of five such dams but
as far as Jeff knows they were never used.  When we first came to it, I was
sure that there was a reservoir on the other side of it but it was just a
beautiful wooded area with the river and some small lakes or ponds.  We sure
enjoyed walking down through the area but the mosquitoes got thick so we left. 
We stopped at Buffalo Bills for dinner and it was very good.  We enjoyed the
Indian decor with a beautiful stuffed buffalo in the entrance way.  We stopped
back at home and got jackets and then drove out to Mary Michael’s, a worked at
the Honeywell Plant, where we thought that we would watch the Fire Works. 
There was several other that had also been invited.  However the city canceled
there display because of the weather as it has been raining lightly most of the
day.  The Michael’s made us welcome and invited us to stay.  They had
refreshments and food but we were too full to eat more.  They had us joining in
a game of Corn Hole.  It is played much like Horse shoes except it is two
slanted boards with a hole in each and you toss corn gags.  If your bag lands
and stays on the board it is worth 1 point unless the opponent buts one of his
bags on the board, in which case it zeros your point.  If you toss the bag thru
the hole it is worth three points unless the opponent also tosses a bag thru
the hole witch zeros the points out.  It was a fun game and we thought it is a
perfect backyard game that any age could enjoy.  Mary said that we could find
the plans for the board and the rules on the inter-net.  I will have to build a
set for us when we get back home.  Mary’s children had purchased several nice
fireworks and lit them off in the back yard.  It was late when we left and came
home.  Mae stayed home and took a shower while Jeff and I went to Wal-Mark’s
for some water, eggs and Jeff rented a movie.  I took a shower and we watched
the movie.  The show was taken from a true instant during World War II when
some of the Jew’s fled into the forests for safety from Hitler’s army.  It was
an R Rated movie, so Mae questioned us watching it.  I don’t know but it sure
gave me a great appreciation for what I have been blessed with and the freedoms
of America.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was 2AM
when the show finished and we went to bed.  I woke at 7AM and was up for a
little while.  Mae woke and had me cuddle up to her and we went back to sleep
for a few minutes.  Mae and I went to Sacrament meeting at the Greenville
Branch.  The building is very small as is the branch but there was a wonderful
spirit there and we appreciated being able to partake of the Sacrament.  There
was also a wonderful feeling of the Spirit with the testimonies that were
born.  We came home after Sacrament meeting as I am hurting with quite a lot of
pain thru my left shoulder and arm.  I took a nap before dinner.  Mae as always
cooked a very nice meal.  I helped her do up the dishes and then Jeff, Mae and
I played some games.  Mae and Jeff then lay down for naps while I worked on my
journal and Family History.  I am sure having trouble with the Family History
programs and have lost quite a bit of information or at least have my files
mixed up.  This is sure discouraging.  Jeff and I set out on the swing until
Mae had dinner ready.  I have tried to discus religion with Jeff but he has
blocked it out of his life.  We played games for a while before going to bed. 
We realized that I miss the Bus In-service class on the 11<sup>th</sup> of
June.  I guess that I was being pressed to do Irven and Sandy’s place and just
over looked the schedule.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
had breakfast and then I took Jeff over to his work.  Jeff gave us the use of
his car again.  Mae had things put together so that when I got back we just
loaded up and left.  We stopped at an auto parts and used their computer reader
and checked the reading on the car.  It indicated two sensors, one on emissions
and one on a knock.  I reset the computer and the light went off.  We did add
some fuel cleaner that was recommended.  We really enjoyed the GPS for we just
put in the address of the John Johnson Farm and it kept us with directions,
even when I made a mistake and turned right instead of left.  It just
recalculates and gives you an alternate route or suggests that you do a U-turn
to get you back on course.  The John Johnson Farm is in Hiram Ohio and it took
us about 5 hours to get there.  We had a couple of pit stops on the way but
other than that just really enjoyed the drive.  We are so impressed with the trees,
foliage and farms here in the mid-west.  Mae has taken so many pictures of the
scenery, farms, homes and towns, including road signs of the names of cities
and towns.  Often the trees are so thick that you can’t see even a few feet off
the roadway.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The John
Johnson farm was very impressive.  Mr. and Mrs. Johnson had twelve children and
raised nine with the other dieing in youth.  They were very industrious having
a large 280 acre farm.  Besides the crops, they had a dairy herd, a cheese
factory, a grist mill or a grain grinding mill and a lumber mill, so they were
really wealthy.  On one occasion one of his older sons came home from visiting
Kirtland and had joined the Mormon Church.  A couple of days after, the
minister came out to the farm and asked Mr. Johnson how come his son had joined
the Mormon Church to which Mr. Johnson said “I don’t know but let’s find out.” 
They got a Book of Mormon and the two of them stayed up all night reading the
book.  The next day Mr. &amp; Mrs. Johnson and their minister (<i>I have a
question as to whether or not I have the details right, because we were told
another story about the Johnson’s and I didn’t get the two stories connected</i>
traveled to Kirtland where they asked where they could find Joseph Smith the
Prophet.  The person answered that he was Joseph Smith.  Mr. Johnson said that
a prophet could heal people and asked if he could heal Mrs. Johnson.  Mrs.
Johnson had a joint problem for the past two years in which she could not raise
her right arm above her head.  Joseph Smith asked her if she had faith that she
could be healed.  She replied that she did.  Joseph then took her by the hand
and said “In the Name of Jesus Christ be healed.”  He then turned and left. 
Mrs. Johnson then slowly raised her arm until it was fully extended above her
head and was never bothered with the problem again.  Mr. &amp; Mrs. Johnson and
their minister were baptized into the Church.  Later Joseph Smith asked Brother
and Sister Johnson to sell their land and consecrate the money to the Lord that
the Church could purchase the property where the Temple would be built.  This
they did and then moved to Kirtland.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                From the
Johnson Farm we went to Mentor where we stayed at the Best Western Motel.  It
was very nice but had we known that Jim and Marion were not going to be with u,
we most likely would have stayed at a little cheaper accommodations.  We then
drove over to Kirtland and found the Temple.  After taking a few pictures we
went out to eat and then came back to the motel for the evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                By
the time we got up and got some breakfast it was 10AM when we got to the Visitor
Center in Kirtland.  We were there for over 2 hours and enjoyed every minute of
it.  Our guide had been there for only two weeks but he did a marvelous job in
giving us many interesting details of the town.  He talked to the group for a
few minutes and gave some background of Kirtland, then we watched a beautiful
20 minute movie.  Wow, it helped us realize and appreciate this great prophet,
his wife, Emma, and the wonderful members even more as we saw what they went
through and still remained faithful.  We had heard some of these stories
before, but the movie was done very well and we could feel the spirit and it
was very touching.  Our guide then took us to Newell Knight’s home and store. 
Wow, they were very valiant and faithful people.  They were both members of
Sidney Rigdon’s church, but Ann (Newell’s wife) told him she agreed with what
he said, but felt something was missing.  As they prayed about it, Ann received
the witness that the Lord’s church would come soon, so when the four
missionaries which included Parley P Pratt, came and taught them, she found the
missing parts and was given the witness that this was the Lord’s true church
and she wanted to be baptized immediately.  Newell wasn’t quite sure and asked
her to wait a while to make sure, but she told him she knew it was true, so was
baptized immediately.  It wasn’t long before Newell also received the witness
and was baptized.  Soon after, the prophet Joseph Smith and Emma arrived and
they went into the Knight’s store and Joseph told Newell “You prayed me here, now
what can I do for you?”  The Knight’s were so excited.  Joseph also said “Do
you have a place for us to stay?”  Newell had built a beautiful home for Ann so
they gave the prophet and Emma two rooms to stay in and use.  One was a bedroom
and the other was a sitting room which the prophet used for the Church
headquarters.  They were there a few months and then Joseph and Emma and their children
went to the John Johnson home to live for a time.  This is where the mob came
and drug Joseph out at night and tarred and feathered him.  Their baby son was
ill at the time and with the exposure to the cold, he died.  Emma and the
Johnson’s spent the night digging off the tar and feathers and Joseph spoke to
his congregation the next morning as it was Sunday.  I can’t imagine anyone
doing that after what he had been through, but he did.  Because they were
worried about the mobs, they moved back to Kirtland and the Knight’s remodeled
part of their store to make an apartment for Joseph and his family.  The
upstairs room was where he held the “School of the Prophets” and this is where
he received the 89<sup>th</sup> section of the D&amp;C – the Word of Wisdom. 
The Father and Son appeared to them in that room.  Wow, it was great to be
there and feel the spirit there.  The prophet and Emma were in Kirtland for 7
years – the longest he stayed in any place, although he was gone a lot to
Missouri where many of the saints were at that time.  Our guide took us through
the saw mill and explained it to us.  We next went to the Ashery.  This was a
building where ashes were process.  Ashes came from fireplaces, but especially
from the burning of trees when the land was cleared.  A person would be paid 50
cents a bucket.  The ashes were then processed to make, the lie used in the making
soap, further processing resulted in potash and even more processing resulted
into pearl ash.  Pearl ash was sent to England where they made china and other
dishes, so they received best price (I believe it was $500 per barrel) for the
Pearl ash.  These funds were used for the operation of the Church, with the
majority of it going to for the building of the Temple.  After moving from
Newell Knight’s home to John Johnson’s home and then for the safety of the
Prophet, back to Kirtland to the remodeled apartment in the Knight store, a
home was finally built just North of the Temple for Joseph and Emma.  This was
the first home that Joseph and Emma had had of their own, sense being married.  They
were only in that home just a few months when because of persecution the Saints
had to leave Kirtland.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We then went
to the Kirtland Temple visitor’s center and viewed a film and took a tour of
the Kirtland Temple.  That was so great to see also.  The Church doesn’t own
this temple but it is owned by the Reorganized Church, which is now called the
“Community of Christ Church”.  The guide explained that the Temple had not been
destroyed when the Saints left Kirtland, like the Nauvoo Temple was, but had
just set with no care.  There were many members of the Church that did not
leave the area but remained.  They later received title to the building because
of <u>abandonment</u>.  The guide also explained that some roomers said that
the building had been used for other purposes but it had not, but only remained
uncared for.  After receiving title the Temple, the then Reorganized Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, did a lot of restoration to the building.  She
explained that during the dedications of the temple, there were over a thousand
people and so 15 to 20 people occupied each pew.  As we set in the pew I
estimated that only 8 to 12 people could set comfortable per pew.  The meeting
took 8 hours and she said that no one left their seats even though there was
some breaks.  I can’t imagine children especially going that long as they would
be tired and have to go to the bathroom, eat, etc.  I asked the guide this and
she said she didn’t know how they did it, but that was what she was told.   During
the 2<sup>nd</sup> dedication session on Sunday, the curtains were dropped to
give privacy to the First Presidency and the Savior appeared to Joseph and
Sidney and accepted His temple.  The members had been in poverty and yet they
gave their all to the building of that temple.  The sisters had also gave their
china dishes which were crushed and put in the plaster for the exterior of the
temple which gave the walls a glisten effect.  When the Reorganized Church
renovate the exterior of the temple, because big chunks of plaster had fallen
off, etc., they tried to re-plaster it the same way, but it didn’t work.  They
later found out the reason why was that the early saints had plastered it by
hand, but when they redid it, they used a power sprayer to put the plaster on
the pressure caused the broken glass to seed itself deep into the plaster and
so the glass didn’t show up on the outside.  They, therefore, just painted over
the building with white paint and that is the way it is maintained today.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We then drove
to the Morley Farm and the couple missionaries told us about this great Morley
couple and how they were also asked by the prophet to sell their farm and
consecrate the money to the Lord for the building up of his church and they did
so.  We went up a beautiful path to where a building had been which used to be
a school house and the prophet also used it to hold meetings in.  They held the
4<sup>th</sup> church conference there and during the conference ordained
several high priests.  After the ordinations, Satan came and entered into
several of the Brothers bodies and physically threw them around the room. 
Hyrum said to Joseph “This isn’t from the Lord” and Joseph responded “No, it’s
not.”  He then rebuked Satan through the power of the priesthood which he held
and in the Name of Jesus Christ he commanded Satan to depart.  Immediately
Satan left.  The prophet told the brethren that this was a needful experience to
show them that Satan has great power, but the priesthood which they now held
has a greater power.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We left the
Morley farm and drove north until we came to Lake Erie, only a few miles out of
our way.  We felt that in as much as we were this close we would like to at
least see the lake.  It looked more like an ocean to us, as you could see no
land across the water and could easily see the curvature of the earth.  We also
wanted to drive to an Amish Community but I had ask directions yesterday and
had gotten such confusion that I didn’t want to try to find.  We then set the
GPS to take us to Jeff and started driving.  We stopped once for something to
eat and once for fuel.  At both stops we switched drivers allowing me to take a
nap.  It was 9:30PM when we got to Jeff’s.  It has been an exciting worth while
trip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After Jeff
left for work I called Jim and Marion to arrange time for us to visit them.  We
determined to go to their place tomorrow.  Today Mae and I walked down town and
to a park along the river.  We just had an enjoyable time being together, see
the river and the park, looking at a home for sell and visiting the Home Store
of Kitchen Aid products.  It has been a very enjoyable day.  This evening after
Jeff got home from work; we ate and then went to the store for groceries.  When
we got back home we played a game of Rummy.  I then worked on my journal for a
while.  Mae did some correction and addition to my entries while I took a
shower.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
before 7AM so that we could get away to Jim and Marion’s fairly early.  I took
Jeff to work but just as we were leaving Jim called and said that they had
sickness in their family, so we decided that we had better wait to go their.  I
worked on my journal getting it caught up again.  Mae read several articles
from the National Right to Life whose opinions were very good.  We sure are in
favor of most of their opinions.  Mae and I took a nap this afternoon and then
Mae made some dinner.  Later we went outside on the front porch and swung in
the swing and read from our book.  Jeff soon came home from work and we went in
and ate diner.  After dinner we went with Jeff to Piqua for Jeff to cancel his
membership to an exercise club.  It was after 8PM when we got back home.  Mae
read more from our book while I entered more to this entry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was 7AM
when we got up.  I cooked some cereal for breakfast while Mae got dressed and
got things straightened up.  Jeff just had a bowl of cold cereal before he went
to work.  This morning, Jeff road his bike to work, leaving his car for us to
use.  Mae and I ate and then left for Jim and Marion Fraiser’s in Springfield,
Ohio.  Again we sure appreciated having the GPS to guide us there.  When we got
there I was so envious of their home setting.  They have 135 acres of land set
back in the woods, so that you can not see another house from their yard.  He
has the crops leased out to another person who pays him twice a year.  When we
drove up to the house, we questioned if we were at the right place, because we
didn’t recognize the two people setting on the porch until we got right up to
the house.  It has been almost 30 years since we last saw them and changes do
take place.  We met some of their grandchildren while we were there.  After we
had visited for a little while they took us around some of the interesting
sights around Springfield.  The first area was a new reservoir established on
the Mad River, for flood control and recreation.  It is one of the most
beautiful reservoirs I have ever seen.  They then took us to see a Church of
God chapel that the Prophet Joseph was asked to preach a sermon at.  Marion
gave us a printed excerpt from Joseph Smith writings that explains a little of
the Zion’s Camp as it traveled through this area of Ohio.  We next went to a
large earth mound that is now a National Historic Site in the village of Enon. 
Evidently it is believed that this possible is an earth grave of a previous
people that may have lived in this area.  We enjoyed being with Jim and Marion
for a little while today.  We got back home shortly after 4PM.  Mae wanted the
Friend to find her stories for this months sharing time.  Marion had suggested
that she could find it on lds.com.  Mae thought about that but then the
computer that she could use was Jeff’s and he doesn’t have a printer.  I
suggested that we go over to the Library and use their computer and then print
the stories off that she wants.  That is what we did.  When we came back home
Jeff had already came home, but was talking to Gail.  He then went for a ride
so they could talk in privacy.  Mae and I ate dinner and then read from our
book.  Later when Jeff came back and had some dinner, the three of us played
some Rummy.  We finished our book before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up as the sky was overcast and cool.  Mae prepared breakfast of pan
cakes which were very good.  It started to rain this morning and we spent some
time setting out side on the porch just watching it.  The rain was very
peaceful although quite hard.  We went over to the laundry mat and washed
clothes.  While we waited for the clothes to wash Mae and I walked over to the
fair grounds and walked around a farm equipment display with most of the
equipment being machinery of the past.  Many of the booths were closed up due
to the rain and some of the events had to be canceled but we enjoyed
ourselves.  When we got back home the three of us played games.  Marion called
to tell Mae how special it was for us to come and see them.  We figured it to
be about 20 years since we have seen them.  We have kept in touch with
Christmas cards and occasionally a phone call.  Marion said that Jim wanted her
to tell me that they had got 2 ½” of rain from this storm.  He had told me
Friday that the farmers were happy with the weather if the get about 1” a week
in rain fall.  In Utah we about 3” a year!  This evening we drove over to
Wal-Mart and rented the DVD “The Secret Life of Bee’s”.  We really enjoyed it. 
Mae and I took showers before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7:30AM and I prepared breakfast while Mae did her hair and Jeff slept. 
Jeff woke in time to eat with us.  Mae and I attended Sacrament meeting and
then came back to be with Jeff.  We relaxed and played games, fixed dinner and
ate, went for a walk down around the river and back.  We set on the swing on
the porch before coming up stairs and playing more games.  While Mae was
preparing dinner I boxed up Jeff’s nice dishes.  He had two sets of dishes that
he found in the top of the cupboards when he moved here.  He told the land lord
who just said; “I guess they are yours now”.  I will check on the freight cost
tomorrow to see if they are worth shipping home.  After playing a couple of
games the three of us went for a walk.  We walked downtown and then to the
river.  We walked along some river trails for quite a while, just enjoying the
beautiful area and the relaxed atmosphere.  Mae cooked some spagitti for an
evening meal.  Jeff is very confused at what he should do but he won’t consider
religion as posible consideration and I certainly don’t have any other answers
for him.  Mae and I rubbed each others feet and then I gave Jeff a foot rubs. 
That is always relaxing.  Sandi returned a call from Mae and let us know how
they are doing.  She is with a friend and they are taking a tour.  They are in
Boston tonight.  She said that they are really enjoying it but they are kept
very busy with the tour group.  Mae and I went outside to watch the fire flies
and went for a short walk around the area.  The weather is sure nice and
comfortable and has been all the time we have been back here.  We did get the
day of rain yesterday and as we were talking about it, we realized that Utah
get about 3 inches of rain fall per year and Ohio hopes for an average of 1 ½
inches per week.  No wonder there is so much foliage and everything is so
green.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My back has
been hurting most of the day yesterday so I wasn’t to sure how I would sleep
last night.  Mae rubbed my back and applied some Thera-gesic and I slept quite
well.  We set the alarm for 5:30 AM but didn’t get up until 6 AM.  I helped Mae
get some breakfast and after eating I took Jeff to work so we could have the
use of his car again.  Mae and I got things cleaned us and packed our suite
cases.  We took the dishes and out two suite cases to the UPS office and had
them weighed.  The one suite case weighed 49 lb and the other 47 ½ lb.  The box
of dishes would have to be completely repacked with much more packing and in
two boxes, one inside of the other or they would never arrive with out being
broken to pieces.  The cost of shipping and packing would be around 100
dollars.  Jeff will have to make that decision.  We went to the museum in town
but it is closed on Mondays.  We came home and I worked on my journal entries
on the trip to Nauvoo.  Mae took some notes of the sights we have been to and I
am trying to get my entries with a little more detail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Dear Jeff,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Dad and I
just want to thank you again for letting us come and visit you here and thank
you again for the use of your car.  We have loved every minute of it – from the
walks in the beautiful parks and by the river and even walking around your
neighborhood and town, to watching the fire flies or lightening bugs, to playing
games, watching movies, visiting or reading in your porch swing, to going out
to eat or eating together here.  We love your apartment with the cute kitchen,
back screened porch and wrap around porch. We like this town and especially the
beautiful green trees, fields and foliage.  We have loved being with you and
loved going to Nauvoo, Kirtland and to Maryon and Jim’s home in Springfield. 
The time has gone fast, but it’s been wonderful and you have been wonderful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Dad and I
both love you so much and wish with all our hearts that you could find the
happiness, joy and peace we have.  We know you feel we have been lied to, but
we have faith that we have not.  We know Heavenly Father gave us commandments,
which if we keep will bring us peace and happiness.  He gave us our agency so
we can choose.  We know God gave us prophets who lived valiant and were
prepared in the pre-existence to come forth on this earth at special times to
receive revelations and visions from Him to guide us in this life.  I am so thankful
to these great men, that they were willing to sacrifice everything for the Lord
and the building up of his kingdom on this earth.  If they were not true
prophets, why would they do all they did and do – even to giving their lives? 
They could have denied and Lord and not had to go through all the persecutions
and trials they had.  Satan wants to stop this work from going forward and he
has great power, but the Priesthood of God and Christ have much more.  The
prophets and apostles and other general authorities are good righteous men.  I
can see it in their eyes and countenance and feel it in my heart.  I know the
Holy Ghost reveals this to me because I try to follow the prophets and live the
gospel and keep God’s commandments.  The more we do this, the more the Holy
Ghost can be with us to comfort, guide, protect and help us.  If we choose to
not obey the commandments, we can’t receive the blessings and the Holy Ghost or
spirit of the Lord can’t be with us.  My dad told me, when I was young, to
never go anyplace where the Holy Ghost wouldn’t and couldn’t go or I would be
left on my own.  The garments are a protection against the power of the
destroyer (Satan.)  II want to do everything I can to keep the spsirit with me
because I hate the feelings I have when because of the wrong choices I make,
the spirit isn’t with me and I feel Satan’s influence.  I can’t blame Satan for
everything but I know he wants to destroy me and my faith in God and he wants
me to be miserable like he is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My brother,
Hal, and I were close and he chose to go the ways of the world and try
everything he could.  He had a good heart and was good to people and at times
he experienced thrills and pleasures, but he was confused and didn’t have the
peace and happiness that I had.  Dad and I tried to talk to him about the
gospel and the Lord, but he wouldn’t listen.  He didn’t want to obey the
commandments and go to church, he wanted to be free and to do what he wanted. 
That’s fine, we all get to choose, but the choices he made didn’t bring him the
happiness he sought and it was devastating for his wife and daughter,
especially his daughter.  I didn’t enjoy Hal as we were growing up together as
he teased me constantly and was mean to me, until we grew up, then we became close
and had many heart to heart talks and I loved him and still do.  I can’t
describe the pain Mom and dad and our family experienced when he would be in
the hospital from overdosing his pills and especially when he took his life. 
Maybe I’ve told you all this before and if so I apologize for repeating it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I just wish
your heart could be softened and you would pray sincerely to Heavenly Father
and receive your testimony back.  Dad and I will always love you no matter
what, but it makes us sad to see you suffering such mental anguish.  I know it
would be hard to come back as Satan would do everything he could to stop you,
but with the Lord’s help you could do it.  This earth life isn’t supposed to be
easy.  We were valiant in the pre-existence and if we endure to the end, we’ll
have eternal happiness.  Dad and I pray for this for all our family.  I love
you so much,</span></p>

in the Lord and the spirit to guide them.</span></p>

2PM and drove to the Honeywell Plant where Jeff works.  Jeff drove us from
there to the Dayton Airport.  We had plenty of time to check in.  From Dayton
we flow North West Airlines to Detroit Michigan.  We had to transfer plains
there and had about 30 minutes to walk from the South end of the B terminal to
the North end of the A terminal.  We walked about as fast as we could and got
there with about 10 minutes to spear, but we were tired.  From Detroit we flew
non-stop to Salt Lake.  We flew at 3800 ft altitude and so could see very
little detail on the ground.  Bob and Carroll met us at the airport and brought
us home.  we were very tired and had gained 2 hours of time.  We soon went to

I was getting cramps in my legs which woke me up.  I got up before 7AM but let
Mae sleep in.  Mae woke about 8 AM.  After breakfast Bob and I feed the
animals.  We then worked on the sprinkler system.  I think I have it ready to
water now.  I took some information over to Mishelle in Transportation and then
went to Green’s Feed.  By the time I got home it was time for dinner and then
we went to the Family History Center.  I am struggling with knowing what I am
doing there.  After getting home tonight I downloaded the pictures that we took
on our trip.  I am having trouble getting one chip of pictures to download.  We
visited with Scott and Mishelle by way of SKIPT on the computer, for over a
half hour.  It is now after mid-night so we had better get to bed.</span></p>

how they would do.  Mae got breakfast ready and I came in for it.  I then went
up to the Adam’s sod farm in Layton but they weren’t ready for me so that took
some time.  I stopped at Green’s Farm Store and exchanged the two sacks of feed
that they gave me the wrong product yesterday.  Grant came over and helped me
lay the sod.  I was a little short on sod so I went to Lowe’s and bought what I
needed.  We finished the sod and then ate dinner.  I was still working out
front for a while.  When I quit I came in and showered and got ready to go Home
Teaching.  Bob got home form his Dr. Appointments and helped me.  We cleaned up
all my tools and put them away as well as cleaning up the dirt and materials. 
Bob and I went Home Teaching to the Johnston’s first and then stopped by the
Casey’s.  Sister Fallis was not at home this evening so we will have to try
another day.  When I got home I visited with Mike next door about our trip. 
Mae, Mike and David came home from watching Tyler’s ball game.  Mike and David
stayed a little while before going home.  We visited with David and Shauna
about our East Canyon trip tomorrow.  I also called Scott and they will plan on
joining us on Saturday afternoon.  It was late before we got to bed.</span></p>

Toone for 11 AM.  I got Irven and Sandy’s air conditioner going for them,
before I went to Dr. Toone’s.  Dr Toone adjusted my back and then suggested
that I ice pack the area that has been adjusted and also take a nap.  Mae has
been busy all morning packing and getting her Visiting Teaching done.  She
still had me follow Dr. Toone’s advise so I did for a half hour.  We finished
packing and when as we left we stopped for fuel in the pickup and boat.  We got
to Morgan just in time to see Tyler’s ball game.  David is an assistant coach
for Tyler’s team, so that gives us two reasons to watch and cheer for the
team.  They won the tournament for this year.  After the game we went over to
Sub-Way and bought us a Foot-Long Oven Roasted Chicken sandwich for our
dinner.  We then went back to where the team was being treated with Mile Shakes
and got Emily.  Emily road up to East Canyon Reservoir, to sight 27, where
David had their camper set up.  David, Connor and Tyler didn’t get up there

a little upset that we hadn’t taken him with us this morning but David had
tried to wake him but he didn’t seem to want to wake up at that time.  I did
enjoy the time to be with David.  We took the children out fishing but again
Tyler seem to get discouraged early and didn’t seem to enjoy it much.  Scott,
Mishelle and their family came up about 1 PM and join us.  Mae took the
children down to the beach while I took a short nap.  When I got up we took
Scott’s family out fishing and swimming.  Later I let David, Shauna and Scott
take the boat and they went out water skiing.  Mae and I cooked a Dutch oven
dinner for this evening.  I had two ovens of food cooked when David, Shauna and
Scott came back in.  After eating Scott and Mishelle packed up and left as well
as Mae and I.  I was really tired as we left the camp about 10:45 PM.  I had to
stop in Morgan and buy me some water and some pop-corn before driving on home. 
It was mid-night when we got home and then had to unpack before taking showers

they talked about our callings and possible a change.  We explained the details
but told them we would do what ever they would like us to do.  They explained
that Bishop Smith is out of town this morning but they would visit with him and
will consider the needs.  Mae had her “Miss Friendly” program to present to the
Primary to day.  We enjoyed all the meetings today.  Bob had part of Bruce’s
family for dinner but invited us to join them.  He had a very nice dinner. 
Later this evening he brought us down a ½ of an apple pie.  Mae worked on the
computer trying to get through the many e-mails she has received while we have
been gone.  Mark also came down this afternoon and said that he had lost the pictures
that I had copied from our files to a CD.  He gave me another DC and as I went
to copy to it I checked the CD and the pictures were already on the file so I
just took the disk back to him.  I caught the past few days up on my journal

the ground was still to wet to get in the field, so I came back home.  Bob had
just gone out to feed the chickens and rabbits about the same time that I went
upstairs to tell him that I didn’t stay at the Stake Farm so I would do the
animals.  I went out and we worked together with them.  Bob then needed to take
his car to Dee’s Service Center so I went over to bring him back.  We went out
to Smith and Edwards where I bought a 20 gal. Metal barrel that I could heat
water in to scaled chickens in.  I killed a rabbit and three chickens today. 
Mae tended David’s children today.  This afternoon she took them over to
Scott’s and while there she helped Mishelle with washing and the twins.  I
cooked the rabbit and then this evening I stripped the meat and ground it up. 
This evening Jeff and Gail brought their children over for Mae to tend while
they went to a show.  We picked strawberries from the garden, getting a nice
bowl full.  Irven and Sandy borrowed my miter saw this evening.  I did get a
short nap this afternoon but have kept going the rest of the time and tonight I
am sure tired.  I am going to take a shower and go to bed.  Mae stayed up for

dentures and make a final adjustment and alignment for her.  She let me sleep
in and I didn’t get up until 9AM.  That put me really late getting to my normal
morning chorus.  After feeding the rabbits and chickens I cut the hay.  It was
after 2PM when I finished that and came in for lunch.  I did lie down and take
a nap after eating.  Mae did her weekly washing today because yesterday she
tended David’s children.  Mae went back to the dentist and got her teeth.  When
I woke up I went out and cleaned the chicken coop.  I have let the chickens run
out side their pen yesterday and today but they are getting into the garden. 
Instead of chasing the chickens to get them back into the coop I turned the
light on in the coop to see how that will work.  When we got home after being
at the Family History Center, all the chickens had gone inside the coop. 
Before we left for the FHC, Mae gave me a hair cut and I took a shower.  This
evening at the FHC I got registered on the New Family History Search system. 
It looks like I have a lot to learn.  Mae isn’t feeling the best tonight so I
had her go to bed with out me.  I set up and compiled the first draft of a

upstairs to see if anything was taking place up there.  Nothing seemed out of
order.  I went out side and saw a large truck just down the street.  I asked
the men if they were doing anything with the sewer lines and they said that
they were just blow out the lateral lines to stop any blockage.  For some
reason our lines seem to have taken a lot of the force.  We watched things the
rest of the day but all seems to be ok.  Anyway that got us up.  I fed and
watered the animals and again let the chickens run.  They eat a lot of bugs but
they are also getting into the garden so I guess I had better keep them
penned.  Bob and I started laying decorative block around the west terraced
planter and at the east end of our entrance.  By 12:30 pm it was hot so we
quite for lunch and for the day because Mae and I had a wedding reception for
Gary and Ruth Nelson this afternoon.  We enjoyed the reception and visited with
Joan and Ralph Peterson for a minute as they were also there.  Mae had called
Eleanor and Dennis to invite them to go with us to the reception but Eleanor
called back and is having heart problems so won’t be able to attend.  After the
reception Mae and I stopped at the store for a few items.  This evening we
watched a John Wayne show on Comcast.  Although we did have four interruptions
by Bob, Mark and Irven and Sandy we really enjoyed it.  After the show I wrote
this entry and Mae opened the inter-net and read letters from Shellie and
Garrett.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast I fed the animals.  Bob and I then finished laying block on the
flower terries.  I even got Cole to help us.  it was 1PM before we finished up
and I came into the house for some dinner.  Robert and Patty came by on their
way to see a Dr. in Salt Lake.  Patty is having pain in her right foot and the
Dr. are not sure what is causing it.  They are going for some test and Patty
wanted to have a Priesthood Blessing.  Robert anointed Patty and I Sealed the
Anointing and gave her a blessing.  After going back downstairs I took a map. 
After getting up I did several small jobs and then filled 200 capsules with
Ambrotose.  Bob came down to tell me that the weather report indicated thunder
showers tonight.  He helped me move the snowmobiles and the tent trailer out of
the canapé.  We then loaded my cut hay onto Jeff’s trailer and parked it under
the canapé.  Mae has been busy all day with house work and also working in the
yard.  It was after 10:30 PM when I got to bed.  Mae stayed up a little longer,
using the chee machine for her back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30 AM so that I could get to the Stake onion patch to weed before the sun got
hot.  When I got there the field was posted to KEEP OUT because the field had
been sprayed.  The morning wasn’t wasted however as I got a greater and deeper
insight as to the need for the Savior to have gone thru such trials and pain. 
My feelings of love for my Savior, the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Succeeding
Prophets to President Monson, my special wife and my children; were all
deepened.  This experience in and of it self was worth the small effort of
getting up early.  Mae helped me with the morning chores and then we worked in
the garden together.  Mae was busy fixing food and items for this evening.  I
worked on the cloth dryer getting it taken apart.  After dinner I took a nap
and when I woke I put the dryer back together after cleaning it and using
silicone on some of the bearing parts.  We went over to Georgia’s and Rick’s
this evening where we were joined by Bryce and Deanna and by Carl and Amelia
and their Granddaughter Aiyonna.  Carl was on the Indian placement program and
lived with Mom and Dad Porter when Kim was young.  That was 39 years ago.  We
had good food, played games and enjoyed visiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and went to the Stake Farm and weeded in the onion patch for 1 ½ hr. 
When I got home Mae went for a short walk while I took care of the animals. 
She then fixed breakfast and after eating Mae and I went with Bob and Carroll
to Dr. Tune’s where we all got an adjustment.  When we got back home Mae and I
took a nap.  I worked around outside and also got things ready for Mae and I to
go fishing with float tubs.  I did get 200 capsules filled with Phyt-Aloe
capsulated in between doing other things today.  Mae has been busy with house
cleaning and getting food ready for a backyard social this evening and also to
have Jeff and Scott’s families over for dinner tomorrow.  The backyard party
was hosted by Wanda Miller and that turned out very nice.  The only problem was
that Mae and I couldn’t eat much of the foods.  Bob and Carroll came home early
and when we got home Bob was mowing the lawns.  That made Mae happy as she has
invited some of the kids families for dinner tomorrow.  Mae trimmed the lawn
and I started cutting some of the heavy weeds along the fences down.  That led
to trimming some trees and grape vines.  It was a nice evening to work
outside.  About 9:30 PM I told Mae that I was still hungry.  She cooked us some
toast and we had apple sauce and some fried chicken.  As we were eating I heard
noises outside and when we went to look it was Sunset City setting of
fireworks.  We went out side and watched them of about ½ hour.  It was a nice
display but I sometimes wonder if we are using wisdom in spending money for
that kind of entertainment.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
6AM and was up for a while and read my scriptures before cuddling back up in
bed with Mae.  I fed the animals and came back in for breakfast.  We just had
time to get ready for church.  My teeth on the right side, has been bothering
me for a couple of days.  Maybe I had better call for a dental appointment.  I
didn’t feel the best today and when we walked home the heat made me dizzy.  Still
not feeling well I took a nap after we had something for lunch.  Scott,
Mishelle and the children came over for dinner.  Jeff and his family were also
invited but Benji is sick so they didn’t come over.  We sure enjoyed the
afternoon and evening with Scott and his lovely family.  Scott and I had a good
talk about the Gospel  and our testimonies.  The twins are growing so fast and
learning so much each time se see them.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6AM to go fishing.  We ate breakfast and took care of the chickens and rabbits
and left about 8AM.  We went up to the reservoir east of the cement plant up
Weber canon.   It is a small reservoir so they will not let boats with anymore
than a small trolling motor on the lake.  We therefore used float tubs.  They
were great except a breeze came up from the west and we soon found out that we
were moving up the reservoir faster than we could move back to the dam.  We had
to paddle to the north side where I got out of my tub and started to pull Mae
along the shore.  In the process Mae dropped my fishing pole and one of my
fins.  I could see my pull about 6 or 7 feet deep on a ledge.  Carefully I used
the other fishing pole and was able to work the other one up to the surface
where I grabbed it.  I then looked to see if the fin could also be seen.  We
spotted it but it was a little deeper than the pole had been.  I changed the
hook on the longest pole to a heavy triple hook and reaching as deep as I could
I hooked the fin and brought it up.  We then proceeded with me pulling Mae
along the shore line until the shore line turned and the breeze was blocked. 
Mae then got out of the tub and I got back in.  Mae then walked along a trail
back to the pickup.  I paddled the tubs over to the shore closer to the pickup
and then we carried the equipment up.  We decided that the tubs are fun but we
will stick to the boat unless we go to a small lake that doesn’t have so much
distance for the wind to carry us, such as Payson Lake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We came on
home and took a nap and rested the rest of the day.  Paddling those tubs was
quite a workout.  We watched a John Wayne show.  It had been a fun day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I tried using
a different mask with the c-pap last night and I only had it on for a couple of
hours before I couldn’t stand it and removed it.  At 2:19AM the telephone rang
and when I answered it a young girl (anyway I guess she was young) ask what was
up.  I asked who this was and she just said, “Who are you?”  I hung the phone
up and then couldn’t go back to sleep for some time.  I finally got up and came
into the front room and slept the rest of the night in the recliner.  Mae woke
me about 7:30AM and we went over to Marcie Fairbourn’s and where we got Jeff’s
car and took to Dee’s.  Jeff has taken Gail into the hospital with labor
pains.  I worked on plans to build a sun room over the patio for Bob and
Carroll.  Mae was busy all day cleaning out the storage room so that Bob and
Carroll could have more storage areas.  We decided to go to Dee’s and get
Jeff’s car and take it to Marcie’s.  At the same time Mae would go to the store
and get a gift for Jeff and Gail’s new baby.  The baby was born today about
2:30PM, he weight 7lb 7oz and was 19 inches long.  Both mother and baby are
doing fine.  The problem of our plans came as we left on time but as I went to
turn right onto Main Street a pickup traveling south on Main Street was in the
left lane but just as it came to the intersection it changed lanes to the right
hand lane.  This caused me to quickly stop and as I did the car behind me had
also starting to move but didn’t stop as quickly as did I so it bumped into our
car.  This caused us a 45 minute delay in our plans so we had to forgo our
plans to go out to eat dinner.  We did stop and get some Maddox’s chicken
before we went to the Family History Center.  Tonight Brother Bell, Mae and I
were only workers there tonight and we had several people come for help.  We
didn’t do to well tonight.  After getting home I filled out this journal
entry.  While I was writing this entry, Mae turned on the TV to a BYU talk,
given by Daniel C. Peterson.  I could not help wishing that Jeff and David
would lesson to this talk and to the defense of the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine
and Covenant and latter day doctrines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
planning for Mae and I to go get Benji and Rachael and then over to the
hospital to see the new baby.  I took care of the rabbits and chickens and came
in for breakfast.  I asked Mae if she could take care of things with the
children and let me stay at home and get started on some of the things I needed
to do today.  She did and I stayed and picked and weeded the strawberries.  I
started the irrigation water on the garden and watched it through the day.  I
worked on Bob &amp; Carroll’s plans for their sunroom.  I got things gathered
up so I was ready to install a water faucet in the back of the house.  I
disassembled a lamp that the touch control switch has worn out.  I had a
dentist appointment with Dr. Gray at 11:40AM.  He x-rayed my teeth but didn’t
find any problem to explain why I have a sensitive area.  I stopped at The Home
Depot on the way back home and bought a switch for the lamp and some liquid
foam to seal around the pipe I am installing for the faucet.  Mae had returned
with the children when I got there.  Mae and the children had also eaten by the
time I returned home.  Bob invited me to eat lunch with him and Mark.  Bob
cooked steak and had salad for lunch.  After lunch I couldn’t get into the
bedroom to turn off the water to the house, because Mae put the children down
for a nap.  I therefore repaired a water line on the irrigation lines to the
rose bushes in the front of the yard.  When the children woke from their naps I
shut off the water and connected the water line for the new water faucet.  I
then watered the chickens and we went over to the hospital to see Gail, Jeff
and the new baby.  They will name him Mathew.  Both Gail and the baby seem to
be doing fine.  Trent Teeples had also come to visit them along with a friend
of Gail’s Jen.  Marcy is sick with the flew so we will keep the children
tonight.  We had to stop by Marcy’s home and get some more clothes and a
sleeping crib for the children.  Benji and Mae sang the ABC song and a couple
of others all the way home.  When Mae put the children to bed Benji wanted to
say prayers before going to sleep.  He blessed his Dad, his Mom and his baby. 
I am sure tired tonight but it is almost 10:30PM as I finish this entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The children
slept well last night so we didn’t get up until 7:45AM.  While I was reading my
morning study time, I read the history of the Prophet Joseph Smith imprisonment
in Liberty Jail; the Extermination Order by Governor Boggs and the mob action
that forced the Saints to leave Missouri in the winter; and the dedication of
many of the early Saints when called to serve missions; my hart felt such
feelings of sorrow and gratitude that I literally broke into tears.  I can’t
help but feel that of all the challenges we have had during our life this
challenge of David and Jeff loosing their testimonies and leaving the Church
has been the hardest I have had to except.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I took Benji
with me to feed the chickens and rabbits.  He really enjoyed that experience. 
As we finished and returned to the house Benji carried an egg in each hand to
give to Grandma.  I tried to get more done on the remodel plans but had several
interruptions and didn’t get much done.  Jeff brought Gail and Matt home this
afternoon.  We took Benji and Rachael home but on the way picked up Jeff at the
car dealership where he left their black car to have some work done on it.  We
got home just in time to attend a meeting with the High Councilman over the
Family History research.  The High Priest leadership was also in attendance. 
It’s almost 10PM and I am getting up early to help Bob take a load of tree
trimmings to the dumps, so I will close and play a game of Solitary before
going to bed.  I played three games, lost one and won two.</span></p>

way I dropped of the trailer tire to get it replaced.  I also took a propane
tank up to JP’s to do a trade as the gas will not come out.  However JP’s no
longer handles the trade so I will have to go somewhere else.  Bob helped me
kill and clean 11 roosters.  This evening I skinned, cut up and packaged four
of the chickens.  The rest we found room in the fridge and put them in there
for tonight.  Mae has been cleaning all day to gather things for the D.I.  This
is the second day in a row that she has spent considerable time trying to get
things cleaned up so that Jeff can have some room for his things.</span></p>

could tend the children while Gail was in the hospital and we were happy to do
that.  We enjoyed having the children with us, they are so cute.   In the
afternoon we took the children over to the hospital to see their new baby
brother.  Benji was excited to see the baby and his mom &amp; dad.  Gail looked
great.  I’m sure I didn’t look that good after I had my babies.  Little Matthew
is so darling.  I enjoyed holding him.  Benji and Rachel were cute with the
