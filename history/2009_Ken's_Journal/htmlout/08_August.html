<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
before 7AM and read my scriptures and had personal prayer.  I sure enjoy
starting the day in this way.  I am so greatful for the guiding influence that
the Gospel has on my life.  With it I find purpose to life; many answers to the
questions of life; guidance and direction for life; but especially hope for
life after this life.  I have often thought that these reasons in and of them
self would be a great reason to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints; but then to add the personal testimony of the restoration of the
Gospel with all its Authority and Priesthood Ordinances, that I have received;
gives me great strength and happiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae prepared
breakfast while I printed off four months worth of my journals.  I then took
care of the animals.  As soon as I finished that I went up and got the tire for
the trailer.  I packed the bearings on the camp trailer and had just finished
that when Mae called me for lunch.  After lunch I packed the wheel bearings on
the boat trailer.  The right bearing was ok but the left had water mixed with
the grease when I removed the bearings.  The inside seal was bad and the
bearings looked stained.  I bought a new set of bearings and seal for the left
wheel.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae has been
busy all day with house cleaning and packing for our trip.  She went to town
for some items.  After the close call of loosing the key to the boat when we
were up to East Canyon with David’s family I had Mae make a duplicate key while
she was at the store.  Mae came back from shopping about the time I finished
with the bearings.  She came out and helped me vacuum and wash the boat.  It
was very dirty inside and out.  We got that done and ate some dinner.  I then
parked the boat and camp trailer in our driveway so that they are ready to pack
and go.  We then showered and changed before going to a wedding reception for
Jenessa Hubbard and Broadrick Horton.  It was held in the back yard of the
Hubbard’s so we saw several from the old Ward that we know.  Scott and Mishelle
were late getting there and so they came in one side of the yard as we left the
other side.  Scott had tried to call me but I hadn’t heard my phone ring.  After
returning home I cut Mae’s hair and then filled out this entry.  Mae took a shower
and I played a game of Solitary before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke about
5:30AM but laid and cuddled for a while.  After getting up and reading I took
care of the chickens and rabbits.  I then set the tent trailer up but got a bucket
of soapy water and the hose and washed it down.  It was really dirty on the
outside.  When I came in Mae got after me for doing that on Sunday.  I started
writing a thank you card to Garrett for the Fathers Day card he sent me.  (a
little late!)  We attended meetings and I felt discouraged with the lesson in
Priesthood meeting.  I just felt like somewhere I sure failed with the raising
of my family.  We came home and I continued with the card for Garrett until Bob
called us for dinner.  During dinner my tooth broke and came out.  That means
that I will have to see the dentist before we leave tomorrow.  I already feel
that I have to much to take care of in the morning with out this.  After dinner
Mae and I took the boat out to Sandi’s.  Mae figured that we could get out to
Sandi’s and back , take some things to Jeff and Gale’s and be at the Family
History Center by 6:30PM.  I also let it get to me as we turned onto I-80 West
as there was road constructions and I had to do some re-routing to get around. 
Mae questioned where I was going and that set wrong with me.  We made it back
just in time for the training meeting at the F.H.C. and so afterwards took the
things to Jeff and Gale.  I felt overwhelmed and confused by the time the
meeting was over.  I am discouraged this evening.  I checked to tent trailer
and I had not set up the sink up therefore the power hadn’t came on.  Bob had
taken the garbage cans out to the street but hadn’t taken the chicken cleanings
out so I did that.  I finished the card to Garrett so we could get it mailed
tomorrow and entered this journal entry before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM so that I could get a early start.  I took care of the chickens and rabbits
and with Bob’s help we skinned cut up and packaged the chickens that I didn’t
get done Saturday.  Mae called Dr. Gray and he wants me to wait until I return
for an appointment in as much as I don’t have pain with the broken tooth.  Mae
and I got things packed up and left about noon.  We stopped to get gas in
Clearfield and then drove to American Fork where we met Becky and gave her some
vegetables from our garden.  We got natural gas at Spanish Fork and again at
Richfield before getting to Fish Lake.  We found a camp site and setup the tent
trailer.  We found that we had some broken water couplings.  I did get the
water in the sink working.  We had bought Sub-Way sandwiches while in Richfield
so that help us with dinner this evening.  We enjoyed being together this
evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up two
or three times during the night.  The furnace didn’t work the best last night. 
We slept in and enjoyed going for a walk along the lake.  It is sure beautiful
country here at Fish Lake.  Sandi and Nick came about 1:30PM; after getting
Nick and Sandi settled we took the boat out on the Lake.  We fished this
afternoon and did fairly well and had a lot of fun.  When we came back to the boat
dock area, Nick when over to the truck to put some things in it.  The first
thing he realized is that the boat trailer was missing from the truck.  Nick had
parked the truck and trailer after lunching the boat.  He did not see the three
signs that said that you could not park trailers on this side of the road. 
Someone had disconnected the trailer and moved it to the other side of the road
in the area for boat trailers.  Nick was relieved to find it but also felt a
little stupid that he hadn’t seen the signs.  After eating this evening we
played Marbles until we went to bed.  Nick and I won two out of three games.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Nick and I
went out fishing about 6:30AM.  We fished until about 1:15PM before coming in
for lunch.  We had caught four fish that we kept and released ½ dozen others. 
We cooked fish and eggs for lunch.  We played games this afternoon, because it
rained all afternoon; until it was time to prepare dinner.  Sandi and Mae
prepared the vegetables for me to cook in the Dutch oven.  I cooked Dutch oven
chicken and rabbit with potatoes, carrots, onions and yams.  While I was cooking
dinner Mae and Sandi went for a walk.  Nick stayed with me and in between
checking the ovens, we played Rummy.  Nick won the game.  After dinner I
cleaned up the oven and then we played more games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                All four of
us went out fishing this morning.  It was quite windy from the start so I
mainly drove the boat while the others fished.  We would drive to the North
West end of the lake, into the wind and then just let the wind push us back to
the South East.  We did quite well and all had fun.  It was quite rough when we
quite and came back to camp.  The wind continued the rest of the day so we
stayed in camp and played games.  Mae and I went to the store to the North end
of the lake and used the public showers.  It cost $3.00 each but it was sure
worth it.  Mae showered first and had trouble getting the water adjusted.  By
the time I got in it was cool but I didn’t bother the adjustment.  This evening
we again played games before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Nick, Sandi
and I went out fishing this morning.  We had a good time fishing and all caught
our share of fish although I think Sandi may have caught the most.  The wind
came up and got quite bad but not as bad as it was yesterday.  We quite at 11Am
with the three limits of fish, and came back to camp.  Mae stayed at camp and
slept in a little later.  She wanted to do her hair so she tried to start the
generator.  In the process she slipped and landed on a rock.  With all that she
didn’t get the generator started, so she drove to the store where we had taken
showers and used their power to curl her hair.  While Nick and I were getting
the boat trailer, Sandi overheard three men that returned a rented boat, report
to the dock man, that that they hadn’t caught anything this morning.  He told
them that he had only see three fish brought in this morning.  We didn’t show
him our three limits.  Mae had most things cleaned up at camp when we got
there.  We ate and then finished packing up.  We left for Tropic about noon. 
Mae had misplaced Keela’s address so I didn’t have it to enter into the GPS. 
We stopped at the store to get some ice to pack the fish in.  While there Mae
asked Sandi if she had the address.  Nick got out his map and said that he felt
that we should go South through Loa.  I put a intersection in the GPS of Tropic
and the GPS suggested that we go back to Richfield and then south along Highway
89.  Nick felt that was the wrong way so we went his way.  It was a much more
beautiful and scenic way but it took us at least 1 1/2 hours longer that way. 
We also stopped at a Sub-Way and got us something for dinner as we know that we
would be late getting there and probably not have much that we could eat
anyway.  It was 6PM when we got to Tropic and that was dinner time.  I did most
of the setting up of the camp trailer.  There was a good turnout and it was a
very enjoyable evening.  Before going to bed Sandi, Nick, Mae and I went over
to David’s trailer and played games with David.  Shauna didn’t feel very good
so we tried to be quite so she could sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Most of the
Family gathered for breakfast.  Keela and Pete have a very nice lodge for the
gathering.  It was a very impressive setting and facilities.  On of the
highlights for me was to have Aunt Iris (age 89) and Aunt Joy (age 85) there
with us.  they both look very good and seem to get along quite well.  There
were many activities for all ages to participate in.  Mae and I helped some of
the children build bird houses.  Sandi, Nick and I went on a 3 ½ hour horse
back trip down into Bryce Canon.  It was 49 years ago that Mae and I hiked down
into Bryce Canon and still remember that experience.  I can tell you that horse
or mule trip down and out the canon is a much better way for me to go.  Mae didn’t
go with us as I was concerned about her sore bottom (from her fall yesterday)
and he bad back.  this evening we had a very enjoyable talent program which
many participated in.  Mae and I started it off by singing “There’s a Hole in
the Bucket”.  We made it through it but I couldn’t remember the tune.  The
evening was a lot of fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Most of the
Family gathered for a Sacrament meeting although the Sacrament wasn’t passed. 
Uncle Van conducted and had Bryce and Deanna report on their mission and gave
an inspirational message.  Both of them did a very special job and left us with
special thoughts of our Savior and what he did for us.  Bryce will always be
Bryce but I am so impressed with his testimony.  I just hoped that David, Shauna
and their children could feel the Spirit that I felt during their talks.  We
packed things up and left a little after noon.  We stopped in Panguitch at
Sub-Way and got a sandwich for lunch.  We filled the boat and Sandi’s truck
with gas while there.  Mae and I then stayed on highway 89 to Ephraim where I
bought a doe rabbit at Taylor’s Rabbit Farm.  We did stop at Richfield and get
natural gas, on the way.  As we drove Mae read from the book “Love That
Lasts”.  We talked about the thoughts that were expressed in the book and as we
did I got the feeling that Mae felt that most of our moves was all my
decision.  As we continued to talk about it I found that there are many things
that I didn’t realize her feelings about.  I really had a depression come over
me.  I gained a feeling that I have really made a lot of bad decisions and
really have blown it.  We stopped in Springville for natural gas and we ate
some dinner there at the Flying J.  It was about 9PM when we got home.  Bob
helped us unload.  As soon as I came in to the house I could hear water
running.  I soon found that the water softener was frozen in full discharge
passion and I could not shut it off.  I am not sure how long that it has been
that way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6:30 AM but it seemed that I really couldn’t get going.  Dr. Gray’s
office called and said that they could take me at 10AM if it would work out
better for me.  I decided to do it if it would help them with their schedule.  After
eating breakfast I took care of the animals, which seemed to take me a long
time.  One thing there was two rabbits that had got out and I finally had to
call Mae who called Bob and with the two of them we were able to catch the
rabbits and put them back in their pens.  I had to hurry to get to my dental
appointment.  Dr. Gray put a temporary crown on my tooth.  It will take two
weeks for him to have the perminate crown.  Mae stayed out and picked tomatoes
for two hours.  We will take them with us this evening and gave them to family
members at the Byron Porter reunion.  I spent the rest of the day canning
fish.  I got seven quarts cooked and another seven quarts ready to cook
tomorrow.  We went to the reunion and had a good time.  Although I enjoyed the
evening I still have a hunting feeling about the talk Mae and I had yesterday. 
It was late when we got home from the Reunion but we stayed up and watched a
movie that was good.  I guess we were not the only ones that had problem when
we got home from the trip.  Bryce and Deanna’s care broke down and they had to
take the care on home with a trailer.  When Georgia and Rick got home their
water heater had gone out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were
awakening by a phone call asking for help in defeating the run-a-way Government
that is taking place.  That was depressing in it self and of course they wanted
a contribution and gave you a guilt complex to support them.  I got a call from
the plumber that I called yesterday to see if parts were available for the
water softener but they aren’t.  the unit is over 25 years old.  After
breakfast I went out and fed the animals.  Mark came out and we got talking so
that took longer plus depressing over the government situation.  When I came in
I wasn’t satisfied with the way the fish had turned out so I redid the bottles
that I hadn’t cooked yesterday.   I emptied the jars out and skinned the fish,
plus cut them into smaller pieces and packed them tighter when I refilled the
jars.  Again it took most of the day to put the fish up and cook it.  We went
to the Family History Center this evening.  I just feel so lost trying to help
there when I don’t know what I am doing.  I didn’t have my pass word and sign
in name with me.  Mae was busy helping patrons so I couldn’t get her help and I
just became discouraged until I just went out into the car and went to sleep. 
As we drove home I really couldn’t express my feelings of discouragement.  When
we got home I caught my journal up before we went to bed.  </span></p>

about 7AM and Mae got up a little later.  After breakfast I took care of the
animals.  Before I did Mae and I had a discussion over the problems that
occurred Sunday as we were coming home.  Everything is worked out again.  Mae
is very special and I am so glad that I have her love.   Mae came out and
picked strawberries, beans and green peppers.  I helped with some weeding.  I
set up the tent trailer and took some of the plumbing apart.  I went over to
the bus terminal and lined up a date for the in-service training class, then to
Durk’s where I bought a new water softener and some parts to repair the tent
trailer.  On the way home I bought some feed for the animals.  I took a nap
while dinner was cooking.  After dinner I installed the new water softener. 
Bob and I went Home Teaching to Johnston’s and Casey’s but Sister Fallis wasn’t
home this evening.  Bob had mowed the lawn this morning so Mae trimmed it this
evening.  We watched a movie this evening before going to bed.</span></p>

sick to her stomach. She came back to bed with leg cramps and still feeling
sick.  I rubbed her legs and got her some Tylenol and water.  I let her sleep
in.  I called David as was going to tend their children for them today.  I
suggested that I could come up to their place and tend the children but David
said that he would take the day of and stay with them.  I got me some breakfast
and then took care of the animals.  I then worked on the rabbit and chicken
records.  I worked on Bob and Carroll’s Sun Room plans.  I also worked on the
tent trailer repairing some of the plumbing problems but I needed a part that I
can’t get until after noon tomorrow.  I tried to take care of Mae through the
day.  This evening we watched a show on DVD and one on Comcast.  I am not
feeling the best this evening.  Nick brought the boat to me getting here at
10PM.  I got him some vegetables from the garden to take home with him.  We
also gave him a Birthday Present as today is his Birthday.</span></p>

the recliner most of the night so that I didn’t disturb Mae.  I did get up and
took care of the animals.  After taking care of the animals I came back into
the house and went back to bed and slept for a while.  This afternoon I went to
the parts shop and got the part that I needed yesterday.  Bob had got a spare
tire for his pickup so I helped him install it under the frame.  This way it
should remain with the truck.  Mae got up set with me doing that as I haven’t
been feeling well.  I also helped Mark seal some of his guns in the seal-a-mill
wrap.  I was to help at the Ogden Temple this evening but because I wasn’t
feeling well, Bob went in my place.  After dinner I lay in the recliner and
went back to sleep.  Mae and I worked on the New Family Search training for a
while this evening.  I entered this entry and now I had better take a shower

rabbits and bottled them.  Mae prepared the bottles for me.  Out of the four
rabbits we got four quarts of meat plus 1 ½ rabbits for Bob to cook for dinner

We stayed after meetings to get our recommends for the dedication of the Oquirrh

he will stop by our place this afternoon.  Just before we went up stairs to eat
dinner Brother Thurman came by with the tickets.  Bob had a wonderful dinner
for us.  Bruce, Micheline and Jamie were also there.  We had rabbit and Bob had
cooked it very well.  This was the first time Jamie had tried rabbit and
Micheline had only tried wild rabbit but they both enjoyed the meat.  After
dinner Mae and I started working on the New Family History program.  I had to
stop and take a nap and then we worked on it later this evening.  We took time
to check the chickens and gather the eggs.  We are getting about 8 to 12 eggs
per day.  The eggs very in size now but they seem to be getting bigger each
day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6:30AM so Mae could take David’s and Scott’s children to Dinosaur Park in
Ogden.  Mae picked tomatoes and vegetables from the garden and prepared
breakfast while I took care of the animals.  I spent the rest of the morning
butchering seven rabbits.  I got me some lunch and then started cutting up the
rabbits.  I slipped with the knife and cut my hand.  That slowed me down a
little in cutting up the rabbits.  I got 14 quarts of rabbit packed and then
cooked it.  That took me the rest of the day.  Mae didn’t get home until
5:30PM.  She brought some Chinese food home for dinner.  We watched “Touched by
an Angle” on TV while we ate.  We then got on the inter-net and studied more of
our calling as Family History Consultants.  Bob mowed the lawns this evening
and when he went out back he ran over my 100’ extension cord and cut it into. 
He felt bad but I guess that’s life.  I gave out about 9PM so we quite and I
finished this entry and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3:30AM with the water softener starting to regenerate.  I was concerned about
the discharge hose working of so I went into the furnace room and checked it of
be sure it was ok.  I tried to go back to sleep but my feet stated jumping so I
got up and set in the recliner.  I did fall asleep and at 6AM when Jeff got up
he turned on the kitchen light and it woke me.  I did get to visit with him for
a minute before he showered, ate and went into work.  I was going to get up but
covered up and went back to sleep.  Mae and I had got up and were about ready
for breakfast when Dr. Gray’s receptionist called and wants me to come in at
10AM.  I had to hurry and shower and go so I didn’t get the rabbits and
chickens taken care of until after I returned.  Dr. Gray still can’t find why
my teeth are causing me problems so he wants me to take 2 Ibuprofen twice today
and again tomorrow morning to see if that will take any inflammation down.  If
it gets worse I am to call him.  If not I will go back in next Monday for the
perminate crown.  He said that there is a possibility that the root is dieing
and he will have to do a root cannel.  I ask about the perminate crown and he
said he can still do a root cannel even through the crown, but he preferred to
do it before the crown is placed.  It was noon before I finished with the
animals.  Scott and Jeff came for lunch today.  We sure enjoy having them.  I
picked tomatoes after lunch and then Mae and I put up 12 quarts of tomato
juice.  We had to hurry in order to finish up in time to go to the Family
History Center.  We didn’t have any patrons come in tonight so we all did some
studying on the New Family Search system.  Mae was able to help Sister Sharon
Patterson get registered on line.  She had become so upset trying to get
registered and had not got it done.  Mae called the Help Center and they found
the problem which really helped Sister Patterson.  It was a got night.  I
filled out this entry after we got home this evening.  While I was doing this
Mae finished cleaning up form our canning and put the tomato juice away.</span></p>

7AM and took a shower.  We had to hurry with the morning chores as we had an
appointment with Dawn Sorrentino to help her Family History.  We were with her
for over two hours and did get her started and we learned a lot.  After lunch I
took a nap and then went over to Irven and Sandy’s and did some repairs for
them.  I got home in time to eat dinner.  Mae then went to the Book Study
Group.  I set down and took another nap before Bob and I went Home Teaching to
Sister Fallis.  Just before we were winding up to go home Mae brought over a
dozen eggs and some tomatoes.  When we got home Jeff was there so we visited with
him for a while before we went to bed.</span></p>

early so I could take care of the animals before going to a meeting with all
the bus staff.  It was held at Davis High School auditorium.  It was ok but
long.  I came home about 12:30PM.  Mae was putting up tomatoes so I helped
her.  We had lunch and then I took a nap.  Mae had a hair appointment so I
finished cooking the tomatoes while she was gone.  I then went over to Irven
and Sandy’s and put a second coat of mud over the patches I put on yesterday. 
I did some caulking around the bath tub and some base board.  I got home about
6PM but Mae wasn’t home yet.  I called her and had her pickup some Chinese
food.  I cooked some brown rice for us to use in place of the normal white rice
that comes with the meal.  Brother Thompson came Home Teaching this evening so
we didn’t have time to eat before his visit.  Jeff came this evening and when
we came down stairs Gale and the children were here also.  I ate a little and
then had to go to Ogden to get gas in my pickup.  After returning I hooked up
the boat and got things ready to go fishing in the morning.  Mae, Jeff, Gale
and the children had set up the projector out side and we watching a movie.  I
entered this entry and then went to bed.  Mae stayed up with Jeff, Gale and the
children for a while and then prepared me a lunch and breakfast for tomorrow.</span></p>

4AM to get ready to go fishing.  I had a little extra time so I fed the rabbits
and chickens before leaving.  I was at Randy’s just after 6AM.  We went to East
Cannon Reservoir and enjoyed a beautiful morning.  Randy had several strikes
but didn’t hook any while I caught three fish.  He finally said that something
was wrong with his real.  When I checked it out I found that his line was
slipping on the spool.  I let the line all the way out and retied it on the
spool.  Randy then caught four fish in just a few minutes.  I caught the last
fish so we each caught out limit.  We enjoyed the beautiful morning and were
happy to take home our fish.  We got home just after noon but then I stopped at
Rick’s (Randy’s son) new home he is building and looked through it.  Mae came
home shortly after I got there.  She had gone to visit with Jeanenne and ended
up going out to lunch with Kim, Jeanenne and Calub.  I felid the fish and took
them up to Bob so he could cook them in the morning for breakfast for all of
us.  When she got home we both took a nap for a hour.  I worked on the tent
trailer getting the plumbing repaired.  This evening we relaxed and watched
TV.  Jeff came about 10:30PM and relaxed with s.  We were late going to bed.</span></p>

up much before Bob had breakfast ready.  He cooked biscuits with hamburger
gravy along with fried trout that I caught yesterday and filet them for him. 
After breakfast I got things ready to kill roosters.  Scott brought the
children over as they wanted to see Grandpa kill the roosters.  I killed two of
the three roosters.  By the time I killed and dressed them out, plus cut them
and sealed them with the Seal-A- Meal my time was gone for today.  We had lunch
and then I took a nap.  We went to Davis High School for a tour of the school. 
This was in connection with Mae’s 50<sup>th</sup> High school Graduation.  We
enjoyed seeing the new rebuilt Davis High School.  It is sure a different structure
than when we went there.  We stopped at Albertsons and bought some water and
bananas before going to Salt Lake.  We had an extra 1 ½ hours before the dinner
so we took a ride on the trolley from Temple Square to the University of Utah
and back again.  We then went to the Grand America Hotel where the Reunion was
held in the Ball Room.  It was a very nice reunion and a lot of work had goon
into the orginiziation of the evening.  Mae especially enjoyed renewing
acquaintances with old class mates.  The dinner was ok but nothing to rave
about.  It was 11 PM before we returned home.  I filled in this entry and we
had a piece of toast and some apple sauce.  Jeff went to work this morning but
came home about 11AM with a head ache and went back to bed.  There were
evidences that he had been up while we were gone but he was in bed when we got
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30AM so that I could be ready for the Temple Dedication at 9AM.  I enjoyed
reading the 14<sup>th</sup> chapter of Helaman this morning in my scripture
study.  I do look forward to the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.  As I read I couldn’t help but wonder how many felt that gave up on the
Lord’s 1<sup>st</sup> appearance and especially those that denied maybe just
hours or even minutes before His crucifixion and therefore lost everything of
eternal worth.  I have special concerns about some of my own children and want
so much to help them.  I am so greatful for the Testimony that I have of my
Savior, Jesus Christ, the restoration of His Gospel through the Prophet Joseph
Smith and that we have the Great Priesthood Power on earth today and a living
Prophet to guide us.  I am excited to attend the Dedication of the Oquirrh
Mountain Temple today.  I went back into the bed room and cuddled up with Mae
for a few minutes.  I sure love that girl and feel so blessed to have her for
my Eternal Companion.  I hurried to care for the chickens and rabbits and then
came in and had cold cereal with Mae for breakfast.  We were a little later
getting to the church than we had wanted because it meant that we had to set in
the back on harder chairs.  The Dedication was wonderful and all that
participated did a special job.  The choir and music was very well performed
and very meaningful.  President Monson’s Dedicatory Prayer was so fitting and
special.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob had us up
for dinner and had a wonderful meal.  It was simple, baked chicken, rice pilaf
and salad but I felt that that meal was much better than the expensive meal
that was served to us last night.  After dinner Mae and I took a nap.  Scott
called and woke us.  He wanted to let me know that the boards he needs should
be 22” long.  I asked him if they had gone to the Dedication meeting and he
said that they hadn’t.  It was 2:10PM so I told him that we would come over to
tend the children so they could go but he said that they hadn’t got tickets. 
That was a disappointing thing for me to find out.  I went out back and took
the tent trailer down.  Although it had rained last night and again this
morning the wind had came up and dried out the tenting on the trailer.  I
finished up the repairs and folded it up so that it wouldn’t sustain other
weather damages.  I am really disappointed with my family.  David and his
family are lacking in testimony.  Jeff has seemingly lost all belief in not
only the Church but also in God.  Sandi doesn’t show much strength in her
testimony and now Scott and Mishelle didn’t even try to plan on attending the
Dedication.  Mae did call Mike and told me that he and his family attended the
Dedication, that’s a boost.  I am afraid that I am not scoring very high on the
success rate of raising a family.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
worked on the lessons for New Family Search for a while and then we went
upstairs and played a game of Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Mae and Carroll
beat Bob and I again.  It was really not even a fun game.  When we came
downstairs I got on the computer and bid on Field Trips for Sept 1<sup>st</sup>
through 4<sup>th</sup>.  I then finished this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

little longer than I should have but then I had to hurry to take care of the
rabbits and chickens before I went to the Dentist.  We decided to do a root canal
on this tooth that has been bothering me.  When Dr. Gray drilled the tooth out
and when he did he said that we had made the right choice as the root was
almost dead.  After getting home I finished feeding the animals.  I hadn’t fed
them any hay before so gave them some now.  After lunch I took a nap while Mae
and Connor went over to the park.  I put my snowmobiles, boat and camp trailer
under the canopy.  I had to have Mae come out and help guide me in order to get
all three in.  After dinner I started this entry.  We were going to work on
Family History this evening but when Jeff came home we played rummy.  It is now
10:20PM so we had better get to bed.</span></p>

nothing except Wild World and that program was almost over.  At 5AM Mae came in
and got me to come back to bed.  We were late getting up.  I took care of the
animals and helped Mark cut and take away the corn stocks.  I planned a board
for Scott and Mishelle but I don’t remember the length he wanted it cut.  Mae
made dinner for Scott and Jeff to eat with us but neither could get away from
work today.  I took a field trip today and didn’t finish until 8:30PM.  Mae had
gone to the Family History Center so I beat her home.  After getting home I
entered my field trip into the computer.  Mae got me something to eat when she
came home.  We played a game of Rummy with Jeff to help him un-wind from work
and hopefully be able to sleep tonight.</span></p>

5:30 AM so that I could get things ready to leave with Nick this afternoon for
Flaming Gorge fishing.  We will be home on Saturday afternoon or evening.  I
did rotate the tires on the car and did some repairs to the rear bumper.  The
rear bumper still doesn’t look right but at least it shouldn’t fall off.  I got
some boards finished for Scott and Mishelle and showed Mae how to take care of
the chickens. The red hen is setting and she doesn’t leave the nest even for
food and water.  I therefore take her off the nest for a few minutes each day. 
Mae has sure been a help to me in getting me ready to go today.  I was all
packed and ready to go by 5PM but Nick didn’t get here until about 7:30PM so it
will be a long drive tonight.  Nick and I arrived at Lucerne Valley Marina camp
ground just after midnight.</span></p>

through out the air mattress with out sleeping bags and went to sleep.  The
stars were so bright that I woke several times and just looked at the sky in
amazement at the beauty and wonder of the sky.  We got up, prepared some quick
breakfast, set up our tent and went out fishing.  We stopped on the way to the
boat dock and paid for our camp site.  We fished until after noon with out any
success so we came in to get some lunch.  After eating we were going to take a
nap but found that our tent was right in the hot sun.  We looked at a empty
camp site close to our site and it had a shady area in it.  We decided to move
out tent to that site and did but it was more work than I had anticipated. 
After moving we had to go to the office and change our camp site.  The lady
wasn’t too happy but made the change.  We went back out fishing and Nick did
catch a nice <u>coco salmon</u>.  When we came in we cleaned the one fish and
fillet it for breakfast tomorrow.  Nick and I played a game of Rummy before we
went to bed.  The one trouble with a tent is that you don’t see the stars as
well as just sleeping under the sky. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up
before 5AM so that we could get an early start on the day.  After preparing and
eating breakfast of salmon, we met Hank _____ at the boat dock about 7AM.  Hank
is a good friend of Nick’s who now lives in Manila and is a licensed Fishing
Guide.  He supplied the boat and all the fishing equipment.  We just had to
have our fishing licenses and snacks.  We fished until almost 2PM with out any
of us even having a bite.  Then we changed to the forth location and as I
dropped my lure and made the first jig I had a Lake trout strike.  He put up a
good fight and after getting him in and having Nick take a photo, I released
him.  That gave us some hope but that was our only catch.  We finally quite fishing
for the day at 4PM, very hot and tired.  When we came in and Nick went to
settle up, Hank refused and said that this trip was on him.  He said that Nick
had spent many hours helping children, which included his sons, with sports and
hadn’t been paid for his time.  He said that this trip was a way that he could
say thanks in return.  After eating some dinner, Nick and I went back out
fishing for <u>coco salmon </u>but didn’t have any luck this evening.  We were
late coming in and had a little trouble finding the bay.  </span></p>

to Mae last night and asked her if she was up before 5AM she might give me a
call to wake me.  She called at 4:03AM as she had woken to use the bathroom. 
That was neat of her anyway.  We were on the lake by 7AM and fished until
11:30AM before quitting.  Nike had caught a couple of small lake trout but that
was it.  We got some lunch and packed up and out of the campgrounds by 1:15PM. 
Nick started driving so I could take a nap.  I woke shortly before we got to
Evanston where we stopped for gas and natural gas.  I drove from there to
home.  We quickly transferred Nick’s equipment to his car and he left for
home.  I showered and shaved before Mae and I went out to eat at the Golden
Corral.  We came back and watched a dumb movie on DVD but it was good to be
together again.</span></p>

called me at 5AM and asked me to take a route today.  I had to hurry and Mae
got up and helped me get off.  The morning route went well, but there were some
mechanical problems with the bus.  When I finished the run I took the bus to
the shop to have them repair the windshield wipers and the horn.  When I got
home I fed the animals.  There was a baby chick that hatched last night and I
thought everything was ok when I left.  The one white hen is still looking
quite sick but I let her be this morning.  Before lunch I took a nap but a call
on the phone woke me.  Mae made a nice lunch and I went into work to take the
afternoon run.  The bus had been repaired by the time I took it this
afternoon.  This evening I took Mae out to see the chick and it is gone.  I
don’t know what or why but it is gone. I also killed the white hen to put her
out of the suffering.  I buried her as I didn’t want it in the garbage all
week.  I got on the computer and got the plans for a Cornhole board and the
rules for the game.  I then worked on The New Family History for a while.  I
filled out this journal entry before we went to bed.</span></p>
