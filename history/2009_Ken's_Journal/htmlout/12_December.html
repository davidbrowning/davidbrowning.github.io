<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I started
driving route 423 this morning and will do until biding process is complete for
that route.  I will probably bid for the route.  This is a special Ed. Route
and so there is an assistant with me.  Today’s runs went fairly well but we
were a ½ hour late getting to the school.  This was due to three teachers aids
that were riding with us that were late and one student was upset and wouldn’t
come out of his house.  The afternoon run went well.  I didn’t feel well this
evening so I didn’t go into the Family History Center.  Mae went and she and
brother Bell were the only ones there tonight.  I watched a couple of shows on
TV this evening and stayed in bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My runs went
well today.  This afternoon we had an Assistant Trainer ride with us to
evaluate my assistant.  It went well except yesterday when we let the last
student off the bus, he had to cross the road.  I asked my assistant if we were
not supposed to have a stop sign and have her escort him across the road.  She
didn’t think it was necessary because of his age.  The Trainer told us today
that we were to escort any Special Ed. Student that crosses the road with a
stop sign.  I went in to the shop when we got back to the dispatch but they
couldn’t find a stop sign for us.  The regular parts person wasn’t there so I
will come back in the morning.  Mae was shopping when I got home.  She had been
to Dr. Canova for a treatment on her back.  We cooked fish on the grill for
dinner.  This evening picked up Irven and Sandy and went to Salt Lake to a Ron
Paul movie, produced by the Campaign for Liberty and also Gary Johnson, former
Governor of New Mexico was there.  It is posible that Governor Johnson will be
a candidate for President in the next election.  It was 10:30PM when we got
home so we soon went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My runs went
well today although I have some concerns as to the route sheets.  I visited
with dispatch before coming home and was told to continue to run them the way I
am and then when the route is re-bid in a couple of weeks, changes can be
made.  I took a nap in-between the morning and afternoon runs.  Mae was gone on
errorns when I got home.  I checked the chickens and let them out.  It is fun
to watch them hurry out to be free when you open the door.  After eating Mae
and I did some studding on our Family History class we are to start after the
first of the year.  I called Bishop Smith and visited with him about the class
and he said that we are not to hold the class during Sunday school.  That
changes things, so we will have to consider other options.  Mae and I watched a
DVD, “Annie Get Your Gun” before going to sleep.  I sure enjoy being with Mae.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up at
6AM to prepare us breakfast before I left for my bus route.  She also left and
went to Georgia’s and the two of them put up apple sauce.  I took care of the
animals after I got home from the morning route.  The last student we pick up
each morning is the most handicap of the five students.  He is both physically
and mentally impaired.  This morning his mother literally drug him out of the
house and to the bus.  I felt so sorry for the mother as well as feeling for
the child.  I feel so helpless in this case and am continually reminded how
greatful I have to be for my healthy children.  The runs went well today.  Mae
went to Scott’s and tended the twins while Mishelle went to a Dr. appointment. 
She stopped at Penney’s, on the way home to look for a black skirt.  When Mae
got home we went to eat at the Golden Corral.  We then went to the Hale Theater
in Salt Lake and saw the production of the “Christmas Carol”.  We sure enjoyed
the production but most of all we enjoyed being together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, December 05, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
5:30AM and couldn’t go back to sleep but dosed off a couple of times.  We
didn’t get up until after 8AM.  When we got up we went right to work.  Mae
prepared breakfast while I started got the water for the animals.  Mae fed and
watered the rabbits while I got on the roof with the blower and cleaned the
leaves out of the rain gutters.  It started snowing and Bob hadn’t put the
charger on the lawn mower so we raked and gathered up all the leaves.  Mark and
Bob came out and helped.  At 11:30AM we quite and attended the Christmas dinner
for the Senior Citizens.  I really didn’t want to attend it but Mae wanted to. 
I ate the dinner although there was very little that I should have eaten.  They
had a nice program after the dinner.  When we got home Mae helped me finish
cleaning up the leaves.  By evening I was in some pain from the food that I
ate.  I didn’t feel like going to the Ward Christmas party so Mae went without
me.  I watched a good western on TV.  Mae came home to get some wash clothes
and dish towels, as there is none at the church.  I ask her if she had help and
she said that she thought so.  I asked her to call me if she needed help.  When
she got home I found that she had done all the dishes her self.  I was upset
that she did not call me.  Mae got on the inter-net and sent to most of our
family, friends and relatives a letter asking everyone to fast for our nation. 
I fear that we are going to have to have something to humble use as a people
before we will be ready for Our God to listen to a few of us.  I have little
faith that even a majority of the Church’s membership are ready to humble
ourselves for such faith.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7:30AM but am not feeling the best.  It is hard to describe the situation and
my feelings except to say I can feel the discomfort over most of my body.  I
did take care of the animals this morning.  It snowed lightly this morning and
the temperature is 21 degrees at 9AM.  Meetings were good but I was cold
especially during Sunday school and Sacrament meeting.  After Sunday school I
put my overcoat back on and wore it during Sacrament meeting.  That helped
considerable.  Bob invited us up for dinner.  I took a nap after dinner.  I
have been in pain all day.  Jeff called and invited us over.  We stayed home
until after the First Presidency’s Christmas Devotional and then we went to
Jeff and Gail’s.  When we went to the door and rang the door bell we heard
Rachael squeal, “Grandma is here.”  Gail, Jeff, Mae and I had a game of
Settlers, which Jeff won.  It was almost 10PM when we got home.  I filled out
this entry and then we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I made my bus
runs today and had time to take a nap between the morning and afternoon runs. 
When we picked up the children after school the teachers brought the one child
out with out shoes or socks on.  He takes them off when ever he is not being
watched and they are trying to show him the consequences of his actions.  I
can’t agree with that way.  It was about 20 degrees and they walked him through
snow to get to the bus.  After I returned to the bus compound I went in and
talked to Sue and Janna about my feelings, as Sherri had gone for the day. 
They told me to keep a report of such incidences and suggested that I talk to
Sherri tomorrow.  We are changing the water bottles for the rabbits three times
a day as it is so cold that they freeze and the rabbits can not get enough
water out of them.  The heater is working for the chicken’s water but the
chickens do not want to come out of the coop because of the cold.  This evening
Mae and I watched a couple of shows on the TV before going to sleep.  Mae also
gave me a hair cut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, December 08, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got about
6 inches of snow this morning.  Roads were bad and traffic was worse.  It took
us 45 extra minutes to make the morning run.  I stopped in and talked to Sherri
and she is going to contact the school.  Mae watered the rabbits this morning.
After getting home I changed the rabbit’s water as it was already frozen.  I
used the snow blower and cleaned the walks and driveway.  I didn’t have time for
a nap between runs today.  The afternoon run went well.  When we picked the
students up this afternoon Nicholas had shoes and socks on.  Nothing was said
about me talking to Sherri but hopefully the problem is corrected.  I again
changed water for the rabbits after coming home.  Mae had me get a short nap in
before we went to the Family History Center.  My file has been damaged on my
thumb stick so I didn’t get much done on my Family History tonight.  I did find
a error on Steven Abile Browning’s file.  It has Guy entered twice with
different dates of birth.  I called and talked to Carla and she found in
Steven’s personal history that Guy was born on the 14<sup>th</sup> of
December.  I will have to re-check the record and make sure that I corrected
the file correctly.  I had to make two entries into my journal to get it up to
date.  We soon went to bed after I got my journal entered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The weather
was bad again today and traffic caused us to run late.  I did get my bid in for
the route.  After finishing the morning route I went up to the service station
and got gas.  I was really out of gas; in fact there was less than 3 gallons of
gas left in the truck.  We took Bob and Carroll out to dinner at the Golden
Corral for their 54<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary.  We enjoyed dinner and
when we got home I had tome to eat and take water to the chickens and rabbits
before going back to take the afternoon run.  The rabbit’s water bottles are freezing
fast in this cold weather.  We are changing them 3 to 4 times a day.  I called
to see what the price is for heated waters.  They cost $35.00 each, so that is
out of the question.  As I was driving to the bus compound I got an idea how I
can make water heaters.  After I finished the afternoon run I picked up a few
items and was able to assemble two heaters.  We will try those tonight and see
if it works before building more.  I took a shower and then Bob and I went Home
Teaching.  At Casey’s I ask Isaac if he would like to see their Family tree. 
He is interested so I ask him if I should talk to his wife as we would need her
permission to get on her records.  He said he would talk to her and that I
should call her on Friday.  We enjoyed a long visit with Elwood and Cleone
Johnston.  They are wonderful people.  Mae balanced out statement while I was
gone.  Our financial doesn’t look to favorable.  I am not sure how to handle
it.  Prices just keep going up and income seems to be going down.  I am not sure
of the answers but some how we have to hang in there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today was
pretty normal and my bus runs went well.  This evening we had Scott and
Mishelle bring their children over for us to tend while they went to Scott’s
companies Christmas party.  We sure enjoyed them.  After eating dinner I took
Kylan and Ashley to the park sleigh riding.  I even went down the hill a couple
of times with them.  Mae played games with Kylan and Ashley and I tried to take
care of the twins and watch a show on TV.  Kaden slept in my arms for a while. 
Kaden was in my arms when Scott and Mishelle came home.  As soon as they came
in the door Kaden was climbing over me to get to her mother.  We enjoyed having
them and was happy that Scott and Mishelle could have some time together.  We
soon went to bed as Mae was especially tired.  I did get some of our computer
files backed up onto the external hard drive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My morning
run went well.  After returning to the compound I took the bus in for service. 
Mae had taken care of the rabbits before I got home.  i fixed myself something
for lunch and then took a nap.  Mae went out to eat with Adele and Linda for
lunch.  My bus was ready when I got back to the compound.  When the school brought
Nickolas Duke out to the bus they did so with him not having shoes and socks
again.  The bus was warm so he road home with out them, but I had Jennifer put
his shoes on before he got off the bus.  Then Christopher gave us some
problems, but overall the day went well.  This evening Mae and I went to the
High Priest Christmas social.  They had a nice dinner and most of it we could
not eat.  I did eat a slice of ham and I paid for it the rest of the night. 
Mae stayed up preparing for the Grand Children’s party until mid-night.  I
couldn’t sleep so got up and slept until 5AM in the recliner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went back
to bed at 5AM and slept until 8AM when the phone rang.  Jay Johnson from Heber
City called about the snowmobiles.  Another woman also called but Jay and his
son came and after looking them over bought them.  I really had a sick feeling
when they sold for I have really enjoyed them.  I cleaned the drive way and
side walks from the snow.  Mae had Grandchildren Christmas parties most of the
day.  First she had the children under nine years of age and the in the
afternoon she had the older grandchildren.  The only grandchildren that did not
come were Shellie’s boys and David.  Today is David’s 18<sup>th</sup> Birthday
and he spent the day with some of his friends.  I built a heater for the
rabbit’s water bottles.  I just built one for a trial and will see how it
works.  After the children all left I helped Mae clean up and put our house
back together again.  Mae was very happy about the way the day went but was
also very tired tonight.  We watched a movie on TV before taking showers and
going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM and after looking out side and seeing that it had snowed hard during the
night, I got dressed and went to the church house and helped clean steps and
walks.  I came home just long enough to change into a suit and white shirt and
go back for the Stake High Priest Quorum meeting.  It was very good and the
theme was around service.  Mainly Temple work, Missionary work and Family
History work.  I came home from there and ate some breakfast, cleaned the walks
and driveway, fed the animals and cleaned the snow from the satellite dish so
Bob could watch the TV.  I did get upset that Bob seemed impatient that he couldn’t
get reception first thing this morning.  I did get a short nap before we
attended church meetings.  When we came home I again clean cared for the
animals and found that the heater works great.  Bob had dinner ready so after
eating I again cleaned the snow off the drive and walks.  I lay on the chee
machine for a while to relieve my back.  Yesterday we read an e-mail from Chuck
Baldwin and today we read a e-mail from Dr. Keiser and between the two of them,
we sure have a dismal out look our country in the near future.  Mae and I
worked on our computers this evening.  Mae read e-mails and sent a e-mail to
our family about the Christmas party this Friday evening and about the plans
for a Ken &amp; Mae Browning Family Reunion the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of next
July.  Mae put together gifts for the Family Christmas party and I filled
capsules with Mannatech so that we would have enough while we are at Shellie
and Roy’s.  We went to bed about 9PM as morning comes early.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My back hurt
when I went to bed so I didn’t sleep very well.  I got up at 3AM and slept the
rest of the night in the recliner.  Mae got up and prepared my breakfast.  I
hadn’t snowed very much last night so the roads were in fair shape.  We did
leave the compound a little early and the run went well.  Mae went up to Jeff
and Gail’s and tended the children for Gail so she could work today.  After the
bus run I stopped at the feed store and got feed for the animals.  When I got
home Mark was trying to get Bob’s pickup out of the back yard.  He was really
having trouble.  I tried to help him but when I suggested that he not spin the
tires, he just said “I know that”.  I packed him a road with my pickup and then
I left him to it while I unloaded the feed.  He was still spinning the tires and
couldn’t get out of the yard.  I told him that I had some chains that would fit
that pickup.  I took them over to him and after looking at the truck for a
minute I got behind the steering wheel and drove it out of the yard.  I got me
something to eat and fed my animals before going back to the bus compound.  This
afternoon run also went well.  Mae didn’t get home until after I got there.  We
ate dinner and then made a game board for our Family Christmas party that we
are having on Friday.  I finished this entry and then took a shower and we went
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM and got ready for work.  Mae left me a note telling me to call Sandy at
5:45AM.  I called and she wants to come over and watch an interview of Ron Paul
on CNBC.  We are able to get that channel on our TV so she came over.  This
mornings run went ok but I had several vehicles that gave me scares.  It
reminded me of when Roy and I both worked at IRS and one day Roy drove.  On the
way home we had several close calls with other drivers.  When Roy let me off at
our apartment and only had 1 ½ blocks to go on home, he said, “Well, I wasn’t
sure we would get home with out having an accident, but I guess we made it.” 
He called me back a little later and told me that as he was turning left, a
girl hit him from behind as she had the sun shining in her eyes.  Anyway we
made it ok.  When I got home Mae made me some breakfast.  I then fed the
animals and then butchered two rabbits.  That left me time for a short nap and
some lunch before I went back for the PM route.  I got a phone call from Sherry
Fullmer asking if I wanted to apply for both of the routs that are open.  I
didn’t think that I could apply for the one but Sherry said that I could, so I
told her I would.  Then I got a call from Elder Bretzing, Salt Lake Church
offices, who is over the department of Mission Farm Land for the Church.  He
asked if I would be willing to except a call for Mae and I to serve as
missionaries in that department?  He is sending me more information and Mae and
I can discuss the call and let him know.  I have thought about it all afternoon
and evening and I would like to accept the call.  Mae has reservations about
it.  This evening I went to the Family History Center but Mae stayed home.  We
didn’t have any patrons come it so it was quite slow.   Brother Bell and I
visited quite a lot this evening.  After getting home I entered this journal
entry before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up at
5:30AM for my bus route, which went well.  Before coming home I stopped at the
feed store and bought some water bottles with heaters.  Bob helped me install
them and I showed him my feeding routine.  I visited with Bob about Mae and I
possibility going on another mission.  He is ok with it but not thrilled.  He
also doesn’t want us to say anything to Mark about it because he doesn’t want
to have Mark want to rent our apartment.  My afternoon run went well although
Jennifer had to take this afternoon off.  I had a sub-assistant and things went
well.  I got a voice message on my phone to call Sherrie Fullmer when I was
able so when I finished the run I went into her office.  She informed me that I
had been awarded the route 423 as a full time bus driver starting tomorrow. 
That is good news.  Mae had gone to American Fork this morning to read
Christmas stories to Jessie’s class.  After that Becky took her out to lunch. 
She didn’t get home until 4PM.  She did stop and do some shopping.   I took
care of the animals and then we ate dinner.  Mae had Sister Claudia Thompson
and Carolyn Saunders of the Relief Society Presidency came to visit and wish
her a Merry Christmas.  I played some games on the computer while Mae read
Christmas letters that we received so far this year.  It was very good to hear
for so many of our family and friends.  It took an hour to read the many
letters we have received so far this year.  It is very food to hear from so
many.  It is now time for bed so good night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My bus runs
went well today.  In between runs I built a waterbed for my rabbit.  I think it
will work to keep new kits warm during these cold days.  I didn’t got to the
dinner for the bus department as I feel so much out of place when I can’t eat
much.  Mae got her hair done this afternoon and she sure looks good.  I got a
call from Sherri Paddock telling me that they had got Mae’s E-mail asking if
they would have openings in February for us to come up.  They have the last two
week-ends open and most week days.  I talked to Elder Bretzing about more
information about the Mission Farm Land.  He said that the papers should be
here tomorrow.  Mae and I discussed the calling.  Mae called Diane Preston and
asked about the finances left by Uncle Dale for missionary callings and she
said that she had ten thousand dollars that she had to give to missionaries by
the end of December or pay most of it to the IRS for taxes.  She was about to
write out the check to the P.B.O. but if we let her know she would write it out
to our Ward.  I called and visited with Bishop Smith and he said that it would
work out ok for that purpose.  I just feel that this is the right thing to do. 
I think Mae is beginning to feel that way to.  This evening we watched a
Christmas show and also made Christmas Crunch.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
and prepared our breakfast while I got ready to go.  We discussed the Mission
opportunity and I think that we are fairly sure that we will accept a call but
we just don’t know where or when.  My bus runs went well today.  My assistant,
Jennifer is very stressed as to our decision, although she says she just wants
what is best for us.  After the morning run I took care of the animals.  I made
a heater for the kit box and put it in the youngest doe’s pen.  We think that she
should have kits on the 27<sup>th</sup> of December.  The heater should keep
the nest warm.  When I finished the afternoon run I went to Scott’s and got
their key board to take up to David’s this evening for the Family Christmas
party.  Mae had cooked a turkey for this evening.  Because of traffic I didn’t
get home until after 4 PM.  Bob had come down stairs and cut up the turkey and
sliced the ham for me.  That really helped and we were able to get up to David
and Shauna’s by 5:15 PM.  David and Shauna had almost everything ready for the
Party when we got there.  I played with Conner and Emily until I was tired and
had to quite.  Our family all got there about 7 PM and we had a wonderful evening. 
All of our family was there except for Shellie’s family and Brad and JaNae as
they had a company party to attend.  Sandi brought their children including
Jaden.  Also Nick’s son, Logan came.  After dinner we played some games, had
many talents performed and a Nativity that was organized by Becky.  It was
really amazing to me as to the amount of talents performed.  David (our son),
Scott and David (our grandson) played several numbers as a trio with their
guitars.  Chelci also joined the boys on some numbers, as she too played the
guitar.  Most everyone joined in singing with some of the boys numbers.  Chelci
sang “Silent Night” accompanied by Sandi.  Kennedy stood on her head for us and
can do amazingly well.  Dawson, Connor  and Jessie each sang and Emily played a
number on her violin.  Mae played “Frosty the Snowman” on her accordion and did
very well.  Our grandchildren and great-grandchildren were especially amazed,
as they hadn’t seen someone play the accordion before.  Sandi had all the
children sing some Christmas song and of course we had to have some small gifts
that were delivered by Santa.  The families then wanted Mae and I to open their
gifts to us, as we will not be here for Christmas.  Sandi and Nick gave me an
air ratchet and impact wrench, Mae a pair of warm fleece pajamas and the DVD
“The Christmas Shoes”.  Mike and Becky gave me three pair of leather gloves,
and Mae an apron (made by Becky) and two nice cookie sheets.  David and Shauna
gave us a beautiful Browning Collectors Clock, with stipulation that they
inherit it on our deaths.  Also they gave us the book “The Shack” by Wm. Paul
Young.  Scott and Mishelle gave us the book “The Undaunted” by Gerald Lund and
Jeff and Gail gave us a set of TV Ears.  Mae was also given Birthday gifts
because we will still be in Arizona for her Birthday.  All in all we had a
wonderful evening.  It was 11:45 PM when we got home.  I unloaded the pickup
and was about to go to bed when Bob came down.  He is very upset with Mark as
Mark is trying to putting a guilt trip on him for asking him to move out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 5AM
and couldn’t go back to sleep, so after having prayer, I turned on my computer
and caught my journal up.  Mae woke later and then tried to go back to bed but
she couldn’t go back to sleep either so she got up and sent an e-mail to our family
thanking them for the wonderful evening last night.  After Mae woke, she fixed
breakfast and we ate.  She then started getting things pulled together while I
took care of the animals.  We packed the pickup, went to Wal-Mart and bought
some back supports for Mae, stopped back home and found that the mail had been
delivered and our letter from Salt Lake had come, we then stopped at Sister
Fallis’s and left her some pumpkin bread and left for Arizona about 12:30PM. We
arrived at Judy Giles, in Kanab about 7PM.  Judy had invited us to stay
overnight with her.  We enjoyed visiting with her for a couple of hours before
we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke and
got ready for Church.  Judy’s Ward started at 11AM so we went to the Ward that
started at 9AM.  They held a very nice Christmas program.  We left after
Sacrament meeting ended.  It was funny but we got lost in Kanab and it took us
a little while to find the main road.  We stopped and bought a Sub-Way for
breakfast before going on.  We drove through to Page and stopped for just a few
minutes at the Maverick to use the restrooms.  It was very tempting to buy a
frozen yogurt but we resisted.  We stopped in Flagstaff for dinner and fuel. 
We went to the Cracker Barrel and as we went in there was two patrons dress all
in black and white, with several pear sings in their face, nose, lips and
eyelids.  They also had their faces made up with heavy black makeup.  They
really gave us the creeps and we couldn’t understand how anyone would like to
that.  We think that they were both females, but could not be positive.  We got
gas at the Standard Station but they could not get our credit card to work so I
paid in cash.  Mae drove about ½ ways from Flagstaff to Phoenix while I slept. 
I drove on to Shellie and Roy’s using the GPS and I am sure glad that we had
that or I don’t think that we would have found their place.  We got there about
6PM.  We sure enjoyed the evening with our family there.  Quint gave up his
bedroom for us to use.  Roy and Shellie sure have a nice home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as it was late when we went to bed last night.  Mae and Shellie went shopping. 
I am fighting a cold with lots of vitamin C.  I am also having quite a bit of
discomfort with pain in my joints and mussels.  My right knee hurts when I go
downstairs.  This afternoon Shellie asked me if I could help one of her
neighbors with some crown molding.  He had a very small compound miter box but
I think he will be able to make the cuts with it.  I called David and had him
e-mail me some angle instructions for crown molding that should also help him. 
Shellie and Roy took the children and then delivered Christmas plates to many
of their friends.  Mae and I watched the show “Kiss Me Kate” on the large movie
screen.  Their movie screen is 10 foot wide and 6 foot height and the projector
is mounted to the ceiling.  It makes a nice way to watch a movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke with
much more pain and my cold seemed worse.  Mae, Shellie and I went to the Mesa
Temple.  Mae especially wanted to go to the Temple to get a better feeling
about accepting a mission call.  The session was quite small although it looks
like the sessions before us were quite large with some marriages taking place. 
Mae is still trying to decide if we should accept the call or not.  As for me I
feel that we should.  I had a lot of pain this afternoon when we returned
home.  I also got cold so I cuddled up in bed and slept for over an hour. 
After dinner Kevis and I played a game of checkers and after a long game I was
able to win.  I think that he didn’t like losing to me.  This evening we
watched the movie “For Ever Strong”.  It was after mid-night when we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep the best last night.  My joints hurt, which woke me and I was concerned
about the mission calling.  Yesterday in the Temple I had such a good feeling
about it but Mae is really having trouble accepting it.  That decision kept me
awake quite a bit.  I also came to the conclusion that it is the coldness of
the waterbed that is causing my joints and mussels to hurt.  When I went back
to bed about 7AM, I put a blanket under me and it felt much better.  When we
made the bed this morning, I found and turned up the thermostat. Mae and I
discussed the mission calling and this morning she filled out the forms.  Shellie,
Mae and I went shopping at Costco.  Mae and I bought a set of salt and pepper
grinders and a toaster.  This afternoon I took a nap. Mae and I also wrapped
Christmas presents for Shellie. This evening Roy’s parents and his sister and
brother-in-law came over for dinner and to spend the evening.  The women played
games while the men watched the show “Fly Boys” on the big screen.  Each
evening Shellie and Roy gather the family together to read from the scriptures
and then Shellie reads a short Christmas story.  Mae and I put our pills
together for the coming week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
4:30AM and was up for a while.  After reading a chapter in the Book of Mormon I
took a shower and went back to bed.  I woke late and got up, it was almost
10AM.  Breakfast was ready so I went upstairs and ate.  We took our time
cleaning up the dishes and visiting.  Roy also has the day off.  All the family
went to the park, Quint and Kevis road their two wheel skate boards, Mae and
Shellie took turns walking and riding a scooter, Roy, Jase and I road bikes. 
Every one enjoyed the park and Mae and I ended up sliding down the slippery
slides.  After coming back home I played games with Quint and Kevis.  We played
chess checkers and at which I won those game.  I played Kevis fox and geese and
he won me four or five time but then Quint played me one of their computer
games.  He made the game quite easy and the first game I lucked out and won. 
The next he made it a little more complicated and he won that one.  Roy’s
parents and his Sister and brother-in-law came over for dinner this evening.  Mae
and I did find time to work on our missionary application forms.  It was almost
11PM and we are still getting ready for Christmas.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We set our
alarm for 5:50 AM and hurried to get up before the boys got up.  At 5 AM the
boys called Shellie and she gave them permission to wake us.  I think they were
surprised that we were already awake.  The Christmas tree, lights and
arrangement of gifts were very beautiful.  One could not wonder how blessed we
are and have been and if we are living worth of so many blessings.  We all got
so many wonderful blessings, even beyond any previous generation that has lived
upon this earth.  I wonder if anyone can be worthy of God’s out pouring of
blessings, and yet do we realize that all this and more is for our benefit. 
After opening our gifts, Shellie prepared a wonderful egg omelet breakfast. 
After breakfast Mae and I took a nap.  The boys enjoyed their toys and gifts
and they expressed thanks for the gifts they were given.  We had a nice dinner
before Garrett called about 5:30PM.  He talked to all of us including Roy’s
parents who came over just to be able to visit for a few minutes with Garrett. 
Roy got the equipment ready so that Shellie, Mae and I could watch the show
“Earth” and then he took all the boys and went to his family’s Christmas
party.  We watched the show and Shellie also stayed with us.  I had seen the
show before but it was really amazing to see it on their theater screen with
surround sound.  Who it was amazing!  Mae sure isn’t feeling good as she has a
cold now.  I am starting to feel some better tonight.  After having prayers
together Mae went to bed and I stayed up and entered this journal entry.  I
also played a game of solitary before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
7:30 AM but no one else was up.  The day just passed without really
accomplishing much.  Trying to get time coordinated today really didn’t
happen.  Mae and I did look up Bakers Ville California and wasn’t to
impressed.  We then looked up Orlando Florida and it was much more impressed. 
Mae decided that out of the two choices, she would rather go to Florida.  This
afternoon I took a bike ride and road around the area just to see what Queen
Creek is like.  It has certainly changed since I finished houses here 34 years
ago.  Mae and Shellie went shopping and they passed me on the way to the
store.  Mae and I did take a nap this afternoon for an hour.  After dinner all
the family watched the movie “Cow Boy’s” staring John Wayne.  It was late when
we finished so we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM to get ready and to Church by 8 AM.  Meetings were very good, although
because of some ones error, Sacrament meeting was several minutes late in
commencing, as the Aaronic Priesthood did not have the Sacrament prepared on
time.  After meetings and we came home Shellie prepared Skillets for dinner.  As
she was preparing the food Roy, Shellie, Mae and I visited about the Sunday
school lesson.  Somehow the conversation got around to our mission call.  Roy,
Shellie and Mae each expressed negative feelings about me wanting to accept the
calling.  I know that Mae is concerned about my health, plus she doesn’t want
to go on another mission, her feelings really hurt me.  I went to our room in
prayer and after dinner asked Mae to call Dian and tell her not to send the
money to Bishop Smith.  I told her that tomorrow I will call and turn down the
call.  She wants to call Brother Bretzing tomorrow before she decides.  We lay
down and took a nap, but then Mae got up and went for a walk.  When it started
getting dark I went upstairs to find her and found a note that she had gone
walking.  I went out side and it was cold.  I was going to get the pickup and
go looking for her but she was in the car with Shellie.  We ate dinner and then
had a Family Home Evening.  Mae was going to play her according but she
couldn’t find her music.  I called David and he found it with his music.  He
e-mailed it to us.  Roy had to transfer it to his e-mail and then was able to
print it out.  We enjoyed a good FHE and ended with the DVD on Joseph Smith the
Prophet, which was great.  Roy, Shellie, Mae and I finished our game of Rook
with Mae and Shellie winning.  It was late so we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then got up and showered.  Mae and I discussed the mission and still
haven’t resolved that yet.  Mae called Brother Bretzing and visited with him. 
That didn’t seem to help in the decision either.  Mae and Shellie went to a
Seymore women’s lunching.  Jase and I stayed at home and I played him a game of
pool.  I tried to teach Jase how to hold the A-stick but he didn’t like that. 
I tried to make my shouts hard and help him but I still won.  After I beat him
he didn’t want to play anymore.  I helped him bring up a game on the enter-net
and he played that the rest of the time.  Shellie and I visited about the
mission call.  I still have no idea what to do except I don’t feel that I have
a justified reason to turn it down.  When Shellie and Mae came home, Kevis,
Shellie, Mae and I played games for a while.  This evening Mae, Shellie, Roy
and I went out to eat at the Red Lobster.  We enjoyed visiting and eating.  The
food was very good.  When we returned home we put a movie on the big screen and
watched a Sherlock Holms movie.  I fell asleep through most of the movie. 
Sherlock Holms is not one of my favorites.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and when we did get up my right ear ach was worse.  We tried several things but
as the day went on it got worse.  I helped Roy a little as he installed some
ceiling speakers in their study.  Mae warmed some colloidal silver and poured a
small amount into my ear drum and with in a few minutes the pain subsided.  I
talked to Bob and he said that the 2<sup>nd</sup> doe had her kits and although
he hadn’t reached into the pen he could see the fur jumping, so presumed that
they were ok.  He had dropped the chicken waterier and broke it so had to find
another one.  I did take a nap this afternoon.  Shellie and Roy went dinning
with some friends this evening.  I helped Mae prepare dinner by grilling turkey
burgers for she and I and hamburgers for Kevis and Quint.  I worked on my
journal and Life Stories.  After Roy and Shellie got home we watched another
movie.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was after
1 AM before we got to bed.  Before laying down I put me cpap on and then Mae
put some warm colloidal silver in my right ear.  Within minutes my ear was
hurting until I had to remove the cpap.  I tossed until after 6AM when Mae got
me some Ibuprofen and then I went back to sleep and slept well until 9:30 AM. 
Shellie soon had egg omelets ready for the family.  After breakfast Mae gave me
a haircut and I took a shower.  While I was taking my shower Mae decided to
take the clippers apart and clean them.  When she couldn’t get them back together
she brought them to me.  It took me a little time as I didn’t see how they came
apart, but I made it.  I called Elder Bretzing and informed him that we were in
harmony and will turn the papers into our Bishop on Sunday.  He said that he
would be looking forward to receiving them.  He also said that Utah is
receiving quite a lot of snow as we were talking.  I checked the weather report
in Flagstaff, Kanab and Fillmore and they show snow today and then letting up
the next three days.  I also found a fueling station for natural gas for the
truck that is on the way as we leave for home.  mae and I went through the
first lesson for the Temple and Family History class we will be teaching in
January.  This evening Shellie, Quint, Mae and I played a game of Settlers,
which Shellie won.  Roy worked most of the day on a workbench in the garage. 
It was late when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Although we
doctored up before going to bed, I still didn’t sleep very well.  I woke
shortly after mid-night and finally got up and took more Tylenol.  I was going
to lay in a recliner but could determine how or which one reclined so I went
downstairs and lay on the couches in the family room.  I restlessly slept there
until Mae came in about 4:30 AM.  I then went back to bed with her.  She got a
while later and I slept until about 9:30 AM.  Shellie had breakfast ready for
the family so I went up and ate.  After breakfast I shaved and got dressed.  Shellie,
Roy, Quint and Kevis went to a movie that the boys wanted to see.  Jase stayed
at home with Mae and I.  I worked on my journal for a little while and then we
drove to a health store in Gilbert, where we bought some medications for my
ears.  After Roy, Shellie, Quint and Jase returned, Roy, Shellie, Mae and played
two games of rook.  Shellie and Mae beat us both games.  Roy is learning the
game quite fast and is feeling much more comfortable playing.  Quint and Kevis
went to a Stake Youth New Years Eve party.  This evening we watched two
movies.  At mid-night we paused the show and celebrated the coming in of the
New Year.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This year has
been an interesting one and you can’t help wondering what the New Year will
bring.  The passed couple of weeks have been great to be here with Roy, Shellie
and their boys but it has also been a challenge because of the decision about
the service mission.  This has really been hard for Mae to feel good about it,
but I think that she has accepted it but is still not excited about being gone
from the family.  I guess that it is within my nature for a change and a
challenge especially if it is a call from the Lord.  That is the only thing
that concerns me is that I am doing what the Lord wants me to do.</span></p>
