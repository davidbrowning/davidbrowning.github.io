<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
to bed until 1:30AM so we didn’t get up until almost 10AM.  It was almost noon
when we ate so we had lunch.  I got some cardboard boxes and we went to Jeff’s
and helped him get some packing.  We helped Jeff until after 3:30PM when we
went to the Sizzler in Layton, where we met David, Shauna, Mike, Becky, Scott
and Mishelle.  Of course Scott and Mishelle brought the twins with them.  The
boys wanted to buy dinner for Mom for her Birthday, I got to come along.  It
was a very enjoyable time.  When we got home I fed the rabbits and then I
started work on my journal.  I finished last year (although I want to add some
more to it) and then I started this years journals.  We also watched a show on the
Hall Mark channel.  Mae got on the internet and read a letter from Garrett. 
There was also a copy of the letter Shellie sent to Garrett.  Shellie has been
sick with the flu while Roy and the boys went out to the sand dunes.  Well, it
looks like we might watch two shows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae woke
early and then went back to sleep in the recliner.  I woke about 7AM.  After
breakfast and feeding my rabbits I started in to paint the closet.  I had to
have Mae go to the store for another quart of paint to finish.  This afternoon
I did some chasing to get the new skis for the snowmobile, get new batteries
for our phones, bought rabbit pellets and took my cell phone into get it
repaired.  I also stopped to see if we could get our bill corrected for the
Comcast services but when I went to the Layton office, there was a line of
waiting customers too long for me to wait for today.  I put the snowmobiles
into Bob’s garage and replaced the skis.  When I came into the house I helped
Mae put things into the new closet shelves.  I turned on a show on Comcast and
we watched that.  I filled in this entry before I showered and washed my face
before reapplying the medication.  My face is very sore from the medication but
I guess it is working the way it is supposed to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, January 03, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke during
the night with my face hurting and my throat was dry.  With my face hurting
from the medication I haven’t been able to use my cpap at nights.  I haven’t
shaved for a few days either.  I took some Tylenol and tried to sleep in the
recliner.  My legs were jumpy so I used the CHEE machine and then went back to
bed.  Mae let me sleep until I woke after 8AM.  We found out that Jeff needed
help moving as it wasn’t going like he thought it would.  David also called and
is concerned about storing all of Jeff and Gail’s things in his basement.  I
can appreciate the situation as we had about the same thing happen to us when
Hendrick was killed.  Judy asked if she could store her things in our basement
and we were not given any definite time frame.  Things were not stacked for
long time storage but open so that if Judy needed to get things out she could. 
It took half of our basement and after a year we were a little concerned.  The
things that Jeff is going to put in storage are things Gail will want access
too.  David suggested a storage unit and I agreed that that would be best.  I
told David that I would come over to help and we could get it oked with Jeff. 
By the time I got there David had located a storage unit and all was ok with Jeff. 
I helped with the moving.  That gave David, Scott, Nolan, Trent, Jeff and I to
get things moved.  It went pretty good but it took longer than Jeff had
planned.  There were some concerns about the storage of the piano that we gave
to Jeff.  There just wasn’t any sense in storing it either in David’s basement
or in the Storage unit.  Either would destroy the piano so I felt that the
piano should be given to some one that could us it.  Mae called Sandi, who
called Chelci and Chelci wanted it.  Sandi, Nick, Chelci and Steve were there
at Jeff’s when we finished with the last load.  We loaded the piano into
Sandi’s car and then we all left.  Mae had worked most of the day getting the
Christmas tree and decorations packed and put away.  When I got home I got some
lunch and then put the snowmobiles away.  I took care of the rabbits and helped
Mae finish with the Christmas decorations and put then into our storage shed. 
This evening Mae and I went over to Gail’s mothers and got the children and
brought them home for us to tend while Jeff and Gail went out.  Gail had asked
me if I could repair a dresser drawer that Benji had bent the rollers on a
drawer.  I did some work on the drawer there but then brought it home with us. 
Here at home I got some screws and installed into the drawer to hold the roller
more solid than it was.  While Mae tended the children I also packed the
Christmas dishes.  I dropped the lid to the cream picture and broke it.  That
is the first of the set that we have broken.  After Jeff and Gail came and got
the children I worked on my journal.  Mae has also been busy wrapping the candy
(fabulous protein bars that we can eat) which she made for me yesterday.  She
is quite a Sweetheart and best of all she is mine.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, January 04, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept
pretty good last night but woke with my face hurting, a slight sore throat and
a stuffy head.  Mae started me on vitamin C.  I showered to again wash the
medicine off and reapplied it again.  I decided to stay home from meetings and
try to get feeling better.  Mae went outside in the cold and took care of my
rabbits so I would not have to.  The temperature got down to below 10 degrees
last night so the rabbits water was frozen more than it has been during this
winter.  I don’t think anyone has had a better wife than I do.  Mae then
attended meetings.  I watched some of the programs on BYU-TV and took a nap,
along with continuing to take vitamin C.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Shellie
called and I visited with her for a while.  She is still under the weather but
said that they had a good time at the sand dunes.  She hadn’t sent us anything
by UPS for Christmas or Mae’s birthday, so we don’t have to worry about that.   We
had thought it might have got lost in the mail as she always sends gifts to
us.  She got busy and didn’t get them mailed.  That’s ok, we were just worried
something had happened to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Sandi called
and we visited for a while.  She had some concerns about Jeff and Gail, which
we have too.  She had to agree with me that it was much easier to control ones
children before they grow up and get married.  Sandi also wanted to know about
the piano and I explained that it was my fault, that the impression was given,
that the piano was being given to Chelci.  Jeff only wants the piano kept for
him until he gets his life straightened out.  I told her that the chances are
that Jeff may never want it, but if his life should change and he does want it,
then Chelci will have had the opportunity of having it and deciding if she
wants a piano in her home or not.  She will also have a piano to use for now
with out a financial outlay.  I suggested that she uses it for now and during
the mean time she start saving to buy her own and then if Jeff never wants it,
she can use the money for what ever she wants.  I also told her that should
Chelci spend money in repairs, and Jeff does take it back, then either Jeff or
I would repay her for those expenses.  If she does not feel good with that, I
will find some place for it to go and I will come out and get it.  We also
discussed Mae’s and mine 50<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary.  I told her that
we would be perfectly fine with something simple.  We want to attend the Salt
Lake Temple on the 19<sup>th</sup> of June with all of our children that would
like to be there with us.  We then can have a special Family Dinner some place
and a time to be together as a family.  We then discussed a snowmobiling trip
this winter and we will plan for the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>
&amp; 7<sup>th</sup> of February.  Sandi will call Shellie and see if they are
interested in joining with us.  I have visited with all the boys and they can
not do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was sure
good visiting with my two daughters.  Mae got home from meetings just as I hung
the phone up.  Bob and Carroll invited us up for dinner.  Bob had roasted a
chicken and had the trimmings.  I had put some rice on to cook, as Mae and  I can’t
eat potatoes.  Everything else was sure good.  I took a nap after coming back
downstairs.  I helped Mae get water for the rabbits this evening but she took
them out.  The water that she gave them this morning was frozen solid by this
afternoon.  This evening I worked on my journal and personal history.  Mae made
some phone calls and worked on some of her personal history.  We started to bed
before 9PM but I still have to wash my face and put on the medication.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, January 05, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
early this morning so she could get up to David’s about 8AM.  David left this
morning to go to schooling in Pittsburg for 3 weeks.  Shauna has to work today
so Mae is going to be with the children to get them off to school, be with
Conner thru the day and be there when Tyler and Emily come home.   I slept in
and then got me some breakfast.  I showered and shaved this morning.  Shaving
was quite a job but I looked a lot better when I finished.  I took care of the
rabbits.  I got on the internet and did some on the bus scheduling.  I needed
to go to the bus shop and check on some scheduling for next week.  Going in got
me two bus runs for next week.  I am finding that it is good to stop in and
talk to Roberta.  While I was out I went to Green’s Farm and Feed and bought 4
more water bottles for the rabbits.  We are having to give the rabbits more
bottles as the weather is so cold that the bottles freeze and the rabbits
aren’t able to get enough water.  I prepared dinner for tonight so it would be
ready when Mae came home.  When she got here she said that she spent most of
the time playing with Conner.  Conner especially likes his Grandma Browning to
tend him because she spends so much time with him.  We watched a movie this
evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, January 06, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night mainly due to my face hurting.  I slept most of the
night in the recliner so that I wouldn’t wake Mae with my tossing and turning. 
I didn’t get going until after 9AM as Mae let me rest as much as I could.  She
is so good to me!  For example: just the way she folds my pajamas, when I
finish the tops are just a bunch but when Mae folds then they look like they
are ready for a gift box.  Also she went out and fed my rabbits for me while I
showered.  She is that way with every thing she can do for me.  I really am
spoiled.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I called and
confirmed reservations for Sandi, Nike, Mae and I to go to the Trail Creek
Lodge in Soda Springs, Idaho for the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>
and checking out on the 7<sup>th</sup> of February.  Being that I was late this
morning, Bob got out and cleaned the driveway and sidewalks.  I worked on my
2008 journal for a while and then we had to leave to take Mae to her
appointment with Nancy and Fran.  Mae’s scans looks very good this time.  After
that appointment we went to the Ogden Temple.  We decided to do initiatory
ordinances today as we are a little short of time.  I had the privilege of
having Gary Nelson as one of the ordinance worker.  He is doing very good at
remembering all the wording.  That is one of the things I worry about when I
think of being asked to work at the Temple.  Before we left the Temple we went
downstairs and ate at the cafeteria.  We stopped at home to get our Family
History bags and went right to the Family History Center.  Although we were a
few minutes late Brother Bell hadn’t got there yet because of taking care of
his wife.  That has got to be very hard on him.  It was very slow at the center
but it gives us time to work on our own files and I guess we are learning as we
go.  We are reading a short book entitled “The Christmas Shoes” that is quite
emotional.  I hurried and took care of my rabbits when we got home.  I then
filled out today’s journal entry and headed for bed as I have a bus run I was
asked to take in the morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, January 07, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had to get
up early this morning to take a bus route.  After getting home I fed my rabbits
and Mae made me an extra breakfast.  I took the snowmobile off the trailer and
road it around the yard.  It performed very well with the new skis.  I took Mae
for a ride and then Scott came for lunch with us.  He took a short ride around
the yard and then came in to eat.  Jeff came and after eating he took a ride
also.  This will be the last time that the two of them will be here for lunch
as Jeff leaves for Ohio Saturday evening.  We are sure going to miss him.  We
just hope that things will work out for him.  I went into Dr. Lee this
afternoon and he suggested that I continue with the treatment on my face
longer.  He also gave me a prescription to use in conjunction with the
treatment.  It should lesson the burning pain.  Mae went with me into Ogden and
I had Fran give me another scan.  My scan did not come out as good as did
Mae’s.  Some of my pills need to increase and I also was given another one to
start taking to get rid of the heavy medals in my system which they think are
probably caused by the cream I am using on my face.  While in Ogden we stopped
at Savers and I bought a belt for $4.99.  Mae has been reading a short book
titled “Christmas Shoes”, which was given to us by Sandi.  We finished it today
and sure enjoyed it.  Mae went to a Book club this evening, however she came
back shortly after leaving and said that it is next week.  We watched a movie
on TV this evening before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, January 08, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke with a
cramp in my leg.  As I jumped out of bed I realized that it was 5:25AM.  I had
forgotten to set the alarm last night.  With Mae’s help I made it in good time
for my bus run.  When I got back home I fed the rabbits.  I had a few things
that I kept busy with plus Mae fixed me some eggs for breakfast.  About noon I
took a nap before going on my afternoon bus run.  When I got home from that I
took care of the rabbits again before Mae and I went over to Jeff’s to help
with more packing and moving things to the storage shed.  I have sure had a
sick feeling about this whole situation.  I am really having a hard time not
being upset with Gail.  I almost said too much as Jeff, Gail and I took the
load to the storage.  Jeff commented that it took a lot longer to move than he
had planned.  I said that when we moved that it usually only took one day to
move but that Mom had packed and sorted for two or three weeks in preparation
for the move.  There is still a lot of work to do before this is finished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
and laid in the recliner the rest of the night.  I made a bus run this morning
and then again this afternoon.  In-between I spent most of the time trying to
figure out how to put Jeff’s dog on a lease.  I got the anchor rope from the
boat and tied it so that there was almost 100’ from post to post that the dog
could move the lease on.  However the dog would go to the one end and walk
around the post and then couldn’t move.  I then changed that but the dog
started chewing on the lease and almost chewed it into.  I gave up and let her
stay in the house.  I did get a ½ hour nap before my afternoon run.  When I got
home I took several items over to the D.I. trailer that is at the church
today.  I went to the UPS store and shipped my old cel-phone back to the company. 
I then took the borrowed cel-phone back to T-Mobil but I had forgotten to bring
the charger with it so I will have to return it again.  I went to Jeff and
Gail’s and helped load things to take to the storage.  Mae has been over there
packing again.  On the way home we stopped at Albertson’s and bought a roasted
chicken and had that with tossed salad for our evening meal.  We watched a DVD
this evening before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, January 10, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke with
my face in pain and got up and took Tylenol.  I tried to sleep in the recliner
but couldn’t so I turned on the TV and watched an old John Wayne movie.  I went
to sleep and at 6AM Jeff took his dog out side.  He didn’t realize that I was
in the recliner and Shylow came in and licked my face.  Boy that brought me up
with a start.  I went back to sleep in our bed and slept until 9AM.  Mae had
breakfast ready for Jeff and I and had already fed the rabbits.  Jeff and I
went over to his house and finished packing things out.  I packed his car and
got almost everything that he wants to take with him in the car.  It is really
packed.  I cautioned him about driving fast with that heavy of a load.  We didn’t
get home until 3PM.  Mae had a nice dinner ready when we got there.  Sandi,
Nike, Mike, Becky, Shauna, Scott, Mishelle, Ashley, Kylan and the twins all
came to see Jeff off and to enjoy a few minutes together.  When they all went
home and Jeff and his dog left it was really hard to contain our feelings.  I
went out and took care of the rabbits and then worked on my journal.  Although
I helped clean up the table and gather the dishes and Becky and Shauna helped
with some of the dishes, Mae still had a big job to do.  We stayed up and
watched a western movie on Comcast before going to bed at 10:45PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, January 11, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early so that I could attend Stake Priesthood meeting.  It was a good meeting
but I came home feeling depressed.  I guess several things didn’t set to well
with me yesterday and I am very concerned about Jeff and David.  I didn’t have
time to wash my face and re-apply the medication before the meeting, so I did
it after returning home.  When I did wash my face the pain was so strong that I
thought I would pass out.  I then had to shave, so by the time I finished I was
had.  I went back to bed and stayed home from our morning meeting.  I did get
to Sunday School and Sacrament meeting.  Bob invited us for dinner.  Mae and I
laid down and took a nap this afternoon.  We slept for almost two hours.  After
getting something to eat, I fed the rabbits.  We then went upstairs and played
Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Mae and Carroll killed Bob and I.  Mae has
checked with Jeff a couple of times with our cel-phones and at 6PM he still had
about 9 hours left to drive.  I have yet to wash my face this evening and I
dread doing that.  I went to bed right after I finished washing and reapplying
the cream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, January 12, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke before
5AM but went back to sleep.  Mae came in and woke me again just before 6:30AM. 
She said that my day planner indicated that I had a ride along route this
morning.  I jumped up and got dressed and started for the door when the phone
rang.  It was the bus driver that I was to meet.  He asked where I was and if I
was going to ride with him.  I told him that I would be right there.  I made it
in less than ten minutes.  The run went very well.  After we finished the run I
dropped Walt off at his house and I drove the bus to our place and parked it in
our driveway.  I then fed my rabbits and got me something to eat.  After
washing my face, I went with Bob to Sherries and adjusted a couple of doors. 
The one set of doors needs some new hardware for it.  We went over to The Home
Depot to get it and stopped on the way at Sam’s Club and looked at having them
convert our slides to digital.  Mae had gone up to David and Shauna’s and
tended Conner today and was there when Tyler and Emily got home from school.  I
drove the afternoon run and that went well.  When I got home I took the Scanner
back to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and got our money back.  Mae was home when I got
back and we ate dinner.  I went out and fed the rabbits while Mae cleaned up
the dishes.  We got together with Bob, Carroll, Irven, Sandy and Mark.  We
played a game of Mormon Bridge and Carroll won.  Bob had made pie for all of us
for desert.  It was sure good.  It was good to get together for the evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept in
the recliner most of the night as my face is so sore.  My white doe had a
litter of kits last night.  I went into a Sub-Bus Drivers Round table.  I’m
really not sure that there is much accomplished at that meeting but we get paid
for attending.  When I came home I took a two hour nap.  Mae fixed some lunch
and then I went with Bob to Sherrie’s and replaced the hardware on the bi-fold
doors on the wash room.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got word
from Jeff that he arrived in Greenville ok but very tired.  He hasn’t been able
to find any where to stay yet and is a little discouraged at the rental
situation there.  It sounds like Gail is expecting quite a lot from him by way
of financial support.  I think that she had better use some of the saving account
that she seems to control, but don’t think she will.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae went to
the Family History Center tonight but I was hurting too bad so I stayed home.  I
went over to Nancy’s and tried some Colloidal Silver.  I tried a couple of
other products but they seem to cause added burning.  I did buy the Colloidal
Silver and have applied it several times this evening.  Shortly after I got
home, I a got a phone call from a person, that knows Nancy.  While I was
visiting with Nancy I told her of an E-Mail we received from Chuck Baldwin, in
which we were told that we (The United States) are with in two States from
having ratification for a Constitutional Convention.  This could mean an end of
our present Construction which includes the Bill of Rights.  Anyway this person
called and said that he had been talking to Nancy and she had told him of this
information.  He would like to get a copy of the E-mail so we will send it on
to him.  I also found out that he has many of the same problems with diet that
I do so he will send me information about that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob brought a
box downstairs this evening that came to us today.  It contained our order of
Mannatech products and the cost was over $500.00 for 8 bottles.  No wonder we
are short of cash.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got a call
at 5:35AM asking me to take a bus run.  I had to leave the compound by 6:27AM
so I really had to hurry.  I made it and the run went well.  I returned to the
compound at 9:40AM and was to be in a CPR training meeting at 9:30AM.  They
were having equipment troubles so I didn’t miss any thing.  The class ended at
12PM and I had to get some afternoon route sheets.  I came home and ate some
lunch and then went right back.  I needed to fuel the bus and I also took it
through the bus wash.  The afternoon run went well.  After getting home I took
care of the rabbits, ate some dinner and went Home Teaching.  We visited the
Casey’s and the Johnston’s.  Before we left the Johnston’s I ask Patriarch
Johnston and Bob to give me a blessing.  Bob anointed and Patriarch gave Sealed
the anointing and gave me a blessing for health.  We stopped at Brother and
Sister Fallis’s but Sister Fallis was ready for bed so we made an appointment
to come next Wednesday at 8PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae had helped
me get off to work and then she laid down for a little longer.  She took care
of my rabbits for me this morning, besides doing the other house work.  She had
lunch ready for me and then went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and helped
there.  This evening she went Visiting Teaching and then she went to the R. S.
book group.  I went to bed shortly after 9PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30AM to get to work.  I made my morning bus runs and all went well.  My
assistant is very good and we got along well.  I took my tennis shoes with me
today and when we had our layover between the High School and the Grade school
we went to Layton Hill Mall and walked in the hallways.  The rest of the run
also went well.  I was 10 minutes late getting back to the CPR class.  That
class went over time and I finished at 1:10PM.  That didn’t leave me enough time
to go home for lunch and get back in time for my afternoon runs.  I just called
Mae and stayed there in the lunch room and ate some almonds before taking my
route.  My assistant spoke to Michelle, my boss, and told her that I was a very
good driver and that she sure enjoyed working with me.  When I got home we went
out to eat with Bob, Carroll and Mark.  It was late celebrating Bob’s Birthday
but we couldn’t go yesterday because Carroll went to Salt Lake to be with her
sister.  We went to the Little Orient in Layton.  The food was very good and
they gladly accommodated us where we can’t have sugars.  The only problem was
the it was cold.  When we came back home Mae and I went to bed and watched a
movie on DVD, “Rear Window”.  Mae took care of my rabbits for me this morning
and when she went out she found that the black doe had died.  We do not know
why she died, but it is good that her kits are big enough to be on their own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 5AM
for a little while but lay in the recliner and went back to sleep.  It was 9AM
when I woke again.  Mae had Visiting Teachers come at that time so I went out
in the garage and filled our water jugs.  We had breakfast and then I took care
of my rabbits.   I got on my computer and caught my journal up to date as
yesterday I didn’t take time to make an entry.  Mae went to lunch with Georgia
today.  I had a field trip to take this afternoon, I took Northridge girls
basketball team to Davis High School.  I let them off and came back home with the
bus.  Mae was still gone so I went upstairs to take the Comcast billing back to
Carroll.  Bruce was there visiting and he asked if I had seen the DVD he had
left here last week.  None of us had so we watched it then.  Mae came home
while I was upstairs and got dinner ready.  After eating I took care of the
rabbits and then laid down and tried to nap.  I rested but didn’t go to sleep. 
Mae went with me to get the girls and return them to Northridge High.  When we
got there we found that the last game the girls were involved in was just ½
over.  We got to watch the last half of the game.  It was a very close game
with Northridge winning by one basket in the last 20 seconds.  It was fun to
watch.  We took the girls back and then took the bus back to the bus compound. 
It was 9:50PM when we got home.  I filled in the last of this entry before we
went to bed.  We watched a DVD that Georgia gave Mae for her Birthday.  The
title was “Only a Stonecutter” which told of John Rowe Moyle, an early member
of the Church that came across the plains in the first hand cart co.  He was
called by Brigham Young to be a stonecutter on the temple.  We were very
impressed at his faithfulness and determination to his calling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I
woke about 3AM and slept the rest of the night in the recliner.  I didn’t think
I was going to sleep very well but I must have as Mae woke me at 8AM.  After
breakfast I fed and cared for the rabbits.  We got a phone call from Jeff
telling us that he had found a house to rent and he was going to be able to
keep his dog.  We were very happy to hear that news.  Mae went to take care of
some errorns for a while.  I took another nap for almost two hours this
afternoon.  My face has been in a lot of pain and it seems to drain my energy. 
We went to Brigham City to the Honeyville Mill and bought some brown medium
grain rice.  On the way home we stopped at Bryce and Deanna’s and visited with
them.  They had two returned missionaries and the one’s girl friend there
visiting.  They were in the middle of a game so I took Deanna’s place and she
showed Mae through the house.  These two missionaries had served in Spain while
Bryce and Deanna had served there.  After they left Bryce, Deanna, Mae and I all
ate the chief salad, Mae had made, and then we played games and visited until
after 10PM.  It was good to be with Bryce and Deanna again.  I filled in my
journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up
during the night and slept most of the time in the recliner.  I stayed home
from meetings today because of my face, both looks and pain.  Mae attended
meetings without me.  Bob and Carroll invited us up for dinner.  Irven and
Sandy came and attended meetings with Mae because they had expected Matt to
pass away yesterday but he seems to have had a little recovery.  We were told
that yesterday morning Christine had not gotten herself anything to eat.  Matt
asked her if she had eaten and when she said that she would in a little while,
he got up and got her some cereal. Everyone was wondering what he was doing and
trying to help steady him with his walker as he is very weak.  Here he was
almost ready to die, and yet he was thinking of his wife and wanting to help
her. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After eating
we played a game of Mormon Bridge.  That was fun.  We talked to David by phone
this afternoon and also with Jeff this evening.  I fed my rabbits and then came
in and relaxed some more.  We had a light super and afterwards I got the chills
and felt terrible.  Mae called our Home Teacher Brother Thompson who came over
and with Mark anointing me he gave me a Priesthood Blessing.  After he left we
watched a show on Comcast, “Hoosier” and really enjoyed that.  After the show,
we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                My face has
been very sore today and I have mainly stayed down.  Mae sure takes care of
me.  This evening we went to Bountiful and met with Sandi.  She gave us her
camera.  She had misplaced it and finally Nike bought her a new one for
Christmas.  She soon found the old one.  It was special of her to want us to
have it.  It also gave us a good chance to visit with Sandi and she needed to
vent.  I wish that Nike could understand her and she him.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When I woke
this morning the pain in my face was at the lowest point since I began this
procedure.  Mae went with me and we went over to the bus terminal.  I took some
papers and turned my last field trip over to Janice for payroll.  I also
checked with Roberta and asked not to be on call for this week.  I will take
the field trip that I bid on and got for Friday.  I also got it oked with
Roberta that Mae could ride with me on my field trips if they are not over
full.  We took a jacket back to Northridge High School that had been left on
the bus last Friday.  Mae worked at the Family History Library tonight and I
stayed home again tonight because my face is hurting so much.  Mae helped me
put the bids for field trips in for the week of the 26<sup>th</sup> – 30<sup>th</sup>.Thursday,
since it hurts too bad to wear my glasses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t do
much today as it hurts to wear my glasses.  This afternoon Mae and I went into
Riverdale.  We took the loaner phone back that I had used while I was getting
my cellule phone replaced under warranty.  We next went to Best Buy where we
bought a new battery for the camera Sandi gave us and a carrying case for it. 
We next stopped at Good Earth Health store and bought a few items.  I didn’t
realize how strong we are getting now that we are getting old.  When we were
first married it took several trips to and from the car to carry in $25.00
worth of groceries, now we can carry $100.00 worth in one trip.  This evening
Bob and I went Home Teaching to Sister Fallis.  When I got home Mae and I
watched a movie on Comcast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
3:30AM and knew that if I went back to bed I would keep Mae awake, so I slept
in the recliner.  We bought some liquid vitamin E yesterday and I put it on my
face and many of the scabs softened and came of during the night.  I can smile
and open my mouth better today than I have for several weeks.  It sure seems
good.  I was able to wear my glasses today and that helped so I could work on
digitizing 35mm slides and putting them onto our computer.  I spent a good part
of the day doing that.  Mae tended Jeff and Gail’s children so that Gail could
go to the Temple.  We called and visited with Jeff for a few minutes.  He
thinks that he will have to get rid of his dog because he doesn’t have time to
work with him.  I can understand his problem but had hoped that it would work
out for him as he doesn’t have anyone else back there with him.  This evening
we watched a movie when we went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept most
of the night in the recliner but did sleep ok.  It was after 8AM when we got up
and probably would not have got up that early except Bob prepared fish for
breakfast for us.  Mae spent most of the day cleaning and straightening up the
storage room.  I kept busy but I’m not to sure just how much I accomplished. 
There were many things I wanted to do but only got part of it done.  At 4PM I
took a field trip, taking Davis High schools Girls Basketball Team to Viewmont
High school.  I brought the bus back home with me and then at 6PM Mae went with
me and we went to the Chuck-A-Rama in Bountiful.  After eating we went back to
Viewmont where we watched the last ½ of the game.  Davis’s girls won the game. 
It was very foggy this evening so it made it harder to drive but all went well
and we got home about 10PM.  Mae is sure a special sweetheart and I sure enjoy
being with her.  After filing out my journal entry I played a game on the
computer before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until after 8AM and after breakfast we went over to Jeff and Gail’s house.  Gail
met us there and I removed a CD and radio from the cabinets for Gail.  I then
patched the mounting holes.  We next took the items, which have been in the
back of my pickup, over to the storage shed.  After coming home Mae went over
to Scott’s to help with the children.  I spent most of the day capturing 35 mm slides. 
I watched a western show on Hall Mark this evening.  During the commercials I
shaved my beard.  My face is healing quite well and it sure feels good to get
rid of my scrubby beard.  When Mae came home we viewed the pictures that I had
captured before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8AM and the love that I feel with Mae is the most beautiful that I can
possibly imagine.  I often wonder what I did to receive such a beautiful and
wonderful wife and sweetheart.  We did turn the Tabernacle broadcast on as we
prepared and ate breakfast.  The time went fast and we had to hurry to get to
church on time.  The Sacrament meeting was very spiritual as we had the Special
Needs Mutual present the program.  When we got home we had a turkey burger for
lunch and then went up to David and Shauna’s for the afternoon and evening and
for dinner.  We really enjoyed the time there.  I called Rich and Lois this
evening and checked to see how they are doing.  Lois is having quite a lot of
hip pain and discomfort.  I filled in my journal and also got on the internet
and put my trip bids in for the first week of February.  It was almost 11PM
before we got to bed.</span></p>

the D.I. in Ogden this morning and worked as a volunteer from 8AM to 12 noon. 
Mae tended Conner today for David and Shauna.  After getting home and eating
lunch I took a nap.  Bob also called me and had me help him get his car from
the repair shop.  Roberta called me and has a route for me to cover the rest of
the week.  I will have to miss Thursday afternoon as we got word that Matt died
yesterday evening.  They will have a funeral on Thursday for him.  I digitized
quite a few more pictures this afternoon but the projector lamp burned out and
I will have to locate another.  I have called all of our children, except Jeff,
about Matt and they are each going to contributing money to be sent to
Christine and the children.  We need to get to bed early this evening as I will

and said that I had over slept and she thought it was now 7 or 8 AM.  I flew
out of bed and as quick as I could got my eyes to focus on the time and realized
that it was only 2AM.  That woke us and neither of us got much sleep after
that.  My bus run went well this morning.  On the way home I stopped and bought
some rabbit pellets as I was completely out of them.  I don’t know if we are
going to break even with this project or not.  We have got to decide if we
should try to raise chickens or not.  I also took the measurements on the
tiller motor.  Mark is trying to bid for a replacement motor for the tiller.  I
see a lot of money going out for these projects.  The question is, are we being
wise in these projects?  Mae went into the D.I. in Ogden and worked this
morning.  From there she went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and helped there
until almost 9PM.  After my last run I got home just before 5PM.  I got something
to eat and then went to the Family History Center.  Mae got home just before I
did.  I went out and took care of the rabbits.  We are late getting to bed
again.</span></p>

hour.  Mae is tending Benji and Rachael for Gail today.  This afternoon’s run
also went well and I was home by 4:30PM.  Bob had me go with him.  He bought a
new used car.  It is a 2003 Mercury Grand Marquee and has only 40,000 miles on
it.  It sure looks good.  After dinner this evening I again took care of my
rabbits, did a little reading for Sundays Priesthood lesson and watched a show
on Comcast.  Mae went Visiting Teaching to one of her Sisters but the other one
wasn’t feeling well.  After the show I entered this journal entry before going

morning.  Bob, Carroll, Mark, Mae and I left for Providence shortly after 9AM. 
we all rode in Bob and Carroll’s new car.  We arrived in time for the viewing
before the funeral.  Christine had done the arrangements for all the music used
in the program.  The talks were very appropriate.  David, Shauna and Conner
were also able to come.  Many of Rich and Lois’s family came.  They always go
out of their way to support family functions.  The internment was at the Eden
Mountain Cemetery so it took a little traveling to get to there.  It did give
us a chance to see the lot that we came so close to buying when we left Ogden. 
I still can not help wondering what changes it may have caused had we been able
to buy that property and build a home there.  It was 4PM when we got home.  We
ate some dinner, I fed the rabbits and then we went over to Scott and
Mishelle’s.  Today is Scott’s Birthday so we tended the children while Scott
and Mishelle went out to eat.  Mae was the one that tended the children while I
took a nap.  We stopped and bought some fried chicken to eat on the way home.

we got to watch the last half of the game.  Northridge Varsity team played very
well and won the game.  The girls were sure energetic on the way home and were
really singing loud.  It was a fun evening.  Mae and I stayed up and watched

for me and helped me several times through the day.  We went over to Layton
Country Creek Ward to be with Scott and Mishelle while they had the twins
Blessed and given their names that they will be known by on this earth.  Scott
did a very good job of performing the ordinances.  Following the ordinances
they had a nice pot-luck luncheon, but we couldn’t eat any of it except for the
large tossed salad Mae had brought.  She also brought chopped boiled eggs,
chopped cooked chicken, sunflower seeds and sliced almonds and oil for us. 
When we returned home I got on the internet and bid bus runs for the week of
Feb. 9<sup>th</sup> through 13<sup>th</sup>.  I then finished my presentation
for tomorrow.  I located some of my original journals and then made this
