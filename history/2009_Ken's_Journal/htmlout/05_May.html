<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got and
went into the bus compound not knowing for sure which run I would be taking.  I
checked at dispatch and was told that I would take bus 472.  That gave me time
to enter some payroll entries.  I then started down through the bus lot and saw
bus #47 still setting in the stall.  I went back to dispatch and told them
about it and it should have been leaving by then.  As we checked further we
found that sheets were not coordinated, my field trip had not been crossed off
as canceled, and there was a sub-driver already on 47 and 472, so I was not
needed this morning.  They do need me to drive 42 this afternoon.  I got a 2
hour call out and came home.  After I finished the route this afternoon I
stopped at Big 5 sports store and bought a couple of items for fishing.  I was
rather disappointed at their selection of fishing items.  When I got home I
started cooking Dutch oven chicken.  Bryce was the first to arrive and expected
Deanna to be late, but she didn’t make it.  Kim came but Jeanenne isn’t feeling
well so she didn’t come.  Rick and Georgia came just as the food was ready. 
The afternoon had warmed up and so we set up tables outside on the lawn and ate
there.  we then came inside where we visited and played games.  It was a great
evening.  we were tired when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and was down to Randy’s about 6AM.  We loaded his things into the boat
and drove to Deer Creek Reservoir to fish.  When we got on the water and got
things ready we realized that we didn’t have Randy’s tackle box.  We went back
and checked the truck but it wasn’t there.  I don’t remember which of us
carried it out to the truck but we didn’t have it.  I used some of my gear and
we started fishing.  Randy called Judy and asked her if we had left it there
bus she couldn’t see it.  It rained all morning on us but we enjoyed the
fishing anyway and by noon had both limits.  On the way home Randy’s son called
him and wanted to know if he wanted to go to Crystal Springs Mineral Pools.  He
did and I said that that would be fun and he invited us to come along to.  I
called Mae and told her that after I would take her to Maddock’s for dinner
after so she was excited about that.  After I let Randy off I watched the road
to see if Randy’s tackle box had fallen off the trailer but could see no signs
of it.  I just can’t think of what happened to the tackle box except that I
must have set it on the rear platform and it fell off some where in our travels. 
Randy, Judy, Russell and Tammy met Mae and I at Crystal Springs about 7PM.  Mae
and I left at 8PM and went to eat at Maddock’s.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4AM
and then went back to bed but had a dream that caused me to wake up
frusterated.  With Church not until 11AM and today being Fast Sunday we had
some free time.  I fed our animals and we watched the Spoken Word and part of a
talk given at BYU Idaho.  I felt a little depressed with the Priesthood lesson
because it left me concerned with our two boys that has left the Church.  We
had Mike’s family and David’s family for dinner and to visit and play a game
this evening.  Mae had cooked a wonderful meal.  The children especially
enjoyed seeing the animals before dinner.  It was a very enjoyable time.  Just
as David’s family was about to leave it started to rain hard and then the wind
came and brought hail.  I was concerned about our tomato plants but it let up
before I could get changed and out to the garden.  I think everything will be
ok.  By the time we cleaned up and put up from the family being here, it was
late and we went to bed.  We had a snack before going to bed and so I had to
sleep in the recliner.  I slept there until after mid-night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke and
got into our bed.  I again woke at 6AM and thought that because it was after
5:30 AM that the bus dispatch wasn’t going to call me today.  At 6:30 AM
however that phone rang and it was dispatch wanting me to take a run.  Mae got
up and fixed me some breakfast that I ate on the way out the door.  I drove bus
494 and the first thing I noticed was what a mess it was in.  I was ok with the
first half of the run but I couldn’t get my mind to interpret the directions
with the street and numbering change that there is between Syracuse, Layton and
Clearfield and my GPS couldn’t locate the street address for me.  As a result I
went the wrong way and had to call dispatch to get directions.  When I got home
we ate.  Bob had cooked the fish that I caught Saturday and had also cooked
some rice pealay to go with it.  It sure made a good breakfast.  I fed the
animals and put some things away.  Time went by so fast that I didn’t get done
what I wanted.  We had some lunch and I went back for the afternoon runs.  I
had trouble with the students and had to stop the bus for both the Jr. High and
the grade school children because of students standing and scuffling while I
was trying to drive.  I swept the bus after both runs.  This morning was the
worse.  I don’t think I have driven a bus that had more daubery on the floor, than
this bus.  Mae told me that Ryan Knutson died yesterday.  That will sure be
hard especially on Sister Knutson but it is a blessing that he is out of the
pain and misery.  After dinner we stopped over with some food and a sympathy
card and a love.  We drove to Morgan to support Emily in her violin recital. 
Mae drove up while I slept.   We got home about 9PM.  I entered this entry and
we went to bed.  I had to play a game of Spider Solitaire before turning my
computer off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early to take a field trip to Orem.  Mae got up and help me get ready.  I had
to take a random blood test this morning also so I was able to take the test
prior to leaving with the bus for the field trip.  The field trip went well but
they were later coming home.  That didn’t affect me but the other bus driver
was late for her afternoon run.  I had to fuel and sweep the bus before parking
it.  Mae has been busy all day and was still picking up canning supplies to can
up some of our food storage.  We worked at the Family History Center this
evening.  it has been a full day and I am tired but I think that I will call in
tonight and tell them that I won’t be able to drive tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30AM.  I was glad that I didn’t get a call out because I wasn’t able to get
hold of the sub-line to tell them that I couldn’t go today.  I did get a call
later asking me to make a afternoon run but I turned it down.  I hate to turn a
call but today is very full of things we need to do.  I got on the computer
first thing and entered my payroll times.  I was missing a field trip work
sheet and so I called Janet and let her know.  She called me back later and
told me that I had turned the sheet in but hadn’t entered it.  She made the
entry for me and also corrected two dates that I had entered wrong.  I got on
line with the Garmin company and corrected my GPS.  I could have never
corrected it with out some help.  After that I went to Irven and Sandy’s and
spent 2 hours there.  Mae was gone with Sister Joanne Von Niederhauser to pick
out a floral arrangement for the Knudson funeral.  We had every family along
the block participating in the cost.  I ate some lunch and then planted six
rose bushes for Mae.  Mae and I then got things loaded into the pickup and went
down to the Church farm and used the canner to can food storage.  When we got
home I checked on the chickens and the rabbits and then as I came back to the
house Mike Linstrom called me to give me a five dollar bill for the funeral
flowers.  Mark came about that time so we ended up in a long discussion at to
the problems of the world.  Mae had dinner ready when I came in.  She was
talking to Jeff on the phone so I started to eat.  Jeff then wanted to talk to
me for a few minutes and we ended up trying to play Hearts over the inter-net. 
It didn’t work very well but we got part of it going.  We watched parts of a
movie on Hallmark.  I made this entry and we went to bed.  We will get up and
take Bob and Carroll to the S.L. Airport in the morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and was ready to take Bob and Carroll to the airport at 7:15AM.  We are
concerned about them going as to weather or not they will enjoy this trip. 
Carroll is already saying the temperature is so high there in San Antonio that
she is just going to set inside of their condo where she has the air
conditioner.  It seems strange to me that you would go on such a trip when you
are not looking forward to it.  We got back home at 9AM.  I fed the chickens
and rabbits and then Mae and I went walking.  We got back just in time for Mae
to go with Claudia.  They met Jola Craven and Marge Beardall for lunch.  The
four of them was in the Stake Relief Society Presidency together.  I was called
to take a special ed bus route this afternoon.  this evening Mae tended the
Brown’s children while they went out to eat.  Brother Brown has been out of
work for some time and Mae got feeling sorry for them so offered to tend their
children plus she bought them a gift certificate for dinner.  I had forgot to
put the Bus Drivers dinner in my day planner and realized that that was for
this evening also.  Mae took care of the children and I went to the dinner.  I
had ordered us salmon dinners and that was only fair.  Then I realized that the
dinner was only for the full time drivers and full time assistants.  I really
felt out of place.  I will know better next year.  Mae got along ok with the
children.  After filling out this entry we went to bed and watched a movie on
DVD, “The Man That Know To Much”.  We enjoyed it but we didn’t get to sleep
until after 11PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The bus shop
called at 5:37AM asking if I could take a morning run.  I know that if I did I
would not be able to attend Ryan’s funeral, so I asked them to try to find some
one else.  We got up at 7:30AM and had to hurry to get breakfast, bath, feed
the rabbits and chickens, and get ready for the funeral.  Mae had started a
jello salad last night and finished it up this morning.  We went over to the
chapel at 9AM and helped with the preparing the tables for a lunching for the
family members after the funeral services.  We went through the viewing and the
helped more with the tables.  We attended the funeral services and they were
very special.  Mae stayed to help with the lunching.  I came home and got some
lunch and then took a field trip.  It was a Drop &amp; Return so I took the
youth from Fairfield Jr. High to Clearfield High school and then drove the bus
to my place.  Scott and his family came over and I helped him hook the trailer
on to his truck.  He and Kylan went up to Logan to buy a moter scutter.  I had
Mae go with me to pickup the students and then the plan was to take the bus
back to the bus compound and then go to Bountiful where we would meet Sandi and
Nick at Chuck-A-Rama for dinner.  It did work out that way but we were over an
hour late getting to Chuck-A-Rama because the students in the one competition
kept winning and went much longer.  then the coach ask if I would stop at
Krispy Kreams so he could buy the students a treat.  Also there was two buses
to take the team to the track meet but they felt that one bus was enough to
return the team to the school.  That was because several parents would come to
the meet and take their child home with them.  It did work out but I really had
a bus full.  We really enjoyed being with Sandi and Nick.  We were tired when
we got home and soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up at
5:15AM and went to Orem to attend a class in Winter Preparedness.  I got up later
and helped with the Ward Activity project of helping some in the Ward with some
yard clean up.  I rotor-tilled the garden area for Leslie Fallis.  I then took
Randy to buy him some fishing tackle.  I gave Randy a fishing real of mine and then
we had the one spool rewound with a different line.  I also checked on the
shower problem that Sandi is having and it isn’t good.  I hated having to tell
Sandi the bad news but it looks like there is a problem with the shower
installation and it will have to be redone.  I mowed the lawns at home
including all the back section.  I also went over to Fallis’s and mowed the
front lawn areas.  I made my field trip bids for the week of May 18 thru the
22.  Mae got home 7:30 PM before Mae got home.  We had something to eat and
watched a movie on Comcast.  I filled in this entry and then cut Mae’s hair
before we went to bed.  </span></p>

7AM with a back ach so I got on the inverter table and the chee machine.  I
started breakfast and then went out and took care of the rabbits and chickens. 
We ate and then attended church.  Meetings were very good as usual.  When we
got home Mae went to work preparing dinner for Scott’s family.  We enjoyed
having them here.  Ashley especially enjoys the chickens and so Scott left her
some shoes here so that when she comes she can have some shoes to change into
before going into the coop area.  They left to go to Mishelle’s Mother’s about
7PM and David and his family came shortly after.  Shellie, Mike and Jeff called
Mae to wish her a Happy Mother’s Day.  I guess there is still several problems
that have arisen over our 50<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary.  If we had known
the problems we would have just had a reception for our friends and let it go
at that.  I’m tired and it is time to go to bed.</span></p>

shop will want me to make a run.”  I went back to sleep and again woke at 6:30
AM and thought,”Oh, they didn’t call me, so I can stay home and get some things
done.”  Then the phone rang and they wanted me to take a run at 7:30AM special
Ed. run.  That left me with little time so Mae got up and help me get ready. 
The run went well in the morning and I also made another Special Ed. Run in the
afternoon.  I got home just in time to get the grill on and start cooking
chicken.  We invited Mark Hulet and Dee Frankom to have dinner with us.  After
dinner we set and just visited about the Gospel.  It was and enjoyable
evening.  They left about 9PM and I got on the computer to use Google Map
Search and trace my route for tomorrow.  It was after 11PM before I got to bed.

4:15AM and had to hurry for my bus route this morning.  We had to count
students today but they hadn’t left me a form and I didn’t realize that they
wanted a count at each stop.  When I got back to the compound I had to fill a
form out and guess at the number of students at each stop.  I had recorded the
total number for each school that I took.  I also talked to Rosa about two
stops that were not on the route sheets.  Roberta then asked me to take a bus
to the Farmington compound and she came down to bring me back.  it was 12:30PM
when I got home.  Mae had a dentist appointment and did some shopping, so she
was gone when I got home.  I ate lunch and then took a nap.  When I got up I
worked on the sprinklers for the lawns.  We then had something for super and
went to the Family History Library in Clearfield.  I wasn’t sure what to work on
but decided to see if I could find my Great Grandmother on the Hill side.  I
assumed that she was born in Canada as that is where her spouse was born but I
couldn’t find anything.  I then decided to place her birth in the United States
and found her being born in Caldwell County, Mo.  It also opened up more
generations that I didn’t have.  I was quite excited at what I had found
tonight.  After getting home I caught my journal up to date.  it is sure easy
to get behind and so hard to remember back a day or two.  It is now 10:30PM and
I will probably get a call out about 5:30AM tomorrow so I had better get to
bed.  I did talk to Sandi and Nick, this evening, about Nick going fishing with
Randy and I on Friday.  David also called to let me know that he had found some
place closer to him to store his camper.  We also schedualed a fishing trip to
the Palisade Resivore in November.  </span></p>

11AM Grin and Kathleen Clark stopped and picked us up.  We went to Maddox’s
where we met the Hyer’s and the Maharry’s for lunch.  Brother and Sister Maharry
have received another call to serve in the Philippines Angeles Mission as office
secretaries.  We had an enjoyable dinner and enjoyed visiting.  When we were
ready to leave Brother Hyer picked up the tab and tip.  It was very nice of him
but I hadn’t planned on that.  When we got back home I worked around the house
again.  I got the water distiller clean and changed the filter.  This evening
we watched a documentary on the life of Doras Day.  The end of the DVD would
not play so we missed the last of it.  </span></p>

bought a new rear white light for the boat.  I also stopped at Sportsman
Warehouse for some fishing supplies and some bait.  After dinner this evening I
mowed the lawns.  I also got the boat ready to go in the morning.  Nick called
and he isn’t feeling well so just Randy and I will be going to morrow.  Mae
tended children for Gail today while she substituted taught today.  I filled in

chickens so Mae wouldn’t have to.  Randy and I had a good time fishing and we
both caught our limits.  Randy did have trouble staying awake, I guess it’s the
med’s that he is taking.  I took a nap after getting home.  Mae and I went to
Tyler and Angie Smith’s wedding reception.  After attending the reception we

I turned the water on to the outside.  We next went to the S.L. Airport and
picked up Bob and Carroll.  They have been at Sherrie’s for the past 10 days.  
After getting home Mae also cut both Bob’s and my hair.   We canning most of
the rabbits that I killed today.  We put up 12 qt of cooked rabbit meat.  While
we were waiting for the rabbits to cook we watched two shows on TV.  The 2<sup>nd</sup>
movie we watched was about two Divorce Lawyers and the couple that were suing
for divorce. These two Lawyers had never married because both we concerned
about so many couples getting divorces.  It gave me a lot to think about and
appreciate the purposes that the Gospel gives for marriage.  I certainly have a
wonderful wife, companion and best friend in our marriage.  I then entered
yesterday and today’s journal entries.  It was almost 11:30PM when we finished
and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke just
before 7AM and stayed up reading my scriptures.  I also was still thinking
about the show we watched last night.  Mae prepared me some breakfast although
she is Fasting for help in her assignment with the Primary today.  She is a
special person but sometimes I have trouble trying to keep up with all she
wants me to do.  I took care of the rabbits and chickens before getting ready
for meetings.  We had time and the day is beautiful this morning, so we walked
to Church.  Meeting went well as usual.  Irven and Sandy came over for dinner. 
They want me to help them do some repairs on their house.  I guess I should help
them cheerfully but it is hard when they won’t take my recommendations and I
hate to just patch things up.  I took Bob 1 ½ rabbits and he cooked them for
dinner.  He made a rice pealoft with it that was very good.  After dinner we
all played a game of Mormon Bridge, which Mae won.  I came downstairs and wrote
two stories that Dad had told to me.  It was late so we just went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 7AM and read for a while.  I am not what set things off but I got quite
depressed at all the projects that I am expected to do.  I don’t know how
people can make it with life and not have a faith in the purpose of life.  I
took care of the rabbits and chickens before breakfast.  I weaned 8 of the kits
from the doe and left four of the smaller with the doe, hoping that they might
get a little more growth before I wean them.  Mae went Visiting Teaching at 9AM
today.  I got on the computer and entered some payroll information and put bids
in for field trips for next week.  I am not sure just what good it does to bid
on the trips.  Last week I bid on 100 trips and got one.  That isn’t very good
odds.  I think that I bid on 95 this next week.  I got Bob, Mark and Carroll to
come outside and we discussed the plans for the front yard.  Mae got home in
time to go over the plans with us also.  After that, Mae fixed lunch and then I
took a nap before taking a PM route.  After dinner this evening I worked in the
front yard removing the basketball standard and some old curbing.  I stopped by
to check on the rabbits and found one of the kits had got out.  I searched
around the area but was unable to find it.  Mae came out and trimmed the
yards.  Before calling it a day and going in, Mae and I went out to make a
final check on the chickens and rabbits.  As we did I saw the little rabbits in
the tall grasses and was able to catch it and put it back into the pens.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:45AM and had to hurry to get to the bus compound to take a field trip.  I
took Tolman Elementary to the Salt Lake Bee’s baseball field.  There was a lot
of schools that attended today’s game.  The parking lot was reserved only for
school buses.  The one worked at the field told me that they expected over
3,000 students to attend today’s game.   I hurried to get back to the bus
compound to take the PM route but when I went looking for my assistant, the bus
pulled out of the parking lot.  I was about to take a two hour callout when
dispatch called me and ask if I could take a bus of Jr. High students home from
Syracuse, as their bus had mechanical problems.  That run went well and I
finished up shortly after 4Pm.  Me had dinner about ready when I got home.  I
checked the chickens and rabbits before we ate.  Mae has been busy all day
cleaning up, working on the computer, inventorying our food supply, along with
other household jobs.  We went to the Family History Center tonight.  I took my
laptop computer and set up one PAF file on my computer and one on the FHC
computer.  This way I was able to start researching the files for incomplete
and duplicated information.  I got through my Father’s family with little
changes but ran into some large problems when I went to my Grandfather’s
records.  I got a call from the bus dispatch to let me know that the PM run
that I was to run is not back to the regular driver.  I may get a call for
tomorrow on another run.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t get
a call this morning so I slept until 7AM.  After the normal morning, Bob and I
went to United Rental and got a stump grinder.  It took all morning but I think
that we got the roots fairly well cut up.  I also ground quite a lot off the
stump in the back yard.  Jeff and Scott came over for lunch.  Scott installed
some new hardware onto our computer.  I took a nap this afternoon and then went
out and looked for the problem in one of the lawn sprinkler lines.  I found
that when Comcast installed a new cable into the house, they cut thru a water
line.  I worked on some of the other lines for a little while and set the water
to cycle thru.  I am going to reset it for tomorrow also as the lawns are
looking dry.  I came in the house very tired and just quite for this evening. 
I forgot that Bob and I was going to go home teaching tonight.  I watched part
of a tv show and then we went to bed.</span></p>

run this morning and then when I finished that run there was a Sub-Round table
meeting, so it was almost noon when I got home.  Mae got me some dinner and I
took a 10 minute nap before taking the afternoon route.  When I got home from
that I worked on the sprinkler system until I had to leave so Mae and I could
get up to Morgan to watch Tyler play base ball.  We stopped at David and
Shauna’s for a minute before coming home.  Bob wasn’t able to get the
sprinklers repaired but it is to late this evening to fix it.  I took care of
the chickens and rabbits and then came in a filled in this journal entry before
we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early to take a bus route today.  b ecause today is Friday and there was early
outs, that didn’t give me much time for lunch.  I worked on the sprinklers for
a few minutes and then after getting home this afternoon I worked until after
9AM and got part on it repaired but the one valve I completely replaced it and
the new valve is not working now.  It now has me completely puzzled.  Bob fixed
some chicken and rice for this evening.  While we were eating he tried to find
something to watch on TV but it was worthless.  Mae went over to help Mishelle
with the babies this afternoon.  We were going to go to Mikes and go to a dance
recital but I worked on the sprinkler.  Mae took Ashley with her and they went
down to Mikes.  I am sure tired tonight.  It was after 10:30PM when I quite
very upset over the system for the new valve that I installed won’t close.  Bob
had prepared some chicken for us to eat when we came in.  it was good but too
late eating for me so I slept most of the night in the recliner.  That’s ok as
Mae isn’t here to sleep with me anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM and started with my morning chores.  I then took the top off the zone valve
and couldn’t see how the solenoid could work.  I took the valve parts, minus
the main base and went back to Lowe’s to get help.  The girl at the return
counter said that I had to bring the complete valve back before she could help
me.  I tried to explain that I couldn’t bring the base back with out cutting it
out of the installation.  Again she insisted that she couldn’t help me if I
didn’t bring the complete unit back.  I got upset and told her that I wouldn’t
bring the base back and she would help me.  she called some one and soon a
young fellow came and helped me.  We looked at the solenoid of another unit and
I instantly saw that the drawing of the unit was not quite correct. From
looking at the new unit, I pulled the solenoid apart of the one we had
installed and saw I flake of plastic in the valve.  I removed the small piece
and took the valve home and reinstalled it and it worked fine.  I started the
water system to go through a complete cycle and we repaired some other areas
while waiting for the cycles to go through each zone.  It was after 2PM when
Mae and I left for the Morgan Cemetery.  We got there and enjoyed putting the
flowers on the graves and visiting with family members.  We then went to the
park and there enjoyed time with our family, Mae’s siblings and children. 
Scott and Mishelle and their children were the only other members of our Family
to attend.  After eating and visiting most of the family left.  Bryce, Deanna,
Mae and I stayed for quite a while and just enjoyed visiting.  It was late when
we got home.  I went out and checked on our animals and then I filled out this
entry.  I have got to reset the watering cycle and take a shower before bed
tonight.</span></p>

enjoyed rubbing each others feet.  I took care of the animals while Mae
prepared breakfast.  It was raining this morning and had rained quite a bit
last night.  We attended our meetings and enjoyed them.  Bob soon had dinner
ready when we returned home.  After dinner Mae and I packed and left for
Pocatello about 4:30PM.  Just before we got to the turnoff to Rich and Lois’s
it started to rain and it really came down hard.  When we got there we waited
for a while for the rain to let up before going on in.  Jeff and Joyce and some
of their family were there.  Devin and Betsey were there plus Phillip and Lisa
were also here.  It was good to visit with all of them.  We kept Lois and Elise
up until almost 11PM just visiting.  It was sure an enjoyable evening.</span></p>

MEMORIAL DAY</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke about
7AM and were soon up to get ready for today’s activities.  Mae and I want to go
to several of the cemeteries here in Idaho to decorate love ones graves with
flowers.  We had breakfast with Rich and Lois and some of their family that got
up that early.  I did look at the railing, that they had replaced, and I have
to admit that the person that did the job, either is a very poor craftsman or
someone that would cheat and take advantage of an older couple &amp; their
daughter.  I would like to talk to him and tell him my feelings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Before we
left, I got on Lois’s computer and did a search for some of the cemeteries,
plus Elise helped me with some of the directions.  We went first to the
Pocatello Cemetery and found Uncle Irven and Aunt Bernice’s graves.  There had
not been an American Flag placed on Uncle Irven’s grave, which there should
have been as he served in World War II.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After leaving
there we went to Wal-Mart and bought some flowers for Mark.  I guess that we
hadn’t told him that we were coming up to Idaho to decorate graves or he would
have sent flowers up with us for his parent’s graves.  We next went to the
Rigby Cemetery to find Uncle Myron and Aunt Lila’s grave.  As we entered the
Cemetery I wondered where we should start looking for the graves.  Mae
suggested that we just start walking but I felt impressed to drive in further. 
I saw an equipment shed and drove to it.  On the door was the Sexton’s name and
phone number.  I called it and his daughter said that he was out but gave me
his cell phone number.  I called that but only got the answering message.  I
left my number asking him to call me.  We then started walking backing and
forth on the rows of graves reading Head Stones, Mae took one row and I took
another.  On the third pass we found the markers.  It was remarkable to me that
we could find them so fast.  Someone had placed some flowers on the graves.  I
guess it would have been Aunt Lila’s family because with their and their
daughter’s death, they would have no other posterity.  To the side of their
graves was the grave of their infant son, which I had not known about until I
did the Family History research.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We noticed
that a military program was getting ready to start so we walked over to the
main flag pole.  I spoke to one of the uniformed men about the placing of flags
on Veterans graves and he told me that it was under the direction of the
Sexton.  I told him that Uncle Myron’s grave did not have a flag on it so he
gave me a flag to put on the grave.  The ceremony then started and we stayed
for it.  It was very appropriate and fitting to honor those Veterans that had
given their life’s and times to protect our freedoms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After leaving
the Cemetery we went to a park and there had our lunch.  Before leaving Rigby
we stopped at a store and bought some flags, so that if any of the other graves
that should be honored with a flag on there grave did not have one, we could
put one on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We next went
to the Rexburg North Cemetery.  We spent some time looking for dad’s grave.  I
finally called Elise and she tried to tell me where it was.  After talking to
her we went deeper into the cemetery than I had thought and we found Dad’s and
his first wife Viola’s graves.  I was sure greatful to have found them as I had
not been back to honor my Father since his death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We drove to
Driggs and found the cemetery.  It didn’t take long to find the Hill plot.  I
was especially pleased at the care that is now done for the cemetery grounds. 
I remember that as a youth each year we would bring rakes and shovels and spend
considerable time cleaning up the plot.  Now it is such a pleasant area with
lawn and trees and it is kept clean and well cared for.  We then looked for
Uncle Grant’s and Aunt Marjorie’s graves and soon found then further East of
the Hill plot.  There to we found the grave of their first baby that I hadn’t
known of until I started my Family History research.  I also took a picture of
the head stones of Marjorie’s Brother and I think her Mother.  I will visit
with Grant and Marjorie’s daughter about the possibility of doing their Temple
work for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                At each grave
we took pictures of the head stones and wrote a brief description of where the
graves were located.  I will enter this information into my computer files so I
will know where all these locations are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We left
Drigg’s and went to Victor.  It took us a while to find the Cemetery there as I
have not been there since we moved from Victor.  Plus the roads have changed a
great deal since we lived there.  After finding the Cemetery I called and had
Mark give me the location of Aunt Vida and Uncle Albert’s graves.  We placed
flowers on each of them.  We then left for Pocatello but stopped at a camp ground
on Pine Pass and ate a picnic lunch.  It was a picnic as we had the mosquitoes out
after us.  It was fun anyway.  After getting to Idaho Falls, Mae drove and let
me take a nap until we got to Pocatello.  We again stopped at Uncle Irven’s
grave and placed a flag there, before coming on to Rich and Lois’s home.  We
had a wonderful day and it was great to be together.   We love spending time
together.  We stayed at Rich &amp; Lois’s home again tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up at
5:30AM with Mae’s phone beeping that it needed to be charged.  That woke me up
so I stayed up thinking about the poor job that the fellow did in replacing the
deck railing.  I would like to talk to him and let him know that I am very
disappointed with his work.  Ether he deliberately cheated them or he is a darn
poor craftsman.  Mae got up at 7AM and we soon had breakfast and started on our
quilt.  We used Rich and Lois’s equipment and made a survival quilt.  We were
not sure if their sewing machine would sew that thick of padding but it worked
very well.  It took the longest for Mae and Lois to sew the edges.  It was
about 3:30 PM before we left for home.  We stopped at home for just a few
minutes and then went over to the Family History Center.  After getting back
home I entered this entry.  I guess that we left some of Mae’s books at the
center.  Time for bed.</span></p>

3:45AM but then went back to bed and slept until 7AM.  After breakfast I took
care of the chickens and rabbits.  I then went out front and started cleaning
up the roots and tried to use the roto-tiller but there was too many.  I used
the pickup and a chain and pulled roots.  Bob and Carroll came home and Bob
helped me by driving the pickup.  I quite for lunch at 12PM as Scott came for
lunch.  After lunch I laid down in the recliner and slept for almost an hour. 
Bob and I again worked on pulling roots from the front of the house.  Mae left
to help Scott and Mishelle this evening by tending children.  While she was
there she did laundry to help out.  Bob and I took the load of cement from the
curbing and the roots that we had pulled out to the dumps.  After getting back,
Bob fixed some dinner for us.   After eating I went downstairs and took a
shower and changed, then he and I went Home Teaching.  We stopped at Fallis’s
but she wasn’t there, but told her son to tell us she would be back about 9PM. 
We went over to Casey’s and found that Isaac has been laid off for about two
months.  Also Becky is expecting a baby girl in two weeks.  We next went into
the McKay Dee Hospital and visited with Patriarch Johnstun who is in there for
bleeding Ulster’s.  We again stopped at Sister Fallas’s but she still wasn’t
there.  I came home and started my journal.  Mae soon came home.  She got on
the inter-net and reserved rooms for us when we get to Kirkland in July, but it
would not process.  </span></p>

4:45AM to get ready to go to the bus compound.  I was one of two drivers that
took youth from Clearfield High School to the Hale Theater.  The drivers also
got to attend the show.  The show was “Pirates of the Caribbean” and the acting
and stage props were great although the plot wasn’t anything special.  We got
the youth back to school at noon.  When I got home Mae had just eaten so she
got me something to eat.  I then laid down and took a nap.  This evening Mae
and I went to the Ogden Temple.  After an enjoyable session we went out to eat
at the Chuck-A-Rama.  I checked on the chickens and rabbits before coming for
the night.  Mae got on the inter-net and read Garrett’s weekly letter, which
gets forwarded to us.  Garrett is doing great and we sure enjoy hearing what he
is doing.  I also filled in my journal entry for today.  </span></p>

sure that I could take d=care of the animals before I took my field trip.  At
5:45AM the phone rang and the dispatch asked if I could take a Special Ed run. 
When Mae told them that I already had a field trip she said I should be back
before my field trip.  I had to hurry and leave because the rout started at
7:15 AM.  I got back to the bus compound at 9AM and found my bus assigned to
the field trip and made it to the school by 9:45AM.  There had been a especial
request for a handicap life on one of the two busses so I brought that bus.  It
turned out that the child for the lift was sick and couldn’t come.  We returned
the youth to the school at 2:15PM and I started back to the bus compound when a
request for a driver to take a Elementary class on a field trip.  I am not sure
just what happened to their schedule but it had fallen through.  I called
dispatch and volunteered.  Dispatch said that my bus was not large enough, so I
said that I would return to the compound.  Dispatch then called back and asked
my location.  They asked if I could stop at the Farmington compound and
exchange busses and then return to the school.  I took the youth from
Washington elementary to Draper where they went to a Family Activity area.  I
was hungry so I went to the café and bought a Chicken Creaser Salad.  I waslked
around the resort for a while and then went to the bus and took a nap.  It was
after 5PM when the youth finished up and reloaded the bus.  After taking the class
back to school I had to take the bus back to the Farmington compound, trade
buses and then return that bus to the Clearfield compound.  It was after 7PM
when I returned home.  I was very tired when I got home and so we went right to
bed.</span></p>

It took two trips to Home Depot to get the blocks for the planters.  Bob helped
me with the first load.  When I finished getting the second load Mae had dinner
ready.  We watched a show on Hall Mark while we ate.  Mae got several phone

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke just
after 4AM and thought that I might soon get a call to take a bus run.  When I
again woke at 7AM I thought how happy I was that I didn’t get a call.  Then I
realized that today is Sunday and I enjoyed that thought.  As I read the
scriptures this morning my mind was continually on David and his family.  I
don’t understand how someone can be so intelligent and yet be so blind as to
the testimony of the Book of Mormon.  I find so much comfort and guidance as I
read and study the scriptures and the directions from living Prophets and those
who are called to lead the Church.  This morning I felt great anxiety for my
children, my assigned families that I Home Teach and for the great evil that is
sweeping the earth.  I often think of parents that I have known and that I now
know that has or had children that have abandoned their teachings.  My heart
aches under such thoughts.  Oh how I realize my need to trust in my Lord and
Savior.  Bishop Smith gave the message in out combined Priesthood and Relief
Society meeting.  His message was on the Family and he gave a very appropriate
and timely message.  In Sunday School Sister Joyce Wilson gave the lesson on
the Three Degrees of Glory and did an excellent presentation.  The Spirit of
the Sacrament meeting was also very good.  Special Day!  After church Bob and I
went over to Sister Fallis’s Home Teaching.  She wasn’t home yet so we came
home and then went back a little later.  Mae and I then went to David and
Shauna’s for dinner and to visit for the evening.  david took us down to show
us their camper.  It is very nice.  After getting back to their home, Mae and
David figured out a date for us to go with them to East Canon reservoir for a
few days.  We watched a show on TV of a man that looks for monsters in the
water.  It show him search for a large monster in a river in Africa that was
eating children, young people and even a water buffalo.  When it ended up he
found large cat fish that weighed up to 161 lb. And he estimated that there
were some that weighted even much more than that.  It was 10PM when we got home. 
I finished this entry and we soon went to bed.  Mae said that if I don’t get a
call to drive bus in the morning we would try to go fishing.</span></p>
