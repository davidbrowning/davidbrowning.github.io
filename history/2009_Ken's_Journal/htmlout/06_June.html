<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got a call
this morning and took a bus run.  The run went ok but the bus was one I have
sub on before and it was just as dirty as it was before.  It was also below
half full when I the pre-trip check.  Bob and I did some figuring on the front
landscaping.  I then took the PM run.  After the bus run I went to Durk’s and
got the material for the sprinklers in front.  I checked the animals before
coming in for dinner.  We relaxed and watched a show this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep the best last night and woke just after 4AM and hoped that I did get
called in this morning.  I went back to sleep and didn’t wake until almost
7AM.  Mae was already up when I got up.  Mae and I had enjoyed relaxing for a
while before we got going this morning.  After feeding my animal’s I started
work on the front yard.  Mae called me for lunch about 1PM.  after eating I
laid in the recliner and took a nap.  At 1:45PM I got a call from the shop
asking me to take a PM route.  I was to leave the compound at 2PM so I was
already late.  I got to Layton High but came into the East side and now they
have the West side open.  That made me later but before I finished that run I
had caught up and got to Central Junior High about on time.  I was a little
behind when I got to the grade school but got all of them home.  I had to fill
the bus with fuel and sweep it out before coming home.  I stopped in the front
yard and put tools away and then went downstairs when Mae had dinner ready.  
We went to the Family History Center this evening.  I have run into problems
with my Family History file.  Some how, I have disconnected some of the
family’s.  When we left to come home our car would not start.  We had to have
Sister Sonya Hess bring us home.  We checked with our Auto Insurance Co. and we
have towing on our policy so tomorrow we will have it towed to Dee’s Service
Center and have him take a look at it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up at
7AM and after breakfast I went over to Dee’s Service where I met the tow co.
with the car.  Dee said he would check it out and let me know what the problem
is.  From there I went over to Irven and Sandy’s to check out the work they
want me to do for them.  It was almost noon when I got home.  Mae had dinner
about ready for Scott and I.  After dinner Bob and I worked on the front yard. 
We had some problems with the water lines and with tree stumps that we missed. 
Mae went Visiting Teaching this afternoon.   I quite working about 6PM, and
came in for dimmer.  Mae had cooked fish for dinner.  We watched a show on Hall
Mark before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was after
6AM when we woke and I was glad that I hadn’t received a call to drive bus this
morning.  Mae prepared breakfast and after eating I fed and took care of the
rabbits and chickens.  Bob and I then started work on the front yard.  At noon
we stopped for lunch.  Mae tended Benji and Rachael this morning for Gail while
she went to the Temple this morning.  After lunch Mae went to a hair
appointment.  I took a nap and then Bob and I went back to work on the front
yard.  I ordered 5 yards of soil from Dwaine Mathason’s company this morning
and it was delivered this afternoon.  It was after 6PM when we quite for the
night.  After dinner Jeff called on the computer so we could see him as well as
he could see us.  Jeff and I then got on the inter-net and played a game of
Hearts.  Jeff won the game.  I entered some payroll information and filled out
my journal.  I will take and shower and go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, June 05, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6AM this morning.  As I read my scriptures this morning I read D &amp; C 133
which is a revelation on the Second Coming of our Lord.  I have trouble
understanding just what this revelation is describing.  I am so greatful for my
testimony of the Church, the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Priesthood Authority and
the Plan of Salvation.  To some this might be a crutch but I feel that I need
the strength that I receive form it or I could not see a purpose to life with
all its challenges and problems.  What else in life gives you a purpose and a
goal to live for?  We are expecting to hear that Uncle Wayne Degraw has passed
away any day now.  He has suffered two strokes and now has Hospice Care in his
home.  He is 97 years old and has lived a good life.  What comfort it is to
have the Gospel at this time.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Bob and I
worked all day on the front yard again.  We rented a bob cat to move the dirt
with.  I don’t think Bob could have helped me and I didn’t feel up to that kind
of work.  When we went to get the bob cat I took some payroll papers to the
office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae went
walking at lunch with Jackie.  They have a good friendship together.  Mae also
helped me with the rabbits and chickens.  She went visiting Teaching and tended
Kylan and Ashley so that Scott and Mishelle could go out together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This evening
I watched a show on TV while Mae played with Kylan and Ashley.  After Scott and
Mishelle got the children I hung Mae’s flowers out side.  I filled out my
journal and took a shower before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, June 06, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
early so she could go to a class on preparedness in Provo.  I got up at 7AM and
after eating breakfast I took care of the rabbits and chickens.  Bob help me
and we cut the hay this morning.  It was a lot of work but we got it cut by
noon.  Bob took the hay out while I cut it.  Before we finished I got cramps on
my legs and had to stand and walk around be for I could continue.  Bob cooked
some lunch.  I tried to cook some rice for me to eat for lunch but I set down
in the recliner and fell asleep.  I had left the heat to high and when Bob came
down to wake me the rice had burned.  Bob and I worked on the front yard again
this afternoon.  We were both wore out when we quite about 6:30PM.  I then
checked on the animals before coming in.  I fixed me something for dinner and
was about to eat when Mae came home.  I watched part of a movie on Hall Mark
and then took my shower.  Mae spent time with Mattie and Jessie before putting
them to bed.  I took a shower and then entered my journal.  We have the
pictures displaying on the computer screen so sometimes we get watching and
reminiscing over past years.  I am very tired and hurt all over so I think I
will got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, June 07, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and I feel much better than when we went to bed last night.  With it being Fast
Sunday we didn’t have breakfast this morning.  Mae got some breakfast for the
little girls as they haven’t started fasting yet.  Mae also stayed home with
the girls rather than taking them to Primary.  It was raining this morning and
has rained hard during the night.  That means that my hay is gone as far as
feed value.  I will probably just till it into the compost pit for mulch.  I
drove the pickup over to attend Priesthood meeting.  Mae and the girls met me
for Sacrament meeting.  Bob prepared dinner for us and as normal it was very
good.  I compiled a letter this afternoon with some Family History papers to
send to Jackie Winterowd.  I also tried to call Jennie Griggs to see if she would
give help me with some information with her family, but no one answered the
phone.  We watched the first part of the movie “The Bible”, with the girls this
evening.  I called David about taking the children fishing in the morning ans
he said that they are planning on it.  We also talked about taking the four
wheelers up to Soda Springs and he thinks that we can take his father-in-laws
trailer.  He will let me know for sure.   I hooked up the boat to the pickup so
it will be ready to go in the morning.  When I took the garbage containers out
to the curb side it was raining quite hard.  I am not sure about our fishing
trip tomorrow.  We will just have to wait and see.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, June 08, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
this morning and had breakfast and after taking care of the animals we went to
David’s where we got their children and then went fishing.  We went up to East
Canyon Reservoir.  I took everyone for a boat ride and then brought Mae, Emily,
Maddi and Jessie back to shore where they enjoyed playing on the beach. 
Conner, Tyler and I went out fishing.  By 11AM we had a limit of nice fish so
we went in.  We all enjoyed a nice lunch and then I took Emily, Maddi and
Jessie out fishing.  Again we had good luck and each of the girls caught fish. 
Mae left before we got back as Tyler had a dentist appointment.  We got to
David and Shauna’s just as Shauna and Tyler returned for the Dentist.  We
stayed and I flayed five fish and we cooked them for dinner.  We sure enjoyed
being with David and his family.  It was after 9PM when we got home and got the
boat put away.  We are all tired and soon went to bed.  I played a couple of
games of solitary before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 6AM.  I fed the animals while Mae prepared breakfast.  I gathered up my
tools and went over to Irven and Sandy’s where I worked on some miner repairs
of their house.  I have been in a depressed mode most of the day because of my
family.  I don’t know what to do about them.  It was 5:45PM when I got home.  I
feed my animals and then went into the house.  Mae had taken Mae took Kylan,
Ashley, Maddi and Jessie to Dinosaur Park in Ogden and didn’t get home until
after 6PM.  jeff came over to our house and will stay this evening.  Scott also
came and had dinner with us.  He brought the twins with him as Mishelle went
out with her Sister.  After putting the little girls to bed Mae, jeff and I
watched the movie “War Wagon” staring John Wayne.  It was 11PM when we went to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, June 10, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6AM and took care of the animals and had breakfast.  I then went over to Irven
and Sandy’s and worked.  I came home for lunch as Scott came for lunch also. 
Jeff was going to come for lunch but he had a conference call at noon that he
had to be in on.  I worked until 6PM when Mae called me to come home so I could
eat before going Home Teaching.  It rained hard from 6PM until 7:30PM.  Bob and
I were able to visit with Brother Casey and with the Johnston’s.  Sister Fallis
wasn’t home so we will have to try to catch her another time.  Jeff, Mae and I
played a game of Rummy before going to bed.  Mae won the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, June 11, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Jeff left for
work at 7AM.  Mae hadn’t slept very well so I let her sleep in and I got my own
breakfast.  I then took care of the animals.  I decided that maybe I had better
wake Mae before I left to work at Irven’s.  I stopped on my way to Irven’s at
Green’s Feed and bought rabbit pellets and chicken laying mash.  I came home
for lunch.  When I went in Mae had just got up.  She spent the afternoon with
the children.  She even went over to Scott’s and got Kylan and Ashley.  Because
it was raining most of the day they went to the Air Force Museum and then to
McDonald’s so the children could play on their toys.  I had hoped to have
finished with Irven and Sandy’s but just before quitting Sandy found another
area in the siding that has rotted from water leaking into it.  This will be a
major job to replace this spot.  I came home a little after 6PM and was very
tired.  Mae had gotten home a little earlier and had dinner about ready.  After
dinner I watched a show on Video and filled capsules with Mannatech product.  Mae
was busy putting the little girls to bed and them sent a e-mail to Scott.  It
was after 11PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, June 12, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up and
went up to David’s where I got his Father-in-Law’s trailer.  I took it to
Wasatch Trailers to have them repair the brakes on it.  On the way from David’s
I went to Wheelright Lumber to see about getting some T-1-11 Cedar siding for
Irven and Sandy’s house but the style that we need is no longer produced.  I
think that I will just have to hand form the area using Auto Bondo.  When I got
home Mae was our working in the garden.  I went out and helped her clean out
most of the weeds.  I came in for some lunch and started warming it up while
Mae ran over to the store for a few items.  Jeff called and said that the car
wouldn’t start.  I ate some lunch and as soon as Mae returned I went over to
pull the car to the shop but when I got to where Jeff had it parked I got in
and it started right up.  We took it to Dee’s where we left it and I told Dee
to drive it all next week to see if it will fail again for him.  I went over to
Irven’s and worked on their garaged.  I worked until time to help Mae prepare
dinner for the Elders.  Just as I got home Becky had came for the little girls. 
Becky said that they had a good time on their cruise.  Bob went up to get the
Missionaries for me while I grilled some chicken.  Jeff also came for dinner. 
He then got his clothes and I think he is going to go to David’s.  I changed
clothes and Mae took me over to Irven’s and was going to drive over to give
Ashley her Birthday gift.  However Scott had taken Ashley and Kylan swimming. 
She stayed and visited with Irven and Sandy while I finished taping the
sheetrock.  By then Scott was taking the family out to eat so we met them at
Golden Corral in the parking lot and gave Ashley her birthday gift and we also
gave Kylan his as we will be gone on his Birthday.  We came on home and took a
few minutes to check our animals before going into the house.  I typed this
entry before we went to bed.  It has been a very busy day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early so that Mae could get started on the packing for our trip and I had to be
over to the church to help clean it.  At 11AM we went to Provo to have dinner
with Pat Bradfield, Ralph and Joan Peterson, Gary Nelson and his companion
Ruth.  Before leaving I asked Mae if we were going to the Sizzler in Orem or
Provo?  She told me that it was in Provo.  We got there 10 minutes early but no
one else was there.  Gary called us and asked us where we were.  It should have
been the Sizzler in Orem.  We were a few minutes late but they waited for us. 
We had a very enjoyable lunch as we visited together.  After eating we stopped
at Sea Gull Book store and bought a Triple Combination set of scriptures for
Jase (for his Birthday) and a set for me (for Christmas).  We then went to
Cabela’s where we bought Mae some fishing equipment.  When we got to Layton we
stopped at The Home Depot and bought some PVC fittings for me to try to remodel
the water container for the chickens.  After getting home Mae went to Wal-Mart
for a few things.  I tried my idea with the waterier but it didn’t work.  I
then took care of the animals for the evening and got some fishing equipment
ready for Monday.  Georgia called Mae and told us that Uncle Wayne died on
Tuesday and the funeral was today.  None of our family had been notified until
Aunt Beth called Georgia today.  I feel bad that we were not notified because
we sure would have been to the funeral.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8AM and then got up.  We enjoyed having the morning to relax just a
little.  I took care of the animals and then got ready for church.  We were
able to walk to church this morning which was a good thing as I left our car
with Dee’s Service to see if he can find why it doesn’t start occasionally. 
Meetings were very good today.  bob invited us for dinner today.  He prepared a
very nice chicken dinner.  He also had fried shrimp on the side.  For desert he
had cooked coco nut cream and lemon pies, using our sweetener.  It was very
good.  Mae and I spent the afternoon trying to get things ready to leave for
our Anniversary trip with our children to Trail Creek Lodge in Soda Springs,
Idaho.  I copied pictures from Mae’s picture files, on to thumb drives, for
each of our children.  It’s after 10PM so I had better get to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM but it seems that I am slow at getting going.  After getting dressed I took
care of the animals and ate breakfast.  I cleaned the pickup so and then got it
packed.  Jeff got there before 8AM and helped me.  Shellie, Roy, Sandi and Nick
got there at 8:30AM.  We finished packing and left for Idaho.  David and Shauna
actually left before we did as they were a little ahead of us when we got to
the Idaho border.  We all got together before we reached the top of the Malad
pass and drove in a caravan the rest of the way.  We arrived at the Trail
Canyon Lodge at 12:30PM and Sheri had lunch ready for us.  We got settled in
our rooms after eating and then played some games and popped corn.  David, Jeff
and I drove to Soda Springs and got some drinks.  After returning to the lodge
the three of us took 4 wheelers and went for a ride.  Sheri had a nice dinner
ready at 6:30PM.  After dinner we set around the table and got talking. 
Shellie and Sandi got joking and before it ended there were hurt feelings.  It
took most of the evening before most of the problem worked out.  We went to
Lava and soaked in the hot pools.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, June 16, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7AM and took our time getting up.  Sheri had a nice breakfast ready by
8:30AM.  David &amp; Shauna, Shellie &amp; Roy and Jeff went for a ride on the
four wheelers.  Sandi went walking this morning a walked further than she had
realized.  I think Nike was quite concerned and was ready to go looking for her
when she returned.  Mae, Jeff and I went riding on the four wheelers and had a
very good time.  Shauna left for home just before lunch.  Sheri prepared her a
sack lunch for her to eat on the way home.  After lunch all of us went to Lava
swimming and to the hot pools again.  We came back to the lodge in time for
dinner.  Again Sheri had a very nice dinner.  She had a desert prepared for
Sandi, Mae and I that was very good that is glutton free.  She also had a nice
chocolate cake and ice cream for all the rest.  Today I broke my diet with
several items.  I am not sure about the desert; I also had some French Fries,
Onion Rings and some pop corn.  This evening I had quite a bit of pain in my
hands and some of the joints in my legs.  After dinner we played a game of Runs
&amp; Bunches, Mae ended up winning the game.  Mike and Becky arrived while we
were playing the game.  The kids then put on a show on DVD that we watched.  I
thought it was fare fetched and ridicules besides a waist of time.  It was
after 1AM before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7AM but Mae stayed in bed longer.  It rained quite a lot today but there was
still time for four wheeling.  Mae and I went for a walk and then came back and
got the truck and went for a ride.  We had a wonderful time together.  I don’t
think there is anything that it isn’t better if Mae is with me.  Scott,
Mishelle and the twins were here when we returned.  Some of the boys went
gulfing.  After lunch we took some Family pictures.  Nick left to go home soon
after we took the pictures.  Mike, David and I went fishing at Blackfoot
Reservoir.  Mike caught the only fish and it was really a nice one.  After
returning to the lodge and eating I tried to set up the projector but we were
unable to get it to work.  It was 11:20 PM before I went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30AM to go fishing but it was raining hard.  Scott was up because of the
twins not sleeping well.  We visited while I waited to see if Sid still was
interested in going fishing.  A while later Sid reported that the waters were
all high, swift and dirty so advised against going fishing today.  There wasn’t
much done outside today because of the rain.  The boys did go down to Soda
Springs and were able to play nine holes of gulf.  I stayed home and watched a
video that was fair.  I also got a nap.  Roy, Shellie, Sandi, Mae and I went to
town and bought a few items.  I bought a Glider Bench for Mae for our 50<sup>th</sup>
Wedding Anniversary.  Sandi also bought one for them. This evening most
everyone went to the Lave hot pots.  We watched a movie on DVD this evening. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up for
breakfast and also everyone got things packed up.  Sheri prepared a very nice
breakfast for us as always.  After breakfast Mike and Becky went to Lave. 
Scott and Mishelle wanted to but it didn’t work out for them.  Before loading
the four wheelers Roy and Scott took a ride and then I took Mishelle for a ride
up to the top on the hill behind the lodge.  We also road to the warming hut to
show it to Mishelle.  I let Mishelle drive the four wheeler beck to the lodge.  It
was noon by the time we got every thing packed up and got the four wheelers
loaded.  We stopped in Downey and ate some lunch.  It was almost 5PM when we
got home.  Roy and Linda were here when we got home.  We had planned on going
to the Salt Lake Temple and going through a session but Roy and Shellie came so
we unloaded the four wheelers.  Roy the wanted me to take him to Durk’s where
we got them a water softener.  Roy and Linda stayed and visited for the
evening.  Roy helped me assemble the Glider Bench.  I had Mae got to the store
and get us some Chicken for dinner.  It was after 10PM before we finished with
the bench and Roy and Linda went home.  I was very tired and had trouble
entering this journal entry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and got started but before I finished feeding animals Roy and Shellie
came.  We soon left for the Ogden Temple where we did Sealings of couples.  It
was a special time.  Mike and Becky were going to go with us but Mike had to go
with David Michael to a football camp.  There was to be about 30 scouts that
were to be there looking at the players and talking to fathers, so Mike felt
that he needed to be there, which I agree he did.  Tayler was sick and stayed
home, so Becky stayed with the little girls at our place while we went to the
temple.  We stopped at Costco for a while before coming on home.  We were
rushed to get to the church and ready for Jace’s Baptism.  That went very well
although we forgot to arrange for white clothes for Jase so Bishop Smith made
some calls and went to get the needed clothes.  I thought Bishop Smith did a
wonderful job at conducting the program and making sure that everyone felt so
welcome.  Shellie gave a beautiful talk on the importance of baptism and then
before the conformation Mae gave a very good talk on the Gift of The Holly
Ghost.  Quint and I were asked to be Witnesses and I noticed that Jace’s hand
was too high on Roy’s arm and it did not go all the way under the water.  I had
Roy re-baptize Jase and the 2<sup>nd</sup> time it went ok.  It was raining
hard most of the day so we asked David if we could have the family
get-to-gather at there place.  It was a house full but David and Shauna
graciously accommodated all of us.  We grilled hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken
and it was served with all the trimmings.  The children all gave me Father-Day
gifts that I opened while we were together.  Sandi and Nike gave me some
barbeque tools and a cute apron.  Roy and Shellie gave me some new everyday
slacks.  Mike and Becky gave me two hats; one of them is a Browning Cap.  David
and Shauna gave me a LED flash light.  We were sure tired when we got home this
evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but went back to sleep.  Mae let me sleep in so when I got up I had to hurry in
order to get my animals taken care of and get ready for Church.  I really
enjoyed the Spirit of the meetings today.  Bob and Carroll invited us for
dinner.  We had thought that we would be out to Sandi and Nike’s to celebrate
Shellie’s Birthday but Shellie and Roy and the children left for home early
this morning.  I asked Carroll if she had anything for a baby gift that Bob and
I could take to Isaac and Becky Casey’s for the birth of their new baby.  She
brought out a beautiful knitted baby blanket that was one of her favorites.  It
was sure special of her.  On the way back home we stopped at Sister Fallis’s
for a quick visit.  I took a nap after Bob and I returned home.  For Fathers
Day Mae gave me a set of Precision Screwdrivers, 4 ties and the book “Out Of
Jerusalem”.  Grant came over to wish Bob a Happy Fathers Day so I went upstairs
to say Hi.  As normal I visited for a while.  This evening I took care of the
animals before eating a light super.  Sandy called and after talking to Mae for
a minute she ask when I was going to come over to fix their siding and the tile
in the shower.  Mae told her that it would probably be a couple of weeks as I
am quite busy trying to finish the front walks for Bob.  Sandy didn’t want that
answer so she asked if she could talk to me.  Mae said that she couldn’t as she
didn’t want me to over work.  I thought it was cute the way she looks out for
me.  Mae and I then worked on the computers for a while.  I downloaded pictures
from the camera and of course we had to look through them.  I also entered two
days of journal entries.  It was 10:45PM when we started for bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was going
to get up early and go to the onion patch and weed but it was to late when we
got to bed last night and I didn’t get up in time.  David brought the children
about 8 or 8:30 this morning for Mae to tend.  Tyler has a program with his
parents to work of the cost of a dirt bike, so Tyler worked with me and we
cleaned the chicken coop and pen, then we cleaned up under the rabbit pens.  We
then tilled most of the garden for weeds.  After lunch I started working on the
water lines in the front yard and Tyler came out and helped dig the trenches. 
He has really been a good helper today.  I rented a sod cutter and got the sod
cut in the front yard but the belt came of it when we took it to the back yard
and I couldn’t get it to work after that.  I took it back but I guess id didn’t
complain enough because they didn’t cut the price any.  Bob and I worked until
after 5PM and then cleaned up and quite for the evening.  I haw very tired but
I showered and we watched the Doris Day shows on DVD.  I have a wonderful wife
that is so good to me and cares about me and my health.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep the best last night so Mae let me sleep in until almost 8AM.  That would
have been fine but I have a busy day planned.  We skipped breakfast today as
all of Mae’s siblings are fasting with the purpose and concern for our children
that are struggling with their Testimony of the Church.  Mae helped me feed the
animals.  It was cute because when we went out we had two roosters that we had
missed yesterday and had not got them back into the pen.  Mae had the one
cornered so I told her to catch it.  She said that she was afraid to for it
might bite her.  She is fun and I sure love her.  Bob and I made covers for the
strawberry plants to try to keep the birds from eating the strawberry’s as they
ripen.  We then worked on the front yard getting sprinkler heads moved and
repositioned and formed a sidewalk along the East side of the driveway.  I
finished up at 1:45PM and had to hurry to shower and leave for the Ogden
Temple.  We had decided that we would calibrate Dad Porter’s Birthday by
attending a session at the Temple.  Although all the family couldn’t be there
they joined us in Fasting for Family members.  After the session we went to the
cafeteria and had dinner.  Mae and I went from the Temple to the Family History
Center in Clearfield as tonight is our assigned night to work.  I think I was
able to get my files back in order and add more information on the Crandall
line.  After getting home Mae and I went out and checked the animals.  Both
does had kits but the again the youngest doe only had three and all three were
dead.  I think that will be the end for her and she will be rabbit stew.  We
had something to eat and I entered this journal entry and we went to bed.  It
is sure fun to watch our pictures come up on the screen saver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were going
to get up at 6AM but when the alarm went off we stayed in bed longer.  Mae
helped me feed the animals after breakfast.  I then went to Ogden and got 2yrds
of concrete and we poured the front walk and side to the driveway.  Mae called
Brother Higgley and he came over and helped me lay it out.  I am sure greatful
for his help for Bob wasn’t much help.  Bob prepared dinner for Roy, Linda,
Irven, Sandy, Mae and I, besides Mark, Carroll and himself.  It was almost 2PM
before I finished the concrete and Roy returned for returning the concrete
cart.  After dinner I went back out and dug the trench for the sprinklers in
the front curbing.  I had just started burying the sprinkler lines when Brother
Wayne and Claudia Thompson came on an Home Teaching appointment.  Mae has been
trying to get things packed for our trip, in between dinner with my family and
Home Teachers and visiting with Linda.  We are sure tired this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6AM and Mae prepared breakfast while I fed the chickens and rabbits.  After
breakfast Mae had an appointment with her dentist.  I got the boat ready and
Bob, Roy and I went to East Canyon Reservoir fishing.  Bob had bought worms but
we were on the way when I asked him if he had them and he had forgotten them. 
We stopped at a couple of stores but they didn’t carry them.  I called David
and ask about who might carry worms at Morgan.  He said he was sure that the
station at Stoddard, so we stopped there and bought more for the trip.  We had
a good time fishing and filled up the limits before coming home.  Mae had
packed for the trip all day, gone to her dentist and was trimming the yard when
we got home.  Bob helped me put the boat away.  Roy went with us so we could
use his Costco membership card and get a new camera.  We also stopped at UPS
and weighed our suitcases.  The one weighed 49 lb. and the other 46 ½ lb.  That
is close enough.  We were able to find a nice camera at Costco.  When we got
back home Mae fixed us a nice dimmer.  Roy wasn’t feeling good when we got back
to the house but after resting and eating some dinner with us he felt better. 
It was sure good to have the day with him.  We finished getting a few items
ready for tomorrow and I did my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke at
5:45AM and got started.  By the time we had breakfast, fed the animals and got
packed it was time to leave.  Bob drove us to the Salt Lake Airport.  We got
through the registration and thought that was interesting as you do your own
computer entry.  We then checked our two bags and they weight 99lb.  We then
went through security and even though it takes a while the security personal
were actually fairly decent about it.  We had trouble finding our departure
gate for when we looked up our flight number on the screen, it came up with a
Delta Airline.  Our tickets were for Northwest Airlines and finally after
checking with a very friendly Security Officer he explained that Delta had just
recently bought Northwest and that is why the flight screen was different.  Our
flight from SLC to Minneapolis was late leaving SL so we just had time to run
to our next connection.  We loaded and the plane backed out.  When we got to Dayton
our bags hadn’t made the plane change so they told us that they would bring
them out to us tonight.  Jeff was at the airport waiting for us when we got
there.  We were hungry so we went out to eat a Ponderosa Steak House.  We had a
very nice dinner and then we went to Greenville.  The landscape is gentle
rolling uneven but flat terrain.  There is no mountains that you can see and
there is thick groves of trees everywhere.  It is very beautiful and green.  I noticed
that the grain crops are about ready for thrashing.  After getting to Jeff’s
home and getting somewhat settled, Jeff took us to Wal-Mark for some groceries
that we needed.  On the way Jeff took us by the Honeywell plant.  We played
games this evening waiting for our luggage to arrive.  We were concerned about
them leaving the bags out side on the porch that someone might take them.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                At 1AM Mae
made some calls and finally got someone and they said that our suitcases had
arrived and a privet company would deliver them.  At 2AM we gave up and went to
bed, hoping for the best.  I woke once with birds outside making a lot of noise,
a dog barking and my CPAP bothering me.  I got up about 6AM and found that our
bags had come and had been placed inside the front entry door.  I took a shower
and shaved and then got my computer out and wrote my journal entry.  Mae woke a
little after 8AM but Jeff had been up late listing for our bags to arrive so we
let him sleep.  It was after 11 when we finished with breakfast.  Jeff went to
the Laundromat to do some laundry while Mae and I looked around town.  We went
to the Anne Oakley park and saw that.  We were going to the Garff Museum but
decided to wait and see it with Jeff.  We got Jeff from the Laundromat and came
back home for dinner.  After eating we took naps.  This afternoon we went to a
park and just enjoyed walking around it.  This evening we ate and then played
games.  We played “Bohnanza” and Mae ended with 24 points and Jeff and I tied
with 25 points.  We broke the tie with “Rock, Scissors, Paper” and I won.  Mae
then took a shower and I entered this entry.  Jeff got on the computer and got
us tickets to the Cincinnati Red Socks baseball game on the 4<sup>th</sup> of
July.  It was after mid-night before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I got
up at 8AM and went to church.  Greenville has a small branch and the building
is also very small.  We enjoyed their meetings.  Mae cooked stir-fry for
dinner.  After eating I fell asleep on the couch, while Mae and Jeff played
some games of Rummy.  This afternoon Jeff took us around the area to show us
the outskirts of Greenville.  It is very beautiful with the rolling hills, many
groves of trees, neat farms and large housing lots.  We saw beautiful homes back
in the groves of trees with the trees being so thick that you could not see
from one house to the next.  There was quite a nice industrial area but when I
mentioned it to Jeff he said that most of the buildings are now empty and
closed down.  At church, one sister said that she would know Monday if she
still had a job or not.  It really looks like the Greenville area is hurting
for employment opportunities.  We had a light super and played a game before
going to bed.  I called Jim and Marion and they are not sure if they can go
with us a week from Monday, to Kirtland, as Jim is in quite a lot of back
pain.  As the sun goes down the fire flies come out and they are fun to watch. 
As I watch them out the window it almost looks like sparks from a campfire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4:30AM and left for Keokuk Iowa where we have motel reservations.  We enjoyed
the trip as we saw beautiful farms among the trees.  We did make a couple of
wrong turns but the GPS soon got us back on track.  We had a “Check Engine”
warning light come on so we stopped and checked all I could.  With plenty of
water, all belts working and the oil ok we continued on.  We did stop to buy
some 50/50 coolant and add to the reservoir, but that didn’t seem to help.  We
stopped at Carthage Illinois and went through the jail where Joseph and Hyrum
were murdered.  That was very impressive and we enjoyed the tour there.  Mae
took lots of pictures all along the way.  It was about 4:30PM when we got to
Keokuk and found the motel.  We took a short nap and then went for something to
eat and bought a few groceries.  We came back to the motel and put on a DVD
that we rented.  It was a stupid movie and really wasn’t worth the $1.00 we
paid to rent it.  I sure enjoyed being with Mae.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at 6am
and took showers before going to Nauvoo.  We did return the DVD and get some
salt, pepper and dish soap while we were at the store.  When we got to Nauvoo
we went to the visitor center.  At the visitor center we got tickets for
performance this evening at the Cultural Hall “Rendezvous in Old Nauvoo”.  We
next went on a wagon ride around Old Nauvoo at which time homes, shops and
special areas were pointed out to us.  The lot of Porter Rockwell was pointed
out but there was not a home there. (In one of the books, we have read, on
Porter Rockwell, it indicated that when the Saints were driven out of Nauvoo,
Porter set his house on fire and burned it down so that no one else could have
the privilege of living in his home.)  The Sister that narrated the area as we
road around explained that Porter Rockwell was a childhood friend of Joseph.  Porter
was one of the first to be baptized when the church was organized on April 6,
1930.  Porter became a fearless defender and body guard of Joseph.  It was said
that Porter never missed his target whether he used a hand gun or a long gun. 
In fact one of the evidences used in his defense when charged with the attempt
to assassin Governor Boggs, was that the Governor was still alive.  Although
Porter was not found guilty of attempting to kill the Governor, they kept him
in prison trying to find other charges that could be brought against him.  He
escaped once but was recaptured and brought back to prison.  This time they
shackled his hands and feet in a very uncomfortable manner and the only way he
could eat the little and pour quality food was like a dog lapping it from the
pan.  Porter again escaped after several months, and they think he was allowed
to escape because they could not find charges to hold him on.  He returned to
Nauvoo where there was a Party that was being hosted by the Prophet.  When
Porter tried to enter the building the guards wouldn’t allow him entrance
because they could not recognize the dirty and unkempt man in such rags. 
Joseph came to see what the problem was and when he saw Porter he looked into
his still blue eyes and recognized him.  He embraced his dear friend, bringing
him in and saw that he was cared for.  After Joseph and Hyrum were murdered,
Porter became the body guard to Brigham Young.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Also we were
told that Samuel Smith rode to Carthage to render help to his two brothers but
encountered mob members that chased him for seven hours before he could elude
them.  By the time he arrived at Carthage it was to late, Joseph and Hyrum we
dead.  He cleaned up the bodies and returned them to Nauvoo and reported to his
mother Lucy, at which he collapsed into his mothers arms.  Twenty three days
later he died from injuries received during the chase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were taken
to a beautiful area by the Mississippi river named North Hill.  Joseph loved to
come to this spot where he welcomed new arrivals, sent off missionaries and
just be alone to meditate.  We were also told that you can see the shallow
areas of the river because the lilies only grow in water up to 18 to 24 inches
in depth.  There were about 30 outlying communities of Saints, West of the
Mississippi River until, due to mob action; they had to come to Nauvoo for
safety.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                At one point
in the wagon ride, it was explained to us, that at the time of the dedication
of the Restored Nauvoo Temple, the Tabernacle Chorus put on two concerts at
which they charged for emitting.  Normally there is no charge for these
performances but for these two and admission was charged.  At the end of the
second performance a check, for the total ticket sale, of $75,000 was written
to the Mayor of Quincy.  President Hinckley, when presenting the check to the
Mayor, said that when the Saints were driven from Independence Missouri in the
depth of winter, with no place to go, it was the good people of Quincy that
took them in.  For several months’ homes, food and jobs was shared with over
1200 suffering Saints.   He further explained; that the Church had never had an
opportunity to thank those early citations of Quincy for their help and
kindness.  We there for presented this check as a token of gratitude and
sincere thanks, for you to use as you feel would be most appropriate for the
community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When we came
to Parley Street it was explained to us, that this street was referred to as
“The Trail of Tears” and later changed to “The Trail of Hope”.  Also when we
passed David Moore’s home on 20 acres of farm land, we were told that at the
time the Saints were being driven out of their homes, David was offered $15.00
for nice brick home, farm, fruit trees and a brick shop.  With such an insult,
David just walked out of his home, locked the door and never looked back.  I
asked a question, at the Land and Records Office when we were there, as to who
the deed for these property’s belong to being that the Saints were never paid
for them.  It was explained that the Saints did not pay the property taxes
after leaving and so the deeds were legally sold for those taxes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After the
wagon ride ended we went back to the Visitor Center and saw the displays of
sculptures by Amanda Johnson.  We were told that Amanda Johnson was an operetta
singer that lost her voice because of a disease.  While recovering she took up
sculpturing on her kitchen table.  Her works are remarkable with such talent. 
We also went through a garden of sculptures called “A tribute to women”, mainly
sculptured by Dennis Smith.  They too were beautifully done with great talent. 
We went down town and got something to eat for lunch.  I then took a nap in the
car while Mae walked around.  We went to the Nauvoo Temple and did a session. 
Mae and I were asked to be the session witnesses.  That was an exciting and
enjoyable experience.  I met a brother that worked at the Temple and visited
with him for a few minutes.  Mae came looking for me and while doing so she got
to see the Baptistery.  We asked and she was able to take me to see it also.  We
also saw the saber that was owned by Joseph Smith and other artifacts related
to the original Nauvoo Temple. One of the beautiful areas of the Temple
construction was the spiral stair cases.  They are very similar to the ones in
the Manti Temple.   It was a great experience.  The Temple wasn’t very busy
today and that is one of the reasons that we got the extra privileges today. 
Outside the Temple we took several pictures.  We got some dinner and then went
back to the Cultural Hall for the evening show.  It was 10:30PM when we got
back to our motel.  I entered this entry before we went to bed.  It’s been a
wonderful day.</span></p>
