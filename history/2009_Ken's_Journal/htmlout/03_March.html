<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
about 7AM but I slept a little longer.  Even though it is Fast Sunday and we
didn’t have to prepare breakfast, time went fast and it was soon time for
Church.  Meetings we very good but Mae’s back got to hurting her until she went
home for a little while.  She came back for Sacrament meeting.  At 3PM Mae and
I went over for interviews with Bishop Smith to renew our Temple Recommends.  I
also stayed after and visited with Bishop Smith about my concerns with David and
Jeff.  I appreciate visiting with Bishop Smith and consider him to be a very
good friend.  Mae and I stopped at Irven and Sandy’s for a few minutes to wish
Irven a Happy Birthday.  We then went to Scott and Mishelle’s for a very nice
dinner and to visit for a little while.  It was fun to play with and hold the
twins.  Scott and Mike connected with a new computer system that lets you talk
and see those your are calling on the computer.  It also allows you to have
conference calls of up to 24 peoples.  It was really amazing to me to remember
when we first started playing music on the computer by placing a transistor
radio on the main memory box and running the program of electronic notes.  Who!
How things have progressed.  I then wonder how anyone can question the ability
of God to know all things.  When we got home I went out and checked the rabbits
and then came in and caught my journal up to date.  it is very easy to get
behind.  Good night as it is now after 10PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at 7AM
but still didn’t get away to go fishing until 10AM and got to East Canon
Reservoir at 11AM.  Just before leaving home Roberta called from the bus shop
and told me that one bus was canceled on tomorrows field trip and that put me
out.  She apologized and said she would try to find me something else.  I was
relieved that she didn’t want me to make a run today.  We didn’t have any luck
and only 2 or 3 nibbles.  We gave up and left shortly after 3PM.  We had to
hurry to get to Bryce and Deanna’s by 5:30PM.  Georgia and Rick were a little
later getting there and then Kim and Jeanenne came along with Mysha and
Koleese.  We ate dinner and then played games and visited.  It was after 9PM
when we left and came home.  I filled in my journal before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got a call
to make a bus run.  The runs went well with the help of an assistant.  This
afternoon I went in early enough to wash the bus but the washer wasn’t working
right and I had to go through twice.  Mae picked up 40 lbs of chicken breast,
20 lb of it we had ground and the rest we kept whole.  After I got home we went
over and got our income tax papers from Mr. Sorenson.  We ran a few stops for
Mae and then went to the Family History Center.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had a field
trip today that went very well.  The driver that is substituted for yesterday
complained to Mishelle about her bus.  I stopped and talked to Mishelle and
explained my side and she said forget it.  Whoever I didn’t forget it and as I
was leaving the compound after my field trip, I saw the bus parking that I
drove yesterday.  I stopped and talked to the driver and she somewhat
apologized, but I felt better at talking with her.  Mae has been very busy
today with feeding the rabbits, walking, made some calls, mailed our tax
papers, cut Bob’s hair, packaged the chicken and had dinner ready for me.  We
went over to the Stake Presidency’s office and got our Temple Recommends
signed.  We then went to the store and sent Roger $100 and bought some food storage. 
I decided that sending Roger $100 is better than giving $100 to these groups
that are fighting all the many government wrong decisions.  It is like having a
glass of water and having to decide if you give it to a person that is thirsty
or throwing it on an out of control hotel fire.  When we got home I entered my
journal entry, Mae e-mailed Roger to let him know that we had sent the money. 
We then went to bed and watched a movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
several times during the night because of my mask and also it was hot
downstairs.  I finally got up at 4AM and went upstairs to see why the furnace
was running all night.  I found that Bob, Carroll and Mark all had their doors
open and also a window in their rooms open but the main problem was that the
front door was standing wide open.  I shut the door as the upstairs was very
cold and the furnace was trying to warm it up.  Meanwhile our apartment
thermostat showed the temperature way over 80 degrees.   I guess that when Mark
came home he hadn’t shut the door tight and the wind blow it open.  I opened
our door to the stair well and that let heat from our apartment go up and warm
the upstairs quicker and cool our apartment.  After I got things cooler I was
able to go back to sleep.  We got back up at 7AM.  After breakfast Mae gave me
a hair cut.  I then took care of the rabbits and worked on the chicken coop. 
Mae went for a walk and then worked on her Primary sharing time.  She kept busy
all day.  I think it would have been the best thing to do if we would tear the
shed completely down and started over.  I think of my Grandmother’s saying,
“Poor people have poor ways.”  I guess that fits me so I will do the best I
can.  I quite in time to put things away, take a shower and a nap before we
went to the Ogden Temple.  This was in preparation for our Ward Conference the
end of this month.  It was a good evening but we didn’t have very many from our
Ward.  When we got home I worked on my journal while Mae worked on the pictures
of each home we have lived on.  She didn’t know the address of our home in
Taylorville so I went through my journal for 1975, and found the several dates
pertaining to the move but not the address.  We then got on Google Map and in a
few minutes found the address.  Mae then looked up information about a Family
History Seminar that is being held this coming Saturday that we will try to
attend.  It’s time to go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got a call
at 5:30AM to drive bus.  Mae got up with me to help get me off.  The run went
well this morning.  I came home and fed the rabbits.  Mae went to eat lunch
with Georgia.  After that she stopped at Penny’s and returned the slacks she
had bought for me.  She also took the projector back to Irven and Sandy.  I
went over to Dr. Francis and got a letter stating that my sleep apnea is under
control and he sees no need for farther test at this time.  I then took the
letter and went back to Work Med.  the Dr. on duty said he would not sign the
medical card unless he completely redid the examination.  I will come back next
Thursday when the other Doctor is on duty.  When I got home I just had time to
get some lunch and go back for the afternoon run.  We had a boy get out of
control just as we were leaving the bus loop.  When he wouldn’t calm down I
pulled the bus over and called in to the dispatch.  Before we got things
settled to take him back to the school he tried to open the door to get off the
bus.  I stopped him from opening the door so he ran to the back of the bus and
jumped out the emergency door.  After I talked to dispatch and the assistant
called the school, dispatch told me to continue the rout with the remainder of
the children.  We also had one boy kick another and that caused the second boy
to slug the first.  By the time I parked the bus and then had to sign the
Incident Reports for the assistant, I was late getting home.  Mae had gotten
home by the time I got there.  Bob went with us to Sam’s Club where we bought a
gazebo for Sandi.  Mae and I took it out to Sandi’s and unloaded it and then
went on to American Fork.  We had to stop for natural gas in Woods Cross. 
Sandi had called the 1<sup>st</sup> counselor in her Bishopric and asked for
help unloading the gazebo.  He told her to find someone else as he would rather
not help.  She called a non-member and he got two other friends to come with
him and they helped me unload the gazebo.  It only took us about 10 minutes. 
After they left we couldn’t find Sandi’s dog for several minutes.  I drove as
fast as I dared but we were ½ hour late getting to the Coral and Band Concert
at the American Fork Junior High School.  Tayler Page was singing in the coral
so we had wanted to support her in it.  We got there in time to hear the last
four numbers.  The coral and band did an excellent job, sounding better than
most High School groups.  We went over to Mike and Becky’s after to visit for a
few minutes.  We had to stop again for natural gas on the way home.  by the
time we got home it was mid-night.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM and Mae got up at 5:30AM so we could go to Bountiful High School to attend
a Family History Conference.  We were tired but stayed all day to try to learn
more about our calling as Family History Consultants.  After the conference was
over we went out to eat a Chuck-A-Rama.  After getting home we played a game of
Canasta with Bob and Carroll.  Bob and I won tonight.  I cut up a banana squash
for Mae this evening.  Mae prepared a tossed salad for tomorrow and got the
table set, while I was catching my journal up to date.  We then moved the
clocks ahead for Day Light Saving Time, before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5AM so that we could go to Salt Lake to pick Jeff up at the airport.  Jeff lay
down and took a nap, which he really needed.  Mae and I went to our Sacrament
meeting.  The High Councilman in his talk told of the need for Fasting and
Prayer and how he received answer to how to help his son that had gone
inactive.  That is a little hard to understand for we have fasted and prayed
many times for Jeff, Davie and Shauna but have not received answers yet.  Mike,
Becky and the family came up for dinner.  Mae cooked a nice diner and I helped
her by grilling chicken.  After dinner we played games.  I showed Mike and
Becky the stove of Bob’s and after talking to Bob, they decided to buy it.  We
took it out and put it in Mike pickup.  Before they left for home, Mike used a
tie down strap and put around it.  It was a little low on the stove but I
thought it would be ok.  They hadn’t been gone very long when Mike called and
said that the stove blow over and broke.  He was quite upset of course but I
tried to calm him down and I think he can replace the oven door for not too
much.  I really feel bad that I hadn’t happened given him another strap to go
over the top.  I know Mike will be upset for some time over this.  Mae, Jeff
and I played a game of Rummy.  Jeff won the game.  I filled out my journal
while Mae and Jeff visited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:15AM and Jeff got up at 6:35AM.  Before Mae woke I got on the computer and
made my bids for next week.  Mae got up at 8:30AM and reminded me that she will
have her teeth extracted next Monday so I had to get back on the computer and
cancel all bids on Monday and Tuesday so I can help Mae out.  David brought
Conner for Mae to tend today.  After breakfast I fed the rabbits and then bent
some sheet metal to fit in front of two feeders in the rabbit pens.  The
rabbits are digging the pellets out and when they drop they go through the
floor screen and are wasted.  I hope these pans will catch the pellets and give
the rabbits a chance to eat them.  I next started work on the chicken coop but
then Bob had me come in so I could talk to a service man on the furnace.  When
that was over I went back to work on the coop.  Mae then called for lunch, so
after eating I took a short nap.  Bob came out and help me on the coop after
lunch.  We worked until after 6PM and got the coop built, including installing
a window in it.  Jeff was here for dinner and after dinner the three of us
played games.  After 9:30PM I quite and filled out my journal entry, while Mae
and Jeff played a game of Rummy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
3:15AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  Mae was not in bed so I went to the
front room and found her asleep in the recliner.  After reading my scriptures
and saying prayers Mae came in.  We cuddled up in our bed and went back to
sleep.  We didn’t get up until 11AM.  I fed the rabbits and prepared some
breakfast for us.  Mishelle called and said that they have found a area in the
basement where water is coming from somewhere.  I took my tool trailer and Mae
went with me over to Scotts.  I found that a drain pipe had broken at a 20
degree angle.  I removed it and went to Durk’s and bought some parts and
repaired it.  I did spend a few minutes talking to Kip outside.  We are still
planning on going ice fishing a week from Saturday.  We will probably go to
Strawberry Reservoir.  I finished with the repairs and we got home about
4:30PM.  Mae fixed some dinner before we went to the Family History Center.  I
started trying to find some information on my Great Grandfather Alexander Hill,
so I got on the old Family Search and after a few tries found several
generations in the Hill line.  I then did the same thing except used my Grand
Mother Zina Crandall and again found several generations of information.  I was
quite excited at what I found tonight but I have a lot of duplications to go
through.  We stopped at Macy’s for some flour that is on sale and ended up
buying $154 worth of groceries.  After carrying in groceries I finished my
journal entry.  I sure love my sweet wife.  She is sure a special woman to put
up with me!  Most nights I will play a game of solitary before I shut my
computer down. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had a field
trip that I drove today and that took most of the day.  I took children from
Doxey Elementary school in Sunset to the Youth Achievement Center in the Gate
Way Mall.  On the forth floor they have a model city with the city building,
various stores, banks and eating place.  The youth are taken in and run the
businesses filling various positions.  We were told by the teacher’s that they
had been preparing for this activity for several days, having a Mayor elected
and applying for and interviewing for the various positions.  It was fun to
watch the students, who were 6<sup>th</sup> grade children, fill these
positions.  At noon I went out to the bus and ate my lunch, read the First
Presidency message in the Ensign and took a nap.   The children were sure
excited and noisy as we went back to school.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Jeff, Gail,
Benji and Rachael were here when I got home.  After dinner we played games for
a while.  Bob and I went Home Teaching to Casey’s and Fallis’s.  Patriarch
Johnston isn’t feeling well enough to have visitors yet.  When I returned home
we watched a movie on Comcast before going to bed.</span></p>

this morning.  Bob and I worked on the chicken coop today.  this afternoon I
went over to the Workmed office and was able to get my new health card for
driving school bus.  I then went to Home Depot and purchased more material for
the chicken run.  From there I went to Green’s Farm and Feed and purchased the
chicken wire, feed for the chicks and more rabbit pellets.  I unloaded the
materials and feed before coming in for the evening.  After dinner I entered yesterday’s
journal entry and started this entry.  Jeff figured his Income Tax refunds and
got them printed and sent in.  We then started a game of Rummy but on the
second hand Jeff was a -150 so he said that we had better quite this game.  He
got my projector out to see why it is cutting of the right side of the screen
and found that it is my computer not the projector.  I got on the inter-net and
searched next weeks awarded trips and found that I have three trips.  I
finished this journal entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast I took care of the rabbits and then started on the chicken coop. 
Scott called and asked me if I wanted the computer desk back.  I told him that
I did but there was no place to put it in the house.  I also talked to him
about use getting another lap top computer to do Family History.  I asked him
about using the inter-net at others homes.  He told me that I could get a
service through our mobile phone co. that allowed inter-net service any where I
got phone service.  I got a call from the bus shop to inform me that the school
wanted to change the return time and the destination of their field trip
today.  I told them that it was ok with me.  Mae wanted me to pickup the
materials for canning some of our storage so I had to leave early to have time
for that.  After going to the cannery I went to the bus compound.  I got my bus
assignment and while doing the bus check I found that I had a flat tire on the
right rear inside tire.  I took it to the shop and they told me that I would
have to get another bus.  When I went into dispatch she said that they didn’t
have any other busses as they were all assigned out.  The shop hurried and
installed another tire and I got on my way.  The trip went well and I returned
at 5PM with the youth but the bus had been left with less than ½ tank of fuel
so I had to refuel when I got to the compound.  The bus was also a mess so I had
time to sweep it before loading the children.  Mae had dinner about ready when
I got home.  I checked the rabbits before we ate dinner.  Mae and I went for a
walk and as we walked Mae practiced her stories from the Children Friend, which
she will have to give this Sunday.  We watched a movie on DVD before going to
bed.</span></p>

before 8AM and had breakfast of sautéed vegetables and scrambled eggs.  I then
took care of the rabbits.  I switched some of the black kits with the new white
doe.  My next project was to make a hanging rack for Mae’s frying pans.  The
rest of the day Bob and I spent on the chicken coop.  We got most of the
electrical installed.  I took Mae out to eat this evening to Sizzlers.  I made
this entry and then we watched a movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Our daughter

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept most
of the night in the recliner as my stomach hurt and felt swollen just above the
navel.  Setting in the recliner seemed to relieve the pain.  I was able to sleep
until early morning and then I crawled into bed.  Mae woke about 7AM but I went
back to sleep.  She woke me at 9:30AM to get ready for Church.  That put stress
on me as I needed to get ready, take care of the rabbits and eat some
breakfast.  As we were leaving I asked Mae not to let me sleep in like that and
I felt that Mae took offence to it that she had been trying to be nice to me
and let me sleep longer.  She is very good to me so I guess I was out of line
to say anything.  Mae fasted today as she has her Primary responsibility to do
today.  I felt unprepared for Priesthood as I hadn’t read the lesson nor had I
remembered to take the Priesthood Manual.  After Priesthood I visited with
Brother Glen Higley about our Family History calling and our thoughts of
getting a new lap-top computer with inter-net on it so we can go into the homes
of the members to encourage them with their own Family History.  I missed
Sunday School class because of the visit.  After Sacrament meeting I stayed for
the Ward Choir practice as the Bishopric asked for more participants in the
choir from the Priesthood.   Mark had also stayed for the practice so I road
home with him.  As we got home we talked about the parking problem he is
having.  When I came in I mentioned some ideas about changes in the driveway
and Mae answered that we couldn’t afford to put out more money and more work on
me.  Bob invited us for dinner and had a great meal.  After dinner I took a
nap.  I wanted work on my journal information but Mae was on the Desk Top
computer and had several e-mails that she listened to or read to me, which
emotionally upset me.  I called Scott and he helped me store a copy of a sleep
form that I need to have filled out yearly in order for me to get my Health
Card that I need in order to be a school bus driver.  I took care of the
rabbits this evening before we had a light super.  Bob came downstairs and help
me administer to Mae prior to her going in to have her teeth removed tomorrow. 
Mark came down and we talked about the garden, using rabbit and chicken manure
for fertilizer on the garden and the possibility of growing yams in our
garden.  I got on the inter-net and looked up the manure and found that it
should have three weeks after applying to garden before planting or hold it in
a compost pile.  As to the yam we found that they are grown in a tropical
area.  I got on the inter-net and bid for field trip runs for the week of March
23<sup>rd</sup> through the 27<sup>th</sup>.  I also entered my time for
payroll.  I then finished this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was about
7:30AM when we got up.  We had breakfast and I fed the rabbits.  The white doe
still hasn’t had kits so I put her back in with the buck and he bread.  Mae and
I went over to Dr. Gray D.D.S. at 10AM and he extracted Mae’s upper teeth and
put in dentures.  We got home about 11:30AM.  Mae rested the rest of the day
and I tried to take care of her.  She has kept ice packs on through out the day
but there is still quite a lot of swelling.  I had Bob help me and we did get
temporary electricity to the chicken coop.  I think we are ready to get the
chicks tomorrow.  Jeff came over this evening to spend the night.  He brought
Mae a large bouquet of flowers from all the children.  Shellie had called
earlier to see how Mae is doing.  Irven and Sandy also called to see how she is
doing.  Jeff and I played a game of chess this evening.  I got him in a bad way
so he gave up and went to bed.  I put Mae to bed about 9:30PM after she watched
a show on Hallmark.  I stayed up and tried to find a address in Liberty, Utah
on the Google map and also on my GPS but could not find it ether way.  I
entered this entry and made some whey for Jeff to have for breakfast.  I then
played a game on the computer before shutting it off and going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Neither Mae
nor I slept the best last night.  Jeff got up and left for work.  I got up and
prepared some breakfast and then we had to hurry to get to Dr. Gray’s for Mae’s
check up.  He adjusted the dentures some but felt very pleased with the way
things are going.  Bob fed the rabbits for me this morning.  When I got home I
worked on the chicken coop and had it ready for the chicks.  I went over to get
the chicks and found that it isn’t until the 27<sup>th</sup> of this month that
they will arrive.  I came home and worked on the rotor-tiller.  Bob came out
and helped me and we got the motor mounted, but it lets the pulley slide in
about ¼” to far.  We will have to remove the motor to make the necessary
changes.  I had to quit and eat and then got to the Family History Center.  I
was able to find more information on Grandma and Grandpa’s family, so I felt
good about that.  I filled in my journal entry when I got home and then went to
bed as I have a early bus run in the morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:30AM to fill a field trip.  I went up to the Environmental Center in Liberty,
getting there before 8AM, to bring 54 students and advisors back to
Clearfield.  They had gone up on Tuesday and stayed over night.  The trip went
well although I drove bus 352 which has a broken speed-o-meter in it.  After
returning I scheduled the bus for service and repairs.  I also entered my time
for payroll, printed my awarded field trip for next week and bid on the next
weeks field trips.  When I got home I took care of the rabbits.  Scott and Jeff
came for lunch and Mae had it ready for them, despite her discomfort with her
teeth.  After lunch I bought some shims and remounted the motor on the
rotor-tiller.  Mark and I then tried the tiller out and also put the rabbit
manure on the garden and tilled it in.  I was sure tired when I came in.  I got
Mae and I something to eat and we watched a couple of shows on the Hall Mark
channel before going to sleep.  Brother Thurman called and ask if Mae and I
would speak in Sacrament meeting Sunday.  I explained that Mae had not
recovered from having her teeth removed, so he excused her but asked if I would
speak.  Of course I said that I would, but I think I dreamt about it all night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep to well and at 5AM I found her in the recliner.  I slept until 7AM and
then got up and wrote down some thoughts for my talk Sunday.  I cooked
breakfast for the two of us and then took care of the rabbits.  I worked
outside cleaning up the trash and getting the area ready where we will put the
chicken run.  Sister Johnston called Mae and she has a nice pot of home made
soup for us.  I went over and got it as Patriarch Johnston doesn’t feel well
enough to drive yet.  They are sure sweet people.  I did take a short nap after
lunch and before my field trip.  The field trip went well although my bus was
in the shop when I got there.  I took Syracuse High School Soccer Teams to
Weber High.  Weber won both Varsity and Jr. Varsity teams.  It was after 8PM
when I got home.  Mae was on the computer answering E-Mails.  She read me
Garrett’s and Shellie’s letters.  We then got ready for bed and put on the
movie “Hello Dolly”.  We only watched the first half and then went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep very well so when I got up she had gone to sleep in the other bedroom, so
I let her sleep longer.  I read my scriptures and did a little work on my talk
before she woke up.  Irven, Sandy and Mark came over this morning so I went
outside and took care of the rabbits and helped them for a while.  I had a
field trip this afternoon so I went to the bus compound at 12:20PM to get my
bus checked out.  Everything was ok with the bus so I got away early.  I was ½
hour early getting to Davis High School and the baseball team was 45 minutes
late getting ready to leave.  I took them to West High School in Salt Lake for
their games.  The Varsity team finished at 6:30 PM and then the Jr. Varsity
played their game.  While I waited for the teams to finish I did some reading,
called Roy and visited with him for a few minutes, ate my lunch and rested.  I
did watch some of the games.  Davis won both the varsity and the J.V. games.  The
playing field did not have lights so they had to quite when it got dark.  I
didn’t finish until 8:50PM and then I had to get fuel in my pickup.  Mae had
gone shopping at Kohls and didn’t get home until after I did.  I got my clothes
for in the morning, fed the rabbits and had just came in when Mae got home. 
While I entered my journal Mae got food ready for me for tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
3AM to go fishing.  I realized the my fishing license had expired on the 19<sup>th,</sup>
so I left early to go to Winegars but they didn’t open until 6AM.  I checked
with Maverick but they don’t sell them.  I went to Wal-Mart but their computer
was still down.  I went over to and got Kip and Dalan and took a chance on
being able to buy fishing licenses in Heber City.  Kip had invited a friend
that he worked with to join us at the reservoir and he also brought his
son-in-law.  Kip had asked me if it was ok before he invited them.  We met at
the Ladders at Strawberry reservoir.  We drilled several holes but didn’t find anything
with the fish-finder.  We talked to two other fisherman and they said that last
week they had caught 15 fish in that area last Saturday.  We moved a second
time and did get some fish showing on the finder.  I help the other two
fellow’s move, as they had a hand auger.  I drilled them two new holes with my
power augur.  About 11:30AM I finally hooked a nice fish.  When we got him out
it was a cut-throat and fell in the slot limit.  He was 17 to 18” long so we
took pictures and let him go.  We fished until after moon and gave up and came
back home.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae had gone
up to David’s who had invited all the family to come up there for breakfast of
biscuits and gravy.  Shellie and her boys are up for a few days so they were
there, and the boys and family’s came.  I had already had the fishing trip scheduled
some time before those plans were made so I didn’t go with them.  Gail &amp;
the children didn’t come up, although she had been invited.  Sandi and Nick had
a photo shoot to take care of today so they were not there.  Shellie and the
boys came back to our place to stay this evening and Sunday.  They will go home
on Monday.  Mae had dinner about ready when I came home.  we decided to watch a
DVD so we popped some corn and all went into our bedroom to watch the movie. 
Even though it was a good movie, I fell asleep.  They decided that as much as
it was a long show and I was asleep to turn it off and every one went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up
early and read my scriptures, said my prayers and took a shower.  I took care
of my rabbits and while the family had breakfast I fasted.  I attended meetings
but the rest only came to Sacrament meeting.  My talk seemed to go fairly well
but I did go a little over.  I stayed for Ward Choir practice.  After that I
went home and had a little to eat and then came back and helped set up chairs
for the closed broadcast of the Draper Temple Dedication.  I got back home just
as the  rest was setting down for dinner so I joined them and ate a little
more.  I would like to have attended the service but Shellie and the kids
couldn’t go so we felt that we should stay with them.  We played some games for
a while and then I started on my journal as Shellie got the boys to bed.  She
and Mom got talking about some of Shellie’s personal problems and I couldn’t
help lessoning in.  that conversation extended into 2AM and included a
Priesthood Blessing.  We went to bed very concerned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
7AM and prepared breakfast for Shellie and the boys.  Shellie didn’t eat but
packed and put things away.  Quint said that he would like three fried eggs and
only ate two of them.  Kevis had one slice of French toast and Jase had a small
bowl of cold cereal.  Mae had made quite a few French Toasts so I took them upstairs
for Mark to eat.  Shellie and the boys got away about 9AM.  I has helping Mae
with the dishes when David came with Conner.  I took care of the rabbits and
then started working on the storage shed.  I rebuilt the door framing and
installed the door from Rick and Georgia’s shed that was torn down.  Bob did
help me by picking some materials up and gave me a hand with the door.  Jeff,
Gail and the children came over for dinner.  After dinner I called and visited
with Roy.  I was hesitant to call him but felt that I needed to.  At first I
felt that Roy was resentful that I called but after visiting for a few minutes
things worked out.  We visited for a while and then concluded the call.  Roy
called back in a few minutes and we discussed other items that he had concerns
about and I do feel that Shellie defiantly has a different version than Roy.  I
counseled Roy that they needed to communicate and suggested that they might
make notes as to their decisions and keep them in a note book.  Jeff, Mae and I
played a game of Rummy and then I filled out my journal entry before going to
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early so that we could take Jeff to the Salt Lake Airport by 5AM.  After
returning home Mae and I went back to bed for a while.  Mae had a dental
appointment at 10:20AM and then went to the Chiropractor for a treatment.  She
then went shopping for a while and picked up some rabbit pellets for me.  Bob
and I worked on the storage shed, getting the siding started.  When Mae got
home she fixed some lunch.  I took a nap and then Bob and I worked more on the
shed.  Mae and I went to the Family History Center this evening.  I called
Jackie and asked her for family information on Uncle Lee and Aunt Welma’s
family.  She and Phil are flying to Texas tomorrow for a short trip and she
will try to get the info for me when she returns.  I was able to find more
information on Uncle Myron and Aunt Lila.  On the way home we stopped at a
Maverick and bought each of us a frozen yogurt.  We then went to Pace’s
drive-in and bought us some fish fries and French fries.  We really blow our
diet tonight.  We watched the movie “The Coal Miner’s Daughter” on Comcast,
before going to bed.  Mae is sure a neat wife and sweetheart!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up
three times during the night so we didn’t get up until almost 8AM.  It rained
and snowed during the night.  I took care of the rabbits and figured the
materials I need to finish the siding on the storage shed.  Bob help Mae
prepare food for lunch today as we are having Scott come over.  I went to the
bus compound to take a field trip but as I got on the bus Roberta called to
inform me that the trip was just now canceled.  I will still get 1 hour pay
anyway.  I went to West Ogden to get the additional siding that I need to
finish the storage shed but the suppliers in that area are closed up.  I did go
to Roofers Supply and bought shingles for the shed.  I came home and tried to
find a siding distributor in the area but was unable.  I took time to check on
the rabbits and found that the new doe had had one kit and it was dead.  I went
to The Home Depot and ordered some siding.  Prices of everything are up.  I
hope that the shed is worth the money we are spending on it.  Mae called me on
my cel phone just as I pulled into the driveway.  She had super ready and we
had the Ward Missionary’s coming at 7:30PM.  After they left we read a article
about missionary work and then we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8AM before getting started.  I was going to kill rabbits but it was to
cold out there for that.  I did start on the installation of the power lines to
the chicken coop.  Bob help me and as I started digging from the shed to the
fence, he went to the rental and got a sod cutter.  We cut the sod from the
fence to the house.  Bob turned the sod over and to the side while I cut it
into smaller sections.  When I had taken care of the rabbits this morning, I
had left the one door unlatched.  I saw one of the rabbits running loose and
when I tried to catch it, it disappeared from my sight.  Later I saw it out
again so I got Mae and Mark to come out to help me catch it.  As we tried to
get close to it, it again disappeared.  This time I looked in a old litter box
that I had left out by the hutches and that is where he was hiding.  Mark
helped me and we started pulling the wire into the conduit.  We quite work for
supper.  Mae and I then got ready for our Home Teachers visit this evening. 
Brother Thompson visited with Bob, Carroll, Mae and I for a while.  Mark had to
be gone this evening.  After our Home Teachers visit we came downstairs and I
made this journal entry.  Mae got on the Internet and read a very disturbing
report on the MAIC, Missouri Information Analysis Center, that focuses on the
so-called on the militia movement and conflates it to the supporters of Ron
Paul, Chuck Baldwin and Bob Barr.  That means that Mae and I at classed as
DANGEROUS MILITIA INFLUENCED TERRORIOUS.  How about that?</span></p>

up until almost 8AM.  While Mae prepared breakfast I fed the rabbits.  As soon
as I finished breakfast I started on the electrical for the chicken coop.  Bob
came out and helped me.  When I didn’t have him helping with the pulling of the
electrical wires he worked on siding the storage shed.  We were able to get the
wiring pulled from the coop electrical panel to the house.  We quite for lunch
and then I took a 20 minute nap.  Mae went with me and we went over to Dallas
Green’s Farm and Feed and got our chicks.  As we were buying them and other
materials a couple came in the store.  When they saw us buying the chicks and
supplies they made the comment that we were getting into the chicken and they
were trying to get out of the chickens.  We ended up going to their place and
they gave us 4 laying hens and some equipment.  Bob and I had to do some
changing to accommodate the hens.  Mae came out and helped us.  Mark came out
also and started filling the trench for the electrical line back in.  It was
7PM before came into the house.  Mae had gone Visiting Teaching so I turned the
TV on and watched a show while I ate my dinner.  Mae got home and watched the
rest of the show with me.  After the show I went out and checked the chickens
and the rabbits.  I then entered this journal entry before we went to bed about
10:30PM.</span></p>

6:30 AM to get started.  I fed the chickens and rabbits while Mae prepared
breakfast.  I got Bob started on siding the storage shed and I went over to
help a couple of Sisters that are moving out of our Ward.  There was quite a
lot of help that showed up and it took about 3 hours to get them moved over to
the Twin Tree apartments in Layton.  I then worked on the electrical for the
coop.  Mark worked on filling the trench back in for me.  Bob, Carroll, Mae and
I went to Kyle Browning and JaNae Hansen’s wedding reception in Orem.  Bob
drove and scarred us a couple of times.  They were married in the Washington DC
Temple, but because they are living and going to school at BYU they also had a
reception here.  Kyle is the son of Dale, Rich and Lois’s youngest son who
lives in Alaska.  The reception was from 1PM to 3PM and we got there at
2:30PM.  We did get to see Rich, Lois, Elise and Janet before they left.  When
we got home we changed clothes and I got back to work on the electrical.  I was
able to get the power on, but am not sure I am getting the voltage I should
have out there.  I cleaned up and took Mae out to eat at the Golden Corral.  We
enjoyed some very good food.  When we got home I entered this journal entry
before we showered and went to bed.  </span></p>

3:30AM with my cpap whistling and loosing air.  I then set up in the recliner
and slept some until morning.  My mind kept thinking about the electrical that
we pulled to the shed.  I fed the rabbits and the chickens while Mae prepared
breakfast.  When I went out side the wind was blowing hard and before long it
was snowing hard.  At 10AM I went to choir practice.  I came home in time to
get Mae and got to meetings.  Bob prepared dinner for us when we got home from
Church.  We had planned on going out to see Sandi and Nick this afternoon but
with the bad weather we stayed home.  I called and visited with Sandi and she
was in agreement with our decision.  I called Brother Haycock about the
electrical problem and he said that we needed to pull a ground and a natural
wire from the house panel to the shed panel in order for it to meet code and
for it to work properly.  While Mae took a nap I filled some capsules with our
Mannatech product.  I went outside and checked the rabbits and chickens and we
had four more eggs today.  This evening we went upstairs and played Canasta
with Bob and Carroll.  Mae and Carroll won again tonight.  It was a close game
tonight.  I filled out my journal while Mae got ready for bed.  We both played
a game of Solitary on the computers before going to bed.</span></p>

went over to the bus compound and printed my trip sheets for this week.  I took
one water tank back as it leaks and exchanged it for rabbit pellets.  I stopped
at the pallet shop on 1000 West and got some saw dust to put in the nest and
coop floor.  It was late when I came in and after eating I turned on a show on
Hall Mark and Mae watched a information show on BYU.</span></p>

took quite a while finding what I wanted.  I was late getting home so we were
late getting to the Family History Center.  I did get more information of

unloaded the pickup so that it is ready to go in the morning.  I filled in my
