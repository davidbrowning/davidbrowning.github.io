<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM to get ready for a field trip.  I had time to feed the rabbits, chickens
and chicks.  I took the band members from Fairfield Jr. High to Utah State
University in Logan.  The trip went well but the group was longer eating than
was planned so we were 30 minutes later leaving for home.  I got to the school
at 3:15 PM and finished the trip at 4 PM.  We had something to eat and then
drove out to Sandi and Nick’s.  I looked at the assembly instructions for the Gazebo. 
We also looked at the master bedroom shower, as it is leaking and causing
mildew.  We stayed over night so before going to bed we played a game of
marbles and as normal Mae and Sandi won.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
several times thinking of how to put the gazebo together and also tried to
think of what can be done with the shower.  I got up just before Sandi left for
work and talked to her about some ideas.  Mas fixed us some breakfast while I
shaved and made our bed.  After eating breakfast we came on home.  I stopped
and got gas in the car and took the car through a car wash.  When I got home I
worked on the electrical for the chicken coop.  I had to go to The Home Depot
and exchange the electrical breakers that I had bought the other day.  I was
sure they were wrong when the fellow in the electrical department gave them to
me.  I told him that I didn’t think they were right but he insisted they were
correct.  I got the 110v circuit working but will wait until later to install
the 220v circuit.  I came in for lunch and after eating took a nap.  I got a
call from the School Bus dispatch and asked if I could take a PM route?  I did
and then as I finished that Roberta called me and ask if I could take an
additional route tomorrow when I get back form the field trip.  That will make
it a big day tomorrow.  I worked outside from 5PM until after 8PM getting a
roust about built for the chickens.  Bob came out and helped me.  It rained
quite hard on us.  Mae had a nice dinner ready when I came in.  After eating I
entered my journal and took a shower before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:35AM to get ready for a field trip.  I took Creekside Elementary to the
University of Utah.  When I returned and let the children off I took students
from Layton Jr. High home and then took a rout from Northridge High.  I was
tired when I finished up.  This evening we watched the movie “Funny Girl”
before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7AM and after eating breakfast I went out and worked on the chicken coop.  I
missed the first half of the morning session of General Conference because I
worked to long on the coop.  After the morning session we ate and then I went
back out and worked on the coop until the afternoon session.  Gail brought the
children over for Mae to tend while she attended baby shower for her sister. 
We took the children out to see the chickens, chicks and rabbits.  We did get
to watch the afternoon session of General Conference.  I finished the work on
the coop and helped Mark get started planting strawberry plants in the garden. 
I picked up Scott and we attended the Priesthood session of General
Conference.  After the session we went to Golden Corral and ate and visited. 
It was a nice evening and I sure enjoyed being with Scott.  I just wish that I
could have had more of my boys with me.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, April 05, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up
early so went into the front room and slept in the recliner so Mae wouldn’t get
disturbed.  I was up for a while thinking of Sandi’s project so I made a list
of some of the items I would need to take with us.  When I went back to sleep,
Mae woke me at 8:30AM.  I fixed us some breakfast and we finished eating just
before conference started.  While the opening song was sang I went out and fed
the rabbits and chickens.  Conference was sure good.  I am deeply impressed at
the lives and devotion of the members of the Quorum of the Twelve and the First
Presidency.  I wish that I could transmit my impressions to my children and
especially David and Jeff.  In between the morning session and the afternoon
session, Bob invited us up for dinner.  He cooks chicken especially for Mae and
I.  Just after the afternoon session started Scott and his family came to be
with us.  After another wonderful session of General Conference ended Mae had a
nice dinner ready.  Following dinner we took the children out to see the
rabbits, chickens and baby chicks.  Ashley and Kylan really enjoyed the baby
chicks and enjoyed holding them.  The twins are sure growing fast and we
enjoyed them also.  Mae and I took a walk in the park after Scott and his
family left for home.  Bob sent us down a couple of slices of apple pie that he
made especially for us with out any sugar in it.  He uses the Agave sweetener
that is all natural agave fruit sweetener.  Scott and Mishelle informed us that
Tina Linderman is getting married.  That is sure good news and we sure hope for
the best for her.  Mae called Tina this evening to let her know how happy we
are for her.  I had to make up some capsules so that Mae could get them ready
for next week.  We sure seem to go through them fast but time goes by fast
anymore.  Mae got things some what ready to go out to Sandi and Nick’s
tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and were ready to leave about 8AM.  We had to go to the Nut &amp; Bolt
Supply to get some anchor bolts and then to the gas station for natural gas for
the pickup.  It was close to noon when we got out to Sandi’s.  We went right to
work and got a lot of the gazebo assembled.  I backed the trailer with the
boxes of parts down to the patio pad but the dirt was quite wet and I got
stuck.  I put on the tire chains but still couldn’t pull the trailer back up. 
I decided to unhook the trailer and leave it where it was as it was close
enough to get the materials we needed.  The trailer rolled back when I
disconnected it and as I tried to control it I slipped and landed on my tail
bone which bruised it and made it hard to work with out pain.  Sandi and Mae
really helped me.  I assigned Mae as the supervisor and chief engineer on the
job.  She read the instructions and kept the right part numbers supplied to
us.  We quite after Nick got home form work and before he went to bed we played
a couple of games of marbles.  The first game Mae and Sandi won but I realized
that Sandi had not used a card that she could have used but had just discarded
a card and drew another.  Kidding, I told her that it had to be forfeiture. 
The second game Nick and I did win.  That is the first game in many that we
have won.  After Nick went to bed Mae, Sandi and I stayed up and watched a
video, “The Boy in Stripped Pajamas”.  It was a World War II movie and left you
with a sick feeling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got a good
start this morning and worked all day on the project.  We used an Extended Fork
Lift to lift the gazebo roof while we installed the eights legs.  It was after
4PM when we finished and left for home.  I took care of the animals while Mae
unpacked some things and took a shower.  I took a shower and we soon left for
the Family History Center.  We were a little late again this evening.  I worked
mainly on Grant Hill’s family and JaNae and Brad’s records.  I did get a phone
number for Jennie Lee Griggs, that is Uncle Grant’s daughter, but I tried to
call her but didn’t get an answer.  I caught two day of my journal entries up
this evening before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, April 08, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up and finishing breakfast.  I took care of the rabbits and chickens
and then went to town to get a meat cleaver.  Mae asked me to mail a package to
Jeff and I also stopped at Dee’s garage to check on the charges for inspecting
the car and getting it registered.  I bought the meat cleaver at Bed Bath and
Beyond.  Scott came for lunch with us today and we sure enjoy having him.  I
killed the five black rabbits this afternoon, cut them us and packaged them. 
They averaged 3.6 lb. apiece dressed weight.  Mae cooked one of the rabbits for
dinner this evening.  After dinner I took a nap and then went outside and
sorted the white kits out into the four pens, separating the bucks from the
does.  Bob and I went Home Teaching this evening.  We visited with the Casey’s
and then went to Sister Fallis’s.  Sister Fallis wasn’t home but her
daughter-in-law came out just as we got there and brought me the phone.  It was
Sister Fallis, telling me that she had gone to Park City with her Sister-in-law
and the windshield wipers quite working.  It is snowing very hard up there so
they are just going to stay the night there.  We had a nice visit with Sister
and Patriarch Johnston.  Sister Johnston fell last Sunday and really bruised
her face.  There were no bones broken, so she should be ok.  Mae was watching a
show when I got home so I watched the end with her.  We went to bed after I
made this entry.  Of course I had to play a game or two of Solitary before
turning the computer off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, April 09, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30 AM and read for a while.  It was cold and raining this morning.  After
breakfast I fed the rabbits and chickens.  I cleaned up and but away some of
the things that we had taken out of the shed before installing the power.  Mae
went to the dentist, and then took Kylan and Ashley to Dinosaur Park in Ogden
today.  She also did some other shopping while gone.  Bob and Carroll’s phones
are not working so I went upstairs and worked on them for a couple of hours. 
With the help of a Comcast technician on the phone, I found that some of the
lines are shorting out the equipment.  I was able to reroute four of their phones
and got them working, but had to turn off the phone in Bob’s room.  I then
worked on the storage shed trying to get the siding finished.  David, Shauna
and their children went to Zion’s Canyon for the week end.  They brought their
dog, Einstein, for us to tend while they are gone.  When Mae returned she
brought Kylan and Ashley here so they could color Easter Eggs.  Kylan and
Ashley also wanted to see and hold some of the chicks.  After they finished
with the eggs Mae took them home and then went up to see Georgia and take her
some flowers.  Georgia was operated on yesterday.  I quite about 8PM and came
in.  I watched part of a show on Hall Mart and then started the movie “Roster
Coburn” on Comcast.  Mae came home and watched the rest of the show with me.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, April 10, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up a
little after 7AM.  Mae was already up as the dog woke her at 5:30 AM.  When I
got up Mae went back to bed and slept a little longer.  One thing about tending
the dogs for our kids is that we realize more each time that we don’t want one
of our own.  I didn’t want to wake her by going into the bedroom for clothes so
I worked on the retyping of my diary from 1970 – 1974.  It was 10 AM before I
got outside to start working on the shed.  Bob helped me and we worked until 2
PM when we stopped for lunch.  I did take a 20 minute nap and then I went over
to the bus compound but everyone had taken today off.  We worked on the shed
again until 7PM and then Mae came out and helped Bob and I and we loaded Bob’s
pickup with all the trash and put things away.  It was after 8 PM when we quite
for the day.  After eating we were going to watch a show but was to tired so
just went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6AM and Mae got up a little later.  I took care of the chickens and rabbits
while Mae prepared breakfast.  We picked up Kylan and Ashley and took them with
us to Sandi’s.  The baby’s haven’t been feeling very good so Scott wasn’t sure
if they would make it out or not.  By taking Kylan and Ashley with us it
insured that they would be able to participate in the Easter egg hunt and it
gave Scott and Mishelle a little more time to get ready to come out if the
baby’s woke up ok.  We hid eggs outside shortly after getting there and then I
started preparations to cook Dutch oven chicken and rabbit.  Scott and Mishelle
did make it out with the twins.  JaNae and her family, Chelci and her family,
and several of Nick’s children came.  The food was good and Sandi and Nick had
made fun arrangements so that everyone had a good time.  Nick slipped a Easter
card into my back pocket and in it was $100 bill for the work I did on the
Gazebo.  I really didn’t want to except it but Sandi insisted.  On the way home
Mae and I stopped at Golden Corral for dinner and enjoyed that.  We got home
about 8PM.  I put things away and checked the chickens before coming in.  I
entered this journal entry and then we went to bed and watched a DVD movie “The
Shootist” with John Wayne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and then I took care of the rabbits and chickens.  I got on the computer and
typed some on my personal history.  Time went fast and it was soon time for
meetings.  I made an appointment with Brother Sylvester, our High Councilman,
so that he might explain to Mae and I our Family History calling.  We feel that
there has got to be more that we need to be doing than we are presently doing. 
Bob prepared dinner for us.  He fried one of the rabbits that I butchered last
Thursday.  It was sure good.  I came down stairs and took a nap after we ate. 
After waking up I called Jackie Winterowd to find out more Family History
information on her Mother and Dad’s family.  We had just begun when David and
Shauna and their children came.  They took their dog but left their children. 
David will be flying out in the morning to Orlando Florida for a company
meeting and will be back on Thursday.  Shanna has to work tomorrow so with us
keeping the children it will save them having to make a special trip to bring
them here tomorrow.  I told Jackie that I would call her back later.  I took
the children out with me to gather the eggs and feed the animals.  While Mae
prepared some thing for super I hid Easter Eggs for the children to find after
super.  They had fun finding the eggs.  I then got on the phone again with
Jackie and we visited for some time about Family History.  As Jackie was going
through some papers she had we found that Uncle Grant and Aunt Margery had a
baby boy that Jackie or I know nothing about.  Evidently their first baby died
but I will have to do more searching.  After hanging up with Jackie I went
upstairs to borrow a vacuum to blow up an air mattress for the children to
sleep on, and I talked to Irven, Bob and Mark and none of them knew anything
about the baby.  We called Kevis and wished him a Happy Birthday today.  I
filled in this journal and it was time to go to bed as I have a field trip to
take tomorrow.  Time goes by to fast with to much to do!!!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went into
the bus compound this morning and took a field trip to S.L.  Mae took Tyler,
Emily and Connor to Dinosaur Park in Ogden.  When I returned to the compound I
completed some payroll entries and but in for the bids for next week.  After
getting home, Mark and I took the pickup load of trash up to the dumps.  We had
a co. give us a bid to remove the tree in the front yard for $350.00 and will
do it next Tuesday.  After eating super Mae and I watched a show on Comcast. 
It was cute but they did take the God in vain several times through out the show. 
We checked the rabbits and chickens before going to bed.  Just before we got in
bed, Jinnie Lee Hill Griggs called me.  I had been trying to contact her but no
one has answered my calls.  I had thought that maybe the phone number I was
given was possibly a wrong number.  We visited for several minutes and it was
good to communicate with her.  I haven’t seen or talked with her since her
parents were killed.  She may have been at Mom or Aunt Vida’s funerals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke before
the alarm went of so got up and started the day.  I took care of the animals
while Mae prepared breakfast.  I had a field trip to take today.  I took
children from West Point Jr. High into the Homeless Center in Ogden.  Because
of rain all day they stayed there at the center, until I returned them to the
school after 2PM.  I wish that I would have had my lap top with me so I could
have worked on my journals.  When Mae opened her pill box this morning there
was two notes tucked inside.  One note from Tyler and one note from Emily.  <i>“Thanks
for taking us to Dinosaur Park. Love Tyler” and “Dear Grandma, thank you for
letting us stay with you.  Love Emily.”</i>  Those notes sure made Mae’s day. 
They are special children but that is the same for all our grandchildren.  We went
to the Family History Center tonight.  I spent most of my time making entries
into Aunt Welma’s family records.  Mae found more information on the Crandel
line that she added to her records.  We are trying to find out how to copy this
new information so that I can just add it to my records without retyping it.  I
will need to learn this process so that I can also build a file for Jacqueline
and send it to her.  It was a good evening tonight.  When we got home I went
out and checked on the animals before we went to bed tonight.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up at
5:30 AM and was up for a few minutes and then cuddled with Mae for a while
before getting up.  Mae fed the rabbits and chickens this morning so I could
get to Dr.Toone and get an adjustment on my back and tail bone.  On the way
home I stopped at Peterson’s Farm supplies and got chicken feed and rabbit feed
plus a feeder for the chicks.  I then stopped at Dee’s Auto shop and made an
appointment to have the pickup inspected and worked on.  I came home and had
some lunch and left to take a field trip.  When I got home I took the feed out
to the shed and took care of the animals while I was there.  The White doe had
kits last night.  I put the 2<sup>nd</sup> white doe in with the buck and he
bread her this afternoon.  After dinner I took a short nap and then Bob and I
went Home Teaching to Sister Fallis’s.  This evening Mae and I watched a show
on Comcast before I entered this entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I set the
alarm for 5AM but didn’t get up until almost 6AM.  Mae helped me get off to
work and then she took care of the chickens and rabbits for me.  I went to the
Salt Lake Community Collage in West Jordan.  I went there so Chelci could have
a dental patient for her training.  I was there almost four hours.  When I got
home Mae said that she thought that the one doe had kits lastnight.  I got a
call from the bus shop asking if I could take a afternoon run so when I got
home I hurried and ate and took the run.  Roberta called me and asked if I
could take the rout tomorrow and Monday.  I told her I could so I will be busy
the next few days.  It was after 5PM when I got home.  Mae had dinner ready so
I changed and we ate on the way to the Ogden Temple.  Our Stake held a Temple
night prior to Stake Conference this weekend.  We got home about 9PM.  I filled
out my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I took the
bus run this morning.  Mae was just going out to feed the animals when I got
home so we went out together.  As we went to the chicken coop we could smell
smoke.  We found that one of the heat lights had fallen and had burned a 10 t0
12 inch hole through the coop floor.  Had it been much longer it could have
burned the complete coop, shed and the storage shed.  We just felt blessed that
it didn’t do more.  We then took care of the rabbits and I tried to count the
new kits.  It looks like she possibly had as many as 10 kits this time.  I
couldn’t count to well as there are so many in the nest.  Mae went up to
Georgia’s to have lunch and visit with her.  I got home before she did and
worked out back on the storage shed, getting the edge of the roof cut back. 
After dinner we attended a wedding reception.  I was a little disappointed with
the reception as many came in even worn out Levis and very casual dress.  The
wedding cake was even very casual.  After returning home we watched a movie on DVD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
early to attend the Republican County Convention.  I slept until almost 8AM and
when I got up I could hear Bob trying to break up the cement sidewalk.  I told
him that I would show him how it would break but he was out there swinging the
sludge hammer and doing very little.  I went out and had him stop.  I quickly
got something to eat and fed the animals and then I got things ready and took
the trailer around front.  We got the walk broken and loaded up.  David called
and wanted to use the trailer today so I told him that I would take it to him
after we dumped the cement.  David and Shauna met us at the gas station in
Mountain Green.   Bob and I then worked on the storage shed getting the soffit
installed.  When Mae came home we finished up so that we could attend the
evening session of our Stake Conference.  We had Elder and Sister Hale of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles visiting.  Also Elders and Sister Richards were
accompanying Elder Hales.  This is Elder Richards first assignment as a new
General Authority.  It was a very good meeting.  We stopped on the way home and
got us a frozen yogurt.  After getting home we played a game of Sevens to be
sure we had all the cards and then a game of Rummy.  I won the Sevens but Mae
really beat me at Rummy.  I finally just conceded that she won and we quite the
game.  I filled out my journal while Mae showered.  We soon went to bed after
that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We set the
alarm for 5:15AM but it took us another 1/5 hr to get up.  Mae prepared
breakfast of hot cakes while I took care of the chickens and rabbits.  Mae and
I road with Bob and Carroll into Ogden, for Stake Conference.  This conference
we had Elder Robert D. Hale of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles and Kent F.
Richards of the 70’s as visiting authorities.  President Travis was released
from the Stake Presidency and President Arrington was sustained as 1<sup>st</sup>
Councilor and LeRoy Puffer was sustained as 2<sup>nd</sup> Councilor.  The
Conference messages were very special and inspirational.  It was special to
have General Authorities and their wife’s at our Conference.  Bob prepared
dinner for us when we got home.  I did work on my personal Family History this
afternoon.  At 2PM Brother Higgley, our High Priest Group Leader, and Brother
Sylvester from the High Counsel came over to visit with us about our calling as
Ward Family History Consultancy.  After they left I took a short nap before
Scott, Mishelle, Kylan, Ashley, Katelyn and Kaden came over for a few minutes
to visit.  Ashley wanted to see the chicks and rabbits.  They left about 6PM.  We
were going to watch a special show this evening but we couldn’t find it.  I
worked on some of my stories and then had Mae check them over.  We tried to get
to bed fairly early but the time sure went by fast.  I did call Rich and Lois
and found out that the man they had work on their deck did a bad job and they are
sure upset over it.  I told them not to pay him but I am afraid they have
already paid him at least some.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I borrowed
Bob’s car to go to the bus compound this morning.  Mae and Bob took my truck
over to Dee’s to have it inspected and some work on it.  Mae then went up to
David to take care of the children.  I got home after 9AM from the morning
run.  I got something to eat and then went out and worked on the storage shed. 
Some how I got mixed up on my time and went to the bus compound an hour early
this afternoon.  I washed the bus and when I got to the school I took a ½ hour
nap.  I finished the afternoon runabout 4PM but then I had to make my payroll
entries.  Roberta asked me to make a change in my field trip so that I could take
the bus route in the morning and then be back from the field trip in time for
the afternoon rout.  That will take all day tomorrow.  It was 5PM when I got
home.  I helped Mae by grilling the chicken.  Mae had the rest of the diner
ready when I got the chicken cooked.  We had Irven, Sandy, Bob, Carroll and
Mark for dinner.  After dinner we played a game of Mormon Bridge.  Mae and I
then went out and took care of the animals.  I bib on next weeks field trips
and then entered this entry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early for a bus route; I finished it and then took a field trip.  I had time
enough to wash the bus before leaving the compound.  Roy called me to talk to
me about his water-softener while I was waiting for the children to come to the
bus.  After I had taken the children to a farm and was waiting for them, I made
some calls to Durk’s, concerning the water-softener.  The field trip was late
finishing so I really had to hurry in order to trade busses and get to my first
school pickup.  The run went well and I finished up at 5PM.  Mae had dinner
ready when I got home and after eating we went to the Family History Center.  I
was very tired and so I went out to the car and took a ½ hr. nap.  I really
didn’t get very much done tonight.  I called Roy this evening to see if the
number that I got him did any good. He said that he called after the shop was
closed so he will have to wait until tomorrow for any information.  I have a
bus run again tomorrow so I will close this entry and get to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up at
4:15AM to get to my bus run.  That went well and I got home just after 9AM. 
Bob &amp; I worked on the shed for a while.  I took a nap before lunch and then
ate.  I made an afternoon run getting home at 5:15PM.  Bob and I worked on the
shed again but we didn’t quite get finished.  While Mae was finishing up dinner
I filled our water containers.  Roy called and had a question about his life
insurance.  He needs to get a copy of his policy before I can give him any
opinion.  After dinner I entered this journal entry and then we plan on
watching a show on DVD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The phone
rang about 6AM.  I thought it must be the bus shop to ask me to take a route
but it was Bob asking about cutting the roots to the tree that we had removed. 
I told him that right then I was sleeping in and it was the first time I had
had time to sleep in.  We didn’t go back to sleep.  Bob later apologized for
waking us.  I did go in to a Sub-Drivers Round table at 9:30AM and when I got
home I worked on the shed for a while.  I thought it was so special of Mae to
come out and climb the latter to see how the roof was looking.  She is sure a
special sweetheart and I sure love her.  Mae put up strawberry jam with Agave
Nectar for sweetener.  It turned out very good. This afternoon I took a field
trip, taking Syracuse High’s boy’s soccer team to a meet against Fremont High. 
Mae was watching a show, when I got home, so we finished it while I ate dinner. 
I made my journal entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast Mae left for Mike’s.  She is going to tend the kids while Mike and
Becky go to a convention in St. George.  I took care of the animals and then
finished the shed.  Bob came out and we cleaned up the trash and put the tools
away.  I got a call from Roberta asking me to take a bus route this afternoon. 
the run went well.  Bob and I worked on Jeff’s motorcycle changing the clutch
cable.  The battery is dead so we filled it with water and put the charger on it
but I don’t think it will work.  It had set empty of water too long.  I watched
a couple of movies this evening before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6AM and the first thing I did was to get on-line and enter my bids.  I then got
me something to eat and called Mae.  I fed my animals and talked to Scott about
repairing his wall.  I went over to Scott’s and replaced the sheetrock and put
the first coat of mud on it.  This afternoon when I got home I watched a couple
of movies.  Mae got home about 7PM.  We watched the movie on the Spirit of
Saint Louse with Jimmy Stewart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6AM so we could take care of the animals and get to Bountiful to attend
Kathleen and Grin Clark’s home coming talk.  They gave a great report and after
meeting we went to their home and had a light lunch.  When we got home we took
a nap and had a light lunch.  I got on the inter-net and did some research on
going back to Ohio to visit Jeff.  Marrion and Jim live just a little ways from
Jeff.  I called Jim and visited for a few minutes with him about coming out
there.  We went over to Scott and Mishelle’s for dinner.  Mishelle had cooked a
very nice dinner and we sure enjoyed being with them.  We came home about
8:30PM.  I went out and took care of the animals and then came in and entered
this entry.  Although we took a nap this afternoon we are still tired this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had the
normal morning routine and I was glad when I woke and it was 6:30AM for I hadn’t
received a call to take a bus run.  After taking care of our animals I took Mae
to the Laundromat where she washed our bed spread quilt.  While she was doing
that I went over to Scott’s and put a second coat of mud on the wall where I
patched the sheetrock.  I stopped on the way back and bought some chicken for
our lunch and then went to the Laundromat and got Mae.  after we got home Mae
did the weekly washing and cleaned up the house.  I butchered five rabbits this
afternoon and then came in and took a short nap.  When I got up I went out and
worked on Jeff’s motorcycle getting it running.  Mae got dinner ready and after
eating I washed the rabbits and put them into the refrigerator.  I will have to
cut them up tomorrow.  Mae has been busy on the internet trying to get plans
made for us to go to Ohio the first of July to be with Jeff and to see some of
the Church History sights.  We talked to Jeff and to Shellie trying to get the
schedule worked out with their schedules.  Mae cleaned up the kitchen while I
entered this entry.  We are going to try to find a show on Comcast to watch
this evening.  Instead we watched “The Rooky” on DVD.  I called the sub-line
and told them that I would not be available to drive tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6AM.  Mae made hot cakes for breakfast.  I took care of the animals and then
cut up the rabbits that I butchered yesterday.  We bottled 7 quarts of rabbit
and pressure caned them.  That took 3 rabbits and the other 2 we froze them.  We
took Mae to the Oral Surgeon, Dr. Newey who first took an xray and then a cat
scan of the concerned area and he determined that everything was ok.  We were
relieved at that news.  We were two hours at Dr. Newey office.  We then drove
to Heber City and was going to drive to Strawberry reservoir to see if the ice
was melted but decided that we wouldn’t have time to now.  We came back to Park
City where we met with others to celebrate Mike’s 40<sup>th</sup> Birthday.  Becky
had arranged for us to meet in Park City and go out to eat.  It was a surprise
to Mike but he caught on to something  was going on when he wanted to stop at
Red Lobster to eat and Becky insisted that they wait until later for dinner in
Park City.  We had a very enjoyable evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 4:30
AM and drove a bus route at 6AM.  I had taken this route last week so the route
was familiar.  After the morning run I went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and
put the final coat of sheetrock mud on the patch.  I got home in time for
lunch.  Mae had lunch ready for Scott and I when I got back at noon.  After
Scott went back to work I took a ½ hour nap before driving the afternoon
route.  When I got home Bob and I loaded the tiller on the trailer and went to
Sherries where I tilled her garden for her.  Mae had dinner ready when I got
home.  After dinner I tried to find something on TV to watch but came out
empty.  I made this entry and then we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up
early for a bus run again.  Mae prepares as much of my breakfast as she could
last night so I let her sleep in.  She also fed the rabbits and chickens so
that after I ate I took a nap.  Mae soon had dinner ready when I got home this
afternoon.  We got ready and attended the wedding reception for Tina Linderman
and Scott Richards this evening.  There was a special feeling to see Tina with
Scott and to know that she has finally found someone to care for her.  It was
also great to see all those from the old Ward there that we know so well.  The
reception was held in a bowery at the Ward Building.  The weather was very
pleasant for the occasion and there was a very large attendance.  Jola Craven,
Deinise Hawks, Bonnie Benedick and Diane Lapervose had voluntary catered the
refreshments and did an excellent job of it.  It all seemed so appropriate.  We
found out, while there, that Tina’s father had passed away and his funeral was
held on Tuesday.  We felt bad that we hadn’t known about that and that we
hadn’t attended the Wedding Ceremony in the Salt Lake Temple this morning.</span></p>
