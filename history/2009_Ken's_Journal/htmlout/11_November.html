<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This morning
we switched off of Day-Light-Saving-Time, so I spent a little while resetting
the clocks and putting new batteries in those that takes a battery.  Even with
the extra hour we had to hurry in order to be ready for Stake Conference.  I
had an assignment to assist with the directions of the parking at conference. 
I went into the Ogden Tabernacle at 11:15 AM.  Those of us that were assigned
to be there were looking for someone to direct us.  When Brother Higgley came
and didn’t know who was to give us instructions, I saw President Mitchell
inside the Tabernacle doors so I went in and asked him who was to give us
instructions and he said “You Brothers hold the Priesthood so you decide what
needs to be done and do it.  Then he added “Don’t let anyone run over you”. 
With this we went to work.  Although we didn’t feel that a lot was needed to
get people in.  It was enjoyable to be united with others for a cause.  The
general Conference meeting was enjoyable.  The Music by the choir was very well
performed and touching and the speakers gave very inspirational talks.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
returning home, Bob invited us up for dinner.  He had prepared large chicken
breast, vegetables, potatoes (we brought up some rice in place of the
potatoes), gravy and tossed salad.  It was very good.  After eating Mae and I
came downstairs and worked on the computers.  Irven and Sandy called and wanted
to come over.  We had planned on playing Canasta with Bob and Carroll so when
Irven and Sandy came we made it a three couple game.  It took quite a while to
play with that many players but it worked out ok.  We called it finished at
10:30PM with Irven and Bob having the highest score.   When Mae and I came back
downstairs I finished writing my story of “My Dogs”.  It was after 1AM when we
got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, November 02, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 7:30AM and started the day.  I was a little frustrated because of being
overwhelmed with things to do.  I made me a “to do” list of 14 items and by the
end of the day I had ½ of them done.  Mae has been doing the washing as well as
cooking meals and cleaning house, then I have had her help with some of my
things.  It has been a busy day but we feel that we have accomplished quite a
lot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, November 03, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got a call
at 5:40AM asking me to take a bus run.  I had to hurry in order to get to the
bus and leave on schedule.  My departure time was 6:55AM.  I was ready to leave
on time but my assistant hadn’t shown up.  I called dispatch and they asked me
to wait a few more minutes.  She came at 7AM and when she said good morning I
replied with “It’s better now that you are here.”  She said that they didn’t
usually leave until 7:05AM so we were on time.  With my assistances help the
run went well.  On the way home after the run, I stopped to wash the pickup. 
It was really dirty so it took longer than I had planed so I didn’t get the
truck rinsed off.  When I got home I rinsed it off with the hose.  I then
watered the rose bushes for Mae.  I fed and watered the chickens and rabbits
before lunch.  Scott forgot that Mae was expecting him for lunch so we ate
without him.  I installed a timer on the chicken coop lights and removed the
digital time that we have been unsuccessful at programming.  I then tried to install
the new printer and that was a disaster.  I got on with a computer tech. for
about 3 hours.  We finally had to quit and go to the Family History center. 
After we finished at the FHC we went up to Jeff and Gail’s new home.  I helped
Jeff bring in a new washer and dryer set, but the water has been shut of and
Jeff hadn’t realized it.  He will get it on tomorrow and I will pickup a couple
of items and finish setting them up tomorrow.  It is almost mid-night so we had
better get some sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, November 04, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up just
before 7AM and got going.  Mae prepared breakfast while I showered and shaved. 
After breakfast I took care of the animals.  I then went to Lowe’s and got some
items for Jeff.  I got up to Jeff’s place and hooked up the electrical for the
dryer and installed a vent hose.  However I ran out of time and didn’t get the
vent quite finished.  I ran home and changed clothes.  Mae had me some lunch
ready to go and a sandwich for me to eat on the way to the bus compound.  I got
my bus and got down to the school with just 5 minutes to spare.  The field trip
went well and I got home just before 9PM.  Mae has also been busy all day and
this evening she helped take care of Scott and Mishelle’s children as well as
prepare dinner for all of them.  Scott came over and spent a couple of hours
installing the printer.  It looks like it is working fine now.  Mae worked on
Quicken to get some reports and it won’t accept the new printer.  It’s getting
late so we had better go to bed.  I did finish the Book of Mormon again and
love it more each time I read it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, November 05, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
before 8AM and got started on the day.  After breakfast I took care of the
animals.  I am concerned that my doe rabbits are not with kits.  I don’t understand
what is happening with them. I did get some payroll information entered and am
now able to print my field trip sheets here at home instead of having to go to
the bus compound.  I worked on the repairs of the snowmobiles hood.  Mae spent
a couple of hours helping Sister Germer with her Family History.  after lunch I
continued with my work out side until our insurance agent with Altius, Larry
Saiz, came and went over the changes with in the program this coming year.  We
selected to remain with Altius this next year.  Larry thinks that there should
have been more covered on our teeth with Mae’s extractions and my root canal. 
He will check on it and get back with us.  I worked a little longer and put my
tools away.  We went up to Morgan to see a music recital in which Emily is
performing tonight.  It was very good and we enjoyed supporting Emily.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, November 06, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up just
before 5AM for the alarm had not gone off yet.  I took my things into the other
room so Mae could sleep longer.  When I looked at the alarm, the clock was set
wrong.  Has I not woke when I did I would have slept to long.  Mae had prepared
my breakfast for me last night so I just had to get ready, eat and go.  The
morning run went well.  It was 9:30AM when I got home.  I took care of the
chickens and rabbits and then worked on the snowmobile hood for a few minutes. 
Mae had lunch ready for me and I took a short nap before taking the afternoon
run.  I got to the elementary school in good time.  I ask for one of the students
to help me with the route and the boy that offered didn’t tell me in time and
got confused so I made a wrong turn.  Then when I let the students off a kinder
garden child got off and as I drove off realized that he was at the wrong
place.  I saw him and stopped as two girls came to the front of the bus to tell
me that he had got off at the wrong stop.  I had them get off and go back and
get him.  We then had to go around the block to get back on the right track. 
At the next stop after every one had got off and I started to move a boy came
up and said that he had to get off at that stop.  I stopped for him although I
felt like making him walk back from the next stop.  After letting all the
students off I started back to the freeway to go to the next school but there
was an accident on US89 that held me up a few more minutes.  I was about 7
minutes late getting to Sunset Jr. High.  That run went better with only one
missed turn.  I had to fuel and sweep the bus when I returned to the compound. 
When I got home we decided to go out to eat this evening.  Mae had gone grocery
shopping and bought me some paint brushes at Lowe’s.  I checked the rabbits and
it looks like the youngest doe is going to have kits this evening.  I gathered
the eggs and then I loaded the printer onto my lap top computer.  We went out
to eat at the Golden Corral.  As we went to get our food we walked right into
Kylan and Ashley.  Scott, Mishelle and the twins were at a table just a little
ways from our table.  The waitress changed our table so we could be with them. 
After eating and enjoying being with Scott and Mishelle and their family we
came home.  I entered this entry and we watched a movie before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early and got ready to go help Jeff and Gail with there moving.  I took care of
the animals while Mae cooked me some breakfast.  Our newest doe had kits when I
checked her this morning.  Mike, David and Scott were already there when I got
there.  Trent was also there as well as Jeff’s Brother-in-law Tyler.  Gail’s
mother and sister came and helped Gail with cleaning.  Mae took care of the
children all day.  There were at least 10 Brothers from the ward that came to
help.  I didn’t think that they had even known that Jeff and Gail were moving
in.  I guess the Arnold’s must have alerted then.  The moving went well and I
was home about 1PM.  Mike, David, Scott and Jeff came over for a few minutes
and helped me move my rabbit pens over by the chicken run.  The rest of the day
I spent helping Mae with our grandchildren.  I watched a couple of western
movies on TV.  We went to bed very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was almost
8AM when I got up.  It didn’t give us any extra time to take care of animals
and get ready for meetings even with it being Fast Sunday.  The cultural hall
floors were re-finished this week end so we couldn’t have any meetings in there
today.  The finish odors were very strong through out the building.  I sure
felt a good spirit in all the meetings.  Mae had her sharing time in primary
today and she said that it went well.  Testimony meet was very good, Mae also
bore her Testimony.  She is such a wonderful wife and sweetheart and I feel so
blessed to have her.  After returning home I did get on the computer and enter
my field trip biding for the week of the 16<sup>th</sup> to the 22<sup>nd</sup>
and my payroll time for last week.  Mae cooked a nice dinner and after I took
care of the chickens we took the dinner over to Jeff and Gail’s.  They are in
fair shape from the move.  After eating we went down to the tree house and fire
pit.  We then went back in the house and cleaned up the dinner dishes.  Jeff
popped some corn and Jeff and I vs Gail and Mae in two games of Rook.  Jeff and
I won both games tonight.  It was after 9:30PM when we got home.  I then filled
out this entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
about 6:30AM and after reading my scriptures, got started.  I made me a list of
things I wanted to work on toady.  The first thing I did was to get a letter
finished to Lorraine Brown.  Mae prepared breakfast and after eating I took
care of the rabbits and chickens.  I worked on the snowmobile for a little
while and then went shopping for some paint for the snowmobile, some lumber to
fence the rabbit pens and I got my paint spray gun replaced.  When I got home I
serviced the pickup and the car.  I showered and Mae and I went to Target to
have photos taken.  These will be Christmas gifts and cards.  Mae prepared us
something to eat while I entered this journal entry and then we watched a show
on DVD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t wake
up in the best of moods but I soon got busy and that took care of my bad mood. 
Mae is sure sweet to overlook my problems sometimes and this morning was one of
them.  After feeding the animals I started on the fencing for the rabbit pens. 
I stopped for lunch and took a ½ hour nap before again working on the fencing. 
Bob came out and helped me for a while.  I quit for dinner and then got ready
and we went to the Family History Center.  I didn’t get a lot accomplished this
evening but I found that someone has Margaret’s file in progress to seal her to
Edward Charles Atkinson and Wendell M Davis.  I did find an e-mail address and
will try to contact this person.  After getting home I printed off four months
of my personal journal and filled them in my book.  I then entered this entry
before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After getting
up this morning I printed a hard copy of the last four months of my journal and
put them in my binder.  It just surprised me that it has been four month since
I have printed my entries.  Time goes by so fast.  I fed the animals and then
started working on the pen.  Bob came out and helped me and we got the fencing
all installed.  Mae has been drying apples and that takes quite a bit of time. 
We went over and saw Nancy today and had the scanning done.  We are doing
pretty well but we still need to continue with most of our supplements.  There
was a few changes, some less and added a couple more and some of the items we
need to change the time of day that we take them.  It keeps Mae busy just
trying to keep our pill schedule planned.  I finished the rabbit pen this
afternoon when we got back.  Bob and I were going Home Teaching this evening but
the Relief Society changed their schedule on their book group for this
evening.  Sister Johnston wanted to attend the book group so we put our home
teaching off until next week.  Mae attended the book group this evening also. 
I watched a couple of shows on TV while she was gone.  While I watched the
shows, I also filled 200 capsules with our supplements.  We were getting ready
for bed, in fact, I was in the shower when Mae remembered that Winegar’s has
chicken breasts on sale so we got dressed and went shopping at 11:30PM.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, November 12, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
7:30AM and found that Mae had got up and went back to sleep in the other room
so that she wouldn’t disturb me.  Mae sure is a wonderful wife and sweetheart
to me.  I just hope I can always be worthy of her love.  I entered yesterday’s
journal before getting going today.  Sandi called asking who had who for this
years Christmas gift exchange.  I decided that I would make a chart on the
computer for the next 10 years and send to each of the children.  I called
Shellie to find out who she bought for last year and so had that information to
start the chart.  When I asked Shellie how she was doing she indicated that she
was about ready to scream.  She is upset that very few people are showing concern
about the way the Government is going down hill.  We talked for some time and I
think she was more relaxed than she was.  Mae wanted to visit with her so I
worked on the chart and got it ready to send.  Mae sent it to the children and
I have the original in my computer file.  I fed the chickens and rabbits and
then let the chickens out of their pen.  They sure enjoyed getting out and
eating all kinds of things, but now that the garden if finished for the year we
will try letting them run.  I then tilled the compost pile getting it down and
mixed up.  Mae had lunch ready for me and then I had a field trip to take.  I
took Clearfield Jr. High’s boys basketball team to Syracuse Jr. High.  As soon
as I started to leave Clearfield Jr. the youth were so quiet that it was almost
like having an empty bus.  As the youth got off the bus, I asked one of the
Cheer Leaders why they were all so quiet.  She said that the coach wanted the
boys to focus on the game they were going to play.  I stayed and watched the
game.  It was a very good game with Clearfield wining by 2 points.  When I got
home Mae had a nice dinner ready.  After eating I went out and checked on the
chickens and gathered the eggs.  All the chickens were back in the run and we
got a good amount of eggs, so I guess we will try it again tomorrow.  I returned
a call to Virginia Driggs.  She said that they called Salt Lake center who told
her that their records showed that Richard Hill was still born and therefore
did not need to be sealed to his parents.  Virginia said that the tomb stone on
his grave shows that Richard lived three days.  However I pulled the picture up
and it shows <u>Richard Hill born &amp; died June 11, 1942</u> so there is
question as to whether or not he was still born.  I had better call her back tomorrow. 
Mae and I went over to the Ericksen’s this evening and help them get registered
on New Family Search and then worked with them a while on it.  After returning
home I called Cheryl and visited with her about Family History and the thoughts
I have about sealing Margaret to her husbands that she had children by so that
those lines can be carried down.  When I came back to the computer from talking
to Cheryl, Mae was upset over an e-mail.  It is now almost mid-night and I
still haven’t finished this entry.  That is one thing that I have against
e-mails.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was 7:30AM
when I got up.  Mae had been up for a little while.  Mae prepared French toast
for breakfast and fried eggs.  After breakfast I took care of the animals.  The
water had frozen last night and it took a little to get it running and out of
the water container.  I did send an e-mail to Virginia before going out,
concerning little Richard.  I ran some errorns and bought some groceries. 
While I was out I stopped at the bus compound to turn in some reports.  I also
spoke to Roberta, telling her that I could use a couple more runs this next
week.  She gave me sub runs for Thursday and Friday.  I painted the snowmobile
hood and while waiting for the paint to dry, I added dead men to each clothes
line pole to help support the lines.  Mae has spent most of the day getting
Christmas gifts ready for Christmas.  At 5:30PM I took a shower and we got
ready and attended the Ogden Temple, doing initiatory ordinances.  When we got
out of the Temple it was too late to eat at Chuck-A-Rama, so we got something
to eat at Kentucky Fried Chicken.  It was pretty good.  I am sure tired this
evening so we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6AM but the time went very fast and by the time we ate breakfast and I took
care of the animals it was after 9AM when I left for Scotts.  I decided to take
my trailer rather than just take tools and again I was so glad that I had all
my tools because there were extra things that needed taking care of before we
could paint.  Mae took the time to straighten up the house before she came over
as tomorrow Mike and Becky and their family are coming for dinner.  Although we
just got a good start on the room, we quite at 3PM and cleaned up the tools. 
Scott and Mishelle had an appointment this evening and Mae and I had a wedding
reception to attend.  It was Robert and Sharre Parks daughter and her new
husband reception.  They were married a couple of weeks ago but it was so close
to the funeral of Roberts and Sharre’s son that they held the reception off a
little while.  It was a very nice reception.  We then went to a basket ball
game at Central Davis Jr. High school that Tyler was playing on the team from
Morgan.  It was a good game and Tyler’s team won by double the score.  It was
fun to be there and support Tyler.  We also got to wish Emily and give her a
birthday gift.  After the game I drove almost home when Mae asked where I was
going.  I was supposed to have gone back to Scott’s and get my truck and
trailer.  We drove back and got it, being concerned with leaving it there over
the week end.  I came on home but Mae went to the grocery store for a couple of
items.  I gathered the eggs and wrote this entry and Mae still hadn’t got home.
 I called her and she was just driving in the driveway.  I re-made the
Christmas Gift Exchange List for our children and it should be ok until the
year 2018.  By then I shouldn’t have to worry about it any more.  Mae gave me a
hair cut and then I took a shower. We watched the movie, “Emma” on DVD this
evening.  It was about as boring as was the show “Pride and Predigest”.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
6:30AM but then went back to bed and slept until almost 9AM.  Mae had breakfast
ready so I ate before taking care of the animals.  It froze the rabbit’s water
last night but the heater worked for the chickens.  We had to hurry in order to
be at church on time.  Brother Barker visited with Mae and I after meetings and
asked us to speak in Sacrament Meeting on the 29<sup>th</sup> of November.  Of
course we said we would.  Our subject is to be “Becoming Saviors on Mount
Zion”.  After getting home I made some notes on the topic.  Mae was busy
getting ready for Mike’s family for dinner.  I helped her with some items and I
gathered the eggs.  We are coming up short on eggs so we wonder if it is
because we are letting the hens run free.  Mike and his family got here about
4:30PM.  Mae had dinner ready and was it ever a nice dinner.  After dinner we
played games until about 8:30PM and they left to go home.  it was a very nice
evening.  I locked the chickens into their pen.  We will try that for a day or
two.  I worked on my talk and filled in this entry.  Mae was working on her
talk for next Tuesday evening, so I played 4 games of solitary on the
computer.  Mae then had me listen to her talk.  It sounds very good and I think
it will be encouraging to the sisters.  We got a reply from David about the
vaccine e-mail we got the other day.  He gave us some very good opinions and
logic on the subject.  David called at 10PM and the two of us visited for the
next hour.  I enjoyed our visit but David isn’t feeling the best and we both
need our rest so we said good night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The alarm
went off at 6AM but I didn’t get up until almost 7AM.  I feed the animals while
Mae got breakfast.  I had to stop at Home Depot before going to Scott’s.  Today
I replaced the light fixture, the stained ceiling tile and masked the ceiling
and stairs.  It was after 5PM when I quit and came home.  Along with many other
things, Mae got her hair done this afternoon.  She had taken care of the
chickens and had dinner ready when I got home.  We watched a movie on TV while
we ate and the watched a second movie before going to bed.  We got a call from
the Stake Executive Secretary, asking if Mae and I would meet with President
Mitchell Wednesday evening at 8PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I took care
of the animals and again spent the day at Scott and Mishelle’s.  It is about
ready now to spray paint.  I came home before 5PM as Mae had called Qwest to
let them know that we were not happy with the way we have been changed around
on their program.  A representative of Qwest called and I visited with her and
they are going to separate our accounts and give us the options we asked for
and a special price for one year.  I worked at the Family History Center this
evening and Mae attended a special Relief Society program at which she was the
guest speaker.  When I got home we were tired and went to bed as I will get up
early for work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, November 18, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early for work.  I let Mae sleep in as she was up during the night.  I had time
to take water out to the chickens but I had Mae take care of the rabbits when
she got up.  I took a bus route this morning and then went to Fairfield Jr.
High and took a field trip.  I had time to come home after returning from the
field trip, to get something for lunch and then I took the afternoon bus
route.  I got home at 4:15PM.  Mae was gone chasing errorns, so I caught my
journal up.  Bob and I went Home Teaching to the Casey’s and Patriarch &amp;
Sister Johnston.  I do enjoy visiting the Johnston’s.  Mae and I then went over
to meet with President Mitchell.  He just visited with us about we are doing
for the Lord.  He was planning to encourage us to go on a mission if we hadn’t
been on one.  When he found out that we had been to the Philippines, he said
“Yes, that is surely a mission to go there.”  He encouraged us to continue
serving as we are.  I checked the chickens after we returned home and I think I
am missing one, but I couldn’t find it roosting any where.  I finished this
entry and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, November 19, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I again took
the bus route 307 so was up early for that.  I didn’t have anything going so
was able to come home and take care of the chickens and rabbits then.  I filled
the water jugs and worked on the snowmobile.  I did lie down and take a nap
after eating lunch.  The afternoon route went well.  I went over to Dr. Gray’s
office but didn’t get any thing changed on our bill, so I just wrote out a
check for the balance.  After getting home I finished putting the snowmobile
hood on and started both machines up.  The one still runs rough so I will have
to have it tuned up.  We watched a show on TV before going to bed.  Mae worked
a lot on getting Family History’s ready for our Thanksgiving Family dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, November 20, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early again this morning to take a bus run again, however the run started an
hour later this morning.  After the run, I attended the Sub-Drivers round
table.  I got home for a little while and then took the snowmobile over to have
it tuned up.  I went from there to the bus compound and took the afternoon
run.  This evening Mae and I went over to Jeff and Gail’s .  We played rook
with Jeff and I winning by quite a ways.  It was about 10PM before we left Jeff
and Gail’s to come home.  We soon went to bed after getting home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, November 21, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After
breakfast and feeding the animals, I hooked up my tool trailer.  Jeff came down
and we loaded his motorcycle onto his trailer.  He took it up to his place as
he now has a garage to put it in.  That gave us room to store some of our
things out of the weather.  We put the glider bench in the shed and got a few
other things arranged in it.  I went over to Scott’s and painted the downstairs
bedroom stairwell and hallway.  Mae did a few things at home and then she drove
over in the car.  She always helps with the children and does what laundry
needs to be done.  Mae left at 4:00 pm to go home and make a vegetable tray to
take for JaNae’s Birthday Surprise Party.  It was almost 5:30PM when I got
home.  I quickly showered and changed before we drove out to Stansberry Park in
Tooele.  Sandi and Chelci had arranged for us to have a surprise Birthday party
for JaNae.  It went very well and there was family and friends that attended. 
JaNae was really touched by the party.  Cody, a life time friend of JaNae’s
gave her a DVD with 20 minutes of old video recording when she and JaNae were
in dance class and competition as young girls and Sandi was the dance
instructor.  After the party several of us went over to Chelci and Steve’s home
and Chelci played the DVD for us.  it brought back many good memories.  Mae and
I went to Sandi and Nick’s to stay for the night.  The four of us played a game
of marbles with Nick and I winning tonight.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, November 22, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke early
and decided to go home so that we could take care of our animals and attend our
ward.  Nick got some breakfast ready so we ate before coming home.  We enjoyed
our meetings and enjoyed the Primary’s program for Sacrament meeting.  I tried
to contact Leslie Fallis to arrange for Bob and I to come Home Teaching.  She
is sick today so we will try to visit her tomorrow evening.  Lorraine Brown
called and visited for a few minutes.  She was glad that I had contacted them
to send the Family History book of Dad Jensen’s to them.  It was good to visit
with her.  Mae and I took care of the chickens and then went up to David and
Shauna’s for dinner.  Shauna had gone to particular attention so that she had
food that we could eat.  It started snowing when we got there so we thought of
staying over night.  After dinner David helped me get my fishing license
on-line for our fishing trip November 28 and 29<sup>th</sup>.  We played a game
and then David went out and cleaned the driveway off.  Mae and I came home as I
didn’t feel the best and we also wanted to work on our talks for next Sunday. 
I also caught my journal up to date and then we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and while I was getting ready, Mae got some breakfast.  I then took care of the
animals.  I started getting things ready for the fishing trip Thursday
evening.  Irven and Sandy came over and I pulled their snowie car over to their
place.  Irven steered while I pulled it with my pickup.  I got natural gas on
the way back home and I stopped in to check on my snowmobile.  After lunch I
took a nap.  I talked to Mark about the rotor-tiller and he said that he was
going to take it to his sons.  I asked him about the motor and he felt that he
had done enough work that is should be his.  I just said no and walked away. 
Mae overheard the conversation and she got quite upset and told him so.  Later
while Bob and I were gone Home Teaching, Mae wrote Mark a letter and put it on
his bed as he had gone somewhere.  When Bob and I finished and came back I
helped Bob hang some curtains.  Mae came up with another letter for Mark
apologizing to him for her getting upset but she did not back down from letting
him know that his feelings about the cost of the motor was wrong.  Mae and I
watched a show on TV this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
early so that I could take a field trip.  I took three separate groups of youth
from Layton High to the Davis Lanes and then returned them to the high school. 
I got home about 12:30PM, just in time to see Scott.  He had came down for
lunch.  It was good to see him for a few minutes anyway.  He said that the
paint dried ok and they have most of the doors rehung.  I called on the
snowmobile and was upset over the price of the repairs.  They had told me that
it should cost less than $100.00, but they charged over $300.00.  I guess there
isn’t anything to do but to accept it.  I hope we can get them sold now.  I
really enjoy them but just can’t afford the up keep they take.  I discussed the
rotor-tiller with Mark again this evening.  We agreed that if Mark wanted he
could pay Bob and I $400 and then he could have the machine or Bob and I will
pay him $400 and we will keep the machine. Ether way the tiller stays in the
shed until the money is transferred.  Mae and I went to the Family History
Center this evening.  Mae amazes me with her ability to help others.  After
getting home I filled in this entry and then we watched a show on TV.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept ok
but when I woke Mae was not in bed.  She had got up early and went back to
sleep in the recliner.  I had just started to shave and take a shower when Bob
asked Mae if we wanted biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  We couldn’t resist
and they were sure good.  I spent quite a while getting things packed to go
fishing with my boys tomorrow evening.  I also helped Mae get food ready for
dinner tomorrow.  I mainly got the turkey cooked, cooled and cut up.  We
attended Tithing Settlement this evening and watched a show on TV before going
to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, November 26, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
finished packing the things that I need to take on the fishing trip this
afternoon.  We then finished getting things ready for Thanksgiving dinner.  We
got to the church house in Willard at 11:45AM.  Family soon started to arrive
and we were ready for dinner about 12:30PM.  We had about 80 family members of
the Glendon and Mildred Porter descendents in attendance.  It was good to be
together.  Of course after the dinner was cleaned up several of the adult and
teenage children got the volleyball net out and played a few games.  Mike,
David, Jeff, Mike’s son David, Tyler and I left for Idaho, about 4 PM, to go
fishing at the spill way of the Palisade reservoir.  We all road in David’s
truck and pulled his camp trailer.  We got there about 8:30PM and set up our
camp.  We then went out fishing.  We all had good luck fishing although it was
quite cold.  It was well after mid-night when we came back to the camper.  It
was so nice to have a warm place to sleep and eat.  I couldn’t help thinking of
the early saints that crowed the plains in wagons and on foot.  Boy would they
think that we had it made.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Friday, November 27, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We started
getting up about 7AM.  The restroom that we parked close to was locked and we
had to go to the restroom by the dam parking lot.  Again I couldn’t help
thinking of the pioneers and as cold as the restroom was it was a lot better
than they had it.  The day was just spent just being together.  Games were
played, food was available, and we watched a cute cartoon movie that was very
moving, entitled “Up”.  Some of us got a nap and some went to the Dam Store for
a few items that we had forgotten to bring.  We went out fishing again about
9PM.  Fishing was slower tonight, although David did very well.  I think that
we came out to early but before min-night I was cold and my back hurt so we
came back.  It was so warm in the camper that we lost courage to go back out
again.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, November 28, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Again we
started getting up about 7AM and soon had breakfast and started packing up. 
With all of us working together we were on our way home by 10:15AM.  We stopped
in I.F. where I bought some tie down straps that I fastened the cover onto my
fishing tent slay.  On Jeff I-Phone he and I played a game of chess.  I was
able to win him.  Later I challenged David (my grandson) to a game and I was
able to beat him also.  Jeff was telling me of a family in Mexico that he met
on his mission that refused to buy their family a TV, but instead, bought them
books and a chess board.  He said that all the family became excellent chess
players as well as very good readers.  David let Jeff and I off at Bryce and
Deanna’s as she had left my pickup there.  We transferred our things from
David’s truck and trailer to my pickup.  I then took Jeff home before going on
home myself.  I got home between 4 and 4:30PM.  We were going to go to a basket
ball game that Tyler was to play in but before we left David called and said
that it had been canceled.  That is a shame because that is why we came home
today.  I finished cleaning and filleting the fish we caught last night.  Mae
and I then spent some time working on our talks for tomorrow, before showering
and going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, November 29, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
I took care of the animals.  We didn’t eat breakfast as both of us felt that we
wanted to fast today before giving out talks.  We attended meetings and they
were all very good.  With it being the fifth Sunday the Relief Society and the
Melchizedek Priesthood met together and Bishop Smith presented the lesson.  He
used Elder Holland’s talk from General Conference.  Bishop played the talk in
it’s fullness after he added his testimony of the message.  Sunday school went
well with Brother Thompson giving the lesson.  Mae and I spoke in Sacrament
meeting.  Sister Page sang “Window’s of Love”, accompanied by Sister Saunders
and it was very beautifully done.  That started a change in my talk and I ended
up changing 90% of my presentation.  Scott, Mishelle, Kylan, Ashley, Kaden and
Kaitlyn came to support us and Mae invited them to come over for dinner.  Mae
prepared a nice dinner and I cooked the chicken on the grill.  We enjoyed
having them with us.  Irven and Sandy came over and we played games and visited
until late.  I took the garbage out to the curb, locked the chickens up for the
night and put the grill away.  I then entered this journal entry before we went
to bed.  It’s been a good day.  I did work in a few minutes to enter some of my
school bus times on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, November 30, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
3:30AM with thoughts in my mind of our chickens, rabbits and garden.  I also
felt that I could go into the bus compound and visit with Roberta about
applying for a bus route and what that would mean as fare me taking time off
for personal business (such as fishing and family activities).  My feelings,
with the animals and garden, are to see if Bodily’s would be interested in working
out a partnership with us.  After we got up I talked to Mae about my feelings. 
She felt that it could be a good thing.  I later visit with Bob about the
Bodily’s and my feelings and he felt ok with it also.  I went into the bus
dispatch and visited with Roberta.  She gave me a bus run and a 2<sup>nd</sup>
field trip for this week.  After Mae and I had lunch we went to Ogden to look
at a heater that is for sale.  We visited with a couple that is preparing to
move back to Australia and they can not take any of their personal belongings
that can not be carried in their suite cases.  They are selling every thing
just to get rid of it.  Besides the heater Mae bought several other items. 
After returning home Roberta called me and offered me a bus route that is
opening up for bid and I can have it until that bid is filled.  It will also
give me an opportunity to bid for the route.  I called Qwest and discussed our
situation with a representative.  I wanted to find out where I could go to sit
down with a live body across a desk but this just doesn’t seem to happen.  I
was on the phone with Jessica, some where in Idaho.  I ask her if she could put
together a statement of our services and charges that we have contracted with
Quest, but she said that she couldn’t do that.  I reached Jessica by calling
1-877-992-0995 and her extension is 57182.  I don’t know if I accomplished
anything or not by the time I hung up.  This evening we watched a show on TV
and worked on Christmas cards and letters.  I have been fighting a cold all day
and this evening it is worse.  I entered this journal entry and we went to bed.</span></p>
