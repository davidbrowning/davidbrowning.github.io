<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 8AM so it put us late starting.  We had invited Jeff and Scott for dinner
but Jeff wasn’t able to make it.  I cooked chicken on cedar boards on the gas
grill.  The cedar boards were given to me by Sandi and Nick for Fathers Day. 
They worked pretty good.  I had a field trip to take this afternoon.  I took
the Clearfield Girls Tennis team to Roy High.  I didn’t get back to Clearfield
 High School until 6:36PM so after dropping the girls off I went to the Family
 History Center, as tonight was our day to work there.  After we completed the
shift I took the bus back to the compound and then drove my truck home.  Mae
drove the car home from the Clearfield Stake house.  I entered this entry
before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until after 7AM so we were late getting started again.  Mae got breakfast and I
fed the animals.  I helped Mae pick tomatoes and then went after several
supplies and looked for materials for Sandi’s project.  I did some work on the
tent trailer.  Scott and the children came over and after repairing the vent in
the trailer I showed Scott how to put the tent down.  After getting it put
away, we hooked it to Scott’s car.  The lights wouldn’t work.  I spent sometime
checking the electrical circuits and found a bad ground wire.  I cut the line
from the plugs and spliced it together and everything worked fine.  It was late
when Scott got away and Mae was tired so she went over to Pace Drive-in and
bought something for us to eat.  We ate it while we watched a Touched by an
Angle series.  It was cute and we relaxed watching it.  Jeff came home about
the time the show finished.  I entered this entry while Mae and Jeff played a
game of Rack-o.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM to go to work.  I road with a driver this morning, so that I would know the
route and be able to take the run by myself tomorrow.  It is a good thing that
I road this morning as the route sheets did not indicate that I had elementary
children to take to school tomorrow.  When I finished this mornings run I came
home for a few minutes for some breakfast.  I then went to an appointment with
Dr. Gray who put a crown on the one tooth.  I again came home and got a short
nap and then went back to the bus compound.  The bus that I had been scheduled
to take today was not at the compound so I had to go into the office and get
another bus assigned to me.  I took the J.V. Football team from Davis
 High School to Weber High for a game.  The Davis team won 10 to 0.  The trip
went well but it was after 7PM when I got home.  I worked on the routs for
tomorrow, got ready for bed and entered this journal entry.  Today has been a
busy day for me.  of course Mae always keeps busy and when I have a day like
this she takes care of the animals for me so that adds to her schedule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I drove bus
335 for Gary Hyde today.  Both runs went well although the route times were
changed from the standard runs as the High School had late in today and then
the grade school had early outs.  Oh well I made the runs with only minor
problems.  When I got home from the last run, I started cutting the material
for making the playing boards for a game called “Corn Hole”.  Mae and I went to
bed early this evening.  I tried to write in my journal but my computer is
going out on me.  I was able to get my files backed up.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, September 05, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
7:30 PM this morning although I would like to have slept in longer.  I worked
on the “Corn Hole playing board this morning and got them finished.  Mae was
also busy all morning trying to prepare for our family to come.  Having our
family come is very important to Mae and she always goes the extra mile to be
sure they have a good time.  Sometimes I feel she does too much but I try not
to say very much.  As we started this morning it started to sprinkle and I
thought I had better tell Mae to call of the gathering but then thought better
and kept quiet.  As it turned out, the weather turned of very pleasant for the
event.   We had most of our family here for the party.  Shellie’s family, Becky
and their girls, Emil from David’s family, Brad and Steve were the only members
of our family that weren’t able to make it.  Everyone joined in playing games
and very good food.  It was a very good afternoon and evening.  When it ended
many hands helped clean up before they left.  After they all left we were tired
and soon went to bed.   My laptop computer is acting very strange so I have
transferred my journal to a thumb drive and am keeping it there for now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, September 06, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early as we have to take food to Gail’s mother’s home about 8:30AM and then be
at the Snowcreek Ward for the blessing of Mathew Lee Browning, our 20<sup>th</sup>
Grand Child’s, Blessing.  I had the privilege of being voice for the blessing. 
I have been very concerned about doing this as I want to be appropriate but
don’t want to offend Jeff.  The opening hymn for the meeting was “How Great
Thou Art”, which is my favorite Hymn.  It also brought back a week ago Thursday
night as Nick and I slept out under the stars and the great beauty of that
night.  How blessed I am.  I felt like I would to express my testimony and
after the Sacrament service and the meeting was opened for testimonies, I
waited but no one got up so I took the opportunity.  Again I wanted to express
my feelings but was nerves about Jeff and David’s feelings.  Our Grandson David
also concluded the testimony time by bearing his testimony of the Book of
Mormon, which I really appreciated, plus there was a lot of pride in my heart
for that fine young man.  From the meeting we went to Gail’s mothers where we
enjoyed a nice lunching and visit.  After getting back home Mae took a nap and
while she slept I transferred my journal entries to the external hard drive, so
that I will not loose that information in the case my laptop completely dies on
me.  When Mae woke from her nap she started preparing us something to eat.  I
took some salad up to Bob and Mark as they just got home from there trip to the
  Teton Basin for a reunion.  Of course I had to visit for a few minutes with
them.  Mae called me for dinner.  After dinner we took some salad, tomatoes,
cucumbers and cake over to the Larson’s.  We then went for a walk in the park. 
When we returned home we studied in the Family History Training for a while, I
then finished this entry before we went to bed.  We watched the DVD of “Big
Jake” with John Wayne.  Although we have seen it before it is still a very
enjoyable movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, September 07, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
3:45AM and didn’t sleep very well after that.  I slept in the recliner so that
I wouldn’t keep Mae awake.  Jeff came home about 730M to get ready to go hiking
with Kim.  Mae cooked waffles for us for breakfast and they were very good.  I
took care of the chickens and rabbits and did some figuring on the water valve
box for Sandi and Nick’s.  Mae and I drove out to Sandi’s and measured the
valves.  I sketched the box with measurements so that I can build the box for
them.  While we were there I checked the garage door openers and found one has
a problem and will need to have a technician repair it.  Mae drove out to
Sandi’s so that I could figure material for the sunroom for Bob and Carroll. 
We got back to Layton just before 3PM so that we got a senior discount on
dinner.  This evening we picked the pears of the tree, I filled my time on the
bus schedules that I have driven and bid on next weeks field trips.   I field
out a material list on the Sunroom to be priced out.  The day was gone so we
watched the movie cartoon if “Tarzan” on Comcast.  I then entered this journal
entry before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tuesday, September 08, 2009</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
8:45AM.  I couldn’t believe that I had slept so late with out even waking at
all.  I still had my CPAP mask on.  Mae had been up for over an hour.  It was
10AM before I got out too feed the animals.  Mae got a call from Scott asking
if she could help Michelle as she had a very bad migraine headache.   She left
shortly and spent the rest of the day taking care of Michelle and the babies. 
I did get the bed made and folded up some laundry.  I was getting ready to go
to work when Bob came down to tell me that Mae was trying to call me.  I had
been in the shower when she tried to call and I had my cell phone on vibrate
and in the bedroom.  I called and she wanted me to bring some prescription pain
pills to her.  I tried to get Bob to take them but he had just left for the
store.  I quickly finished putting some lunch together and too the pills to Mae. 
That put me late getting to the bus compound so I was running behind schedule. 
I got to the school just at the time I was suppose to be leaving, however I
went to West Cross High instead of View Mont High so I had to quickly go to the
other end of town.  I was able to get the team to Fremont High in plenty of
time.  The games didn’t get over until after 6PM so by the time I got them back
to school and back to the bus compound, cleaned and fueled the bus it was
almost 8PM when I got home.  Jeff was home when I got there.  I got myself some
thing to eat and visited with Jeff for a few minutes.  I was going to get on
the computer and do some studding on the New Family History but Mae had taken
my book with her as I had planned on going over there after the game.  I did
get my journal entry in for today.  We soon went to bed after Mae got home. 
She had been busy at the FHC this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
3:30AM and was afraid that I would wake Mae if I went back to bed so I slept in
the recliner.  I didn’t think that I slept very good there but I didn’t hear
Mae get up and go outside.  I slept until almost 8AM.  Mae went visiting
teaching this morning.  I went over to Home Depot after feeding and caring for
the animals.  While there I priced the material for Bob and Carroll’s addition
and I picked up the material for a project for Sandi.  While I was there I got
a call from the bus dispatch and asked if I could take a special ed. route this
afternoon.  I just had time to get home and grab a sandwich and go.  Mae had
gone out to eat with Georgia this afternoon.  I worked on pricing the remodel
job for Bob and Carroll this evening and then Mae and I watched a cute show on
Comcast free movies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Other than
feed my animals I worked on the bid most of the morning.  I went up to find a
dealer for pricing the siding but the one above Hill Field is now closed.  I
took a field trip this afternoon.  I loaded the JV Football team at Wood Cross
at 3:25PM, taking them to Olympus High in SL.  It was after 10PM when I got
home.  I entered my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae and I
spent a wonderful day together.  We got up at 4:30AM and after caring for the
animals and eating breakfast we went fishing at East Canyon Reservoir.  We both
caught our limits alternating one fish after the other.  After both had caught
4 fish we spent some time boating, and eating our lunch.  After returning home
we showered and took a nap.  This evening we went to Bingham High in Salt Lake
and watched the football game between American Fork and Bingham High.  We met
Mike and Becky there at the game.  Of course they and we were there to support
David.  Sorry to say that Bingham won 40 to 14 and in the last quarter, David
had a helmet hit directly into his right calf that put him out of the game for
the night.  It was late when we got home so I entered this entry before we went
to bed.  Mae isn’t feeling the best this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae got up
and got ready to go to the Family History classes in Ogden today.  I didn’t get
until just in time to eat breakfast with her.  I stayed home to get things done
here.  I took care of the animals, worked on a fishing real that turned into a
long painful job and ended up in disaster.  I built a valve box for Sandi and
Nick.  That turned out ok.  I sometimes get to feeling overwhelmed with things
I need to do and am not sure that my priorities are always right.  After dinner
tonight Mae and I wrote up a bulletin on Family History and I took it over to
Brother Glenn Higley.  Mae isn’t feeling the best tonight but she just keeps
going.  I made this entry and then we went to bed.  We watched the movie “Black
Beauty” before we went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke about
7AM and started the day.  Mae prepared breakfast while I was showering and
shaving.   I then went out and took care of the animals.  Mae wasn’t feeling
the best but went to Church anyway.  Meetings were very good and we enjoyed the
block meetings.  After getting home Bob prepared dinner.  After dinner Bob and
I went home teaching to Sister Fallis.  I talked to her about her horses and
the care and feed for them for this winter.  We also gave some thoughts from
the Ensign on the value of Sisters in our Heavenly Fathers eternal plan.  Mae
and I started through some of the lessons on the New Family History but we got
a phone call from Irven and Sandy.  They asked us to come over so this evening
we went over to Irven and Sandy’s and visited and played games with them. 
After getting home I went out and gathered the eggs.  We got 18 eggs today
there is still 3 or 4 hens that are not laying yet.  I entered this journal
entry and we soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about 3:30AM
to use the bathroom and couldn’t go back to sleep.  After trying for a while I
got up and fillet the fish that we caught the other day.  I finished them about
7AM.  I took three of them up to Bob for him to cook for breakfast this morning
and the other five I sealed with the seal-a-meal and put them in the freezer.  I
fed the chickens and rabbits and then came in for breakfast.  Bob had prepared
the fish and eggs for all of us.  The rest of the day was spent putting wood
stain and sealer on the glider bench, the corn-hole boards and the valve box
that I built for Sandi and Nick.  After finishing the sealing of those items I
came in and took an hour nap.  Mae and Mark had to move the stained items into
the sheds while I was sleeping for a storm came in.  This evening Mae and I
went up to Kim’s where we got together with Mae’s sibling for a nice dinner
that Jeanenne had prepared.  We then visited and played some games.  It was
late when we got home.  I filled out this entry and we went to bed.  I have also
been trying to clean up the desk top computer by changing Mae’s pictures
around.  I also got them backed on the external hard drive.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
Mae prepared hot cakes for breakfast.  They were sure good!  I got Bob and
Carroll’s price put together and took it up to them.  They were upset as Bob
had gone down to the V.A. Hospital to have his hearing aid checked and when he
got down there it wasn’t with him.  They looked all over for it but could not
find it.  I didn’t have time to help as I still had to feed the animals and
then leave for an appointment with Nancy.  She said that I am doing pretty good
but she still thinks that I need to continue with the diet and the pills we are
taking.  She also added some more for us.  Mae and I each drove as I had to
hurry and leave in order to get to the bus compound in time to make the field
trip.  I took Mountain Ridge girls volleyball teams to Weber High.  It was
after 10 PM when I got home.  Mae finished with Nancy, came back to Clinton and
found where she was to vote and cast her votes.  She them went to the Family
History Center where there was just she and Brother Bell.  She said that no
body came for help tonight so she was just able to study and work on her own
files.  After I got home I entered the information into the computer for the
field trip and then entered my journal entry before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After taking
care of the animals and eating breakfast Bob and I started to dig around the tree
in the back yard that is dieing.  Bob, Mae and I went over to the Clinton
Senior Citizen lunching.  When we got back I went over to the bus compound and
took the West Point Jr. High girls volley ball team to North Davis Jr. High. 
West Point won the game.  I got home about 5:30 PM.  While I ate dinner Mae and
I watched a serious of “Touched by an Angle”.  Mae then went to the Relief
Society’s book study group.  I started another show on “Touched by an Angle”
but Bob told me that there was a good show on channel 46 with Shaun Conway, so
I changed channels and watched that show.  Mae came home just at the end of the
show and watched the end with me.  I finished this entry and we went to bed. 
No! Mae and I each played a couple of hands of Spider Solitary before we went
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
with a cramp in my foot.  I was able to go back to sleep and slept until the
alarm went off at 6:30AM.  I made the bed while Mae prepared breakfast.  I took
care of the animals and then went to a round table meeting for the sub-bus
drivers.  I came out of the meeting with several questions that I didn’t get
answered.  I stopped on the way home and bought feed for the animals.  Scott
and Jeff came for dinner.  As usual Mae had a very nice dinner.  After dinner I
had a field trip to take.  I got to the bus compound early enough but I had
mixed my time up by an hour and so was late getting to the school by 15 to 20
minutes.  I got the Clearfield JV Football Team to Lehi High School in time for
the game.  Clearfield won Lehi 20 to 0.  the trip went well although on the way
home from Lehi I had a pickup pulling a trailer come on and cut in front of me
so close that I had to quickly apply the brakes.  The good thing is that I
anticipated that he was going to do that.  Mae put up salsa today and mainly
for my benefit.  She is such a sweetheart and spoils me quite badly.  When I
got home she had gone to a Constitution Celebration held at Northridge High
School.  Jeff was here when I got home.  I got him to help me set the clock for
the lights for the chicken coop.  It was a good thing I had his help because
the only instructions I could find was in Spanish.  We still didn’t get is set
quite right for it didn’t shut off on time.   He and I started to play two
handed Rock.  We made up the rules and had played a couple of hands when Mae
came home.  The three of us played a game of rummy and I won, beating them by
quite a ways this time.  I filled out my journal and we all went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up this
morning just after 7AM but Jeff was up and in the bathroom so I ended up going
up stairs.  Mae had breakfast about ready when I came back so we ate and then I
feed the animals.  However I took the time to fix the chicken’s grain feeder so
that they won’t throw so much feed.  I also fixed one of my tool boxes.  Mae
got the things done in the house and came out and trimmed the lawn.  We then
took showers and went into the Ogden Temple.  It was noon when we got there so
we decided to get something to eat before the session.  Deanna was there in the
lunch room waiting for Bryce.  We set with her and visited while we ate.  It
was good to visit with her.  We enjoyed the session.  We stopped for gas and at
the grocery store on the way home.  We were busy getting ready for Grinn and
Kathleen Clark.  They came at 5:30 PM.  We ate and then played a game of Corn
Hole.  Mae and Kathleen also played a quick game of Crocket while Grinn and I
visited.  After they left Mae helped me get ready to go fishing in the
morning.  It was 10:30PM when I finished this entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up
shortly after 4AM and got ready to go fishing.  I picked Randy up at 6AM and we
went up to East Canyon Reservoir. W got on the water about 7:30AM and we had
our limits by 10AM.  I had stopped fishing when I caught 3 and Randy only had
1, so I used the time to change the line on one of my reels.  It was
interesting that when we came back to the dock a man asked how we had done. 
When I told him that we had caught our limits, he asked what we were catching
them on.  I told him that we were just using worms and he replied that he
hadn’t brought any of those.  Mae was tending Jeff and Gale’s children while
they had gone out to eat.  Mae fixed Rachael, herself and I some lunch (Benji
didn’t want any as he had already eaten lunch.  Jeff and Gale soon came for
their children.  I then took a ½ hr. nap.  We took the valve box out to Sandi’s
and then stayed for dinner with her.  We watched the DVD titled “Akeelah and
the Bee” that Sandi recommended.  It was an excellent movie that I would
recommend for anyone to watch.  It was very late when we got home.  I had to
keep eating in order to stay awake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were tired
and didn’t get up until after 7AM.  I fed the animals and then came in and
showered before we had breakfast.  Mae was in Jr. Sunday School today with her
calling as Mrs. Friendly.  She said that it went very well and she sure enjoyed
her time today.  I was asked to give the opening prayer in Sacrament meeting. 
Sister Fallis played “Be Still My Soul” on the violin for a special musical
number and did a very special job.  Bob and Carroll invited us up for dinner
and of course it was very good.  Mae and I came back downstairs and read the
instructions from the New Family History information that the Bishop received. 
We then laid down for a nap.  Mae said that she would lay there for a few
minutes but ended up sleeping for a hour.  She needed it.  We drove up to David
and Shauna’s to take a Birthday gift to David and to visit for a few minutes.  We
stayed and played a game with the family before they went to bed.  It was good
to spend a little time with them.  After getting home I took the garbage out
and checked on the chickens.  The timer on the lights is still not working
right.  Mae got on the computer and read the letters of Shellie and Garrett’s. 
We sure enjoy having their letters also come to us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I called into
the bus dispatch and let them know that I could not drive today as we will be
in a class all day.  I woke about 5:30AM anyway.  I fed the animals while Mae
got ready and prepared our lunch and breakfast.  When I came in I helped with
the lunch by grinding a bottle of rabbit into sandwich spread.  We had a few
minutes of extra time so I got on the school district web site and started
bidding on field trips for next week.  We drove into Ogden and as I drove Mae
read information that we received a week or so ago concerning a Class Action
Law Suit, against the insurance Co. that we purchased an annuity.   We attended
a training session at the Ogden Family History Center from 9AM to 4PM.  It was
very good but we were very tired when we finished and came home.  At home we
watched a little TV and read more on the law suit.  The problem we are having
is that we don’t know what much of the information is talking about.  I also
talked to Bob about the addition and he and Carroll talked over some concerns
that I have and decided to put the project on hold at least this winter and
maybe not doing it at all.  It is late and we are tired so I think we will go
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
shortly after 3AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so I went into the front room
to the recliner.  I don’t know how long I was awake but finally did and didn’t
wake until almost 8AM.  I guess my concerns were about the investments with the
annuity company and the class action lawsuit.  I am also concerned about our
finances and am considering trying for a full time bus route.  Getting up late
put me behind so while Mae prepared breakfast I shaved.  After eating I took
care of the animals and then cut the hay.  I finished that at lunch time.  Mae
had invited Scott and Jeff for lunch but neither were able to come today.  it
was sure a good meal that they missed.  This afternoon I dug, and cut around
the tree that is infected with box elder bugs and has died.  I then hooked a
chain to the tree and pulled it over with my pickup.  I took a nap and then
when I woke Mae and I ate some super and went to the Clearfield Family History
Center.  Mae, Brother Bell and I were the only ones there and no one came in
for help so we used the time to study the New Family Search programs.  I had
planned to work on my PAF file but I had the wrong file with me.  After we
closed the center and came home I worked on my PAF file, getting some of Uncle
Grant and Aunt Marjorie’s Family’s information entered into my file.  This
information was sent to me by Virginia Lee Hill.  I then entered this entry
before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but after using the bathroom and reading my scriptures I snuggled back in bed
with Mae.  Jeff came by just before 8AM for some of his things.  We ate
breakfast and then I took care of the animals.  Bob and I then worked on
cutting up the tree that we took down.  We burned the motor out on the chain
saw we had so we went to the rental and rented one.  We were most of the day
getting it cut up and loaded into the pickup.  While I was working on the
project I got stung by a hornet on my right index finger.  I immediately went
into the house and sprayed the area with Colloidal Silver.  I put my gloves on
and went back to work.  When I quite working, 2 or 3 hours later my hand was
fine, the sting had quite and the swelling had gone down.  Mae went to Kohl’s
to look at sale items.  She called me just as we were finishing with the
loading of the tree, and asked if I wanted to come down to Kohl’s and look at
what she had picked out.  I went down and gave my feelings that she could buy
them all, plus I picked out a new jacket for me as I lost the one that Mike
gave me last winter.  Before Mae got home I started working on the computer, on
my PAF file.  I added information to Grant and Marjorie Hill’s family record. 
They are my uncle and aunt.  I have been able to establish contact with their
daughter Virginia Lee and it is with some of the information that she has sent that
I am updating my PAF files.  After some work on my files I quite for tonight
and entered my journal entry for today.  Mae did some on the internet while
waiting for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                After taking
care of the animals I cut my hay.  That left me with time to shower and eat
lunch before going to the bus compound to take a field trip.  I took Woods
Cross High school girls volleyball teams to Tooele High school for games.  WX
won in all three divisions.  It was almost 10PM when I returned home.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This morning
I took care of my animals and then Bob and I took the pickup load of trash to
the dumps.  This afternoon I took Hill Field Elementary classes to Dinosaur
Park in Ogden.  As soon as I returned home Mae and I left for American High
school to watch the American High vs Pleasant Grove high schools play
football.  Mae put the schools address in my GPS and also got directions from
Becky.  The directions that the GPS was giving me were opposite to those that
Mae was telling me.  I finally called Becky and got the directions again.  We finally
got there but between getting started late because of the field trip and the
wrong address, it was half time when we got there.  David, our grandson, is on
the American Fork team and so we enjoy see his games.  Pleasant Grove won 20 to
7.  When we got back to our car I checked the GPS to see why it was taking the
wrong place.  I found that Mae had miss-entered the East West coordinates.  We
stayed the night with Mike’s family.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was after
7AM when we got up.  I helped Becky with the breakfast preparations by cutting
up the melons.  They had friends and Family come over for a brunch before we
went to the Baptismal for Mattie.  The Baptism took place at the American Fork
Tabernacle.  Mike performed the baptism with Scott and me as witnesses.  The
water in the fount was very low but Mike was able to emerge Mattie completely
under the water.  We went back up to Mike and Becky’s for a little while and
got the rest of our items.  Mike and Becky gave us a pineapple peeler and cutter. 
They had one that Mae commented on one time so the next time they saw one, they
bought it for us.  Scott and Kylan had came down for the baptism, so when Scott
was ready to go home, Kylan ask if he could ride home with us.  We stopped at
Cabala’s and returned some items that we had bought from them but didn’t need
them.  We next stopped in Kaysville at the Sub-Way and bought something to eat
for lunch.  We got home at 4PM so I took a 15 minute nap and then we went to
Sister Vica Germer’s 90<sup>th</sup> Birthday Party.  As we watched the
pictures they had at her different ages through her life I couldn’t help but
wonder about life and the few there that even has a hope for the eternities.  I
am sure greatful for the hope the Gospel of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
gives to me.  We came home and Scott and Mishelle brought their children over
for us to tend this evening as they went out for the evening.  It took both Mae
and I working together to care for them.  After they returned and took the
children I watched a show on TV while Mae prepared for tomorrow when David,
Scott and Jeff’s family’s will be coming for dinner.  It was after midnight
when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5AM and didn’t go back to bed as I was concerned about waking Mae.  I did go
back to sleep in the recliner.  I helped Mae with breakfast, fed the animals
and got ready for church.  Meetings were very good.  We had a egg omelet for
lunch and then got ready for our family to come for dinner.  We enjoyed a nice
meal, played games and visited.  It has been a very nice afternoon but we were
tired when they all went home.  We set down and watched a show on TV before
going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke for a
few minutes at 5:15 AM but then went back to bed.  I slept until almost 8AM. 
Mae had got up a little earlier.  After breakfast I took care of the animals. 
I also cleaned out the chicken coop.  Roberta called and asked me to take a run
this afternoon but then she called back and said that I wouldn’t need to.  Mae
and took a ride to see the fall colors.  We drove up Weber Canon, up Trappers
Pass to Snow Basin, down the old road to Huntsville, over to Eden and Liberty,
tried to find the road that went out the north end of Ogden Valley to Paradise
but could not, over North Ogden Pass and went out to eat at Chuck-A-Rama in
Ogden.  It was a nice afternoon and evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke before
4 AM and was unable to go back to sleep.  I woke quite discouraged and as I set
in the recliner I could hear the freezer making a lot of noise and it ran a
lot.  The thoughts of needing a new freezer added to my depression.  My mind
reflected to things that I experienced posible before I was eight years old.  I
can see how those experiences, has had an influence on my feelings even today. 
One of the reflections that is always on my mind, every since we returned from
our mission, is why are my children having so many challenges with their
testimony’s of the Gospel?  Mae and I are very compatible in most ways but we
do have some differences that are still a challenge to me.  Mae woke about 8AM
but I hadn’t got much sleep since I first woke.  I am concerned about our
finances and whether or not I need to apply for a full time route.  There is
also a lot of concern about the situation with Mark and how to best handle
that.  I thought about our chickens and rabbits and the cost that has gone out
for them with not to much return yet.  We are still trying to figure out the
phones, the computers, the inter-net system and the television programs.  Then
to add to that is the world and especially the National moral deterioration. 
After Mae got up I took a shower, ate breakfast and took care of the animals. 
While out with the chickens I noticed that there was 4 quail under the trailer
and white shed.   I worked on the application for the bus route, cleaned out the
compressor areas of the refrigeration and the freezer, discussed the situation
about Mark with Bob and came to a conclusion that Bob, Carroll, Mae and I need
to visit about it more tomorrow.  We checked into a program that Quest is
offering with the phone service, high speed inter-net service and dish TV
reception.  Mae had dinner for Scott and Jeff,  so while they were here I
mentioned the inter-net service and Jeff told us that we had most everything we
need except for a new laptop computer.  I would just have to have wireless
phone service on my laptop.  This evening Mae and I went to the Family History
Center.  We didn’t have any patrons come tonight so we got quite a bit of studying
on the New Family History.  When we got home I entered this entry before we
went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae didn’t
sleep very well so after I got up I got her to lay back down.  I then got up
and in a few minutes she was up.  After breakfast I took care of the animals. 
I then got a letter ready to mail to Virginia Griggs with what Family History
information she had sent me entered on PAF.  I high lighted the areas where I
need more information.  I then helped Mae peel tomatoes for making spagitti
sauce.  After lunch I went over to the bus terminal and took a field trip,
taking Legacy Jr. High’s girls volleyball teams to Sunset Jr. High.  It was a
drop and return run so I brought the bus back to our place while I waited.  This
evening we watched a DVD before going to bed.</span></p>
