<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Segoe Print"'>At the request of Matt Price, from the Country Creek
Ward, Layton Utah Holmes Creek Stake, I am writing this Testimony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe Print"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Segoe Print"'>I bear my Testimony that I know that God lives, that
He is the Eternal Father in Heaven, the literal Father of our Spirits and that
He loves each one of his children.  I know that He has an Eternal plan, that
when followed, will allow each of his children, that will be faithful to those
eternal laws, the privilege of returning home to where he dwells.  I know that
Jesus Christ is God’s Eldest Son in the preexistent world and is His only
begotten Son upon this earth.  He was chosen to be the central figure in the
eternal plan of Our Heavenly Father, to come in the Meridian of time to this
earth, to be born of an earthly Mother, “Mary”.  To grow day by day learning
much the way each of us do, the experiences of earth life.  I know that He
lived a perfect life, not making even one mistake.  I am sure that because of
His Father that He was often tutored by Heavenly Angles.  I know that when he
reached the age that allowed him to begin His ministry, that He organized His
Church in its fullness here on earth.  I know that He set for us a perfect
example of how we are to try to live.  He lived in perfect harmony and
obedience to His Heavenly Fathers Eternal laws and ordinances.  I know that
because of Our Heavenly Father and Jesus's love for each of us that Jesus was
allowed to suffer the most unjust trial and then was crucified on the cross. 
Jesus is the Christ foretold by all the Prophets of God from the beginning of
time.  Through His selfless sacrifice He became the First to be resurrected and
made it possible for everyone that has been or that will be born to be
resurrected from the death of the body.  Also because of His love for us He was
willing to suffer and paid the Eternal price for all the sins of those that are
willing to take upon then self His Name and be obedient to His commandments. 
Through this Atonement for our sins, we will be able to be cleansed from our
sins and return to live with Our Heavenly Father and receive Eternal
Exaltation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Segoe Print"'>I know that there was a falling away into total
Apostasy from Christ’s True Church after His death and the death of His chosen Apostles. 
The authority from God for man to act in His name was taken.  Although many men
tried to find the truth and many brought about great forces of change, it
wasn’t until April 6, 1830 that The Church of Jesus Christ was restored through
Joseph Smith Jr. and subsequently followed by the restoration of all the
ancient authority and gifts that God had given to the Prophets of old until
there was a fullness of the Gospel as given by Christ Himself.  I know and bear
Testimony that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is that Church
and we have been and are today lead by A Prophet of God, even until the
present, with that Prophet being Gordon B. Hinckley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Segoe Print"'>I pray with all the desires of my heart that I may
always bear this testimony and be obedience all of my life.  I bear this
testimony in the Name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.</span></p>
