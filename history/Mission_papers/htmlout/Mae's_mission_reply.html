<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dear Brethren:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When I was dating Kenneth Browning,
who is now my husband, he was helping to support his older brother on his
mission.  Ken had always wanted to go on a mission, but after he talked to our
Bishop he was advised to get married.  The Bishop told him that when you meet
and fall in love with a special companion, then that is a mission in life.  I
had told Ken I would wait for him while he went on his mission, but we took the
Bishop’s advice and got married.  We continued to help support Ken’s missionary
brother for over a year.  Whenever we would go to missionary farewells or
homecomings, Ken would feel bad wishing that he had been able to go.  I told
him that after we raised our family, we would go together.  I looked forward to
this time, although I know I was more excited that he could finally go out to
serve the Lord, than for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The day came when we met with our
Bishop and he handed each of us our mission papers to fill out.  As he handed
mine to me, an overwhelming feeling of love, excitement and joy came over me, tears
came to my eyes and the thoughts came to me “These are my papers, not just
Ken’s.  The Lord wants me to go too.”  I have helped our sons fill out their
papers to go on missions and now I will be filling out mine.”  I felt I had the
confirmation that this mission wasn’t just for Ken, but for me also.  I love
the Lord and am excited to go out in the mission field to share his gospel with
our brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When I was being interviewed by our
Stake President and he asked me if I felt I was worthy and ready to go out and
represent our Savior, Jesus Christ, again an overwhelming feeling of love came
over me and, through my tears, I managed to say “I hope so as I love him and
want to serve him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I was surprised, when we opened the
call and saw that we were to serve in the Philippines Angeles Mission, as I had
supposed that we would be serving somewhere in the states, but I am excited and
willing to go wherever the Lord wants us to serve.  I am also excited to be
able to serve with my best friend and eternal companion.  I feel inadequate, in
many ways to preach the gospel, but I know that with the Lord’s help all things
are possible.</p>
