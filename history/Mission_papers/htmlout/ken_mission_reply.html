<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Brethren:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I have wanted this call to serve a
full time mission for as long as I can remember.  As a young child, though my
parents were not active at that time, if I knew that a Returning Missionary was
to give his report, I was at Sacrament Meeting.  That goal continued with me
through the years.  Prior to my 19<sup>th</sup> Birthday, my brother (18 months
older), who had never wanted to go on a mission, and had became inactive, reversed
his life and asked to serve.  My Father (not active) would not support him.  My
Mother felt she could come up with 1/4 of the money, the Elders Quorum would
donate 1/4 more, and I (having a good job after school) offered the rest.  When
I turned 19, there wasn’t enough money for the two of us, so I stayed home and
fell in love with a wonderful girl and got married.  I have never regretted
getting married, but have always regretted having not served a full time
mission.  We have had all four of our sons serve full time missions and as of
the 20<sup>th</sup> of February 2003, all six of our children will have married
in the Temple.  I now am excited to have things work out so that I and my
Eternal Companion may serve the Lord as Full Time Missionaries.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>My 2<sup>nd</sup> son, who is in
the medical profession and is concerned for our health and safety, told me that
I had not disclosed my complete medical history.  I promised him that I would
include an explanation in my Acceptance Letter.  Approximately 15 years ago, I
had a Strep Infection go through out my body.  After being treated by a
Physician and released, pain began returning to my feet.  It continued until I
returned to the Doctor.  When he couldn’t find a problem, I went to another and
another because the pain was getting continuously worse.  The 4<sup>th</sup>
Doctor, after running every test he could think of doing, said that he did not
know what I had.  He felt that I would continue to get worse and that at the
rate the pain was increasing, within three months I would be in a wheelchair
for the rest of my life.  My Father-in-law took me to a Nutritionist and we
found that I could control the pain through Diet.  I can not drink milk, eat
foods with sugar added to it, and eat very little red meat, but can eat chicken
and fish.  I drink whey as a substitute for milk, and take mainly two food
supplements as well as a multivitamin.  These items I can take with me.  For
over five years, I have been mainly pain free and have worked in the
construction field of labor doing all the trades.  I do not feel that this
problem will, in any way, interfere with my service to the Lord, but want to be
totally up front with you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>My Father In Heaven has so richly
blessed my life in every way.  Not only am I excited for this opportunity to
experience a mission, but want to serve My Lord, that I might be found worthy
of His Eternal Blessings.  “I Will Go Where You Want Me To Go”.</p>
