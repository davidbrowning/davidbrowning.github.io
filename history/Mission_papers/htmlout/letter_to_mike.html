<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Mike,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am writing this e-mail to you as we are not
quite sure just what to do.  I don’t think that you should share this letter
with anyone else at this time.  I will try to explain what we know and have
pieced together and maybe even configured within our own minds, then ask you to
think about it and pray about it, and then advise us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            During the past few weeks we have got
information or hints of information, some from Jeff, in a vague way and some
from Gale and some from other comments made from others.  These have quite
upset us as to just what is happening, to the point that your mother is in
tears very often and very upset, we are both concerned.  We have even wondered
if we need to return home to see for our self what is happening.  As you might
know, that while Mom’s Uncle Van and Aunt Allison were on there mission, their one
son left the church and severed all family relationship.  They were heart
broken, as you can imagine.  I think this memory is adding to your mothers
worries.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Anyway, let me try to tell you what
we have learned.  Jeff, through private e-mails to us, has indicated that he
feels like the worlds biggest deceiver.  He is trying to tell Gale that he
loves her but he can’t get himself to believe it.  We think that he has never
forgotten his feelings for Nicky and is possibility even blaming the Lord that
he gave two years to serve and during that time lost Nicky.  What ever his
concerns are, they are affecting his schooling, and he is having a lot of depression. 
Gale, again through private e-mails, has indicated that, though their love is
growing deeper, she is very concerned about Jeff.  She said that Jeff is having
problems with depression; also she feels that he is having problems with his
testimony.  Jeff will pray and have scripture study with her, but is not doing
these on his own.  He doesn’t want to attend the Temple and he is studding some
books that question the church, at school.  She said that Jeff has talked to
David and he, David, is also having some of the same feelings about the church. 
Gale indicated that she feels that Jeff is questioning his testimony at to the
Church being true.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mike, my feelings are that my first
responsibility is to my wife and my second is to my family.  At this point I am
not sure just what to do, but if I am needed at home, then that is where I will
be.  Will you please assess the situation and give me some feedback?  Our
concerns for Sandi have been hard to know just how to help, but this may even
be more serious.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We love and appreciate all you do
for us,</p>
