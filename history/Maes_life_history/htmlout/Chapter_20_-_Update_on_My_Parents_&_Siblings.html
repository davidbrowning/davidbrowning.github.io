align=left hspace=12 alt=P1190314><b>Dad</b> had been in the High Counsel of
the North Davis Stake for quite a few years.  He really enjoyed this position. 
Shortly after, Dad was asked to be <b>the Bishop of the Sunset 2nd ward </b>as
Bishop Nicholas was being released after being Bishop for eleven years.  What a
challenge for dad.  Dad Chose Carl Grimstad and Dwane Baldwin for his
counselors.  A few months later, Duane had to move so both he and Carl were
released since Carl's work affected his time too much.  Clayton Peterson and
Brother VanBrocklin are his new counselors. Everyone loved dad and he was a
wonderful bishop.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  <b>Mom</b> is the Primary <b>Stake Secretary of the North
Davis Stake</b>.  She enjoys this very much. (I have written much more about
Mom in other chapters)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  <b>Bryce </b>is on his mission in Uruguay.  Mom lets us
read his letters and lately they are very wonderful and enlightening.  During
the first part of his mission he was quite discouraged and homesick.  I think
this was because most of his companions were just about ready to come home so
they just went sightseeing and buying souvenirs and didn't do much missionary
work.  Now that he's senior companion, things are working out better for him
and he's enjoying his mission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> <b>Hal</b> is still the same old carefree &quot;live for
today, for tomorrow you may die&quot; fellow.  He is a fireman here at one of
the fire stations in Ogden.  He lives with the folks, and is a pretty good kid
other than he isn't a bit religious and spends his money as fast as he gets
it.  He is good to help the down trotten though.  He always felt sorry for
Uncle Royal and Aunt Maurine, and would go visit them and take them gifts.  When
he was in the Air Force and stationed on the island of Crate, he was always
helping the poor people there - buying groceries for them, especially his house
helper as he felt sorry for her and would buy groceries for her to take home to
her family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> <b>Terry</b> is a Junior at Clearfield High School.  He's
six foot four inches tall and is really thin.  A beanpole you might say.  When
we would invite him to our home and I would fix us meals, I wondered if I would
ever fill him up, especially with pancakes.  I thought he must have a “hollow”
leg.  He's a good piano player and is really studious.  He likes to read.  I
wish I was more like him in that respect.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Georgia</b> is a Freshman at Sunset Junior High School. 
She's really getting cute.  She's a sweet girl and I'm really thankful for a
sister like her.  She went up to camp with me this year and really had a great
time.  She tends Sandy for me sometimes and is really good with her.  Sandy
just loves her.  I'm eleven years older than Georgia, and Georgia is eleven
years older than Sandy - give or take a few months.  When I was eleven, Grandpa
Porter passed away, and when Georgia was eleven, Grandpa Bushnell passed away. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Kim </b>is feeling his oats right now and is a worry to
our parents.  He isn’t as respectful to our parents as he needs to be.  I hope
he changes and realizes what wonderful parents we have.  (He did and is a
wonderful man, son, husband, father, brother, friend and a righteous son of
God.  I am proud of him and love him very much.)</p>

align=left hspace=12 alt=DSC04092><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>HAL &amp;
JEAN</span></b> - Hal met Jean Duke as her parents were friends of our
neighbors, the Thompsons, who bought Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell’s home after
they passed away.  Jean and her parents came to visit the Thompsons and Hal and
Jean met.  Hal had been going with a cute girl, Kathy, who I really liked.  She
was sweet and kind and pretty.  She loved Hal and he liked her, but she was
Catholic, so I think our parents were not as excited that he might get serious
and marry her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>When Hal met Jean, he started dating her and they got
married.  Dad was the Bishop of the Sunset 2<sup>nd</sup> ward at the time, so
they asked him to marry them and they asked Ken and I if they could be married
at our home.  We were happy that they wanted to do that.</b>  I think it was
just the two of them, their parents and Ken and I at the wedding.  Ken put cans
on a rope and tied it to the back of their car.  They had their reception at
the Sunset Church the next night.  It was decorated beautifully, and turned out
nice.  Our little Sandy was their flower girl.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=149 height=213

align=left hspace=12 alt="Cindi Porter, Hal &amp; Jean's daughter">Jean had
been semi active in the church, but I don’t think she went to church after she
married Hal.  They bought a home not too far away from our home in Ogden, so we
got together often and while <b>Hal and Ken played Chess, Jean and I would
visit.  Hal would usually win as Hal was such an intelligent kid that he was
good at everything he did.  Ken won once and was really excited about that</b>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=319 height=239
src="Chapter_20_-_Update_on_My_Parents_&amp;_Siblings_files/image004.jpg"
align=left hspace=12 alt=DSC03044> Hal &amp; Jean had a daughter, Cindi, who
Hal adored.  Hal took her to amusement parks, other parks and played with her a
lot.  She loved him too.  Hal took our kids on rides in his little Volkswagen. 
He would take them on roads down in Hooper and go fast as the road went up and
down hills, they loved that.  He also took them to Lagoon with Cindy, and would
play the games there and won them all a stuffed animal.  <b>They thought he was
the greatest</b>! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:3.0pt'>Hal &amp; Jean, Bryce &amp; Deana
and Ken &amp; I would do things together also. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b> Hal was addicted to sleeping
pills as when he was in the military, they got him on them.  He had not slept
well as a child, but no one knew this.  Hal just figured that everyone just
mainly rested at night.  I don’t know how he was able to function at school and
get good grades, but he did.  He used to tease me by saying:</b> <b>“Why do you
spend so much time studying for school?” and I would tell him that I wasn’t
smart like he was and had to study to get good grades</b>.  <b>Hal could just
listen to the teachers as they taught and explained the information the
students were to learn and then he could ace the tests.  He didn’t do much
homework, but he still got good grades.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Anyway, <b>Hal would overdose on
sleeping pills at times and Jean would have to call an ambulance to take him to
the hospital, and then she would call Mom and say “Well, your son did it
again.”  Mom said how hard this was on her, that her heart would seem like it
went up into her throat, when she heard these words.  One time I was just
getting out of the hospital after having David, and Mom &amp; Dad were getting
in the elevator as Ken, our baby and I were getting out.  At first, I thought
they were coming to see me, but after looking at their faces, I could tell
something was wrong – they were coming to see Hal as he had overdosed again. 
When Bryce &amp; Deanna were having their Bryce &amp; Deanna were having their
reception, he did it again and put a damper on their reception, especially for
Mom &amp; Dad</b>.  <u>Hal would call Bryce sometimes and ask him to go hiking
with him, so he could wear off the drugs, and Bryce would but Bryce would
become upset, when at the top of the mountain, Hal would pop in more pills.</u>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> <b>I would visit Hal at the
hospital and we had some good talks.  I loved that brother now.</b>  <b>He and
Jean were having problems because of his overdosing, so he would call me, and
we would have long talks</b>.  <b>Ken and I had moved to Arizona, but moved
back to Utah at this time, and I believe it was because Hal needed me, and I
was so glad I was here for him.</b>  He told me that Jean didn’t love him.  I
talked with her about this and she said she didn’t know how to love, as her
parents hadn’t shown her love as she was growing up.  That is so sad.  <u>Jean
eventually decided to take Cindy and separate from Hal for a time as she felt
by doing this, he would miss them so much that he would get help and get off
the sleeping pills, but this backfired.</u>  <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>He
took his life<u>.</u></span></b><u>  He had told me that he would only marry
once as he had seen the grief his buddies had had when they got divorces, and
how hard it was that they had to pay child support and alimony.  I think that Hal
loved Jean and Cindy and thought he was losing them and it was too much for
him.  </u>Mom &amp; Dad’s Bishop was a social worker and he said that when a
person has been on sleeping pills for over 7 years that if something traumatic
happens in their lives they can’t take it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I well remember the day that Mom
got the word that this had happened.  We were living in the home I grew up in,
in Sunset.  Mom would call me every morning to see how we were doing and just
to talk.  This morning she didn’t call, and I felt something was wrong.  <b>I
called her, and she was hysterical.  I finally got it out of her that the
police had just come to tell her Hal had taken his life</b>.  When he hadn’t
reported to work for a couple of days and hadn’t called in, his boss called the
police and the police found him in his home.  I jumped in the car and drove
down to Mom &amp; Dad’s, but I know the Lord blessed me that I didn’t get in an
accident as<b> I was crying so hard, I could hardly see where I was going</b>. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jean felt bad and felt that we
blamed her for his death, but we tried to reassure her that we were not blaming
her and that we still loved her and Cindy and wanted them to still be a part of
our family and our lives.  Mom &amp; Dad were great to invite them to all our
family activities and they came, and they were in our family pictures too.  We
felt bad that Jean didn’t let Cindy come to her father’s funeral or see him in
his casket, so that there no closure for Cindy.  I think Cindy suffered the
rest of her life partly because of this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>My parents are expecting their mission call
today, June 30, 1979.</b>  I've written most of my life story as I've lived it,
but now I'm typing it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Dad &amp; Mom went to the
Boston, Massachusetts Mission.</b>  They loved it there in many ways, but
because of the roads, turnabouts &amp; traffic, it was easy for dad to get
lost, so they went with the young Elders some of the time.  Mom &amp; Dad did
convert at least two families and they stayed friends with them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>They also became great friends of a
lady whose husband had passed away and she had a terrible phobia that she
couldn’t leave her Highrise apartment.  She had too much anxiety, so mom &amp;
dad would get her groceries, pay her bills, get her medicine, etc.  This lady
loved my parents, especially mom.  Everyone loved mom, and dad too as they are
great people and love the Lord and his children.  This lady wanted to join the
church and be sealed to her husband, so she asked Mom if she would have hers
and her husband’s work done after she passed away.  They didn’t have any
children.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mom and this lady would call each
other frequently and when this lady passed away, <b>Mom kept her promise and
got the work ready and Ken and I went to the temple for mom to act as proxies
for this good sister and her husband.</b>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mom had problems, while on her
mission, and had to have a hysterectomy and other surgery.  They felt this was
a blessing from the Lord as the Mayo Clinic is in Boston, so Mom had good
care.  While mom was recuperating, she could make phone calls and set up
appointments for dad and the young Elders.  Mom &amp; Dad set a great example
for their family. </p>

afterwards) that if he had stepped a few steps further back, he would have been
on the D Military Zone border and could have been shot.  He wrote to our folks
and said that the castles there were big and beautiful in a way, but they were
damp and cold.  He said how blessed we were to live in America where we have

all passed away.  Cindy’s daughter, Samantha “Sam<span style='font-size:16.0pt'>”
</span>Dugan.  Sam was raised by Brian and Mercedes Dugan as they had her as
their “foster daughter” whenever Cindy was in rehab.  Finally, Cindy’s caseworker
told Cindy she had one more chance to get off drugs and if she couldn’t,
Samantha would be given to the Dugan’s to adopt as they loved her and wanted to
adopt her.  This happened, and it was tragic for Cindy as she loved Sam so much
and was what she was living for.  The Dugans were not members of our church,
but they were good people and good parents.  They also had a son and Sam and
Leam enjoyed each other.  He was younger than Sam.  Sam graduated from high
school, college and became a lawyer.  He met a good guy and they hit it off and
lived together for several years and just got married this year.  I invited
them to dinner with us a few months ago before they were married, and I was
disappointed that we were not invited to the reception they had in Salt Lake. 
The Dugans live in Colorado, so they were married there and had a reception
there, but Sam has lived in Salt Lake while going to the University of Utah,
and so they had a open house there also.  Nolan, Bryce &amp; Deanna’s son, has
stayed close with Sam and so was invited to their wedding in Colorado, and did
go to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>BRYCE, DEANNA &amp; FAMILY:  </b>Bryce and Deanna had
five wonderful children, three sons and two daughters.  Nolan, Shanna, Wendy,
Chad and Darin.  They raised their family in Clearfield, then after their
children were all married, they went on a mission to Spain.  It was a difficult
mission mainly because of their strict mission president.  Bryce was a Branch
President there and they served to the best of their ability.  I think because
of this experience, they didn’t care to go on another mission.  After their
mission, they sold their home in Clearfield and bought a home in Willard.  They
are happy there.  Both Bryce &amp; Deanna served as officiators in the Ogden
Temple and then transferred to the Brigham City Temple after it’s
construction.  Deanna was diagnosed with cancer in her liver.  They found a
large tumor and had to shrink it with Chemotherapy before operating to remove
it.  Two more tumors came back later, and they operated again to take them
out.  This about did poor Deanna in, but she is strong and recuperated.  It
came back again, so they again put her on Chemotherapy.  It didn’t help, so
they have done radiation.  We sure hope this kills the cancer cells as Deanna
is such a wonderful person.  She was their Relief Society President before her
first bout with cancer and she wasn’t released.  She had two good counselors,
and they took over and just talked with Deanna by phone or came to her house for
meetings.  Everyone loves Deanna.  All our children were so sad when they heard
she had cancer for they all love her too.  Bryce still serves as an officiator
in the Brigham City Temple and has been their High Priest Leader and has held
several other positions. Bryce has health problems too, lung and breathing
problems, COPD, I think. They have several grandchildren also and Shanna’s
oldest, Breanna, went on a mission, went to college, met a wonderful man and
married in the temple.  Tanner has a beautiful voice and uses his talent.  He
went on a mission and is now in college.  Wendy’s oldest went on a mission but
came home early and is struggling with her testimony, which is a heartache to
her parents and we understand this.  The other grandchildren are still in
school – Elementary up to High School.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These children have all grown up and all are married with
children except Kaleesee.  Joshua is homosexual, so is married to a male.  We
are sad that he has gone this way, but his partner is nice and Joshua is a good
nephew.  Charity lives in Virginia and has four daughters (I think), Dezeree
has a cute little boy born last year, Summer has a little daughter and a son. 
Mysha has two little boys, one is adopted and the other was born a couple of
months after they got the cute little adopted son.  They had a son who passed
away right after birth, and they hadn’t been able to have any other children
until this happened last year.  Joshua and his partner are fostering some
children.  Caleb has three children, I think.  I haven’t kept up with them
since Charity, Dezeree and Caleb live out of state. </p>
