align=left hspace=12 alt=118>In November of 1991, we were able to buy our home
here in Layton.  It’s a nice home in a young neighborhood &amp; ward.  The
families are the ages of our older children and their children.  We are
definitely the grandparents, but we love being grandparents - so it’s great.  </p>

align=left hspace=12 alt=78><b>We enjoy it here, and it has been a good move
for Jeff.</b>  He found wonderful friends, especially <b>Trent Teeples and
later Anna</b>.  They helped him become very involved in music, drama and
seminary council.  Ken and I loved to go watch the plays Jeff were in when he
was at Layton High.  We took our mothers with us and they enjoyed them too. 
Jeff was not in Latones, which was a mixed choir, but was in the male choir,
Lyrics.  I loved to go to the school when they performed or other places during
the Christmas holidays as they put on a great Christmas program.  They didn’t
just stand and sing, they had a choreographer who taught them special dance
moves.  It was fun to watch them.   Jeff was first at Central Davis Jr. High
and Scott was at Layton High.  Jeff had a friend (can’t remember his name) and
we took him with us when Ken, Jeff &amp; I went to visit Shellie, Roy &amp;
family in Mesa, Arizona.  We stopped at the sand dunes on the way home and he
and Jeff had a great time playing on them.  We had a little Sprint which Scott
drove until he went on his mission and when Jeff turned 16 he drove it.  I’ll
tell a couple of experiences of him with the sprint.  Jeff and his friend were
up in East Layton and the friend wanted to drive.  Jeff let him and he didn’t
make a turn and did some damage to the car.  <b>(Ask Jeff if I have this story
correct). </b> Another time Jeff &amp; Trent went driving up in the mountains
and we got a call late at night that they were stranded. I don’t remember how
they got a hold of us as there were no cell phones then.  Anyway, Ken called
Rodney Stevenson, who was a mechanic and a close neighbor and they drove up and
brought the boys home and I think it was the next day that Ken and Rodney went
back to get the car with Rodney’s truck.  Rodney told Jeff “This isn’t even a
place that Jeeps should go, let alone the Sprint.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Scott made friends here too</b>,
although the friends he made, while living with Grandma, are still his good
friends and since they all drive and go to Layton High, it’s easy for them to
still do things together.  Scott learned to swim and dive while living in Arizona
so he got on the Layton High Diving team.  He is really good, so went to state
competition.  I love to watch him dive.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Scott</b> had dated several girls in Layton and the
surrounding area.  The first one he went steady with was Rachel.  She was a
nice girl, but she liked Scott too much and I was glad when they broke up.  He
dated another girl and she really worried me as she always wanted to be with
him and she would call him all the time and after David returned from his
mission and he and Scott shared the basement bedroom, she knocked on their
window late one night and told him she had baked him some cookies.  I was glad
when he started dating <b>Mishelle</b>.  After just a few dates with her, they
were talking and she told him that she would never marry any boy who hadn’t
gone on a mission.  Scott decided that maybe other good girls would feel this
way, so he made an appointment with the Bishop to see what he needed to do to
prepare for his mission.  At this time, he was working at <b>Golden Corral in Clearfield.</b>  He was hired on as a dishwasher and then they moved him up to a cook.  We
were excited that he had this good job, but didn’t realize that the manager and
others played hard rock music back there and Scott liked it, got hooked on it
and started buying those CDs.  When we first started hearing him play that
music, we were upset.  The bishop told him he would need to get rid of those
CDs, read the Book of Mormon, etc.  He was great!  He came home and did get rid
of all those hard rock music CDs and did what the bishop asked him to do and
did prepare himself for his mission.  He continued to date Mishelle and they
fell in love and she told him she wanted to wait for him.  He told her she
could date while he was gone as he didn’t think it was fair for her to stay
home, but she wouldn’t date others.  She had plenty of chances, but she loved
Scott and wanted him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I would like to insert a <b>spiritual
experience</b> I had while living with Ken’s Mom in Layton, and <b>Scott</b>
was working at the Golden Corral in Clearfield.  Like I said before, Scott got
hooked on hard rock music at the Golden Corral as it was played there.  He
liked this music and bought CDs.  I had a hysterectomy and bladder surgery and
was home recuperating.  Scott and his friends wanted to go to a concert at Park
 City.  He would be driving the Sprint.  I wasn’t excited about him going, let
alone driving, as many at those concerts were drunk or stoned and would still
drive, so I was worried that Scott might be in an accident or have other
problems with the people there.  I trusted Scott, but I didn’t trust many of
those who would be at the concert.  Anyway, he went.  Ken, his mother and Jeff
were asleep and it was late, but I couldn’t sleep because of worrying about
Scott and also the discomfort I was in.  I began to imagine all sorts of bad
things and I had so much anxiety.  Finally, I realized I needed to pray
sincerely for Scott’s safety.  As soon as I asked the Lord to protect him, I
had a warm, peaceful feeling come over me, the anxiety and worry left, and I
knew Scott was alright.  I was so thankful to my Heavenly Father at this time
for his love and concern for me, for Scott and all of us.  Scott returned home
soon after, but he had come close to an accident and as we talked, I shared my
concerns and feelings with him and how Heavenly Father had answered my prayers.</p>

take pictures of Scott before the graduation began because they have to turn in
their caps and gowns right after the graduation.  It didn’t work out to get

<p class=MsoNormal> <b>David met Shauna Howard in one of his classes.</b>  They
dated off and on for a while and he was also dating other girls.  A funny
incident happened when he took Shauna Howard to a stake dance.  We were at that
dance and David introduced her to us.  I thought then what a beautiful and
sweet girl she was.  The funny thing was that he introduced her as Shauna Jones
(another girl he was going with).  Shauna didn’t think too much about it, she
just thought it was a slip of the tongue, but when he introduced her to Georgia
&amp; Rick as Shauna Jones, she knew he must be dating another Shauna – Shauna
Jones.  They had a talk about it later.  He hadn’t dated either for a while as
he was busy with his studies, but a special event came up and he wanted to go,
but needed a date.  He asked me about it and I said: “Why don’t you take Shauna
Howard, she’s a beautiful and sweet girl.”  He called and she accepted.  They
started dating steadily after that.  He decided to go into the medical field. 
He lived with us two years until he and Shauna got married.  I enjoyed having
him come home and tell me about the things he learned at college and the
experiences he had.  Shauna is another beautiful daughter-in-law and we are
very thankful for her.  She is a great addition to our family.  They were
married in the Manti Temple.  They are living in Clearfield.  Shauna graduated

missionary son.  His cousin, Bryan is on his mission to Russia
and he wrote Scott saying: “I’m glad I am here on my mission as I couldn’t take
the “heat” where you are.”  Scott wrote back:  I’m glad I’m here on my mission
as I couldn’t take the “cold” where you are.” <b>Mishelle</b> wrote to Scott
and would come to our home each Sunday to have dinner with us and then play
games.  Jeff played the piano beautifully and Mishelle played beautifully also,
so they had fun on the piano.  We enjoyed having her come and hoped she would
wait for Scott.  A few weeks before Scott returned from his mission, we noticed
that Mishelle had a terrible cough each Sunday when she would come to visit. 
We asked her about it and she said that she has been to the doctor several
times, but he just keeps giving her antibodies, but they don’t seem to be
helping.  I told her she should go to a specialist as her cold and cough
sounded awful.  Her mother took her to a specialist and they determined that
she had Hodgkin’s Cancer and it was in the 4<sup>th</sup> stage.  We were all
very worried.  She had to be on Chemo for 8 months so they had to postpone
their wedding date.  She needed Scott at this time so he put off his education

Park </span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>– <b>Rich &amp; Lois.  </b></span>They
bought a time share condo there and invited us to come and share it with them
the last week in January or first week in February for several years.  They had
snowmobiles and we would ride double and ride through beautiful white meadows,
up and down the sides of the old railroad track, go to Big Springs and watch
the trout, Moose, Elk, Geese, etc.  It is beautiful there.  Ken &amp; Rich
would go to Lion Head, but it was too dangerous for Lois &amp; I.  We would
ride up past the continental divide and go up on top of a mountain called “Two
Top” where the wind and snow had made beautiful formations on the trees.  It
was so beautiful and you could see all over.  I was nervous going up and back
down, however.  The last time we did this, Rich &amp; Lois didn’t go with us so
both Ken and I had our own snowmobiles.  The snow and wind had made deep hills
and gullies and it was so frightening (at least for me).  Ken kept waving for
me to come up, but I finally went up one so steep that it flipped me and the
snowmobile over and down we came and landed by a pine tree.  If I had hit the
pine tree, I could have been seriously hurt.  The snowmobile was buried and Ken
and some other riders got the snowmobile out.  I wouldn’t go up any further and
I was really frightened to go back down – but I made it.  Other times, all of
us went in their motor home to Yellowstone Park, then unloaded the snowmobiles
and road the snowmobiles through the Park.  It was really cold, but we dressed
warm in snowmobile suits and helmets and would stop at the “warming shacks” to
get warm, drink hot chocolate and eat our lunch.  It was so beautiful.  We saw
lots of buffalo, Elk, Fox, Geese, Swans, etc.  We also run into a herd of
buffalo a couple of times.  You would pass other riders, as many like to
snowmobile there.  There is a clubhouse close to the condo where we would go
and sit in hot tubes, swim, play ping pong, etc<b>.  </b>Lois &amp; I would
help each other cook meals &amp; clean.  We would read, visit, play games,
especially “Mormon Bridge” as that is Rich’s favorite.  We would also watch
videos, etc., when not snowmobiling.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our Country Creek Ward was divided and they made
the Country View Ward, which put our home in that new ward.  Bishop Rudd was
the Bishop of the Country Creek Ward and had been since our family bought our
home there.  A family had just bought a home in our neighborhood, but their
stay was supposed to be only temporary while they built their new home in Fruit
Heights.  They were a steward, faithful family, so he was called to be our new
bishop.  When he was sustained as Bishop, he spoke and told the ward members
that if they were called to positions, they shouldn’t decline saying that it
wasn’t a convenient time as it surely wasn’t a convenient time for him.  He
wanted to spend most of his spare time overseeing the building of his home and
with being called to be Bishop, he wouldn’t have much spare time.  Well, he
called me in and asked me to be the Relief Society President.  When he asked if
I would accept the calling, I told him “How can I refuse after you gave your
talk.”  I fasted and prayed about my counselors and secretary and the Lord did
bless me with a wonderful presidency.   My first counselor was <b>Jolynn
Stevenson</b> and she was great – so dependable, had great ideas and was always
there to do her part and go visiting the sisters with me.  She was energetic
and enthusiastic.  My other counselor, secretary and teachers were wonderful
too.  When I asked to be released due to not having enough time to fulfill my
calling like I needed to, as I was having to help my mom and Ken’s mom lots
more because of their age and health, our son, David, was going to be married
so I had things to do for that, and I was still working full time at Davis
School District and it was a stressful job, especially at this time.  When I
told my counselors that I was going to be released, they were disappointed as
they had enjoyed serving with me and as a presidency.  <u>Jolynn was expecting
their last baby and when the baby was born, her and Rodney named her Libby
Mae.  She gave her the name of “Mae” after me.  I was honored to have them do
that, and Libby Mae has always been close to me.</u>  Jolynn would make a
special effort to invite me to special occasions for Libby, or to stop over,
call, etc.  She, Rodney and Libby Mae just stopped in to see me on Monday (July
3, 2017 – just rewriting and adding to this history) to let me know that Libby
Mae was leaving for her mission to the state of Washington the following day. 
She had lost our phone number, so hadn’t been able to let me know that she was
speaking in church prior to leaving on her mission.  We had a good visit and
several hugs.</p>

Roy &amp; Garrett to two of Garrett’s “T” ball games.  It was fun watching him
play ball.  It doesn’t seem that long ago that we were watching our own sons
play ball.  We came home and were busy with sending out wedding invitations for
Scott &amp; Mishelle’s wedding which was on June 1<sup>st</sup>.  Sandi, Shauna
and I gave Mishelle a bridal shower, for the family, on the 16<sup>th</sup> at
our home.  It turned out really nice and she was excited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Tuesday night, the 21<sup>st</sup>, Ken and I
went out to Tooele to watch Chelci play softball.  She plays 1<sup>st</sup>
base and is really good.  I had called JaNae to see if she could come to the
game also so we could see her.  She did, but so did her dad, which made it a
little uncomfortable since Terry met Sandi there.  Dave stayed out by the edge
of the field, but we felt we should go speak to him since he had been our
son-in-law for 16 years and since JaNae was living with him and we wanted to
keep relations good because of her.  Ken went over and talked with him.  I
think I would have enjoyed it more, had Dave not come this time.  Sandi said he
had only been to one other game, and she was sure he came this time just
because we were coming.  It was Chelci’s birthday the next day so we took her
birthday present out to her this night.  We got her a journal and some black
Levi’s.  She opened it and was excited, especially with the journal as she had
wanted one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jeff graduated from seminary on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.</b> 
It was held at the Stake Regional Center in Bountiful.  We took Ken’s mom and
my mom with us.  It was really nice and we were very proud of Jeff.  He also
sang in the seminary choir which sang during the program.  Trent, Jeff’s best
friend, is the president of the seminary council and Jeff was over scripture
mastery on the council.  Trent spoke and gave an outstanding talk.  We were
very impressed, but Trent is an outstanding young man as also Jeff is.  We went
to get ice cream after.  Jeff had ridden his motorcycle.  He had to be there
early and even though there was another vehicle for him to take, he decided to
ride the motorcycle.  As we were coming home, it started to rain, it rained
really hard and so I was really worried about Jeff.  Upon arriving home, after
taking our mother’s home, Jeff’s motorcycle was there and I was really
relieved.  Upon entering the house, Jeff came out of the bathroom after having
taken a hot shower.  He said it wasn’t a good experience, to say the least, but
he thought, while he was driving through the pouring rain and he was getting
soaked and freezing and the roads were terrible to drive on – that he was
thankful for a good helmet so he could see and keep his head warm, for leather
gloves to keep his hands warmer, for a leather jacket to keep him warmer than
he would have been, and for a motorcycle and not a horse or covered wagon like
the pioneers had.  He was also grateful for a warm home to come to and a hot
shower to be in and dry clothes to put on.  *I thought – Wow! What a special
son we have, to not complain, but to realize his blessings and thank the Lord
for them.  I’m not so sure I would have thought those things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had Stake Relief Society Leadership Meeting on
May 23<sup>rd</sup> and I had been so busy with everything else, I hadn’t had
as much time as I would have liked to prepare, but it was a little different,
thank goodness.  We held it at Marge’s home, had a luncheon and at my table
(Homemaking counselors), we just shared homemaking meeting ideas, board meeting
ideas, etc.  I had sent them a letter asking that they come prepared to share
these ideas.  I put together some ideas and other materials to give to them. 
(I did a lot of this at work during my lunch hours since I didn’t have it at
home.)  It went really well, and all but two of the wards were represented. 
One had to leave town to take care of a new grandchild and the other was ill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On the 24<sup>th</sup>, we went to the high
school to watch Jeff perform in the Extravanza which the LaTones, Lerics &amp;
Lace present at the end of the year.  Jeff is in the Lerics.  It was wonderful
and I especially liked watching Jeff as he is dramic and a very good dancer as
well as singer.  Not that I’m prejudiced, of course.  They dance as they sing
on many of the numbers.  We took the grandmothers and Aunt Vida.  Scott &amp;
Mishelle went also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went on the 29<sup>th</sup> with Scott &amp;
Mishelle and her family to the Bountiful Temple for Mishelle to take out her
endowments.  It was wonderful to be there.  We saw some old friends, Wayne
&amp; Carol Hickenlooper there.  They have a son who was getting his endowments
prior to going on a mission.</p>

Layton High School</b> was the following night, May 30<sup>th</sup> at the high
school.  It was in the gym and we had to sit on the bleachers so we didn’t take
the grandmothers.  We could only have 3 or 4 tickets anyway.  Scott wanted to
go, but Mishelle needed his help with things she had to do for the wedding.  It
was a wonderful graduation, but we were tired and our backs hurting by the time
the last of the seniors received their diplomas.  We went with Jeff to the
Country Club where we ate a delicious dinner.  Trent’s parents paid for our
tickets since when they asked Trent what he wanted for graduation, he said to
have his two bet friends with him – Jeff and Anna and their parents to sit at
the same table with him and his parents at the graduation dinner.  We had a
good time.  Jeff, Trent, and Anna and most of the seniors went to the Senior
Bash afterwards where they spent the entire night at the high school having
wonderful activities.  They had a great tie.  Lori, Trent’s mom, was in charge
of the dinner and the senior bash.  (Picture with Jeff and his best friends –
Trent &amp; Anna.  Trent &amp; Anna got married soon after Trent returned home
from his mission.  It is 2017 and they still get together – Jeff &amp; Gail and
Trent &amp; Anna.  They get together sometimes with their families and
sometimes just the four of them.  It’s great to have such good friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On the 31<sup>st</sup>, we had a family dinner
since Shellie and her family had come in late Thursday night and Mike and his
family had come up on Wednesday (they were staying with her family in Provo.) 
It was to celebrate Jeff’s graduation and Scott’s wedding and since we could
all be together.  We cooked a turkey and had the trimmings.  We visited and
played games afterwards. Sandi and her girls came also.  Candace, our neighbor,
went on a trip so let us use her home again, so Sandi and the girls slept there
plus Scott &amp; Jeff.  Mike &amp; Becky slept in Jeff’s room with David &amp;
Taylor on the hide-a-bed in the family room.  Shellie, Roy &amp; baby slept in
Scott’s room with Garrett &amp; Quint in a make-shift bed on the floor in the
computer room.  It was great being together again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Saturday morning, June 1<sup>st</sup>, we were
up early getting ready to go to the temple.  Scott went to pick up Mishelle and
they went together.  Ken &amp; I drove alone because we had to be there early
with Scott.  We hired Mindy Craven to tend Garrett &amp; Quint, David &amp;
Taylor while Shellie &amp; Roy and Mike &amp; Becky went to the temple.  Sandi
offered to go early with Shellie &amp; Roy to tend the baby in the lobby of the
temple while Shellie &amp; Roy were at the wedding.  I was so thrilled that
Sandi offered to do this.  It has been so hard for Sandi when her sister and
brothers got married in the temple, because of her life, that she didn’t even
go to Shellie’s wedding breakfast, let alone the temple grounds for pictures,
and didn’t go to the temple for pictures at either Mike or David’s wedding. 
This is a big step for Sandi and all of us were excited that she would be
there.  Jeff took JaNae and Chelci with him to be there for pictures.  He later
told me that it was very hard for him to be there.  He felt all alone.  The
last of his brothers &amp; sisters had been married and now he was alone in the
family. JaNae &amp; Chelci were there, but he still felt alone and had a hard
time.  He left right after the family pictures and went driving around.  I
guess it’s pretty hard for the last child.  I never felt that as I was the
first child to leave home to get married, in my family.</p>

align=left hspace=12 alt=93><b>Anyway, Scott &amp; Mishelle’s marriage was
wonderful.</b>  The sealer was a wonderful man and gave special advice to
them.  Scott &amp; Mishelle looked so happy and it brought tears to my eyes to
think of the past year – how hard it has been with her having cancer and going
through chemotherapy together.  Scott was with her each time, since he worked 4
ten-hour days and had Fridays off.  I’ve had many, many people tell me what a
special young man he is to take on such a responsibility – to stand by her even
though they weren’t engaged when she found out she had cancer.  But he loved
her and wanted her for his eternal companion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was a beautiful day and the pictures turned
out great.  We went to the wedding breakfast at the Red Flame in Bountiful. 
The food was wonderful and we had a grand tie.  It cost over $600.00, but it
was worth it.  It cost $8.50 per person and that included the tax and tip.  We
had chicken breasts, baked potatoes, drink, desert and salad bar. Everyone
enjoyed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had family pictures taken at Olan Mills
studio in Layton, since David couldn’t be to the reception that night where
pictures would be taken.  He was receiving an award at Weber University and, of
course, needed to be there.  Ken and I went to look at the proofs two weeks
later and they were wonderful.  We are so thankful for our beautiful and
wonderful family.  We have such good children and they chose wonderful
companions, and our grandchildren are the best.  We are so fortunate, and I am
so happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We all love Mishelle and are thankful for her
and how she went through so much pain, sickness, anxiety, etc.  She tried to be
positive and have faith that she would get well – and she has.  We grew to love
Mishelle more and more as her and Scott dated and then after he left on is
mission, we invited her over each Sunday for dinner ad to spend the evening. 
We would play games or watch church videos or just visit.  Most of the time we
invited Ken’s mom or my mom, or both plus David &amp; Shauna or any family
members so we enjoyed the evenings.  Jeff enjoyed having Mishelle there too and
the two of them would play the piano together some evenings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            The next day, Sunday, Shellie, Roy &amp;
family headed back home to Arizona.</b>  They left about the time we were going
to church for Sacrament Meeting.  It was hard to see them leave, sure wish they
lived closer.  We miss out on so much of their children’s lives.  I hope
someday we can live close by each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            After meetings, Ken &amp; I left for Montana
with Mike.</b>  We took our good car as it is cheaper to drive than Mike’s
truck.  We went with him to help him finish packing up the house and clean it
as they are moving down, and we are excited about that.  Becky and the two
children stayed in Provo with her parents.  It was a wonderful trip.  The
scenery was so beautiful.  I had never been up that way and I loved it.  I had
taken books &amp; Ensigns to read (which I usually do on trips – I read out
loud to Ken), but it was so beautiful and nice to just visit with Mike and Ken
and enjoy the scenery.  We arrived in Inverness that evening and went to bed. 
The next day we started packing when the guy came with his moving truck to move
Mike.  We hadn’t expected him until the following day.  He said he got through
early from his last moving job and decided to come and see if we were ready. 
We hurried to finish packing which he and his son packed the truck.  I then
started cleaning.  It wasn’t bad as Becky is a good housekeeper.  After we were
finished and the truck had left, Mike showed us around Inverness and we saw the
High School and Elementary School where he taught at and coached.  It’s a cute
little town.  We met his good neighbor and others in the neighborhood.  We had
a good time.  Because we didn’t have a bed to sleep in that night, we decided
to go part way and sleep in a motel.  We did, but none of us slept much.  Ken
and I didn’t sleep because the bed was so hard and Mike didn’t sleep because
when Ken did sleep, he snored too loud.  We started out tired the next morning,
but still had a good trip.  The scenery was beautiful and it was relaxing for
me to just enjoy the scenery and again visit with Mike &amp; Ken.  We took Mike
to his home in Provo.  His father-in-law helped Mike &amp; Becky get into it. 
It is an older home, but very nice and has a nice yard with lots of shrubbery
and trees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          </span>This summer
has gone by really fast.  With going to Arizona in April to help out when Kevis
was born, Scott’s wedding and helping Mike move down from Montana, we didn’t
feel we had the time or money to go on other vacations, but we did get together
up to Camperworld a couple of times.  Once with the family at Coleville and
once, just Ken &amp; I at Woodland up by Heber.  (Scott &amp; Mishelle came up
on Friday afternoon and stayed the night with us.)  We took Irven’s 4-wheeler
and had a great time in the mountains with it.  Ken &amp; I just relaxed and
had a great week.  Ken went fishing part of the time while I worked on
scrapbooks.  It was so quiet and beautiful up there.  We also have the children
and their families to our home for Sunday dinners quite regularly.  Scott &amp;
Mishelle and David &amp; Shauna come almost every other week as they live close
by, ad Sandi ad her girls and Mike, Becky and their family come as often as
they ca.  We really enjoy having our family with us.  They are great kids, have
married great spouses and have wonderful children.  We just wish Shellie, Roy
&amp; family lived close by so they could be with us also.  They were here in
June for Scott &amp; Mishelle’s wedding, but we only get to see them two or
three times a year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>David graduated from Weber University and he
graduated with honors</b>.  We are proud of him.  He worked hard for it and got
straight A’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken’s younger brother, Irven, wife, Sandy, and
their family moved to Arizona from Washington.  A friend introduced him to a
dream that was going to make them rich, but it worked out for them like it did
for us when we went down there the last time.  It didn’t work out, and they had
a rough time financially, like we did.  Since Mom Jensen let us live with her
for a while, we decided we should return the favor to Irven &amp; his family – <b>so
Irven, Sandy and their family moved in with us the first of August</b>.  It has
worked out really well for the most part.  Since Scott had moved out, we had an
extra bedroom so Irven &amp; Sandy took that, and we moved our computer into
our bedroom, turning the computer and exercise room into a bedroom for Mark. 
Actually, Christine &amp; Jennifer stayed in that room until they left for
college in September.  We are adding an extra bathroom in the basement so we
have the extra needed shower.  I think it would be really hard to do this with
most couples, but we really enjoy Irven &amp; Sandy.  Sandy and I have always
gotten along really well.  We giggle like young girls.  Her &amp; I share the
housecleaning and we take turns every other week buying the groceries and
fixing the meals.  That is wonderful to be able to do that, and whoever is
cooking, their husband &amp; family help with the dishes and cleanup.  This
leaves the other family time to do other things the week they aren’t cooking –
which is great!  Mark is a sweet kid and he was no problem.  Jeff must have
been on his mission at this time.  Well, fast forward, and it did get harder. 
The one thing for me was that with them here, our children and families didn’t
feel like there was room for them to come visit, come for Sunday dinners, etc. 
Christmas was good, but harder.  Some of our children did come and so did their
children, except Doug, who was married and living in Arizona.   We were crowded
together in our family room to open gifts.  It was a different Christmas, but
their children are great, so it was okay.   After they had been there for nine
months, Irven talked to Ken and said “This is working out great, so we should
make it permanent. With sharing expenses, it is easier financially on all of
us.”  Irven had been getting on Ken’s nerves and this didn’t set well with him,
he was ready to have them go, so he said “Irven, if I wanted to live with you,
I would have married you.”  That is a crazy thing to say, but Irven got the
message and he and Sandy started looking for another home.  There were some
difficult feelings at first, but when they found a home in Clearfield and moved
in, they were fine and it was better for all of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            For October conference, our family got
together.  We had been together the previous Sunday for dinner and decided we
needed to go up the canyon once more together before the bad weather set in, so
we met at our home on Saturday, the 5<sup>th</sup>, at noon and went up
Farmington Canyon.  We had taken fried chicken, salads, Sandi’s good rolls and
desert.  We ate, went for walks (I enjoyed going around with little David.  He
would say “come on Grandma, let’s go take this shortcut.”) We listed to the
afternoon session of conference on the radio in Mike’s truck.  Ken took a nap
in Mike’s truck also.  It was a nice day.  Mike, Becky &amp; family, Sandi and
Chelci stayed over and slept in the tent trailer.  Sunday morning, Ken fixed
biscuits and gravy for breakfast and David &amp; Shauna and Scott &amp;
Mishelle came over.  After breakfast, some of them had to leave and the rest of
us watched conference.  We invited Mom Jensen and Aunt Vida over for supper and
to watch the afternoon session of conference.  Conference was sure wonderful.</p>

align=left hspace=12 alt="Ken with his ambulance construction van">After
quitting working at the Bountiful Mall, Ken worked for Dwaine Mattison, my
cousin Eve’s husband.  Dwaine hired Ken to work with him to build homes.  It
didn’t work well for Ken, as it was always a “Dwaine Deal”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ken bought a used ambulance and converted it to his work
van</b>.  When he first brought it home, the neighbors called thinking the
ambulance was there for one of our family.  Ken took off the flashing lights,
etc<b>.  We took a fun vacation in it, to Shellie &amp; Roy’s home in Arizona.</b> 
We took Jeff and his girlfriend, Nicki, and Sandi and her girls with us.  While
on this trip, <b>Scott called to tell Jeff that his mission call had come.</b> 
This was great as many of us were together and Jeff didn’t want to wait until
we got home to open it, so he had Scott open it and read it to us.  It stated
that he would be going to <b>the Mexico City Mission</b>.  I think he was a
little disappointed at that because he had a prejudice toward Mexicans.  It
turned out to not be the greatest mission for him.  Not sure why he was called
there unless the Lord wanted him to love everyone, including the Mexican
people.  He did love some of the people, but he had native companions and he
was the zone leader and his companion and other missionaries were Mexican and
didn’t obey mission rules.  He told the mission president, but he was native
also and just told Jeff that he couldn’t send them home as it would not only
ruin their lives, but their families as well.  We were sad when Jeff told us
this after he had returned home, as the mission president should have done
something about this problem.  It was a hard mission for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Dwaine wanted to buy the
ambulance/work van from Ken, and Ken did end up selling it to him.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken worked for another construction
company after he left Dwaine, and then retired when he turned 62.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jackie Thompson, my former boss at
Davis School District is now the director of a new Equity Department now.  She
called and asked if I would be willing to come out of retirement and be her
secretary.  This was after we came home from our mission.  Ken didn’t want me
to and I didn’t want to either, even though I would have enjoyed working with
her and we could use the money, I wanted to be able to enjoy our grandchildren
and families more, do more family history and temple work and enjoy life, so I
declined.  She understood and hired Patty Woodward.  Patty had left the
Planning Dept and was hired in Staff Development to take Billie’s place after
she retired.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I haven’t called Jackie since we
moved to Roy as Ken can’t drive school busses anymore, so we don’t have extra
money for gas and lunch, but I did call her on April 20, 2017 and we will do it
again before she retires in July.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Sandy always gave me wonderful
reviews each year and she nominated me to receive the secretary of the year
award again, this time as her secretary of Staff Development in 1998.   The
superintendent presented these awards at the school board meeting.  He said
some nice things about me and then presented me with a plaque which read:
“Davis County Schools Board Honors to Mae Browning, Staff Development Secretary
for dedicated and outstanding service for children in Davis County Schools.  Presented
October 6, 1998.  It was signed by Dr. Darrell K. White, Superintendent of

<p class=MsoNormal> Elizabeth, the secretary at the Computer Dept, took my

prior to Ken and I going on our mission to the Philippines.</b>  Sandy and my
assistants planned a retirement open house for me.  They went all out and it
was really nice.  They sent invitations out to all the schools and district
offices and to our family.  Most of our children and grandchildren were there
and many of my friends from the schools and district office.  Sandy and my
assistants gave me a beautiful corsage to wear.  The school catering dept
catered the food and it was really nice.  Nancy Fleming the assistant
superintendent over Staff Development made a speech and presented me with a beautiful
gold bell.  Sandy made a speech and gave me gifts.  They had me say a few
words.  I received many cards and gifts.  I was afraid that not many would
attend and I had kind of wanted to not have an open house, but just slip
quietly away – maybe do a lunch with the ladies in our dept., but that didn’t
happen, however, my former boss, Claudia Seeley, gave me a going away party at
her home in Salt Lake and invited our Staff Development Dept - Sandy, Marilyn,
Betty, Jackie, Billie, Linda and myself.  Claudia had a nice lunch for us and
they all went in on a gift for me.  It was a Christmas Angel.  We had a great

left.  (This isn’t a good picture; the original is in my occupational scrap
