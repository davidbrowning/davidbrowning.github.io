<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 11 – STAKE YWMIA
&amp; CAMP BEAVER</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In February 1965 I was called in to the Stake
President's office to see Brother Smout of the High Council and President
Thompson.  I knew it must be to take a stake M.I.A. position because that is
what they are over, but I thought it might be secretary or a class teacher. 
Boy, was I ever wrong.  They asked me to be <b>Stake Young Women’s Activity
Counselor</b> under Sister <b>Myrene Dransfield</b>.  I was so shocked I could
hardly drive home.  When I told Ken, he told me he didn't think I should take
it as it would require too much of my time, and besides my nerves weren't the
best when I was in an executive position in the ward.  I called and talked to
Dad and Mom and Mom didn't know whether I should take it or not.  When I talked
to Dad about it before I made my decision, Dad said if it was him, he sure
would accept it as he really enjoyed stake work.  He liked going around and
visiting the wards &amp; getting to know more people in the stake.  I had to
call President Thompson that night and tell him my decision as they wanted to
put me in during stake conference on Sunday.  I prayed about it and the more I
thought about it and talked with Ken, we decided I should take it because if
that was what the Lord wanted me to do, then I should do it.  I was sustained
during the second session of conference.  That night they were having their
stake speech festival so Sister Dransfield asked me to come and help greet at
the door and sit up with the rest of the executives.  I replaced Jean Edwards. 
Myrene told me that when President Thompson asked who she wanted to replace
Jean, she told him she wanted me.  President Thompson told her that he didn't
think my Bishop would let me go and that she had better have a second name. 
Mike (that was her nickname) said she told LaRae what President Thompson had
said so they both thought and prayed some more, but couldn't come up with
another name so they knew the Lord wanted me in this position.  President
Thompson told me that they ask the Bishops and if the Bishops say the person is
needed in the ward, he tells them the stake needs them and is taking them.  I
heard later that this is what happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have had many wonderful and rich experiences
during the time that I was activity counselor.  I loved Mike right from the
beginning.  She was almost my mother's age.  I have never seen a woman so
enthusiastic and one who would devote as much time and work to her position as
she did.  She was a remarkable leader.  She could make money stretch further
than anyone I have ever seen, and get the most out of the money she did spend. 
She could get people and girls to do things that very few people could.  She
could get up and talk and the words would just flow out and the things that she
would say would be so timely and appropriate.  I learned a lot from Mike and
she will always be a wonderful friend.  I enjoyed working with LaRae Brown, the
age group counselor also.  She is a very efficient person and she really knows
the MIA program.  She is really quite the conversationist.  You usually
couldn't get a word in edgewise when she was around, but she is a wonderful
person.  The women on the board were really wonderful, especially my activity
directors.  They were: JoAnn Draney, Speech and Drama; Charlene Price, Music
Director; Deanna Clark, Dance Director and Marion Smout, Sports and Camp. 
JoAnn was very good, but she had to be prodded along.  I worked with her mainly
on the roadshow preparations - rules, judging sheets, theme, etc.  Ken helped
me a great deal also.  At the April Leadership Meeting we had all the activity
counselors, speech, drama, music and dance directors meet together and we
handed them out the rules and thoroughly discussed them so that they could get
busy on their individual roadshows and have them ready for July 26th, the date
scheduled for the presentations of the roadshows.  The roadshows went off very
well.  Each ward had a roadshow, and Harrisville won the Superior rating. 
Lomond View came next.  They only lacked a couple of points from being first. 
They had put in so much money into their roadshow that when they didn't win
they were really bitter.  They did have a cute roadshow, but Harrisville went
along better with the main theme &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; and thus received the
most points from the judges.  Mike and the rest of us were really disappointed
with the way Lomond View acted.  I also worked with JoAnn on the skit to be
presented in April Leadership for June Conference.  It turned out really cute. 
I also helped her with the Theme Presentation that was put on in September 65.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I liked Charlene, but I would get upset with her
some times because she would wait until the last minute to get things done. 
She started worrying about them early enough, but it seemed that they didn't
get done until the last minute.  She was very dependable at all her meetings,
however, and I enjoyed working with her.  I worked with her on the Stake and
Region Music Festivals and they were both very successful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Deanna is a very talented and dependable woman. 
She had a tough time, however, as her husband never supported her and was
always giving her a bad time.  I worked with her on the Teen Dances, Stake
Dances and floorshows, and especially the Stake and All-Church Dance
Festivals.  We had an All Girl's Dance and two squares of Square Dancers
participating in the dance festivals.  Deanna taught them these dances and did
a terrific job with them.  She put in a lot of hours and work with rehearsals
and everything.  I made the posters, programs, helped with the decorations,
planning, etc., for the Stake Dance Festival and I mimeographed rules, etc.,
for the dancers for the All-Church Dance Festival.  Deanna is a wonderful girl,
but she sure has a temper and she says what she thinks.  She also put in many
hours teaching dances during the instruction periods prior to the teen dances
every Saturday night during the months of January, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>February and March.  She had to be released due to her
health and her husband's insistence right after June Conference.</p>

hspace=12 alt=DSC04127>            <b>Marian Smoot</b> was my favorite activity
director.  It's funny because when I first met Marian my first impression was
that it would be hard working with her as she is a Gym teacher at North Davis
Junior High, and she is very efficient, dependable and skilled in her position
as Sports Camp Director.  I felt that I was inferior to her and that she would
probably resent me being over her.  Much to my surprise it was just the
opposite.  She went out of her way to support me in my position, and let me
know in various ways that she respected me and was behind me.  I think the world
of Marian.  I have never met a girl that was as efficient, as fair, as sincere,
willing to go the extra mile and had such a sparkling personality as Marian. 
Everyone loved her, especially the girls.  She was so dependable that I never
worried for a minute about the projects and activities that she was over or
working on, as to whether they would get done or not because they always did
and usually better than I could have done them.  Because of my fear of her
resenting me, I didn't get too close to Marian until we started working and
planning together for camp.  While Marian was in school, Mike and I would wash,
dye and crush egg shells for one of the crafts for camp.  We also got most of
the other crafts ready.  Then at night, we would get together with Marian and
LaRae and plan the menus, activities, work schedules, etc.  Marian and I got
together and planned our Campcrafter program for camp.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Soon after I was put in as Activity Counselor, Mike asked me
if I would try to study and prepare to go down to the<b> General Board
Campcrafter Certification Campout the 27th, 28th and 29th of May to become
certified so that we could start this program in our stake this year at camp</b>. 
Marian wanted to go down also, but since school would not be out by then, she
couldn't go.  I was so busy with all the other activities, meetings, etc., that
I didn't have too much time to prepare for this until that month.  That month,
especially the last two weeks, I really crammed.  Phillis Martin was certified
and she worked with me teaching me knots, lashing, map and compass, first aid,
etc.  Phillis lived in the ward I grew up in and was in the MIA part of the
time when I was a teenager.  Shirlene Larsen, the Stake Camp Director from the
North Weber Stake (the stake that shares our camp) went down with me to be
certified.  I have never in my life spent a rougher three days, but I wouldn't
trade those experiences for anything.  Thursday night from 5 p.m. until 11:30
p.m. we went around to the various groups for oral testing.  By the time that
night was over my head was spinning and I felt as if I was in another world.  I
passed everything, however, much to my surprise.  Friday morning, we had to be
at the Grand Central Parking Lot at 7 a.m.  I spent Thursday night with Aunt
Enid and Uncle Wayne.  They were surely wonderful to me.  Shirlene spent the
night with her brother and his wife.  I drove her over and went and got her the
next morning.  We traveled from Grand Central in a caravan to Tracy Wigwam camp
where we put our packs on our backs and took our hike.  We arrived at a
campsite with no facilities.  We set up camp - pitched our tents, built
latrines, wood piles, tables, coolers, dug pits for our underground coolers,
etc.  Next, we cooked our lunch and went on our map and compass hike.  When we
returned we had to hike down for water and prepare a skit for the campfire
program that night.  We were divided into groups when we registered Thursday
night.  The girls and women in my group were wonderful especially one from
Brigham who was also their Stake Activity Counselor and was about my age.  We
enjoyed each other's company very much.  The campfire program that night was
really great.  The next morning at 6 a.m. we had testimony meeting.  That was
truly a wonderful experience in itself.  The testimonies of those women were
beautiful.  The spirit was very strong. I was able to bear my testimony also. 
After the meeting we built our fires including the one using no matches.  It
took me quite a while to get mine going and to take care of it so I didn't have
much time for my breakfast.  Next, we took our nature hike.  On this hike we
made our observations and taught our songs to one another.  We cooked our lunch
on our hike.  When we got back, we broke camp, and took our written tests. 
When I arrived home, I was filled with a wonderful feeling for the wonderful
experiences I had had, but I was also so tired that I was about sick.  Ken said
I looked pretty awful.  I was sunburned, had blisters, dirty everywhere, etc. 
Mike had tended Sandy for me while I was gone.  She said it was the least she
could do.  I didn't get my letter telling me what level of achievement I had
passed for almost a month.  They said it should only take about a week, boy was
I ever anxious waiting for that letter.  Mike and Marian were also anxious. 
When it arrived, I was so thrilled I could hardly see, for I had passed all
four years, I had achieved the level of Adventurer.  Mike, Marian and everyone
was very happy and excited, but not as excited as I was.  This picture is of
Me, Mike, Marian &amp; one of the other ward leaders, at Camp Beaver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=280 height=210
src="Chapter_11_-_Stake_YWMIA_and_Camp_Beaver_files/image002.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=DSC04124>Our stake camp was called <b>&quot;Camp Beaver&quot;.</b> 
It was up past Huntsville and up South Fork canyon.  It was a beautiful camp. 
It had a river running on the north of it.  The girls used to play in it and
float on inner tubes during their free time.  It had cabins, a large cement
slab the size of a basketball court where we played volleyball, ate on picnic
tables in good weather, (when it was bad weather, we had another building where
we cooked the food and it had tables and benches and would hold about 60
people.)  We also held our activities on that cement slab.  It had a big
fireplace where we would cook food for some meals, it had a big fire area with
logs around where we would gather each night to have a campfire program and the
last night we would have our testimony meeting.  That was always the highlight
of camp as it was so spiritual.  Most all the girls and leaders would bear
their testimonies and the spirit was so strong.  There were large sinks and
mirrors outside the kitchen building where girls and leaders would wash their
hair.  It was a wonderful camp with lots of trees.  I loved it there.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The three cabins each held about 20 people. 
There were cots with mattresses for 20 - so the camp held about 60 people which
meant we had to have the Laurels go up one week, the Mia Maids go up another
week and the Beehives also a separate week.  That meant I was gone for three
weeks each year at camp.  The leaders would go up Sunday night so we could be
up early Monday morning to be ready when the girls and ward leaders arrived. 
We would go home Friday afternoon.  I would wash clothes on Saturday and go
with Mike to buy the next week's groceries for camp.  Sometimes Mike would have
the other counselor go with her.  When the third week was over, I was beat and
had really missed my family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first week I went to camp was the hardest
because I was the only one certified and I had to certify everyone else.  The
first week I passed Mike and Marian off along with the girls - so the 2nd and
3rd weeks Mike and Marian were able to help me pass off the girls and leaders. 
That first week all I heard was &quot;Mae&quot; (I was young then and didn't
particularly want to be called &quot;Sister Browning&quot;).  Some called me
that anyway to show respect.  Anyway.  Since I was certified, they needed to
pass everything off to me.  I had the ward leaders help me teach first aid and
bandaging, and other certification requirements.  Marian and I had the stake
camp staff help us with the activities and campfire programs.  The girls
enjoyed the hikes and most of the certification requirements, but would rather
have had more time to play than they did, so the next year we had the wards
teach their girls some of the requirements and then they just had to pass them
off at camp.  Anyway, back to that first week, I was worn to a frazzle trying
to help all the girls and leaders with certification, running from one to
another.  Finally, Mike called me into the kitchen cabin and told me to lie
down on one of the far benches.  She had a blanket and pillow on it.  I did and
then she scooted the table over by me and the tablecloth went down almost to
the floor - so no one could see me there.  When the girls were shouting for me,
her and Marian told them I wasn't available to help them for awhile.  That way
I got to have a short nap each day which really helped.  Marian and I had fun
with the girls.  We even had shaving cream fights and water fights.  Someone
brought &quot;itching&quot; powder and put down Marian's neck.  It was awful,
about drove her nuts for awhile.  They didn't try that again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=262 height=196
src="Chapter_11_-_Stake_YWMIA_and_Camp_Beaver_files/image003.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=DSC03927>            The first year we only passed off the
yearling level (lst level).  The following year we passed off the 2nd level
(Mountaineer) to those who had passed the &quot;yearling&quot; the year
before.  The third year, we passed off the 1st, 2nd and 3rd levels and the
fourth year we passed off all four levels.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the best parts of camp was having <b>Jr Camp
Counselors</b>.  I would ask the wards to give me a list of their oldest girls
and I would pick one from each ward to be a Jr. Camp Counselor.  I would have
them come to my home where I would teach them the next level of certification
and we would go on a pre-campout where they could pass off this certification
so they could help Marian and I teach and pass off this certification at camp. 
Marian and I became really good friends by working so closely together on camp
and we became close with these Jr Camp Counselors as we taught and trained
them, went on the pre-campout and then worked together at camp.  They were
special girls and were a lot of help to us.  This picture is of me (2<sup>nd</sup>
from left) and my Jr Camp Counselors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Jr Camp Counselors for the fourth year at
camp were my favorites.  I had asked Tammy to help me with camp that year.  She
consented to be over the lst year (Yearling) certification - so we went to camp
with me the first week.  She also consented to go with me and the Jr. Camp
Counselors to the Pre-Campout.  We had lots of experiences there.  We picked
two tents.  Half of the girls were in one tent with Tammy and the other half in
the other tent with me.  I don't remember Marian going with us on this
campout.  We heard noises outside the tent that night, but I assured the girls
that it was probably just squirrels or other small animals.  The next morning,
we found bear tracks around our tents.  Later that day a forest ranger stopped
by and asked us if we had seen a brown bear as it had been spotted at several
campsites.  We didn't sleep as well the next night, but he didn't come around,
thank goodness.  Tammy had brought Larry's pistol so in case we needed it - we
did.  On our hike we ran into a rattlesnake and Tammy shot it.  Even though we
had a lot of excitement, we also accomplished a lot and had a lot of fun also. 
We had a big water fight just before we left camp.  These Jr. Camp Counselors
presented Tammy and I each with a book of favorite quotes at the regular camp. 
(I don't remember the name of the book, but I should still have it.) On the
inside cover, the girls had gotten together and composed a poem about our
pre-campout.  It told about the bear, rattlesnake and water fight.  It was
really cute and I have treasured that book.  (Guess I will go down and look for
it in the bookcase.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first year we had some problems with the
older girls.  We had set rules, one of which was that boys were not allowed in
camp and that the girls were not allowed to leave the campground unless, of
course, their parents came to get them as a couple did who were going on vacation. 
We told the girls that if any girl should invite a boy up or entice him into
the campground, she would be taken home.  Well, sure enough, they tested us by
doing it one night.  They snuck out of camp, met their boyfriends and were
necking with them just inside the campgrounds. We took the two girls’ home the
next morning.  We didn't have trouble with any of the others after that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a girl nicknamed &quot;Scotty&quot; with
us.  She was really a leader, but was leading the girls in the wrong
direction.  She was a troublemaker, and caused us some grief that first year. 
We decided that if she was coming the next year, we had to get her on our side
- so we met with her and told her she was a &quot;natural leader&quot; and that
we needed her to help us with camp.  She was cooperative and liked the
responsibility we had given her.  That following year at camp was much better. 
If the girls would get rowdy while we were trying to teach certification,
Scotty would either just glare at them, or tell them to &quot;listen up - that
they needed to learn these things&quot; and they would listen.  It was great to
have her on our side.  The last night at testimony meeting when most of the
girls and leaders had born their testimonies, Scotty stood up.  With tears
streaming down her cheeks she thanked all the girls and leaders for being her
&quot;friends&quot; and caring about her.  She told the girls that if their
parents are strict and put a curfew on them and want to know where they are
going and what they are doing and want to meet their friends - that they should
be grateful and thankful that their parents care about them.  She said she
wished her parents cared about her, but they don't.  She said they don't care
where she goes, how long she stays, what she does.  She started smoking to
&quot;shock&quot; them and see if they cared.  They didn't.  She then started
drinking and going around with the wrong crowd, they still didn't care.  She
said they wouldn't care if I ended up in the reform school or jail - maybe they
would be happy because then I wouldn't be around.  It gave us all something to
think about - and we felt so bad for Scotty.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            (More about camp - hope it isn’t a repeat, but
not time to keep going through this rough draft at this time).  Camp Clean-Up
was the 26th of June.  We started at 8 a.m. in the morning.  There were to be 4
women and 2 men from each ward and all the stake board.  Everyone brought part
of the lunch.  While the rest were cleaning the camp, Marian and myself, with
the help of Brother Swaner, prepared the fire displays and woodpile for our
campcrafter program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Monday morning at 5:15, Marian stopped by to
pick me up.  We told the girls that they could be there at 6:00 a.m. so we had
to be their a few minutes early.  It was quite chilly at that time of the
morning.  We had the girls go into the kitchen where Mike explained the rules
of the camp - what was expected of them etc.  They went to their cabins, picked
out a bed and spent a few minutes getting settled.  Mike, Marian, and myself
were each in a different cabin.  We also had two ward leaders in each cabin. 
After everyone was situated in their cabins, we had them come up and register,
check in crafts and written reports for the campcrafter program and they were
assigned to their work details.  Breakfast consisted of rolls and hot
chocolate, afterwards everyone got busy on their work details and then
straightened their cabins.  Marian and I tore the material for the lunch
sacks.  At 9 a.m., they came up to the outside tables and make their lunch
sacks.  Marian explained the campcrafter program to them and we passed out
their campcrafter booklets for them to study the rest of the morning and
whenever they had time.  At ten, while the girls were studying, Marian and I
taught the leaders their various fire demonstrations to be presented in the
afternoon.  Lunch was served at noon on paper plates and cups so that
immediately after, we could go ahead with the campcrafter program.  At two the
girls were allowed to play in the river or do crafts.  At five we had supper,
6:45 p.m. we took the flag down, and at seven we had our relays and junior
Olympics.  The girls enjoyed these and had a lot of fun.  Afterwards we showed films
of last year's camp and of June conference for this year.              We woke
the girls at 6:45 a.m. Tuesday morning.  They moaned and groaned, but they
finally got up.  Flag ceremony was at 7:30 and breakfast followed.  We cooked
pancakes, bacon and eggs on the outside grills and ate outside.  It was a
beautiful morning.  After breakfast everyone had their work details to do, then
straighten their cabins, and afterwards everyone that didn't have a hat, had to
come up and I helped them make a wallpaper hat.  While I was doing this, Mike
and the other leaders were preparing the items that the girls were to take on
their hike for their lunch.  At 9:30 everyone came up to the kitchen in their
hiking clothes and gathered up their lunch, put it in their lunch sacks that
they had previously made, and at 10:00 we left for our hike.  Mike and one or
two of the ward leaders stayed to get things ready for supper.  Marian and I
led the way and the other leaders were scattered throughout the line, but the
last week as we were anticipating trouble, Marian led the way and I brought up
the rear.  The hike led the girls through creeks, where we had to cross by way
of large rocks or a log.  We had to go through fences and bushes, but finally
we arrived at the Weber Memorial Park.  The first week the girls built their
individual fires in a large clearing at the park, but the other two weeks we
had them build their fires out in the parking lot before we left for the hike. 
We cooked our lunch and ate, and by then the girls were ready to return to camp
so that they could play in the river.  At 6:00 we had supper and at 7;00 we had
a Forrest ranger come and show films and talk to us about fires and
conversation.  This was our program for M.I.A.  We met over at the campfire,
however, at 7:30 for our opening exercises and afterwards we went back and sang
songs around the campfire.  Every night we took one cabin and taught them north
by the stars and how to make a bedroll.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On Wednesday morning we arose at 7:00, flag
ceremony at 7:30, breakfast right after.  Then work details and cabins to be
straightened.  Between 10 and 11 we taught the leaders First Aid.  Marian
taught a couple of the leaders, and I would teach the other two, then each of
us would prepare for our demonstrations.  Lunch was served at noon, and our
campcrafter program was from 12:45 to 2:00.  The girls played in the river and
worked on arts and crafts until around 5 p.m.  The girls were given sweet rolls
that Mike and some of the ward leaders had made during the day, to tide them
over until our Hawaiian luau.  Between 6:00 and 6:30 we took down the flag,
then we had the girls get in their groups and we gave each leader some
balloons, create paper, tape and other decorations and each group was to
decorate a forth of the slab for our Hawaiian Luau.  The girls were really
clever, they really had some darling ideas.  One week they made a Hawaiian girl
out of a broom, mop, pillows, crate paper, and some of their clothes.  They
also made palm trees, a boat, a hut and various other decorations.  Each week
they really made the slab look like Hawaii.  After we were finished decorating,
we played Tin-A-Ling (Japanese hop scotch), Lummy sticks and they did the
Limbo.  At eight we had our luau outside on the tables which were lined up down
the middle of the slab and decorated.  We barbecued a half of a chicken for
everyone.  We had tossed green salad, cicabobs, rolls, orange drink and cake
with lemon sauce.  One week, we had the stake presidency and their wives and
other high council members and visitors come up for our luau.  This was really
a success and one of the main highlights of the week.  After, if it was late
enough they would go to their cabins and finally go to sleep.  One week it was
too early so Marian took them over to the campfire and led them in songs and
they told scary stories.  Mike and I didn't go down as we were tired and were
doing other things.  The girls thought that we were dressing up and would come
up out of the river to scare them since they were telling scary stories.  They
heard some noises and started screaming and running - so they ran to the cabins
and hid under their covers.  Mike and I wondered what was going on when we
heard the screaming and girls running everyone.  Marian came in and told us
what had happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thursday morning, we were up bright and early at
7:00.  The girls didn't think that this was such a good idea.  They wanted to
sleep in - so Marian, Mike and I had to do as we did every morning; go in each
of the cabins several times, banging on pans, tickling them, pulling down their
covers, etc.  After flag ceremony, breakfast and while the girls were doing
their work details and straightening their cabins, Marian and I taught the
leaders the remainder of the First Aid and north by the sun.  Lunch was at
12:00.  After the campcrafter demonstrations, Marian and I started testing the
girls orally.  The first week I had to test all the girls by myself as Marian
wasn't certified.  Boy was I every exhausted when I finished.  The other two
weeks it wasn't so bad as I only had to test half of them.  We just spot
checked them on their requirements and all that they had learned during the
week.  While one group was being tested the other groups played in the river. 
We had supper at 5:00 and afterwards we gave the girls their written test. 
Following this we had our testimony meeting which was always so inspirational
and wonderful.  We all sat on the logs around the campfire and listened to each
other bear our testimonies.  The second week every girl and leader bore their
testimonies.  The girls went down to their cabins after our Miss Eager Beaver
was awarded and the closing prayer was said.  The last week we gave Mike a
stuffed bear to remember us as her nickname was &quot;Mother Bear&quot;.  The
first week, the first year Beehives gave Marian the nickname of Daddy Bear, I
was Mama Bear, and Mike was Big Beaver.  Thursday night was sad for the girls
as this was the last night they would be at camp as the next morning they would
be leaving for home.  They would miss the friends they had made at camp, this
way of life, and all the fun and wonderful experiences they had had.  Some of
the girls, especially the first year Beehives cried half the night.  We didn't
think we would ever get them to settle down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Friday morning. we got the girls up early, had
cereal and toast for breakfast, and assigned them their duties for that
morning.  Some had to clean cabins, some had to clean tills and pick up all
around, others had to defrost and clean the fridge, and still others had to mop
and wax the kitchen floor.  Their parents and leaders came up to get them
around 10:00.  Mike, Marian and myself were usually there until noon getting
things ready for the next week and making our new grocery lists.  When we got
home we had to do our washing and ironing, clean house, fix casseroles and
cakes, etc., for our families to eat for the next week.  Mike's mother-in-law
did her washing and ironing - so she got the groceries and other items we
needed.  Three weeks at camp plus all the time preparing for it, took up most
of the summer.  It was a sacrifice, but I loved it at the time because I loved
everything about camp - the girls, ward and stake leaders I worked with,
camping and having fun along with all the work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Since I was the only one certified, whenever
anyone got hurt, didn't feel good, or were just teasing, they would yell
&quot;Mae&quot;.  They thought that since I was certified and had a sleeve
patch that I should know everything and know how to do everything.  The first
week we had more than our share of accidents so I was running to one or another
a lot of the time.  Finally, Marian got disgusted and told them to come and
find me instead of yelling for me all the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The girls or &quot;ladies&quot; as Marian called
them were really a lot of fun and cute kids.  They brought shaving cream, silly
soap, honey, saran wrap, catsup, cereal, rice and many other things plus lots
of squirt guns to play tricks.  We told them that they could play tricks and
have fun as long as it didn't hurt anyone and for everyone to be good sports. 
We had to be good sports to as they were always throwing us in the river, or
putting shaving cream and silly soap all over us.  They used the honey, saran
wrap, and catsup etc., for the tills and un screwed the light bulks so that
when someone came down to use them, they would sit in this mess.  We always had
to take our flashlights when the three of us went down at night.  The three of
us were always the last to go to bed as we would stay and talk up in the
kitchen or get things ready for the next day until the ward leaders got the
girls quieted down.  When we went to bed we would usually find all kinds of
goodies waiting for us, such as our sleeping bags sewed together, or full of
cereal, rice, rocks, grass, etc.  The first week, the girls were continually
putting shaving cream on us or doing something, so Marian and I decided to pay
them back.  Wednesday night after the Luau and the girls had gone back to their
cabins, Marian and I filled our squirt guns and took some matches to light the
small firecrackers she had brought and went down to the cabins.  We locked the
doors from the outside and went around to the back where we put the
firecrackers under the doors and squirted through the windows.  The girls
thought it was boys and they really got scared.  They started screaming and
yelling so we unlocked the doors and tried to keep a straight face and went
into the cabins and told them that we would go scare the boys away and for them
to quiet down and go to sleep.  Apparently, they didn't believe us and guessed
who the boys were because the next day they ganged up on us.  First, they threw
Marian in, then they grabbed me.  Marian tried to stop them so she got thrown
in again.  We really gave them a fight for it though, and we threw several of
them in.  Darla, Mike's daughter, sat there laughing.  She was the one that
roused them up and then she sat there watching and letting them do all the
dirty work - so we grabbed her.  I've never seen such a wildcat, she kicked and
fought and both Marian and I thought we would never make it to the river with
her, and when we did we sunk down on the bank huffing and puffing.  Mike saw us
grab Darla so she ran and got her movie camera.  She told the ward leaders that
Darla would really give us a fight for our money, and boy she did.  That
afternoon I went down to my cabin for something and there was my sleeping bag
hanging from the rafters.  It was sewed together and filled with goodies of all
kinds.  Marian's was about in that shape too.  We also got our fill of shaving
cream, etc., that day.  The next week Marian and I decided we'd better not try
that trick again, but the last week the girls were asking for it again, and
since it was our last week we decided to live dangerously again so we cut up
onions and put them in the pillow cases of some of the girls who had been the
worst - Pam, Scotty, Chris and a few others.  It took them until the next night
to figure out who did it, but they just blamed Marian.  They thought I was too
sweet and nice to do it, so after Testimony meeting they grabbed her and dumped
itching powder down her back.  I tried to stop them, but was too late.  It was
like little slivers.  They really started to bother her so we ran up to the
kitchen, she threw her blouse off and I tried to gently rub it off and wipe it
off with a damp cloth.  Finally, I had to pick some of them off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Marian brought her skate board up to camp and
whenever she got a few minutes which wasn't very often, she would ride around
on it on the slab.  She tried to teach me how to use it, and I have to admit it
is quite fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a couple of incidents with snakes.  The
first Monday we were up there, Marian and I took off around 4 p.m. to make sure
of the trail that we were going to take them on the next morning for their three-mile
hike.  As we approached the memorial park we were walking in tall grass.  I
went to take a step and just about stepped on a blow snake.  I jumped and
almost landed on another one.  From then on, I let Marian take the lead.  The
other incident was when the girls found a water snake and tied it down from the
rafters just in front of Marian's bed.  That day after we got out of the river
the girls in that cabin could hardly wait until Marian got down to her cabin. 
Mike found out about it and motioned to me to go over where she was.  She told
me to tell Marian as she was afraid it would really scare her.  I told her, but
she really put on a good show for them pretending she didn't know it was there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike hated the river so she never got in it unless
the girls threw her in.  Marian and I really enjoyed it though.  It was great
fun floating down it on inner tubes.  There were only a couple of days each
week that we had time to get in it, but when we did, we really took advantage
of it and had a ball.  We made trains with the girls and went down that way
some times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One day Marian and I were so beat, and you
couldn't get any rest in the cabins so Marian suggested that we get out pillows
and put the benches under the tables and go to sleep on them.  The table cloths
were down low enough so no one could see us so we were able to get a little
rest that way.  When we got up we were a little stiff though as the benches
were really hard.  Some of the girls came looking for us, but Mike was always
such a good sport and she told them to look elsewhere for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Every night while we were sitting visiting we
would snack on left over doughnuts, cookies, cup cakes, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I really love camp.  I enjoyed the time I spent
up there very much.  I grew to love Marian and Mike very much, also the other
ward leaders and all the girls.  You can get so close to the girls at camp. 
This is one of the reasons I enjoy it so much.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Sometime later, Myrene
Dransfield (Mike) was moving from the stake</b>.  She told me she thought I
would be asked to be the next Stake Young Women's President.  I told her I
hoped not because Ken was feeling that he and Sandi had been neglected and he
wanted me to be released.  I also told her that I didn't want that
responsibility<b>.  She said &quot;Mae, you try to please everyone and you
can't do that.  You can only please half the people half the time, so you might
as well please yourself and you will please half the people&quot;</b>.  That
was the way with Mike.  I loved her, I thought she was great, but there were
others who didn't like her. She was a great leader and I am thankful I had the
opportunity of serving with her.  She was not only was a lot of fun, but she
loved the Lord and loved the girls and sacrificed a lot for them.  I got close
to her children also - who were not much younger than I was.  Mike &amp; her
husband, Ed, had a boat and water skis and they invited Marian and her husband,
and Ken and I to go water skiing with their family sometimes.  That was great
fun. I met Darla (Mike’s oldest daughter) while working at David School
District.  Darla was a social worker for the schools and had come in to see
about classes to get her lane change.  I recognized her almost immediately, and
she did me.  We hugged and updated each other on our families.  Of course, Darla
had married and had a family.  She told me that Mike, her mother, had passed
away unexpectedly and that her dad had soon remarried.  She said his new wife
didn’t want much to do with his family and was all about her family.  Darla’s
dad had gone along with what his new wife wanted, and Darla said that they
hardly ever saw her dad since then, that he hadn’t been a grandfather to his
own grandkids.  That was sad to hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The lst counselor, LaRae Brown, was asked to be
the Young Women's President and she asked for me to stay in with her.  Ken
asked me to please be released with Mike - so I did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike and I were released at stake conference
which was held at the Ogden Tabernacle.  Ken &amp; I came in and saw Marian
sitting at the back of the tabernacle.  We went over and sat by her and her
husband.  She said &quot;Mae, I wouldn't sit way back here if I were you, it's
too far to walk to the front when they ask you to speak&quot;.  I said
&quot;they won't ask me to speak - maybe Mike, but not me.  She said &quot;don't
say I didn't warn you&quot;.  Well, they did call on both Mike and I to speak
after they released us.  It seemed like that was the longest walk I ever took. 
I should have listened to Marian.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Marian was sustained as the activity counselor. 
I was happy about that as I had grown to love her and she was really talented
and efficient and a great leader.  She was a school teacher too.  Not long afterwards<b>
I got a call to meet with the stake presidency and they called me to be the</b>
<b>stake camp director.  Marian had asked for me.</b>  Now, we could still work
together on camp and be there together, only the positions had changed.  I now
was under her where before she was under me, but that didn't matter.  We worked
great together with the help of the Lord.  Shellie was born about this time -
so one year I didn't go to camp, but I helped with it. </p>
