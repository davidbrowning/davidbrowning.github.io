style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 28 – BACK TO UTAH – HOME AT 1747 N MAIN – AUG
1974 TO NOV. 1975</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In May of 1975 when I called Mom to let her know we would be
moving back to Utah, she was so excited and she asked if we’d like to rent
their old home in Sunset.  (The home I grew up in) as it was vacant right now. 
We decided this would be good as then we’d have a home to come to and we could
live there until we decided where we wanted to build or buy our home.  It was
exciting arriving in Sunset and showing the children the home and yard, the
park in back of our home, etc., and sharing with them the memories I had of
growing up and what I liked to do and where I would go, etc. Sometime later, I
took them for walks and showed them where my friends had lived and our other
good neighbors and friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> The first Sunday when we went to
church, the people were so excited to have us in the ward as they remembered us
and needed us in the ward.  The ward has problems.  The members, it seems, just
do what they have to do and sometimes not even that much.  There’s not much
enthusiasm or the spirit that they should have.  <b>Sister Miskin</b> was the
Relief Society President and she asked the Bishop right away if I could teach
in the Relief Society so I was called to teach the Spiritual Living lessons.  I
enjoyed this calling and felt I learned a lot as the teacher always learns the
most.  They asked Ken to be the High Priest Group Leader.  We had wonderful
neighbors.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The <b>Thompsons</b> bought Grandpa
and Grandma Bushnell’s home after they passed away.  They remodeled the home as
he was a carpenter.  They were an older couple, but very wonderful people. 
They were always bringing us over some goodies.  Around Thanksgiving they
brought us over a turkey as they said they had been given three and they wanted
us to have one.  <b>Belva Provost</b> was Sandy’s lst year Beehive teacher in
M.I.A. and a very wonderful one.  In their class they picked a secret
grandmother and Sandy picked Sister Thompson.  She did special secret things
for Sister Thompson during the year and at the end of the year, they had a
special night to honor their secret grandmothers and when Sister Thompson found
out that Sandy was her secret granddaughter, she made a dip and drape doll for
her.  It was really cute with red hair, a yellow and white plaid dress and hat
and a white apron.  Sandy was really thrilled and it still sets on her dresser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our neighbors next to the Thompsons were <b>Ross
and Glenda Taylor</b>.  Glenda is Melba Miskin’s daughter and Melba lived next
door to them.  We enjoyed Ross and Glenda.  We went out to eat with them,
invited them to our home for dinner, went bike riding with them, etc.  Glenda
and I also worked on several projects and committees for ward activities. 
After about the third one in a row, she told her mother that she needed a rest
from them, as I always went all out and it was so much work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=174 height=131
src="Chapter_27_-_Our_Move_to_Sunset,_Utah_files/image002.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=P1190725>            We became good friends with <b>Ralph &amp;
Belva Provost</b> and with <b>Ben and Linda Sisneros</b>.  The six of us would
go out to eat together and enjoy visiting.  They were wonderful people.  Sandy
and the Sisneros’s daughter, Julie, were also good friends.  The only problem
with this friendship was that Ben was too strict.  He would say “No” before the
two children could hardly even ask him anything.  Julie couldn’t play with Sandy
very much when Ben was around.  I guess he thought she should stay home and not
play with friends.  Linda was better about that and would let them play when
Ben wasn’t home.  Linda and I would talk on the phone for an hour or more at a
time.  Whenever she called, I knew I would be on the phone for quite a while,
but she was really fun to talk to.  She is really talented.  She is an artist,
in fact, she painted me a picture that I really love.  She always does the
roadshows because she is so good.  She writes the script, paints the scenery,
designs the costumes, directs the roadshow and everything else.  She asked me
to be in the entre act along with several other women.  It was really fun.  She
made us a costume out of cardboard and painted them.  We carried them and stuck
our heads through.  I was the Shirley Temple doll. <b>Dorothy McKnee,</b> (another
good friend that we went square dancing with, her husband and Ben Sisneros were
counselors in the Bishopric) was another doll, Belva Provost was the Raggedy
Ann doll and Glenda Taylor was a little girl in it who was trying to decide
which doll she wanted to buy.  Linda is such a perfectionist that we had lots
of practices, but I really enjoyed it.  Linda also asked Ken and I to be in a
play that she was asked to direct for our wards Art Festival.  I was the mother
of the bride in the play.  Belva is very talented in drama so she was the
bride.  Her son was also in it, plus Ken and Ben and two other older teenage
boys who were also very good.  It was a hill billy play, and we really had a
ball practicing it and putting it on.  I was surprised that I could do
something like that as I’d never before had a main part in a play.  It’s
surprising what you can do if you try and ask the Lord’s help.  When we had the
Bushnell Reunion in May 1976, Mom asked if we could put this play on for them. 
The rest of the cast agreed and Linda felt it would be good experience for us
and so we did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Several years later, Ralph Provost passed away
and it was hard on Belva.  They were only able to have two children and Robin,
their daughter, married, but he wasn’t a good husband, so she divorced him.
Belva &amp; Ralph’s son became gay.  Belva would have been a wonderful
grandmother, but neither of her children had children.  I’m sure that is so
hard on Belva.  Belva moved to East Fruit Heights and became the mayor.  This
picture shows her in a parade as the mayor.  Her daughter, Robin, is in the DUP
with me now in 2017.  She is a sweet lady, like her mother.  She became a
school teacher, but is retired now.  Ben Sisneros passed away also leaving
Linda at an early age.</p>

hspace=12 alt="Ken with children at Halloween in Sunset home">            <b>Mike,
David and Scott’s bedroom used to be my bedroom</b>.  It had a window that was
over the roof of the porch of the basement outside door.  Mike was 5 and David
was 4.  I would put them down for a nap and close the door.  I must have put
Scott down for a nap in our bedroom.  Anyway, a couple of hours later, I would
hear them call out to me and say they were awake and could they get up now.  I
didn’t find out until after they were married that soon after I would close the
door, they would open the bedroom window, climb out onto the porch roof and
slide down the column posts and run down to the part, which was just below the
end of our lot.  They said they would play there until they thought it had been
long enough that I might check on them, so they would run home, climb up the
posts, open the window and climb back into bed and then call out to me.  I’m
not sure how I never checked on them all that time.  I’m sure glad they didn’t
get hurt.  Now days, if that happened they might be kidnapped, but it was much safer
in those days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I used to give our children an
allowance.  They had chores to do each day, but they were expected to do those
and help out as we were a family and worked together, but we knew they needed
some spending money, so we gave them a weekly allowance.   Mike and David have
always been “best buddies”, but they are very different.  One thing I will
point out here is how they deal with money.  David is a saver and Mike is a
spender.   They were this way even starting at this young age.  When they would
get their allowance, they would walk together over to the little store on the
corner.  Mike would spend all his money on candy, pop, ice cream or whatever. 
David would buy a few 2 for 1 penny candies and save the rest of his money.  A
couple of days later, Mike would want some more candy and he didn’t have any
money so he would ask David if he could borrow some money from him.  David knew
about interest, so he told Mike he would give him so much, but he had to pay
him more than he borrowed.  Mike agreed, so when they got their next allowance,
Mike had to pay David almost half of what he got.  Mike kept borrowing
practically every week, so he was always in debt to David and David kept saving
his money and making more from Mike.  They were both good to pay their tithing
first.  I remember when we were first teaching them about tithing and gave them
their allowance; Mike gave us most of his money and said it was for tithing. 
When we discussed it with him, he had thought he got to keep 10 cents and pay
the rest, instead of the other way around.  He was happy to learn that he got
to keep most of the money, but we thought it was neat that he had been willing
to give the 90 cents.</p>

hspace=12 alt="Ken &amp; Scott with our dog, Casper">We got a beautiful dog - a
white Spitz, named <b>Casper.</b>  Sandy wanted a dog so bad.  She said she
would even pay for it.  She was babysitting, so earning some money.  Ken didn’t
want one, but he finally made some stipulations that if we could find a dog
that was a female, had been spaded and had the shots, was housebroken, a good
dog and good with children, a good watchdog, etc., etc.  He even said if it was
white and didn’t cost much money - then we could have it.  I went to a lady’s
home in Clearfield sometimes to get my hair done.  One day when I was over there,
I saw her beautiful white dog and commented on it.  She said “Do you know
anyone who would like her?”  I asked her why and she said they loved the dog
and it was such a good dog, but they lived by where the school kids passed on
their way to school and the kids would tease the dog and was making her mean. 
She didn’t want that to happen so they had talked about giving her away to a
good family who would love her and take good care of her.  The dog met all of
Ken’s stipulations - so I told her we would love to have her.  I did offer to
pay $10 because they had paid a lot of her and had her spaded, shots, etc.  I
can’t remember whether Sandy paid the $10 or me, but Sandy was so excited as
were all of us.  Ken was really surprised as he didn’t expect me to be able to
find such a dog.  He grew to love her too.  I think the Lord had a hand in that
as we did need Casper.  She was a great comfort and joy to all of us.  I think
she was the only house dog we had as Ken felt that dogs &amp; cats needed to
stay outdoors.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b> It is now July 1975 and we are
on vacation at Island Park in Idaho at Buttermilk Campground</b>.  It is so
beautiful &amp; peaceful here.  We have been here almost a week.  This weekend
we will enjoy being with relatives for the Robinson reunion here at Mac’s
lodge.   <b>When we were setting up camp, David started calling me.  I looked
around and couldn’t see him.  He yelled “up here Mom, I’m up in the tree”.  I
looked up to where the sound was coming from and there he was up at the top of
a tall pine tree.  He was holding onto the top and swinging back and forth.  I
was really frightened as he was only about 3 or 4 years old.  I told him to get
back down and we went over to help him after he got almost to the bottom.  I
don’t know how he could have climbed that tree, but David was daring and loved
adventure.  Soon after that, he said he needed to go to the bathroom.  Shellie
was riding her bike and we asked her to take him to the bathroom.  Sometime
later, we couldn’t find David and asked Shellie where he was.  She said “I
don’t know”.  We found out she had taken him to the outhouse and then left him
there, and continued riding her bike.  We became frightened as it was starting
to get dark.  We all went in different directions, calling him and frantically
looking for him.  Finally, a man came towards us holding David’s hand.  We were
so relieved to find him.  David said he came out and couldn’t find Shellie and
started walking to find us, but he had gotten lost.  He was frightened and
started to cry when the man had found him.  We were upset with Shellie for
leaving him, but so thankful he was alright</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>GRANDMA’S RASBERRIES (MY MOM’S)  (Put picture of her in
her raspberry patch)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=397 height=298
src="Chapter_27_-_Our_Move_to_Sunset,_Utah_files/image005.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=P1190375.JPG>My mother had a big raspberry patch and while we
were living here in Sunset, Mom asked if the children and I could come and help
her pick them.  I could have what I picked and she would pay the children for
what they picked, as she sold them in cases to her customers.  We would go
early before it got hot.  We also would eat as we picked.  We had a small
bucket tied around our waist with a small rope.  When the bucket was full, we
would empty it into baskets to form a case of raspberries.  Many times, I would
pick mine to make jam and frozen raspberries for salads, but other times I
would pick them to help mom sell them to other people.  Mom would pay the
children to pick them for other people.  It was hard at times because the
raspberries were so close together and we would get scratched, sun burned, have
spiders &amp; other insects get on you, etc.  But it was also good to spend the
time with Mom/Grandma and visit with her as we picked.  They were delicious,
big raspberries so we sure enjoyed them too.  Dad picked them sometimes also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom &amp; Dad were wonderful grandparents.  All
Mom’s grandchildren loved her and loved to come to her house.  She had toys for
them to play with, in their basement, and Grandma gave them chewable vitamin
Cs, plus other food and snacks.  She loved them and they knew it.  Dad was
great too, but he was gone most of the time with work, church responsibilities
and when he had some time, he loved to sit in his favorite chair and read his
scriptures and other good books, so he didn’t interact with the grandchildren
as much, but that’s the way it is with most grandparents, it’s the grandmother
who is the nurturer and loves to be with her family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken was very discontent working for John
Howard at the Commercial Security Bank’s data processing center.</b>  John had
made several promises that he didn’t keep.  One, he told us that if we had any
trouble selling our home with having to move so quick, that the bank would
either make the payments for us, or buy it.  Well, they didn’t, and we did have
a hard time selling it.  Everything had tightened up in Mesa and Phoenix
as people were out of work and having to move (a big recession) so there were
so many homes for sale and people couldn’t afford to buy a new home.  Larry and
Tammy offered to try to sell it for us so they ran an ad in two newspapers. 
Larry fixed up the yard after our other neighbor had let everything about die
out.  He was going to keep it up for us and then we would pay him, but I guess
he was too busy so it really ran down.  Larry suggested that we put up a nice
fence since so many of the people who looked at the home wanted a fence.  Ken
and I decided to go down and build the fence.  We enjoyed the visit with our
friends and the nice trip, but the fence cost us $700.00 which we really
couldn’t afford.  Time went on and the home still hadn’t sold.  We felt it was
really a burden on Larry and Tammy to have to keep up the yard when they lived
about five miles away, and to have to go back and forth to show people our home
- so we decided to list it with a realtor even though it meant that we would
lose more money because they would take out their commission.  We were having a
hard time financially since we were paying Mom and Dad $150.00 a month rent,
and still making $200.00 a month, house payments on our home in Mesa. 
Ken talked to John to see if they wouldn’t make the payment or help us as he
had promised.  He finally got us what the interest payment would be on the home
for two months, but Ken practically had to beg him for that.  Time went on and
we didn’t know what we were going to do.  Finally, the realtor called and made
an offer to buy it herself for rental property.  It meant that we would really
lose on the home.  In fact, the little bit that we would get would pay Larry
and Tammy for the money they had put into our home fixing it up and the ads in
the paper and the fence.  It also meant that we wouldn’t have a down payment to
put on another home for us here in Utah.  We were really sick because we had
planned to have Ken build us a home on an acre of land.  We had even looked at
some land in Clinton.  With this Dilemma, Mom and Dad offered to let us buy the
home we were living in.  They had it appraised for $37,000.  That included the
apartments in back.  We really didn’t want the home because it was old and
would need new plumbing and wiring.  And the kitchen and bathroom needed to be
remodeled, and Ken had wanted a garage which this home didn’t have.  But, we
didn’t have a down payment and the folks would let us buy it for nothing down
and a lower interest that we could get on any other home, so we had about
decided to buy it.  Then Ken said one evening, “I just don’t want this home.” 
So, I said that we shouldn’t buy it then.  Mom and Dad were disappointed
because they wanted us to buy it for sentimental reasons and also that meant
that we would be living close to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken confronted John with breaking this promise
and also several others.  One was that Ken would only have to be the data
processing supervisor on graveyard shift for a few months or a year and then he
could move into the daytime programmer’s department.  Ken couldn’t sleep very
well during the day and it seemed to disrupt the whole family with his unusual
schedule.  I was always fixing meals it seemed.  I would fix breakfast for the
children, then Ken would come home from work and I’d fix breakfast for him. 
Then lunch for us, then Ken would wake up and I’d fix him lunch.  We’d be
hungry for supper and he wouldn’t. So, we would stagger that or try to
compromise.  It was hard on my nerves trying to keep the children quiet while
he slept.  He couldn’t sleep very well, so he was cross a lot of the time.  Not
only from not getting enough sleep, but because he was unhappy at John.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Irven, Ken’s younger brother, was working for
Burrows company in Salt Lake and talked to <b>Gary Miles who owned a
programming company</b> and did work for the Burrows company, about Ken.  He
had Ken come down for an interview.  It went very well, and he said he’d let us
know.  On returning from our vacation at Island Park in Idaho, we found a
message that Gary had called and wanted Ken to return his call.  Ken did and
got the job.  We were really thrilled.  Ken commuted back and forth every day. 
This soon got tiresome as it was expensive for gas and it took away two extra
hours from the family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In July, just prior to our leaving for vacation
to Island Park, <b>Bishop Sid Sly</b> came to our home to talk with me.  He
said they were changing the primary presidency as Sister Holbrook had been in
for several years.  He asked if I would be the new <b>primary president</b>.  I
told him that Ken had changed jobs and was working in Salt Lake
now and we would probably be moving down to Salt Lake in the near future.  He
said he felt inspired to call me and that they would like me to hold that
position as long as I did live here.  I consented.  While on our vacation I
prayed and tried to decide on my counselors.  When I returned, I talked to Ben
Sisneros about my choices and he helped me decide.  (He was the counselor over
the primary).  I chose <b>Karen Bidwell as my first counselor and Kay Kendall
as my second counselor</b>.  Our secretary was sister Fern Beesley.  We visited
our teachers and decided on some others for classes without teachers.  We
decided to make cakes for the teacher’s birthdays and do some other projects. 
We held our presidency meetings the morning before primary.  I grew to love
these two counselors and I enjoyed working with them and the teachers.  We
bought our home in August, but had to wait until the last of October to have it
approved and the paper work done.  We moved the last of November.  My special
counselors and secretary bought me a darling <b>little ceramic doll.  It has a
green dress with pink flowers</b>.  I have it still today and cherish it.  I
have gotten many gifts from special friends, neighbors and those I served with
in the church and I keep them around my home to remind me of these special
people and they bring back special memories.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When the Bishop told <b>Sister Miskin</b> that I
would be released from the Relief Society to be President of the Primary, she
was very upset.  In fact, the Sunday that I was sustained, she walked out of
Sacrament Meeting at that time.  She told me afterwards that she felt that
anyone could be president of the primary, but only certain ones could be good
teachers in the Relief Society.  She said she told the Bishop that he might as
well release her if he was going to release me as I was one of the main ones
that kept the Relief Society going.  I don’t feel this way.  We are all
replaceable.   It was just that I enjoyed this position and I tried to do my
best as I try to in any position that I hold.  I know that if I do all I can,
the Lord will bless me and help me to magnify my callings.  I love the Lord and
love serving him and his children.  I had made posters and other visual aids
and handouts and I tried different methods such as panel discussions, handed
parts out or assigned things to other sisters and I did put a lot of time into
my lessons, which I guess some of the other teachers did not.  But, Sister
Miskin was overly dramatic about it.  I felt bad that she was resentful towards
the Bishopric for this change as there is always change and we have to trust in
the Lord that it is what he wants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was also the Sunday School Librarian in the
Sunset 2<sup>nd</sup> ward.  I enjoyed the ward and my friends and associations
there.  Judy Gebheim was in the Relief Society Presidency and also P.T.A.
President.  Judy and I have been good friends ever since she and Hendrick
(Ken’s best friend growing up) were married.  When Hendrick was killed in a
truck accident, she married Dennis Gebheim a year later.  He isn’t a very good
husband or father, but Judy still stays with him.  They moved to Sunset so I
was glad to be reunited with her.  She asked me to be the Safety Chairman in
the P.T.A.  President Petersen of our Stake Presidency was the principal of the
elementary school.  I enjoyed this position although it was a lot of work and
took a lot of time.  One of my responsibilities was to carry out Safety Week.
We had contests, showed films, had bike safety courses and I gave the teachers
several suggestions to do during that week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was released as Primary President, prior
to our moving, they put in Karen Bidwell, my lst counselor as the president. 
Her husband wasn’t very active, but he supported her.  Karen is a bubbly
talkative person.  We’d usually be on the phone for long periods of time when
I’d talk to her, but I enjoyed it.  Karen was also my Relief Society visiting
teaching partner.  She wasn’t afraid to go the extra mile either which also
made me want her for my counselor.  Soon after we moved to Taylorsville, the
Sunset 2<sup>nd</sup> ward bishopric was changed.  The new bishop was Mel
Wood.  He called and asked our family to come and speak in the ward.  We did so
and were happy to see everyone again.  Whenever we go back to a former ward,
the members always treat us so good and act so happy to see us.  We’re thankful
for these people and the things we have learned from them and the experiences
we have had.  When we moved, the Sunset Stake President, President Rock told us,
when we saw him at a wedding reception, that we weren’t supposed to move
because <b>they had Ken in mind for the new bishop</b>.  Also, President
Peterson had told me that, when I was at the elementary school.  Other members
of the ward also expressed that same thought.  I feel Ken would have been a
bishop by now if we hadn’t moved so many times.  He probably would have been in
the Mount Fort Ward because our stake president there, Pres. Wimmer had told us
about that same thing when we were moving from there.  He could have been in Clearfield also because he was serving as lst counselor when we moved to Mesa.  When
Bishop Rees was released and Bishop Opie was put in as Bishop of the Lehi 3<sup>rd</sup>
ward in Mesa, we were talking with him at his daughter’s wedding breakfast in
Salt Lake and he said he surely would have asked for Ken to be his counselor
had he still been in the ward, and that he had a hard time choosing his
counselors.  Ken feels that the Lord probably knows that he shouldn’t be a
bishop and that’s one reason why we keep moving.  I don’t feel that way; I feel
Ken would make a wonderful bishop.  He says he doesn’t have enough patience
with the members, but then maybe he would learn more patience.   Although, it’s
fine with me if he isn’t called to be a Bishop as it is a very demanding
position and it would be hard on Ken, me and the family (although I know the
Lord blesses you also).    Ken is a very wonderful and spiritual person and
whether or not he ever becomes a bishop, I feel he is worthy and I’m sure
thankful for him and for the example he sets for me and our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had lived in Arizona for three years before
moving back to Utah. While living in Sunset, <b><u>David had another problem
with his health</u>.</b>  He again didn't have much energy so I called Dr.
Swanstrom as I wondered if David was low on iron again.  It is interesting that
we have had David's blood tested by other doctors and they say his blood is
normal.  We know better because he isn't healthy and when we send a spernum (I
think that's what Dr. Swanstrom called it - the test by saliva) Dr. Swanstrom
would say he was low and would send more iron and magnesium up and he would get
well again.  This time Dr. Swanstrom told me that David had a film growing over
his white cells and he would send hydrochloric acid up and to follow his
directions carefully.  I asked him what the problem was and he said that David
could literally starve to death - that with this film over his white cells, he
couldn't assimilate the food.  He could eat wonderful food, but it wouldn't do
him any good.  I was worried and Dr. Swanstrom said he felt this would dissolve
the film and he would be ok.  He did tell me to send a spernum from David just
shortly before we finished giving him all of it.  It came in a bottle with a
dropper.  We were to put so many drops of it into half a glass of water each
day.  Dr. Swamstrom told us the seriousness of it as people had died of this. 
He said the spernum would tell whether the film was dissolved and if it wasn't,
he would send up another bottle, but all he could have David take was two
bottles.  If that didn't work, he didn't know what else to do.  We sent the
first spernum down and it hadn't dissolved the film so Dr. Swanstrom sent the 2nd
bottle up.  I prayed constantly that this 2nd bottle of hydrochloric acid would
dissolve it.  When we sent the next spernum down, he called and said it was
dissolved and David should be fine.  Boy, were we ever grateful to him and the
Lord.</p>
