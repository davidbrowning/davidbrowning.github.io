align=left hspace=12 alt="1b David - born 12 Sep 1970">On September of 1970,
the Lord blessed us with another beautiful baby son whom we named David.   When
this son was born, I told Ken I didn't care if his mom didn't like the name of
David, we did and he was our child and we could name him what we wanted - so we
named him David Glen.  Glen after my father.  Ken's mom never said anything
about his name.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My concerns about having two children so close,
especially since Shellie &amp; Mike were only two years apart, quickly ended
when David was born.  David didn't have colic and was a contented baby, and
Mike was so cute with David and always wanted to help.  He was a big help.  I
let him get me the diapers, binkee, help feed him when I bottle fed him or gave
him water in the bottle, etc.  He always wanted to hold him, etc., and as soon
as David was old enough to play, they were having fun together.  David,
although a contended baby, was a sickly baby.  He was always getting colds
which would turn into tonsillitis, croup, ear infections, etc.  </p>
