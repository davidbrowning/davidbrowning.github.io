<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Pat, myself &amp; the
Savior</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was about 14, my best friend, Pat
Kleitches and I were babysitting for a family in the ward.  They had asked me
to tend their children and I asked if Pat could come along.  Pat’s parents
weren’t members of our church, so, of course, she wasn’t either.  They were
antagonistic to the church and forbid Pat to join.  They had allowed her to go
to church with me.  She had always gone to Sunday School, Primary, M.I.A. and
sometimes Sacrament Meeting with me.  They had moved from Pennsylvania to
Sunset, Utah when Pat was seven years old.  She lived on the highway about 4
houses away from me.  We had become best friends.  Pat and I had discussions
about the church many times.  On this particular night, after the children were
asleep, Pat and I began discussing the church again.  I bore my testimony to
her and we began to feel the spirit of the Lord.  All of a sudden, I looked
over at the big chair which was to my left.  It was aglow.  There was a
beautiful brightness and in the middle of it was Jesus Christ - or an angel. 
I’m not sure which, although we felt it was Christ.  I was so filled with the
love of this being that I immediately began to cry.  Pat began crying almost at
the same time.  When I looked again, he was gone.  We cried and cried for a
long time.  When we at last gained composure, she said, “Mae, did you see
Christ?”  I nodded yes, and we hugged each other.  She had seen him the exact
same time I had, but he didn’t stay long, just long enough for us to see him
sitting in that chair and to feel his presence.  It was such a beautiful
experience and I know it helped to instill the desire in Pat’s heart to join
the church. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Pat married Ron Bradfield in February of 1959,
our senior year.  Ken and I witnessed their marriage at Pat’s parents’ home. 
About a year later when Ken and I were living in Sunset, renting Mom and Dad’s
apartment behind their home, I got a call from Pat.  She said the missionaries
had finished teaching her the lessons and she wanted to be baptized as she had
a testimony that it was true, but was afraid that if she did, her parents would
disown her.  I went over to her apartment to talk with her.  I told her that
many had joined the church even though it meant their folks would disown them. 
She decided to join as her husband wanted her to do so also.  Her parents did
disown her and made it very miserable for Pat.  They even came to her apartment
and took back everything they had ever given her (at least the things she still
had).  Finally, after several months and much heartache, they did reunite.  
Pat &amp; Ron wanted to be married in the temple, but Pat was having a hard
time with the law of tithing.  We had another good talk.  She explained to me
that she wanted to pay tithing, but there just wasn’t enough money.  She had
figured and refigured and when she paid the bills, and bought the food, there
wasn’t money left to pay tithing.   I explained that if they would pay their
tithing first (before paying their bills) the Lord would bless them, and they
would have enough money left over to pay their bills and buy their food.  I
told her it worked for us and I was sure it would for her.  I told her to at
least try it.  I really prayed hard for her that she would have the faith to
try it.  She did, and it did work.  She called and told me that she didn’t know
how it worked, but it did, and she was so happy.  They were able to get a
temple recommend and go to the temple.  I was able to be the one to go through
with her - since her mother wasn’t a member and she didn’t have a sister or any
close family member.  I was thrilled to be with her.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We have always stayed close.  She has thanked me
over and over for being her best friend and fellowshipping her into the gospel
and setting the example for her. Pat is a very special lady.  She has raised a
wonderful family.  She is a wonderful wife, mother and grandmother.  She has
been a YWMIA President and loved the girls.  She has done a lot for so many
people and loves the Lord and continues to serve him and her fellow men.  I am
thankful that Pat was my best friend.  My husband, Ken, is now my best friend,
but she continues to be a very dear friend.  I know that I was just an
instrument in the Lord’s hands to help Pat into the Church, and it was him, not
me.  I don’t want the credit, but I am thankful to my Heavenly Father for the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessing she has been in my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>BROTHER COVEY – PRAYING
BEFORE READING THE SCRIPTURES:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had been to a lecture by Bro. Covey who told
us that we should pray before studying the scriptures and this would help us to
understand the scriptures better and to gain more from them.  I did this, and I
enjoyed reading and pondering the scriptures so much.  I would cry many times
as I read about the Savior and felt the spirit. I enjoyed this time as I took more
time to read the scriptures and ponder them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>My Guardian Angel</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am a little nervous about telling this
experience, but I need to.  I have told some, or maybe all, of our children as
they were growing up, to impress upon them the importance of praying for
protection both spiritually as well as physically, and also the influence of
Satan in our lives and how we need to not put ourselves in a position to be
tempted like that.   Ken and I were engaged, and we were very much in love.  We
were engaged 8 months and that is a long time, but I wanted to graduate from
high school before we got married and Ken gave me my engagement ring in October
of 1958.  Our wedding date was set for June 19<sup>th</sup>.  One evening after
going to a formal dance, I invited Ken into my house.  It was late and everyone
in my family was asleep, so we didn’t turn on any lights.  We stood together
kissing and Ken started unzipping my formal at the back.  He had never done
this before.  All of a sudden, we saw mom walk from her and dad’s bedroom into
the bathroom.  Even though the lights were not on, we could see her clearly. I
guess from the street and other lights reflecting in the windows.  She was
wearing her long pink nightgown and had her cap on her head.  She always went
to the beauty shop to have her hair set each week and so at night, to keep it
from being messed up, she would wrap toilet paper around her hair and pin it
with bobby pins and then put on a mesh cap to hold it.  Ken quickly zipped up
my dress and we stood there waiting for the bathroom light to go on or for the
toilet to flush or to hear the water in the sink – but we heard nothing.  We
waited for several minutes and then I went to the bathroom and spoke softly to
her as I wondered if she was alright.  When she didn’t answer, I opened the
door, but no one was in the bathroom and we had not seen her leave.  The only
thing Ken and I could think is that it was my guardian angel who was there to
protect us from Satan’s influence.  Ken and I both are in a habit of praying to
the Lord both night and morning for safety and protection among other things,
and as we realized what could have happened that night, we knelt down and
thanked the Lord for answering our prayers and sending my guardian angel to
protect us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad – giving me a
blessing.</span></b>  Ken, myself and our family were up from Arizona visiting
for Thanksgiving and I woke in the middle of the night with terrible pains in
my stomach.  At first, I thought it was just indigestion, but it got worse
&amp; worse.  Ken was sleeping, and I didn’t want to wake him, and I knew that
dad got up several times during the night to go to the bathroom, so I waited
for him to give me a blessing.  Finally, Mom got up to go to the bathroom and
found me in such pain, so she woke dad.  As soon as he put his hands on my head
and gave me a beautiful blessing that the pain would stop – it did stop, and I
have never had that pain return.  I was so grateful for the power of the
priesthood and that dad honored his priesthood and was worthy to give me that
blessing.  Ken felt bad, the next morning, that I hadn’t woke him, so he could
give me the blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad – in hospital prior to
passing away.</span></b>  Mom had been hanging on to him, she wouldn’t let him
die.  He had Anti-Tripson Deficiency and had been getting worse and worse.  He
was on oxygen 24/7.  He didn’t feel like eating.  Mom kept trying to get him to
eat, but he said he wasn’t hungry.  He was miserable.  He had always been so
healthy as he took good care of himself by eating right, taking vitamins and
minerals, working hard and after retiring, he walked every day.  He had good
posture, etc.  This Anti-Tripson Deficiency is an inherited disease.  Anyway,
he had pneumonia along with his disease, so was taken to the hospital.  Mom had
been with him and was really tired, so Georgia asked Rick if he would take her
home.  She didn’t want to leave dad, but we convinced her that she needed to
get some sleep, or she would get sick.  Soon after they left, Georgia &amp; I
went over to dad’s bed and told him that he could pass away now.  We told him
that Rick had taken Mom home to get some sleep.  Dad bore his testimony to us
girls and told us how much he loved us and were proud of us and that he loved
all of his family.  I told dad that I had always knew he had a testimony.  We
told him we loved him, we gave him a hug and right after, he passed away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sister in Relief Society</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I was walking into Relief Society one morning<b>, </b>I
saw a sister sitting by herself at the back of the room.  I had a strong
feeling that I should go and sit by her, but just at that moment my friend,
Mishelle Killian, motioned for me to come sit by her.  She was sitting towards
the front.  I stood there trying to decide what to do and Mishelle kept
motioning for me to come and sit by her, so I gave in and went there.  I had an
uncomfortable feeling and wished I had gone with my feelings as I noticed no
one sat by this sister.  I didn’t know her very well, but knew the spirit had
wanted me to sit by her.  I thought I would speak to her after R.S. but I
didn’t get the chance.  A few days later, I found out that this sister had
moved on Monday and that she was in the process of divorce.  Her husband had
left her and her children.  I felt so bad that I had not listened to the
Spirit.  If I had, I probably could have visited with her before and after R.S.
and found this out and could have offered to help her or tend her children, or
whatever the Holy Ghost directed me to do and say.   I hope I can listen and
act next time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>NFIB – working and what
happened one-day March 19, 1987</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was really hoping to do good today.  I didn’t get any
sales yesterday, part of the day was spent with Dave Young, my manager.  He is
here meeting with all his people.  He is a good boss, and a good person.  He is
my brother, Bryce’s friend, also a friend of Ken’s brother, Irven.  Well –
anyway, the morning wasn’t good.  I drove all over – couldn’t find owners,
couldn’t find addresses, roads were torn up, etc.  I finally did new business,
gave a couple of presentations, almost got one closed, then he changed his mind
for the time.  I went to sell another that we had already given the
presentation to, but they want to wait for a month.  I was pretty discouraged
and upset because of the pressure.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Dave had asked me to call him
around noon, so we could meet, and he could give me some more cards he was
getting from another representative.  I finally got a hold of him and we met. 
He gave me lots of cards and supplies he had gotten from Norm Thompson, the Mesa representative who just went into another business because he needed more money to
support his family.  Dave invited me to go to lunch with him and even though I
trust him (he loves his wife, is strong in the church, good friend to Bryce
&amp; Irven, etc.) and even though I hadn’t eaten lunch, I declined as I wanted
to get to work and make some sales for the day.  I drove to a shaded area,
sorted the cards, drove off to Mesa to begin work again.  I reached for my kit
as I got out of the car and it wasn’t there.  I looked all over the car and no
kit.  I started to panic because it had the checks in from the sales I had made
this week.  I got out and frantically looked through the boxes that Dave had
given me, that were in the trunk.  It was nowhere to be found.  I was so upset
and scared.  I drove to a phone booth and called Dave.  He was there, thank
goodness.  I asked him if I could have left my kit in his car.  He ran out to
check, but no, it wasn’t there.  He asked if my kit had checks in it and I said
“yes.”  He could tell that I was really upset and worried, so he tried to
console me by telling me how others had done similar things, tried to tell me
funny things to get me to laugh, and told me not to take it personally – that
things like that happen to lots of people and some things are lots worse.  He
was so understanding, I could hardly believe it.  I told him at the first
(after he told me it wasn’t in his car) that he should fire me.  He said, “I
can’t, you’re one of my very best people.”  He is always complimenting me and
encouraging me.  He’s a great boss – all his people think so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> He told me to drive back to where
we were parked – that maybe I had sat it on the trunk or the top of the car and
forgot and driven off.  That it might be there.  I did.  It was ½ mile away,
but I drove fast.  It wasn’t there.  I went into businesses close by and asked
if anyone had turned in a brown binder, but no one had.  I wondered if I could
have put it on the trunk when I sorted my cards, so I drove there.  It wasn’t
there.  That was the same place (shopping center) where I had called Dave
before, so I decided to go over and call him to tell him the bad news.  He had
told me that I could go back to the businesses who had given me checks and get
them to stop payment on the checks and write me out new ones.  I hated the
thought of doing that, but I knew I would have to – but there was another
problem.  I couldn’t remember all the businesses that had given me checks – and
I had no way of finding out as the receipt was with the person, and the
membership card was with the checks in the kit.  As I came up to the phone
booth, it dawned on me (the Holy Ghost) that the last time I remember having my
kit was when I gave a presentation to a jeweler in that shopping center, so I
might have laid it on top of the phone booth while I made the call four hours
earlier.  That maybe someone had turned it in to one of the stores, so I
checked, and no one had.  I went back and called Dave.  We discussed it some
more and he again tried to console me.  He told me that he had another copy of
the membership list and Craig in Phoenix would make me up another kit and get
it to me early the next morning.  He said he wished he could help more, but he
had so much to do.  He had already helped so much, and I sure appreciated it. 
He told me to cheer up and go sit in the car and think and let the Holy Ghost
prompt me, that maybe I could still find it.  If not, to go home and have a
good evening and tomorrow would be a better day.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>As I went to leave the phone booth,
I remembered that I better call home, so the family wouldn’t worry.  I noticed
a man waiting to use the phone, so I asked if I could make one more quick
call.  I told him something devastating had just happened.  <b>He looked at me
funny and said, “You look familiar.”  He had a business card in his hand.  He
said, “You aren’t Mae Browning, are you?”  I said “yes, do you have my brown
book?”  He did.</b>  We walked to his big rig (he was a trucker) and he
explained how he had found my book, and going through it, he saw the checks,
etc., and knew the person who owned it might lose their job if they didn’t find
it (most bosses would fire their people for this reason), so he found my
business card and called our home.  Scott answered, and this man left his name
and number in California.  But then he knew that if I called California, his
brother-in-law (his partner wouldn’t know anything about it and wouldn’t be
able to help me.  He also knew that he couldn’t just leave my book at a store,
etc., nearby as they might be dishonest and cash the checks.  He knew he
wouldn’t be back in Tempe for another week, and that I’d need it now.  He
waited around trying to figure out what to do.  He looked on his map for my
address, to take it there, but knew he couldn’t fit his rig down the roads in a
housing division.  He was to pick up a load at a certain time, but didn’t, as
he felt he had to work something out for me.  Four hours later, at the same
phone booth, he was waiting to use the phone to call my home again to see if I
was home by now and to see if I could meet him somewhere to get my book. 
Wow!!! I knew the Lord had used him as an instrument in answering my prayers. 
Here he, a good, honest, man (he didn’t look like one and a lot of truckers
might not be) and he really went the extra mile to help me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> I wanted to repay him somehow so
gave him four dollars I had in my purse and asked him to give me his name and
address and I would send him more money.  I explained that we were having
financial problems and that’s why I had gotten this job, but I didn’t tell him
that, to get out of paying him a reward or something, I was just upset and
grateful and blurted it out.  He said “no, I’m just glad I could help you.”  I
told him that I didn’t know if he was a Christian or not, but I was, and I knew
the Lord had used him – a good, honest man to answer my prayers.  I also told
him that if I couldn’t repay him for his extreme kindness, that I would help
other people.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It really makes me realize that
lately I haven’t taken time to help others or show love like I used to and
should.  I’ve felt so pressured lately that I haven’t.  I will do better in the
future. (I put a copy in 1987 part of this history)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Spiritual experience
involving Scott</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were still living with Mom Jensen and Scott was a
teenager.  He had great friends, but one night they wanted to go to a rock
concert in Park City.  I didn’t really want him to go to a rock concert, but we
let him go.  He drove our little Sprint and took his friends.  I had recently had
an operation – hysterectomy and I was recovering.  I wasn’t feeling good.  I
couldn’t go to sleep and I remember sitting up waiting for Scott.  He didn’t
come when I thought he should have.  I began to get more and more anxious. 
Finally, a dark despairing feeling came over me and I knelt down and prayed.  I
asked Heavenly Father to please protect Scott and bring him back home safely
and soon.  At that moment, I had a warm, wonderful, peaceful feeling come over
me and I knew Scott was alright.  It wasn’t long until he came home.  Last
night, Saturday June 14<sup>th</sup>, as Ken, Jeff, Scott and David were riding
together coming home from a restaurant in Salt Lake where we met Sandi and Mike
to be together and pay for their dad and my dinners for Father’s Day; I was
telling Scott about this experience.  He was sitting next to me in the back
seat.  Ken was on the other side and Jeff was in front with David who was
driving.  When I finished telling Scott this experience, he told me that that
night as they were coming home from the concert, he was starting to pass a semi-truck
when it came over and started to push him off the highway.  He was able to gain
control of the car and they were ok.  I now know why I had that dark and
despairing feeling and felt the need to pray for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>My friend from the
pre-existence. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This experience happened while at the Salt Lake Temple.  I
can’t remember the date or how old I was, probably in my thirties.  Ken and I
had gone to the temple one morning and as I was sitting in the first room, my
eyes focused on a woman about my age who was sitting two or three rows up from
me.  I felt such closeness to her that I could hardly take my eyes off from
her.  I remember that she had long brown hair.  I had a hard time concentrating
on the session.  As we progressed to the next room, she was only one row ahead
of me and I felt such a love and warmth radiating from her that I wished I was
sitting next to her.  As we progressed to the third room, I found that I was
indeed sitting next to her.  As I did, she looked at me with such a beautiful
smile and put her hand on mine.  I have never felt like that before – like I
knew her – like she was a very close friend.  When we went into the Celestial
Room, she was waiting for me and we hugged.  We both started talking at once,
trying to figure out why we felt this closeness for each other.  She and her
husband were on a vacation from another state back east.  They had never been
out here before.  As we talked, we found that we had many things in common.  The
only thing we could figure out is that we must have been close friends in the
pre-existence.  That is the only way we could explain the love and closeness we
felt for each other.  She said the first time she saw me in the first room, she
felt an overwhelming feeling of love for me too.  As our husbands came through
the veil, we introduced them.  We met again, after dressing, before we left the
temple and visited some more and got each other’s address and phone numbers. 
With us moving like we do and maybe they did also, anyway we lost tract of each
other, but I know that I will see her again after this life and we will be
close friends again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Our experience in the Philippines</b> when Tina Linderman
woke up in the night having a terrible feeling that something bad was happening
to us and that she needed to pray.  She did pray for our safety and that was
when Ken and I were dropping off the zone leaders after being to zone leaders
conference in Angeles.  Ken usually dropped them off on the side of the road and
let them walk across the road to their home, but this time we had two boxes of
Book of Mormons for them, so he looked both ways and started to do a U turn to
let them off in front of their home, when at that moment a black car without
his lights on was right there on us.  It was a miracle that he didn’t hit us. 
We all screamed, and the Elders dove for the floor of the car and I threw
myself over to Ken as the car would have hit me broadside.  The Lord just put
out his hand and stopped that car.  Ken drove off the road and stopped and we
all shook, and the black car didn’t move for some time and finally went on. 
I’m sure he was as shaken as we were.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had been in to get my mammogram and the technician noticed
my mole and asked if my doctor had noticed it.  I said the doctor I had before
we went on Medicare didn’t seem concerned about it and my doctor now probably
hadn’t noticed it or at least he hadn’t said anything.  She was concerned and
felt I should have it looked at right away.  I decided I better call my doctor,
but when I told the nurse the reason I was making the appointment, she told me
I needed to see a dermatologist.  I looked one up in my provider list and called
him.  The nurse said I wouldn’t be able to get in for two months.  I had the
thought that I should call Jeanenne and see about doing the alternative
medicine way that she has taken care of moles for Kim.  I am doing that at this
time.  My special friend, Noma tew, in Idaho (our 2<sup>nd</sup> mother) did
this same thing with moles and she is still living.  Another friend and

worse and worse as it kept spreading and she really suffered before she died.

it, but he is prepared.  As he went to leave this morning, he couldn’t find his
keys.  He looked all over.  I stopped what I was doing and helped look for
them.  We looked in his coat and clothes he had on yesterday, we looked on
everything throughout the house.  We went out to his truck and looked there as
well as all around the ground.  It was time that he needed to leave.  He could
have taken my keys as I have a key to his truck on my key ring, but he has the
key to the buses on his key ring and needed that.  As soon as I came back into
our home, I knelt by the couch and said a prayer asking Heavenly Father that he
would help us find the keys as Ken needed to go.  I started looking again, and
I went to our recliner and felt down around the sides of it and felt the keys
way back down there.  They must have fallen out of his pocket when he laid in
the recliner yesterday to take a nap.  I know for sure that the Lord guided me
there, as I don’t think I would have thought to look there if I had not prayed. 
That is another testimony of the power of prayer and the love Heavenly Father
has for each of us if we try to keep his commandments and ask sincerely and
with faith.  I am so thankful for his love and for my membership in his church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>VIRGINIA JOHNSTON -
Tuesday, May 6, 2008 </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken has been really busy the last while
(although he usually keeps really busy as everyone wants him to help them with
one project or another, since he knows how to do everything) as he has been
training to be a bus driver.  Since he is getting older (69 now), he gets tired
easier and gets in pain if he works too hard or too long or if the project is
stressful – so he has decided he wants to phase out of doing construction jobs
except just for our immediate family, and Bob since we live here.  Although, he
will help others in an emergency, if needed, I’m sure.  We can’t make ends meet
just with our social security checks &amp; my small retirement check, so he
needs to bring in extra money some way, so he decided to be a school bus driver. 
He applied, and they need bus drivers, so were excited to have him.  The
training has been lengthy and several tests, but he has completed them.  He is
to work as a substitute for 6 months and then he can apply for his own bus
route if he chooses to.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Anyway, my brother, Bryce and his
wife, Deanna, brought a home in Perry, but it needed a lot of work done to it,
so Bryce asked Ken if he would help him.  My sister, Georgia and her husband
need him to help them do a project, our son, Scott and wife, Mishelle, need him
to fix their bathroom, my cousin, Randy needs him to do projects on remodeling
their home, etc., etc.  On Tuesday, after morning school bus training, he had
planned to go to Bryce’s home to work there again, but realized he wouldn’t
have enough time as we had a meeting that evening with the High Priest Leader
in our ward about family history work, so he worked on projects for Bob &amp;
Mark on the yard and garden.  While we were eating supper, a neighbor called
and asked if he would go to Sister Virginia Johnston’s home and install some
hand safety railings in her shower for her.  He explained that he didn’t have
time and she needed it done right away.  Ken accepted, and we stopped at her
home on our way to the meeting to see what it entailed.  After the meeting, Ken
asked if I would go with him to Virginia’s home while he installed them.  I had
hoped to stay home and do more on-line training on the internet since Irven
&amp; Sandy had been to our home all day while we cooked a meal in our solar
oven.  They hadn’t planned to be there all day, but her and I kept visiting
about different things and the day was gone.  Time sure flies by so fast.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I started to object about going
with him but then I realized that it was hard for him to spend the time doing this
for her, since he was tired from working so hard all day, but he was willing to
do it and besides it wasn’t appropriate for a man to go into a single woman’s
home alone.  Virginia was a widow – so I went with him.  I was glad I did
because as I visited with Virginia, she told me several spiritual experiences
she had with raising her family.  I felt the spirit and my love and admiration
for this special lady and her family grew in my heart.  I felt the Lord gave me
this blessing since I was willing to go with Ken.  Virginia was happy for my
visit too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sister Carolyn Saunders gave the lesson in Relief Society
and it was taken from the First Presidency Message in the July Ensign. 
President Uchtdorf’s message was “Heeding the Voice of the Prophets” and it was
an excellent message.  <b>Sister Saunders had a picture of President Monson on
the table and as I looked at it, I had this wonderful, warm, loving feeling
come over me that lasted for at least a couple of minutes or more.  That was
another confirmation from Heavenly Father that He called Thomas S. Monday to be
our prophet today.  I am thankful for that confirmation.</b>  I do love
President Monson and I know he was to be our prophet, but I loved President
Hinckley so much that it was a little hard for me.  Now there won’t be.  Thank
you, Heavenly Father, for your love in doing this for me.</p>

TWINS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Scott went with Mishelle to the doctor in April of 2009
to see the ultrasound and see what sex their baby was, they both came home
shocked.  They found out they were going to have TWINS, a boy and a girl.  When
they told Kylan and Ashley, Ashley didn’t seem surprised.  She was happy, but
she seemed to know that they were going to have twins.  When they asked her
about it, she said “I knew Heavenly Father would give us twins because I prayed
for that.  I knew if we had a baby girl, I would be really happy, but Kylan
would be sad because he wants a brother, and if we had a baby boy, Kylan would
be happy, but I would be sad because I want a sister.  So, I asked Heavenly
Father to give us one of each, so we could both be happy.”  Wow! The faith of a
child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>DENTIST - May 2008 </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I went to the dentist in May for a checkup and to have them
cleaned.  I found out after I got there that Dr. Cottle had retired and a new
young dentist was taking his place.  They took x-rays and the dentist told me
that the roots of a tooth on the back top right side were crumbling and because
I had had a root canal in that tooth, I couldn’t feel any pain.  He said the
tooth couldn’t be saved and I would need to go to an oral surgeon to have it
pulled as he didn’t have the equipment needed to get it out.  He also said I
had a cavity which needed filling and that I needed three new crowns in order
to save those teeth.  They gave me a paper itemizing the cost of the work which
needed to be done and it was $3,000.00 plus the cost of the oral surgeon.  Each
crown was $670.00 plus $150.00 for some other procedure they do with crowns. 
Needless to say, I was pretty discouraged when I left that day as $3,000.00 is
a lot of money even in today’s world, and we don’t have any dental insurance. 
They wanted to make an appointment for me to have the work done, but I decided
to call other dentists and get a second opinion.  <b>I did make an appointment
with the oral surgeon.  I was nervous about going there since the dentist said
the roots were crumbling, I knew he would have to dig them out and it would be
a painful and stressful experience.  I prayed hard to Heavenly Father that the
tooth would come out ok and to bless the oral surgeon as he took it out.  He
deadened all around the tooth and I felt it being numbed even up into my right
eye.  When he pulled the tooth, it came out all intact.  I was surprised and
asked him about it and he showed me the tooth.  I told him Dr. Harris had told
me the roots were crumbling.  He said I know, I am very surprised myself.  I
knew my prayers had been answered.  I got along great and didn’t even have to
take a pain pill that he prescribed.  I only took Tylenol.  Mark Hulet. Ken’s
cousin had been a dentist and he kept asking me how I felt and how I was
doing.  He was surprised that I was doing so well</b>.  Ken had been with me as
he wanted to know how the oral surgeon felt about me having dentures instead of
having all this work done since my teeth have always been soft and I have
always had so many cavities, caps, bridges, root canals, crowns, teeth pulled,
paradonel disease, etc., and I take fairly good care of my teeth.  We have
spent a lot of money on my teeth, plus what the insurance would pay.  I always
liked Dr. Cottle, but I don’t think he took as good of care of my teeth as he
should as prior to going on our mission to the Philippines; Dr. Cottle had
checked my teeth and said they were good.  But soon after I got there I had an
abscessed tooth and had to go to a dentist that the mission president referred
me to in Angeles.  She did a lot of work and also had to put on three crowns. 
Now here we are again.  The oral surgeon told me that if he were me, he would
have the new crowns put on and keep my teeth as long as I can.  He said “If you
even decide to have dentures, only do it on the top as you have a ridge on the
bottom and the dentures would slide back and forth and wouldn’t work.  I had
other dentists tell me that since I had had paradonal disease my gums would
never adjust to dentures and I would be miserable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>GRANDPARENTS BINDERS - November
5, 2012</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On November 29<sup>th</sup>, while doing laundry and
cleaning house; I was cleaning our 3<sup>rd</sup> bedroom storage room with two
purposes.  1 – it needed to be cleaned &amp; better organized and 2 – to find
my 4 plastic accordion envelope binders.  I had bought them several years ago
as I wanted one for each of my grandparents.  The first was for my grandfather
George Bushnell, second for his wife, my grandmother, Iva Swallow Bushnell. 
The third for my grandfather, Byron Porter and the last for his wife, my
grandmother, Mary Elizabeth “May” Robinson Porter.  My mother, Mildred Bushnell
Porter, had passed away and with me being the eldest living child, and loving
Family History, I was the one to take Mom’s genealogy, special papers, cards
and pictures.  As I went through these boxes, I found birth, marriage and death
certificates.  I found paper awards, newspaper clippings, other certificates,
histories, etc., so I was able to put these, where they belonged, in these
binders.  Anyway, they were not on the shelf where I usually kept them so as I
was cleaning, I was looking for them, but I couldn’t find them.  When I was
saying my morning prayers, I asked God to help me find them.  When I finished
cleaning the entire room, I prayed again and told the Lord that I couldn’t find
them, but I knew that he knew where they were, and I sure would like to find
them.  I then decided to clean the other storage room as I thought that maybe I
had put them there.  They were not there either.  I then looked through all the
bookcases and every other place that I thought they might be, but to no
success.  I was worried as I surely hated to lose those binders with those
important documents, papers &amp; pictures.  I said another prayer in my mind
and just then the thought came to me “They are at your sister, Georgia’s
home”.  I know that message came from God or his messenger.  I then remembered
that several months ago, Georgia &amp; I went through the boxes of genealogy
and other papers, cards, etc., that I had taken to her house prior to Ken and I
going on our mission.  She has a big home and I have a small one and with us
being gone, I wanted them to be in safe keeping.  I had taken these binders
over that day as I thought we could go through them to see if there were
documents or papers that she would want a copy of.  We hadn’t had time to do
that, so I just left them with her and told her I could get them later.  Well,
she forgot about them and I forgot about them and forgot that I had taken them
to her house.  The Lord knew where they were and after I had done all I could
to try to find them, he gave me the answer.  I knelt and offered a prayer of
thanks as I was very grateful to know where they were.  I called Georgia and
she brought them to me when we went to a meeting together on Thursday night. 
Another good thing is that I got both my storage rooms cleaned and better
organized, so I was glad about that too.</p>
