<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As this year has swiftly passed by, it has
brought some good experiences and some not so good.   This life is full of ups
and downs, but it is for our experience and we are to learn from the hard times
and enjoy the good.  Over the years, I’ve come to realize that our attitude
plays a big part on our happiness.  Some people have very little financially,
some have major health or other problems and yet they are happy and make others
happy.  And there are others who are miserable, and it seems they have
everything that should make them happy.  Our wish, for this coming year for
you, is that you will have health and happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Scott</b> came home from his mission to
Venezuela in May.  We were excited to have him return and so was his
girlfriend, Mishelle Dillingham, who is now his fiancé.  They received some sad
news soon after his return.  She had been coughing for several months, the
doctor finally took an x-ray and found cancer.  She is undergoing chemotherapy
treatments at the present.  They hope to be able to marry soon after the
treatments are over.  She is in our prayers constantly, and hope you will pray
for her also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            .<b> Sandi</b> is our oldest.  She has two
daughters, JaNae, age 16 who has been a cheerleader both her sophomore and now
her junior years at Grantsville High, and Chelci, Age 12.  Chelci goes to the
Middle School in Grantsville.  She excels in softball and has a pretty voice so
enjoys singing.  Sandi is the head cook at Harris Elementary.  She taught
clogging dance lessons for a few years, mainly for the benefit of her girls. 
She enjoys oil pointing in her spare time and is secretary of the Young Women. 
<b>Sandi</b> <b>divorced her husband, Dave, a few months</b> ago.  She hasn’t
been happy in her marriage.  We hope the future will be brighter for her.  They
have joint custody of their daughters, JaNae and Chelci, but JaNae lives with
her dad and Chelci with her mom.  We pray for them also as divorce is never
easy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Old Folk’s Sociable </b>– each
March in Grantsville.  Sandi &amp; girls usually performed in the programs –
dancing (clogging) &amp; Chelci singing<b>.  </b>They have great programs,
dinners, dances &amp; great decorations throughout the high school.  Sandi
usually had her art work displayed.  They also had car shows.  We love to go to
these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Shellie</b> and Roy live in
Chandler, Arizona.  They have three sons - Garrett, age 7, Quint, age 4 and
Kevis age 5 months.  Roy did an apprenticeship, training as an Integrated
Circuit Mask Designer.  He works at Motorola designing computer chips.  We wish
they lived closer, but he likes his work, makes good money, and there is not a
Motorola plant to transfer to here in Utah, so guess we’ll spend our winter
vacations in sunny Arizona.  Roy is in the Sunday School Presidency and Shellie
has served mainly in the Young Women’s organization, but is now in Relief
Society.  Shellie, like Sandi, is also gifted in art, and is taking oil
painting lessons.  Roy enjoys water skiing and camping, in fact, their entire
family does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple of weeks ago, I flew down to Arizona to visit
Shellie and her family.  <b>With changing jobs this summer, (in case you have
not heard, I left Lincoln Elementary to be the secretary for Staff Development
at the district office.</b>)  Anyway, with learning a new job, I didn’t take my
vacation at that time so I took part of my vacation enjoying Shellie’s two
little boys, and of course, Shellie &amp; Roy.  With them living in Arizona, we
don’t get to see them as often as we’d like.  I had a wonderful time; the only
thing that could have made it better was if Ken could have been there.  He
spent his vacation building an apartment for his mother in his brother, Bob’s
basement.  With overworking on this apartment and long hours at his job, he is
having health problems again – so back on his strict diet.  Not fun at this
time of year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Mike, Becky and their two little ones, David
&amp; Taylor are doing great in Inverness, Montana</b>.  Mike is teaching
special education and doing some coaching so they were able to spend last
summer in Utah.  We enjoyed being with them for most of the weekends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>David &amp; Shauna are living in Clearfield</b>. 
We are thankful they live close to us.  David will graduate with his four-year
degree this summer, but with him being in the medical field, he still has lots
of schooling ahead.  Shauna just changed jobs recently.  She is a nurse and
changed from Davis South Hospital in Bountiful to McKay Dee in Ogden.  David
still works at the FHP lab part-time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Jeff, our youngest, is a senior
at Layton High</b>.  He is enjoying his high school years, and is really
involved in music and drama and on the seminary council, so we don’t see much
of him especially at this season of the year, but we are glad he is developing
his talents and sharing with others.  Ken &amp; I enjoy going to the plays, Lyrics
performances, etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jeff has lots of friends and they
double date or come to our home and have Video parties in our family room. 
They are all great kids so we welcome them here.  For their Junior Prom one of
the friend’s father had a moving van and he let them put couches and chairs in
the back and he drove them to where they ate before the dance, and to the dance
and then came and got them to take them home.  They had a blast and that was
sure different transportation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another of Jeff’s good friends is “<b>Ben</b>”.  For some
reason, Ben and his dad had problems and Jeff asked if Ben could come live with
us for a while.  Ben was great and we enjoyed having him in our home.  He and
Jeff had a great time together.  Now in 2012, Ben is married, has a family and
is living back East.   Jeff was able to go visit them when he was on a business
trip.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Two of the girls Jeff hung out with
were Jenny and Meresha.  They were cute girls too and I think both had a crush
on Jeff.  They were always here for video parties and games.  I remember one
time when Jeff &amp; Ben and Jenny &amp; Meresha were going to a costume
party.  Jeff was dressed like the 1920s.  He even had shiny black &amp; white
pat-n-leather shoes, silver gray tux and great hat.  He looked great!  Jeff
would come home from a date, Lyrics performance or a play, etc., and he and I
would stay up late talking.  We enjoyed those late-night visits.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>There are Daddy-Daughter dates, but
I had a Mother-Son date.  I think it was for my birthday that Jeff took me to
Abrovenell Hall to a symphony.  This was the first time I had been to
Abrovenell Hall and I think the first time to a symphony.  I really enjoyed the
symphony and really enjoyed being with Jeff. He is a great son and we enjoy him
very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken &amp; I are thankful for each
of our wonderful children and feel we have been greatly blessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>UPDATE FOR KENNETH BROWNING FAMILY 1994 (For Bushnell Reunion)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken is working as the Maintenance Director of
the 5 Points Mall in Bountiful.  He keeps really busy but enjoys it.  He also
does remodeling, and sells part-time for Beneficial Insurance Company.  He is a
High Counselor in our Holmes Creek Stake.  When Ken has any free time, he
enjoys being with his family.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mae is the secretary at Lincoln
Elementary in Layton where she keeps busy with a faculty and staff of over 70
and almost 1,000 students.  Thank goodness for 3 great assistants; it’s a good
place to work.  She’d rather be home enjoying her family and grandkids, but the
money helps support their missionary sons.  She was just released as the Relief
Society President and is now a counselor in the Stake Relief Society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and Mae have 6 wonderful
children – Sandi, Shellie, Mike, David, Scott, and Jeff.  The four oldest are
married.  Sandi and Dave have 2 girls – JaNae and Chelci.  Shellie and Roy have
2 boys, Garrett and Quint.  Mike and Becky have a son, David, and a daughter to
be born the latter part of August.  David and Shauna were just married in the Manti
 Temple on June 24<sup>th</sup>.  Scott is on a mission to Venezuela and enjoys it although he says it’s a never-ending summer.  He has a darling
girlfriend, Mishelle, waiting for him.  Jeff, our youngest, is 16 – dating,
driving, working part-time, plays the piano, and gets involved in
extra-curricular activities at Layton High.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Hopefully the 3 oldest children
will fill this sheet out telling about them and their families. Since David
just got married, I’ll tell a little about him and Shauna.  She just graduated
as an R.N. in nursing and is now working full time in Bountiful.  David met her
at Weber State about two years ago soon after he returned from his mission to Brussels,
 Belgium &amp; France.  David is going into medicine and is planning to be a
Physician’s Assistant.  He still has several years ahead of him.  He has been
at the top of his class so his scholarships help.  He works at the FHP clinic
in Ogden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie &amp; Roy - Dear Bushnell
Family:  We’ve been planning on and looking forward to this reunion for the
last several years but as things turn out, we won’t be able to make it.  We’re
really disappointed to be missing reuniting with you and all the fun.  Anyway,
we’ll give you an update on our life.  We’re still living in Arizona and
although it’s getting hot, we’re really enjoying it.  After years of renting,
we’ve finally bought a new home in South Chandler where for a little while
anyway we still have fields around us and can smell the cows at night.  We love
our home, neighbors and ward.  Two years ago, Roy quit the construction field
forever and now does I.C. Design layout (designs computer chips).  He’s been
working for Clark I.C. Design and contracting to Motorola which is exciting to
us because of their great benefits package.  June
 26<sup>th</sup> 1994 Motorola is sending us to Geneva, Switzerland
for 3-4 months.  We’re ecstatic!  We’ve rented movies about Europe from the
library and even Garrett (4) is really excited.  Our one real concern is Quint
who’s one and can be quite a handful.  Roy’s parents are thinking about going
over with us for a month or so to help out.  I’m sure we’ll love it.  Hope your
families are doing great.  Miss ya, The Seymores – Roy, Shellie, Garrett, and
Quint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mike and Becky Browning – Mike and
I are expecting our second child August 22 (99% sure it’s a girl).  Mike will
be graduating from BYU with a degree in Psychology and Special Education on
August 12<sup>th</sup>.  We have found a job in Joplin, Montana and will be
moving up there the 22<sup>nd</sup> of August.  Mike for sure, me if the baby
is born early.  We are really excited to move and get away from the stress of
school and enter the stress of reality.  We are also excited because I have
been working full time for the past year and now I will be able to be home to
raise our children.  Mike is doing his student teaching right now and enjoys
being able to teach!  That’s about it for us.</p>
