alt="Mae cutting Mom Jensen's hair"><b>It’s July 9, 2001.</b>  I wanted to
record a Saturday a couple of weeks ago.  Ken’s Mom has need of round-the-clock
care.  She broke her arm, and since her mind is about gone, she gets angry,
frustrated, and upset because of the pain and because of the cast which
restricts her from being as independent as she wants to be so she tries to cut
it off, break it off or soak it off.  We have to watch her all the time and
many times it is the nighttime which is the worst.  Irven &amp; Sandy and Ken
&amp; I had been taking turns watching her.  Sandy was doing it during the
weekdays and Ken &amp; I would take turns staying the evenings with her &amp;
Irven, and Ken &amp; I would do the weekends.  (We call it “tend her”) as
sometimes she is worse than a 2-year-old as a 2-year-old seems to understand
and remember better than she does.  She also gets angry and throws tantrums,
like a 2-year-old, sometimes.  Other times she is quiet, sweet and alert.  We
play “rummy”, her favorite card game with her sometimes and she is alert and
even wins.  I was amazed at how she figured out how to play with her broken arm
as the cast goes from her hand to her shoulder.  Her fingers stick out of the
cast and part of her hand.  She got another chair and spread the cards out on
it.  They were on the other side of her so we couldn’t see them and then she
could maneuver them and be able to play with her one hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This one Saturday, Ken was staying with her
while I stayed at home to clean, do laundry, trim the lawns, go grocery
shopping, etc.  Ken had mowed the lawns early before he went over to be with
his mom.  I decided to trim before it got too hot.  When I came in to get a
drink of water, the phone rang <b>and Scott asked if I had remembered that it
was Kylan’s birthday and that they had invited me to go swimming with them</b>. 
I remembered his birthday, but forgot about going swimming.  I asked them when
they were going and they said “in about 15 minutes”.  I told them I’d meet them
at the Clearfield pool.  I hurried and changed and drove over.  We had a
wonderful time and stayed for about 3 hours.  Scott &amp; Mishelle had bought a
float tube for Kylan and he loved it and had a great time.  We took turns
playing with him and swimming.  Scott did some great dives off the high diving
board and the lower one - flips, backwards, etc.  Scott was on the Layton
 High School diving team and went to state.  I love to watch him.  He’s modest
so doesn’t want to do it if there are too many people.  Mishelle and I even
went off the lower diving board.  She dove, but I just jumped off.  I used to
dive when I was younger, but I’m too nervous now.  I really had a great time
being with Scott, Mishelle and little Kylan and I love to swim - so it was
great.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I gave them my gift and Kylan opened it and I
left for home, changed back into my grubbies and was heading out to finish
trimming the lawns when <b>Jeff came up the stairs and asked if I would like to
go see the movie “Pearl Harbor” with him</b>.  He said he had been calling his
friends, but either they weren’t home or couldn’t go.  I said “Oh Jeff, I’ve
been playing for 3 hours and I’ve got so much to do”.  He said “Oh Mom, you
need to watch the Disney video “Jungle Book” more and be like Baloo - he just
enjoyed life and doesn’t take it so seriously.”  Jeff told me he would do the
vacuuming when we got home.  I said “Ok” and went up to change my clothes
again.  It was fun being with Jeff and visiting.  He’s a special son and it was
great “bonding” together (as he put it).  The show was good, it was amazing to
see what actually went on when Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese.  It
only had a little “dog poop” (bad language and a love scene). I had been told
by many good people that the show is incredible and doesn’t have anything “bad”
in it, but there was.  Boy, it’s getting harder and harder to go to movies anymore
because of the language, sex and violence.  Ken and I just mainly rent old
movies on video instead of going to the movies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Anyway, I still enjoyed it and enjoyed being
with Jeff.  I changed into my grubbies for the 3<sup>rd</sup> time and was on
my way to at least finish trimming before it was too dark and the phone rang.  <b>It
was Scott asking if I wanted to come over and watch Kylan open his presents and
have cake and ice cream</b><u>.  I said to myself “what the heck”, that’s more
important than house cleaning</u> so I asked them to give me a few minutes to
finish trimming and I would be over.  I quickly finished trimming, changed
clothes again and drove over to their home.  Kylan was tired as he hadn’t had a
nap, but he was cute most of the time anyway.  Mishelle made him a cupcake and
put a big candle in and lit it.  She helped him blow it out and took the candle
out and let him have to it.  He didn’t grab it, instead he took little pieces
off the edges of the cupcake with his thumb and index finger and ate it.  Mishelle
scared him accidently and he started crying so they got him down to open his
presents.  I got some cute pictures.  It was fun being with them and I was glad
they had invited me over.  Ken was staying the night at his mom’s, but when I
got home he called.  He had called earlier and was worried since no one was
home, wondering where I was.  He prayed and had a good feeling that I was
alright and the thought came to him that I might be at Scott’s.  I’m sure
thankful for prayer as I have prayed about him and the children different times
when I have been worried about them and I get that comforting, peaceful feeling
too and can relax.  Well, I had a fun day - didn’t accomplish much on the list
of things I had planned to do, but it was a wonderful day.  Jeff did vacuum for
me and I stayed up late getting a few things done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001</b>, on
the way to work, I was listening to the radio when the news came on of the
terrible tragedies which happened to the <b>Twin Trade Towers in New York and the
Pentagon in Washington D.C. </b>  Two planes were hijacked and flew right into
the Twin Trade Towers in New York City.  The Hijackers were illegal aliens from
the Middle East - terrorists.   I was devastated and could not believe what I
had just heard.  Then a third plane hit the Pentagon.  We found out several
days later that over 6,000 people were killed.  That news has greatly affected
not only the citizens of the United States of America, but the people
throughout the world.  We have been praying all week for the people who mourn
the loss of their loved ones who were killed, for the firemen and rescuers, for
those who were injured and for the President of the United States and the other
leaders of our country.  We have realized later that these twin towers could
not have come down this way.  A science professor at BYU told about that and
the church had to tell him that he could not tell the public this as he was
representing the Church.  He wouldn’t stop, so he was fired.  Of course, the
media did not tell his information, now that he was fired.  They would have
made it a real story if they could have criticized the church. Satan has
control of the media, he has great power in the world today.  There are many
who feel this destruction of the Twin Towers was done deliberately as since
then our government have made such strict regulations and have more control
over us.  We had a good president in Ronald Regan, but since then it has gone
downhill.  But, we are told that in the last days there would be much wickedness,
evil, corruption and confusion and it surely is. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Since then we have had a drug which is a powder
sent in letters throughout the country and some have died from that drug.  They
feel these are from terrorist also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>This last week, Oct 20 - 23, 2001</b>, there
were so many terrible things reported in the news that it made me depressed and
upset and I didn’t want to listen to the news anymore and I haven’t for a few
days.  The news told of a man &amp; his wife who had separated.  He took his
two small children up in the mountains by Stockton (South of Tooele), shot and
killed the baby boy in his car seat and when the little girl started running,
he shot and killed her, and then he turned the gun on him and took his life. 
Another incident happened in Tooele - a little boy found his dad’s loaded rifle
and shot and killed his little brother.  In a daycare center a baby was
killed.  A couple of little boys (ages 3 &amp; 4) killed the baby girl.  The
daycare lady had gone outside to check on the other children I understand. 
Another report told of two men who shot and killed two deer hunters -just to
get their truck.  They led the police on a chase and escaped for a couple of
days, but were found and are in custody now.  The deer hunters were young men
in their 20's.  The one was married and had 3 small children.  This world is
getting so wicked; it scares me for my children and grandchildren.  I hope and
pray they will be strong and can overcome the powers of Satan and stay strong
in the gospel and stand for the right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>December 2001:  </b><u>Sandi &amp; Terry
invited our family to come to their cabin the day after Christmas and spend the
rest of that week there with them.  I think most, if not all, of our family
were there.</u>  We had such a great time and Sandi &amp; Terry were a great
host and hostess.  We played games, visited, went sleigh riding down the road
by their house with their snowmobiles pulling us back up, ate great meals and
just enjoyed relaxing and being together.  We have a close family and we are so
thankful for that.  Everyone enjoys being together.  <u>While there, Mike was
riding Sandi and Terry’s four-wheeler and road past a building lot that was for
sale for $10,000.  He was amazed at that price and told Ken and I about it.  He
took us back and we looked at the beautiful corner lot with lots of quaking
aspen trees.  We got the phone number to call.  We thought that would be a
great investment even if we didn’t build on it, but the thought crossed our
minds that we might want to build on it.  We prayed about it and both of us had
a good feeling about it.  Ken has always wanted to build our own home and this
might be the right opportunity.  We called and were able to purchase it.  </u></p>
