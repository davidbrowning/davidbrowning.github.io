<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and I have a busy, but great
life.  I think it was February when our son, David, asked his dad if he could
help him build a “climbing wall” in his high garage, for their family as they
love “Rock Climbing”, so they invited us for dinner one night and then Ken and
David figured out how they would do it and the materials they would need.  They
got scaffolding and Ken did most of the work.  David helped him on Saturday and
after work when he could.  The kids helped some too.  It took several days, but
turned out good.  It was hard on Ken, however, and he suffered with his legs
and feet for some time afterwards, but when our kids need or want something
done, Ken is always there for them if he possibly can.  He’s a great dad and a
wonderful husband.  He has always made our homes and yards beautiful too, he
has always done things for me to make me happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This has surely been a wonderful,
but busy spring &amp; summer.  It started in <b>March with Rachel’s baptism</b>
on the 5<sup>th</sup>.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Then the following day, after
church <b>we drove to our granddaughter, Chelci’s home in Grantsville to tend
her and Steve’s children while they went on a cruse for their 10<sup>th</sup>
anniversary</b>.  It was hard on us since we are older and not used to getting
up so early to get the older children, Nathan off to school and Addie off to
preschool and get the twins who are 2 years old up, fed and ready for the day. 
However, we love these children and it was fun being with them.  The twins were
great with us and so fun to watch and be with, all the children were.  Jacob
had diarrhea, and Ken got this from him.  He had me get Pepto Bismo for him and
since he was taking it, he didn’t think he should take his acid reflux pills as
he didn’t know if they should be taken together.  Nathan had been sick with the
flu, but was getting better, but I caught it from him, so wasn’t feeling good
for several days.  I was sure glad that Ken was there to help me as I don’t
know how I would have managed to take care of the children without him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>We left Chelci’s on Friday,
March 11<sup>th</sup>, to drive to Shellie &amp; Roy’s for two weeks</b>.  Ken
had health problems (terrible acid reflux since he didn’t take his pills for
two days and terrible hiccups from this and taking Pepto Bismo), on the way and
we had to return home to get him to the hospital.  We had driven to our
longtime friend, Judy Giles home in Kanab (halfway to Arizona) where we spend
the night and it was a terrible night for Ken, so we headed back to Utah about
5 am.  On the way, we called our son, David who is a PA in Dermatology, to ask
him what we should do.  From the symptoms I gave him, he assumed the worst – a
bleeding ulcer, and told us to drive to the nearest hospital.  Ken was doing
better while I drove, so we kept on going.  It was snowing and the roads were
bad, so I kept praying that I could drive carefully, that Ken would be alright
and we would be safe.  David called and said he didn’t want me to have to drive
all the way, so he and our son, Mike, were on their way to take us as far as
necessary, as they were worried about their dad.  We made it all the way to
Ogden to the Ogden Regional Hospital and after the doctor took tests and
examined him, she couldn’t find anything wrong with him, so released him and
said we could continue our journey.  Ken was embarrassed that he had troubled
our sons as they had had other plans for the day.  But, we were all relieved
that he was okay.  Ken and I then drove again to Judy’s home in Kanab, spend
the night with her and early the next morning continued our trip to Arizona. 
We had a wonderful ten days playing games with mostly Shellie, but also with
Nora when she and her two children, Maggie age 3 and Damon not yet one year
came over, or evenings when her, Garrett and their children came to be with us,
Shellie, Roy and their other sons.  Garrett, Nora and their children, went to
the Phoenix Zoo one day with us, Shellie &amp; Jase.  Roy also left work and
came for a couple of hours.  We ate our meals out on the patio overlooking the manmade
lake where geese and ducks came by often.  Shellie &amp; Roy have a paddle boat
and 2 kayaks so we were on the river doing this also.  Ken and Jase would fish
either on shore or on the paddle boat and they both caught fish, which we took
pictures of and then they released them back into the lake.  I went shopping
with Shellie two or three times, we went to church with them; I helped Shellie
make Easter gifts for her neighbors and went with her to deliver them.  I also
went visiting teaching with her<b>.  We had a great time, except for one
incident</b> when Ken was so discouraged after hearing that Roy &amp; Shellie
didn’t have temple recommends now, that he went walking the next morning and
was gone for over four hours.  It was hot and he didn’t take water with him,
and he didn’t even take his cell phone.  We had breakfast without him and
finally after 2 ½ hours, Shellie said we should take her car and go looking for
him.  We drove up and down the streets for over an hour and finally went home
to call the police.  Shortly after calling the police, he turned up at their
place.  Shellie and I were upset, but Roy was mad.  I was glad Shellie settled
him down as he was ready to send Ken back home.  He told me they would be happy
to have me stay, but of course, I wouldn’t stay if Ken left.  Roy was mad at
Ken because he was this upset that he and Shellie were struggling with their
testimonies now and that they didn’t have temple recommends.  I chewed Ken out
and told him how we had all been so worried.  He said he walked so far that he
got lost for quite a while. It has been so hard on Ken and I to have most of
our children leave the church, which is so important to us.  Ken gets so
depressed, I do too especially when I read the scriptures and know what they
should be doing and they aren’t.  We love our children and want them for
eternity and don’t see how that is possible unless they repent and come back. 
We hope and pray that they will.  At this time, July 2016, Mike is the only one
of our children with a temple recommend and in 1978, all of them did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The following Wednesday, after
getting home from Arizona, Irven &amp; Sandy had invited us to go to a town
meeting in Clearfield with them.  It turned out to be a county convention and
just delegates were to be there, so we didn’t stay long.  I love to spend time
with our grandchildren so I invited Kylan and Ashley to spend a couple of days
with us.  We had fun visiting, playing games, eating, snacking and watching
planes fly in and out of the airport.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><u>On April 4<sup>th</sup></u>,
we had our Porter sibling/spouse get-together at our home.</b>  Even though
Deanna is going through Chemo for liver cancer, she came with Bryce.  It is
good to have Terry and Angela move to Idaho from Alaska this year so they can
join us for family activities and reunions now.  I don’t think Jeanenne came as
she was sick, but I think Kim came and also Georgia &amp; Rick.  We always have
a great time eating, visiting and playing games.  This time we spend all the
time eating and visiting.  We take turns doing this every three month and we
all look forward to these times together.  On Saturday, <u>April 5<sup>th</sup></u>,
I went with a good friend, Diane Graf from Clinton, to a cooking class in Salt
Lake.  It was fun visiting with her and another good friend, Camille Smith,
while we drove there and back and the class was good and the food delicious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken and I always keep busy with
home/visiting teaching our couples and widows</b>, especially <b>Marianne and
Lynn Ray</b>.  Lynn passed away with cancer in December, but Marianne has lots
of health problems, not much family support and is very needy.  She is always
calling needing us to do lots of things.  Ken has put in a water heater for
her, has done plumbing work, did work on their swamp cooler, worked on their
sprinkling system, helped her with her washing machine, put in a new swamp
cooler this summer which took him 11 hours and put him down for 3 days as his
legs and feet were hurting so bad.  I take her to doctor’s offices, get
medications for her, take her to get groceries, we both have helped her move
furniture, I helped her do other things and helped her make phone calls, etc.,
with her finances, etc.  Ken and I lose patience with her at times, but she
doesn’t have others to help her, and when Lynn was alive, he was sick so
couldn’t do much and she had to take care of him.  She has major health
problems (although we wonder if all of it is true as she does lie).  She has a
big service dog and 9 cats, so it isn’t fun to go there, and she talks
non-stop, so it is hard getting out of her house or off the phone. Oh well, we
try to have her do what she can because the Bishop has told us that the more we
do for her, the more she will expect it and want us to do for her.  She knows
now that it upsets us so she tries to do more for herself and when she hints
that we do more, and I feel she can do it herself or get other friends to help
her, I don’t take the hint. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have another couple, <b>Evelyn
and Harold Hilton.</b>  They both have poor health, but they are younger than
us.  They have a son, who is on drugs, who lives with them and doesn’t work, so
that’s a problem.  They don’t go out to church because of their health.  Harold
has dementia and Evelyn “Evie” has scoliosis and her back was leaning toward
the right, and it was so bad that she was in terrible pain and would fall a lot
because of poor balance.  She recently had a hard operation where they put rods
down her spine to make her back straight.  She had seriously broken her right
arm before we knew them and it was terribly deformed so they operated on it and
put pins, nuts and bolts in it.  After her back operation, she again fell on it
and they had to operate on it again and put mesh, etc.  She got infection in
her back where part of the incision was and she is in rehab now.  She was in
Rocky Mountain Rehab, then home, then back in the hospital several times and
now in StoneHedge Rehab.  She has had quite a time.  They don’t have much
family.  Their son had a daughter who is 16 and she comes to visit and help out
at times.  They don’t have many friends as they don’t get out much.  They are
on church welfare, but it isn’t right because they had an RV, a big truck, a
van and a four-wheeler and some land at Lava Hot Springs in Idaho.  They gave
them to this son, so they could be on welfare.  The son, Mike, takes his mother’s
drugs and pain pills as he can’t get enough on his own and sometimes he is good
to his parents, but many times ornery, especially if he needs drugs and can’t
get them.  He does do a lot of the cooking.  At least that’s something.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have a wonderful, sweet, sister
who is a widow,<b> Leah Neilsen</b>, that we go home/visiting teaching to and
we love her and love to go there.  She is my hero.  She will surely go to the
Celestial Kingdom.  She has asthma and other health problems; her husband
wasn’t active in the church and later got Alzheimer’s and she nursed him
through that until he passed away.  None of her children are active in the
church, but she is so strong and so faithful and always has a smile and
positive attitude and does everything and anything to help others and the
church.  She goes to the temple weekly with four other sisters in our park, at
least when she is well enough to do so.  She is tall and stately and an elect
lady.  She always looks beautiful and everyone loves her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have another wonderful widow, <b>Shirley
Lemon</b>, and we enjoy going to her home and always have a good visit there
too.  We have a brother, Wendell Siglin, who married a non-member, Linda.  She
is polite, but doesn’t want anything to do with the church.  Wendell has
children who are active in the church, but he loves to spend his time fishing,
golfing and playing.  When we catch him home alone, we have a fun visit with
him, but we don’t catch him very often.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>For Spring Break, Mike had asked
Ken and I if we could come to their home so Ken could help him rebuilt the two
gates for their wood fence as they were falling apart.</b>  Becky also wanted
them to make a trellis for her grapes.  We stayed about three days and they
accomplished all this.  Becky fixed delicious meals for us and I loved visiting
with her and Maddi and Jessie.  We all played games at night.  Ken had taken
his tool trailer behind our truck so he would have all the tools and equipment
they would need, but on the way home, some of the tread from one of the trailer
tires came loose and ripped off the bumper and did damage to the trailer.  Ken
was able to pull the truck &amp; trailer off at a good spot on the freeway and
thankfully we didn’t cause an accident.  Ken took off the tire and had to take
the spare to get air in it, so he left me behind with the trailer.  He came
back, put it on and we headed back home.  Mike had passed us as he was meeting
David in Ogden for lunch, so he called as he was worried about us.  Ken assured
him that we were alright and he could handle things.  Mike insisted on paying
for the new tire since we had brought the trailer to his home.  Mike is a great
son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>On the 21<sup>st</sup> of April,
we went to support Paige at her Utah State University Program</b> “Exhibit” in
Salt Lake City.  She is very talented and it was great.  We met Mike, Becky and
the girls there and visited with them, and also Becky’s parents and siblings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken and I have great neighbors,
two are sweet widows, Mary and Jackie</b>, and we love to visit with them and
take food to them occasionally.  Tim, our neighbor to the west is divorced, but
such a nice guy.  He is always happy to help Ken with anything Ken needs help
with.  Many times, he will come out and ask Ken if he can help.  Tim is
probably only in his fifties.  We take food to him sometimes too and he is
always grateful.  We have a wonderful ward and always enjoy visiting with these
good people at church, choir or other activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>We have good friends here in the
mobile home park – Lee and Glory Gifford, Pat and Dave Presnell, Judy and Klaus
Decker and Daryl and Lindsey Wayment</b>.  We play games or get together to go
places or just visit.  Bishop &amp; Ravee Mullins have become good friends.  He
visits us a lot and one day he asked if we had been to all the temples in
Utah.  When we told him “no”, he asked if we would like to go to them with he
and Ravee, so we scheduled some dates to do and it has been great.  We have
been to the Payson Temple and the Timpanogas Temple so far.  We go out to eat
afterwards.  They also wanted us to go camping with them and one day they took
us to their favorite place by Causie Reservoir – Memorial Park.  We enjoyed the
day and set the dates to go camping.  We went for three days the first part of
June</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Lee &amp; Glory Gifford went to
Africa</b> with their daughter &amp; grandsons where the daughter and her
husband were adopting three little girls.  They had to foster the girls there
in Africa for up to three years, so <b>Lee &amp; Glory asked us if we could
take care of their berries and garden</b>.  They have an exceptional yard with
strawberries, raspberries, Logan berries and black berries, grapes, all kinds
of fruit trees, however, they just planted them a couple of years ago. They
have 8 garden boxes, an herb box, and lots of beautiful plants and flowers. 
Lee used to be a landscaper and worked on temples.  Gardening and landscape are
also his hobbies.  Lee &amp; Glory said we could plant what we wanted as they
didn’t plan to be home for at least a year.  This kept us busy also, especially
Ken, but I went also to help plant and weed.  It turned out that their stay
only lasted a few months (and we were glad), but they have insisted on us
picking and having half of their berries and fruit.  We are sharing the garden
also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Also, in Clinton, we have several
friends.  I go to lunch occasionally with <b>Marna McFee</b> and we love to
visit and be together<b>.  Ron and Diane Graf</b> are probably our closest
friends at this time and we do a lot with them and Ken and Ron love to go
fishing together.  Charles and Carolyn Saunders are back from their mission, so
we have resumed our friendship by getting together monthly to play games, visit
and eat snacks.  We keep in touch with <b>Marilyn and Kelly Bodily and Morgan
and Marge Thomas</b> and enjoy visiting with them and getting together
occasionally with them.  Several of us lady friends from Clinton (they still
invite me now that I’ve moved) get together for lunch when it is one of our
birthdays.  That is so fun to be with them again.  We have friends from other
places we have lived, who we keep in contact with and also our mission couple
friends.  Anyway, good friends are very important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken loves to fish, but we have
been so busy that he has only gone three times</b>.  Once with our friend, Ron
Graf and once with our grandsons, Kylan and Connor who love to fish too.  I
haven’t even gone fishing with him this year.  We went to Diane &amp; Ron’s
home Monday night to play games with them and Charles and Carolyn Saunders and
Ron and Ken decided to go fishing today at Strawberry Reservoir.  I’m sure they
are having a good time and it is good for me to be alone so I can do some of
the things I like to do – like catching up my picture albums and writing in my
life history.  I have visited with neighbors as I was out this morning on my
walk, and Mike called when he was coming home from work today and we had a good
visit.  His back is really hurting him and he called to apologize again for not
being able to attend our Glendon Porter Reunion last Saturday at a park near
us.  I had arranged for a pavilion at this park and set up this reunion, but
Shellie and Jase were the only ones from our family there.  The others all had
other fun plans, except Mike.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Shortly after coming home from Arizona, in
April, Jeff wanted us to come visit them for a week</b>.  Gail and the children
love us to come also and we love being with them.  Rachel called to see if we
could come a day earlier as it was “<b>Grandparents Day</b>”, so we did.  Ken
was going to go with Ben and I with Rachel and both of us later with Matt and
Gail to his field trip, but Ben’s teacher allowed Ken to take Ben early and
they came to lunch with Rachel and I and afterwards Gail &amp; Matt came and we
all went to Rachel’s room to look at her art exhibits and papers.  We then went
to Ben’s room where he and his classmates put on a play.  Afterwards Ken wasn’t
feeling the bet, so he left to go to their home to rest and I went with Gail
and Matt to his fieldtrip which was to a nursery.  We went on a tour there and
they told us all about the flowers, plants and trees.  They gave a treat to the
children at the end.   We don’t talk about the church around Jeff, but we sure
love him.  He is a sweet, wonderful loving husband, father, son, brother and
friend.  They had bought kayaks and they took us to the river where we had fun
kayaking there.  It was beautiful and a peaceful place to be.  The children
were in school, but Matt was in afternoon kindergarten.  When I fixed
breakfast, if I made bacon and eggs, he always wanted some bacon.   Matt was
waiting for me to get up each morning as he loved playing games with me. 
Rachel is taking piano lessons and would play the pieces she was learning for
me.  Ken helped Gail with her garden.  Jeff &amp; Gail and Ken &amp; I played
lots of games at night after dinner each night as we all enjoy doing this.  I
played with the children during the day.  Jeff wasn’t feeling the best that
week, but kept going anyway.  One day I suggested that we just watch a video
instead of going to the river again as I knew he didn’t feel up to it.  He
agreed and we all piled on Jeff &amp; Gail’s bed, except Jeff sat in their
recliner and we all watched “Star Wars”. It was fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            On April 23<sup>rd</sup>, we had our annual
Porter Cousin’s party at my cousin, Lael</b> and her husband, Neil Walls home
in Layton.  They have a beautiful home up on a mountain.  The view is breath
taking.  The food is “pot luck” and there is always tons of good food.  We eat,
visit and then sit around in a circle and each take turns telling about our
families and what we have been doing the past year.  All my Porter cousins are
still active in the church and wonderful, faithful members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I offer to tend our grandchildren and
enjoy doing this and have always done this.  Maddie and Jessie stayed with us a
couple of days while their parents went on a trip and we also went to their
home another time when they were in school as Mike &amp; Becky hated to have
them home alone at night and we didn’t blame them and enjoyed being with the
girls.  We visited, played games and had a good time.  Even though Kylan and
Ashley tend the twins for Scott and Mishelle, we go there to be with all of
them at times since they enjoy being with us.  We used to tend Jeff &amp;
Gail’s children when they lived here.  In fact, I gave Jeff &amp; Gail and
Scott &amp; Mishelle cards for Christmas some years that we would tend their
children at least once a month during that year.  We enjoyed this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>             We went to Emily’s piano recital</b>.  She

play.  She is 15 now.  <b>We also went to a couple of Connor’s baseball games
where Connor mainly plays “Pitch</b>” and he is really good at it.  He told his
dad that he likes it when it is a full count.  That is unusual as most pitchers
feel the pressure and are worried, but Connor says he knows he has to
concentrate and pitch a strike.  David is their baseball coach and enjoys it. 
Their team won most of their games. <b>Tyler </b>used to play basketball and
was really good at it, but didn’t want to this past year as he didn’t like the
varsity coach and he loves track so is doing that instead.  He is really good
at it also<b>.  Ken and I went to one of his track meets and watch him run the
hurdles.  He also does the long jump and the high jump</b>.  Tyler is really
tall and thin.  He is a great young man – very polite and kind.  He and his
siblings are all straight A students.  He is taking really hard honor; college
classes so spend much of his time after school studying.  He is also dating a
cute girl, but since he doesn’t go to church much anymore because his parents
don’t, her father isn’t too excited about his daughter dating Tyler.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went from there to Logan for <b>Paige’s
graduation from Utah State University</b>.  Becky had invited us also to come
to David and Sierra’s home there in Logan for lunch before the graduation. 
They also invited Garrett’s parents and we enjoyed visiting with all of them. 
Becky’s parents didn’t come as their health is too bad.  In talking with
Garrett’s parents, we found they used to live in Anchorage Alaska and were
friends with Terry and Angela.  What a small world.  They asked for Terry and
Angela’s phone number so they could stay in touch with them.  It was great to
be with all of this family – Mike, Becky, Maddi and Jessie, David, Sierra and
little Henry and Paige and Garrett.  We took pictures of Paige in her cap and
gown and then went to the graduation.  I had uncomfortable high heels and my
feet were killing me by the time we reached the gymnasium where it was being
held.  After seeing Paige walk in with her classmates and after she received
her diploma, Ken and I left as we were to be to Irven &amp; Sandy’s home in
Smithfield for dinner.  As we left the gymnasium, I was dreading the walk back,
but there was a shuttle bus there waiting for anyone and he asked us if we
would like a ride.  We surely did.  We had a nice dinner with Irven and Sandy,
played games and spent the night.  Irven wants Ken to put in a water storage
system for him similar to ours, but he wants 200 gallons of water.  He and Ken
worked on the plans for it before going to bed.  What a busy day. Ken wasn’t
too excited to build it for Irven.  Irven said he would pay Ken, but it is hard
doing work for Irven &amp; Sandy and this one was even harder.  It was very
stressful for Ken.  It turned out really good, but it cost more than Sandy
wanted to pay, so Ken lowered the amount he was charging them and called Jared
at Durk’s as he had originally given them a better price for the tank.  Jared
ended up giving it to them for his cost, as he had misfigured before.  Ken said
to me later “I’m not going to do another job for them”.  (We’ll see, but maybe
not as Ken is 77 years old now and his health isn’t as good and it is getting
harder and harder for him to do this physical work).</p>

strawberries are blossoming now and we are excited about that. &nbsp;Apricots
are forming on the tree. The peas haven't blossomed yet, but the vines are sure
tall and healthy, so they should be blossoming right away. &nbsp;We can see
several potato plants coming up. &nbsp;The fellow at Jerry's Nursery took me
about a different tomato plant that is supposed to be delicious, so I decided
to try it. &nbsp;We already had the tomatoes planted in the south grow boxes
with the peppers behind them, so we planted this different tomato plant in one
of the north boxes, plus a yellow bell tomato plant (the size of a cherry
tomato) in another of the boxes. &nbsp;The garlic plants are really tall, but
look healthy. &nbsp;The grapes vines look great and all the berry plants do
also. &nbsp;You sure have a beautiful yard with all your trees, flowers,
bushes, garden boxes, grapes, berries, etc. &nbsp;We planted cucumbers and
Zucchini in our two garden boxes and we plan to plant banana squash and
spaghetti squash at our place also, so we can share these also if you like
squash and cucumbers. &nbsp;</span></p>

*It does really hurt that he and also his sweet wife, and our sons, Scott and
Jeff don’t have a testimony of the gospel either.  Scott convinced Mishelle now
too, and she used to be so strong.  In fact, that was what changed Scott’s
decision to go on a mission was because she said she would never marry a man
who hadn’t served a mission.  Scott decided that maybe other girls felt that
way too, and he started preparing for his mission.  Mishelle waited for Scott
while on his mission, as she loved him.  Now, she doesn’t believe either and it
breaks our hearts (Ken and I) that we are losing our children, their spouses and
grandchildren.  Satan is working so hard on our family.  We just keep praying
for them and putting their names in the temple and trying to love them
unconditionally.  I do love them so much and that’s why it hurts so badly. 
Jeff doesn’t even believe in God.  He told us that soon after we returned from
our mission to the Philippines.  He has depression and anxiety, and I can
understand why.  If he would humble himself, repent and decide to read the
scriptures and pray again, and want to gain his testimony back, I know the Lord
would bless him and he would feel peace and happiness again.  I sure hope and
pray for that.  Gail is still strong in the gospel, thank goodness, but I worry
about their children, especially Ben.  He will be 10 on the 19<sup>th</sup> of
June and when we were visiting last month, he told me that he hates himself and
wants to jump off buildings and kill himself.  He says he doesn’t believe in
God anymore.  That broke my heart.  Maybe he is just saying that to get
attention, but I don’t think so, I think he is confused because his dad doesn’t
believe, won’t pray, have family home evening with them, won’t go to church and
doesn’t want to talk about God or church.  His mother does do these things and
does them with their children, so why wouldn’t he be confused and hurting.  Now
the children are not wanting to pray and go to church, etc.  Ben especially.  I
think Rachel might be okay, but I’m really worried about Ben and Matt.  I hope
I can help them some, and I pray every day that Heavenly Father will help this
family, and all our family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mike, Becky and daughters, Jessie &amp; Maddi, stopped in
for a few minutes this morning on their way to Montana for a week’s vacation. 
They wanted to give me my Mother’s Day present as they hadn’t been able to be
with us and our family until now.  The gift was a huge golden “Jack”.  Mike
said when he saw it, it reminded him of me.  I had loved playing jacks as a
girl with my friends and I became quite good at it.  I taught some of our
children and grandchildren how to play them and I played with them. I thought
that was an unusual gift, but a thoughtful one.  Ken said “I know where to put
it”, and he put it on the shelf of our entertainment center between the two DVD
players.  It will be a great conversation piece.  They had a beautiful Mother’s
day card with it and Becky wrote some beautiful tributes.  It said “Dear Mom,
you are such a blessing in my life – I am so grateful for your friendship and
example.  Thank you for all the many happy memories we have shared and support
and love you have always shown me and our family. Stepping into the unknown of
being a mother-in-law, I have been so grateful I’ve had you to help me know how
to do it right.  I love you and hope you have a wonderful day. Love, Becky”. 
She is a beautiful and special daughter-in-law, and has always expressed love
and appreciation in cards for almost everything we have done for them – tending
or being with their children, family gatherings at our home or Ken doing
‘fix-up” jobs for them or helping Mike do them.  I couldn’t ask for a better daughter-in-law. 
But I am very blessed to have four beautiful, wonderful daughter-in-laws.  I
love all of them and am so grateful they love our wonderful sons and are good
wives to them and wonderful mothers, and I am grateful for their love for me. 
I hope and pray that we will always be a close family and love being with one
another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I texted Mike and Becky after they had left this morning to
express my appreciation for them stopping in and also the special, thoughtful
gift and card and told them that I loved them and their family.  Becky texted
back saying: “Love you too and grateful for your love and example in my life.” 
I texted back telling her what a great wife, mother, friend and daughter-in-law
she was and that I loved her very much.  She texted back saying; “Thank you mom
that means a lot to me, and I am grateful for all the love and support you have
always shown me.”  Ken texted back telling her that he loved her and was
grateful for the love and support she had always given Mike, and that they were
the only ones, in our family, who were working for an eternal marriage.  She
texted back saying: “You have raised wonderful children and I am lucky to be
part of your family.”  I texted back telling her that we did have a wonderful
family and that we love each of them dearly”, and I sure do love each one of
them.</p>

the Morgan Park where we eat lunch and visit and the guys play Frisbee or other
lawn games and the children play at the playground or the splash pad.  Kim had
reserved a pavilion for us as last year they were already taken, so we ate in
lawn chairs and on the grass.  Usually it hasn’t been that busy, but since they
put in the splash pad, it’s getting more people out.  We all had a good time. 
Georgia and Rick were on vacation in Austria, so they couldn’t be there, so
none of their children came either, but we had good representation from the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken’s brother, Roy, called to
see if he could come and stay with us for two or three weeks.</b>  He wanted to
go to the Browning Reunion on the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> of June,
2016 at the camp grounds in Paradise, near Logan and then stay and visit us and
others while here.  Irven &amp; Sandy’s daughter, Jennifer planned and
organized this reunion with the help of other family members, especially Irven
&amp; Sandy.  We told Roy that he was welcome to come and stay with us.  His
granddaughter, Joylynn, drove him up in his car.  She stayed with us that
Saturday night and then Ken &amp; Roy took her to the train station the next
morning where she rode the train back to her home.  It was interesting having
Roy here.  He has dementia pretty bad, and was always forgetting where he put
things, especially his medicine and insulin.  We had to keep reminding him to
take his pills and insulin shots.  The first week, he mainly stayed here and
helped Ken some when Ken was working on our home.  Thursday night, Sandi and
Gary came and had dinner with us and spend the night in their new toy hauler as
they wanted to follow us to the reunion.  Roy also followed us in his car to
Jennifer’s where he left his car and rode the rest of the way to the camp with
us.  We all left early so we could spend that day visiting with those who would
be there, especially Irven, Sandy and their family as most of the Brownings,
including our son, David and his wife and children and Scott, who would only be
bringing Ashley with him, were coming on Saturday.  Sandi and Gary had some
damage done to their new toy hauler since the road around the reservoir was a
dirt road and narrow and lots of vehicles were coming down since they had 300
girls for Young Women’s camp up there during the week.  It was difficult for us
to get around those vehicles, but especially for Gary &amp; Sandi.  At one
point, a lady in a truck would not get off to the side, so Gary had to get his
truck with toy hauler up on the side of the hill to let her go by.  This caused
damage to their toy hauler and they were not too happy about that, but they
were better about it than many would have been.  When we finally reached our
destination, we found it was very beautiful there and it had a nice pavilion
and lots of grass and nice restrooms, which was a plus.  Sandi and Gary sat up
their toy hauler and we sat up and leveled our camper and then we went to visit
family members, sign in, get name tags and get signed up for various games and
activities.  I won at Bonchie Ball as we were set up in couples competing
against each other.  I played against several and Sandi won the ones she played
against, so her and I competed and I won.  I also played Sandy Browning and
beat her.  I was surprised as I am usually not that good at it.  We played
Rummikub and other games, visited, ate good food and relaxed in that beautiful
surroundings.  In the evening, Ken and I went for a walk and saw a couple of
small waterfalls and other beauties of nature.  They had the “Iron Rod” set up
for girl’s camp and it was great!  Roy realized that he had left his medicine
and insulin in his car, so that was a worry.  He told us he would be fine for a
couple of days and he seemed to be.  David and his family and Scott &amp;
Ashley arrived in time on Saturday morning, for us to visit with them a few
minutes before we had to leave for home.  Sandi &amp; Gary and Ken, &amp; I
left soon after breakfast on Saturday morning as we needed to go to our church
and set up for the Bushnell Cousin’s Reunion.  I had this planned way before
Irven’s family set this date for the Browning Reunion.  However, Aunt Joy
passed away a week ago and her funeral was on Wednesday, which my siblings and
Ken and I went to in Fillmore, so we cancelled the Cousin’s reunion, since we
would all be at Aunt Joy’s funeral and it would be hard for those who have come
from far away to have to come that same week up to Roy.  I had arranged for a
business to cater the food and it was too late to back out on them, so my
siblings and spouses said they would come and we would all divide up the cost
and take the leftovers back to our homes to share with others or eat later.  We
did this and still had a good time.  When we decided to have Bushnell cousin’s
reunions, they told me and my siblings to host the first one since Mom was the
oldest child of Grandma and Grandpa’s.  Well, I did my part and arranged for
this one, so if they want another one, then other cousins will have to host
it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Roy stayed at the reunion as he
went to Irven and Sandi’s to spend 3 or 4 days with them.  They called us that
night when they got home to say that the medicine and insulin was not in his
car, that he must have left them at our home.  I saw a plastic bag with
medicine in and a black case which I figured had his insulin in, so we decided
that we would all meet in Brigham City and we would give them to him.  We did
and had just arrived back home when they called to say that he still didn’t
have his insulin and that he thought it was in his black upright bag.  I looked
in it and found some insulin needles and papers and didn’t see anything else,
so again we took off to meet them in Brigham City.  Roy looked at the needles
and said he still didn’t have the insulin.  We were worried about that, so had
tried to call Irven and Sandy on their cell phone before we left home and
different times on the way, but no answer.  We were all frustrated by this time
and it was late and we were all tired.  Ken and Irven decided to take Roy to
the nearby Walmart store to see if the pharmacy was still open to see if he
could get another bottle of insulin.  The pharmacy was closed, but Roy bought
some bags of skittles candy as he heard he could use that in an emergency. 
That didn’t sound good to us, so we had them follow us to our home so we could
search and hopefully find his insulin.  We got here before them and I again
went to his upright case and felt it all over and saw a zipper at the top on
the backside.  I unzipped it and found the bottle of insulin.  Since it was so
late, we had them sleep here.  Roy slept in the guest bedroom where his things
were and Irven and Sandy slept in our recliners.  The next morning was Sunday
and they wanted to leave before I could get us all some breakfast, so they could
get them in plenty of time to go to church.  Roy came out of the guest bedroom
carrying is black case and said he had everything he needed now.  As they left
the house, I glanced at the counter and Roy had left his wallet, keys, etc.,
there.  I ran and told them to stop and then I ran back and grabbed them and
handed them to Irven and told him that he and Sandy would have to watch Roy
closely since he is very forgetful with the dementia.  They just left when I
was going in the bathroom and the door was open in his bedroom and I saw (of
all things) his bottle of insulin sitting on the dresser.  I was upset.  I was
in my pajamas, Ken was still asleep.  I grabbed the insulin and keys to the car
and took off after them.  I didn’t even grab my purse, but I did my cell phone
and kept trying to call them to tell them to stop as he had left his insulin. 
Wow!!  We had gone through all that time, gas for cars and frustration the
night before and he had still left the insulin.  No one answered the cell phone
and I chased them as far as 12<sup>th</sup> street, but couldn’t find them, so
had to turn around and come home.  I left them frantic messages on the phone. 
When they arrived home, they found the messages I had left, but they were on
the home phone, not their cell phone.  They called and said they would talk
about it and decide what to do.  Irven later called back and said that Roy had
found another bottle of insulin which he had had all along, even at the
reunion.  Oh my!!  I know it’s hard on Roy to be so forgetful and cause
problems, and it’s hard on family and others who he is with. I sure hope Ken
and I don’t get dementia or Alzheimer’s which their mother had.   Roy drove
back to our home and arrived here safely.  We had been worried as to whether he
would get lost or not.  We took him to visit Bob and he met with a friend and
had lunch one day and he helped Ken when Ken was putting in the new swamp
cooler for Marianne Ray.  He mainly sat in a lawn chair at Marianne’s in the
shade and handed Ken tools when he needed them.  The Following week, we had
planned with Scott, Mishelle and their family to go camping with them up at
Memorial Park where we camped with Bishop &amp; Ravee Mullins.  We thought Roy
would want to go back to his home by now, but when Ken told him we were going
camping, he wanted to go with us.  We made sure he had his medicine, insulin
and what he needed with him this time.  We went on Wednesday morning so we
could get the double campsite we wanted as it was the 4<sup>th</sup> of July
weekend and we knew it would be really crowded by Friday when Scott, Mishelle
and family could get here.  We were glad we did as people started coming in
that night and we wouldn’t have gotten this nice place.  It was shady all the
time in these two spots and we had lots of room there and lots of grass.  You
can’t reserve a campsite here, it was a first come, first serve campground and
the camp hosts just came around and collected the money after you were set up. 
We had an enjoyable time.  Roy wanted to go fishing, so Ken got him set up with
the fishing pole and off he went.  I asked Ken if it was safe for Roy to go
alone and he said “yes, he’ll be fine.”  Well, he came back awhile later with a
skinned-up arm and wet shoes and clothes.  He had slipped on the bank and
fallen in.  We took care of his arm, and he seemed ok.  Ken and I went for a
walk while Roy took a nap.  We met some people who were camping nearby and
visited with them.  We enjoyed the beautiful scenery and just enjoyed relaxing
in the out-of-doors.  Scott, Mishelle and family came up around noon on Friday
and we helped them get set up.  They have a new, very nice trailer with a pull
out. They were happy that we had this nice camping spot too.  We enjoyed
visiting, playing games, going for walks, eating together, etc.  Roy enjoyed
being with us too.  As we sat around the campfire, Ashley asked if we could
make up stories, like we do sometimes.  Someone starts a story and the next
person adds to it and it goes around the circle of people.  This was fun and
some really had a good imagination. </p>

Ken and Roy went to get him at the SLC Airport.  When they got here, I fixed
him a plate of food (leftovers from our Sunday dinner).  This evening Roy,
Russ, Mae and I went up to the hospital to visit Bob.  We had a nice visit with
him.  He told the Dr. that he didn’t want to do anything that would prolong his
life.  I had to agree with him.  Like he said, if they could make him well that
would be one thing but just to prolong his life he is not in favor of that. 
Roy, Russ and I gave Bob a blessing before we left.  We soon went to bed after
getting home but it was still after 11pm before Ken and I got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Monday, July 5<sup>th</sup></b> - I didn’t slept very
well so Ken got breakfast and Russ and Roy left for California about 8am.  I
said goodbye to them, ate breakfast and then started the laundry and house
work.  I have been busy all day and Ken have got quite a lot done also.  Ken
and I went down to Gifford’s and picked Logan Berries and Raspberries.  We
pulled almost all of the Radishes although they are getting quite large and
will not be as tender.  Lee invited us to come back and watch the movie “The 4<sup>th</sup>
of July” with them.  It was a good movie but there was more strong language
than we normally watch.  It was almost midnight when we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>KENNETH BROWNING FAMILY
REUNION AT JEFF &amp; GAIL’S HOME IN IDAHO</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Thursday, July 7</b>, we had breakfast,
finished packing and left early this morning to go to <b><u>Twin Falls, to Jeff
&amp; Gail’s, for our family reunion.</u></b>  Shellie, Roy &amp; Jase came
yesterday and they all wanted to go to the Lake to go Kayaking.  Ken &amp; I
stayed so we could get the volley ball poles set in the ground and the playing
area measured and sprayed, so the family can play volleyball this weekend.  Jase
and Ben had stayed also so they could play “Mindcraft”, a game they play
together on the “X Box”.  We asked them to come and help us some also.  Ken and
I played a game of Corn Hole before going in.  After the others came back and
we had eaten, we played games before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Friday, July 8 -</b> Sandi and Gary arrived
just before Gail &amp; most of the family were ready to leave for the Steadman
Family Park. Scott and his family also arrived about that time, but they
stayed, and I helped them get their trailer set up along the canal, North of
Jeff’s home.  Gail, her children, Mae, Shellie, Roy, Jase and Sandi went to the
Steadman Family Park where they took their lunch and enjoyed going on Water
Slides and a Zip Line and other activities.  Gary had stayed to set up their
toy hauler. Mike &amp; Becky came later and started preparing dinner as this
was their meal to do.  They fixed Nachos with pulled pork, beans, cheese, sour
cream and olives and a tossed salad.  This evening Jeff set up a movie screen
in the back yard and we watched a show.  It was a science fiction movie, so
that didn’t interest Ken &amp; much, but it was good to be with our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Saturday, July 9, 2016</b> - For breakfast
Scott and Michelle prepared pan cakes, sausage and eggs.  Most of the day was
spent at the river on kayaks, paddle boards and rafts.  Lunch was Hoagies from
Wall Mart, furnished by Jeff and Gail.  For dinner this evening Ken and I
cooked Dutch Oven Chicken.  After dinner Mike, Becky, Paige, Garrett, Mattie
and Jessie left for home, as Mike had responsibilities Sunday morning.  The
rest of us played games and visited.  While Ken was visiting with David somehow
in the conversation he mentioned that he would like to go into Twin Falls to
get a Frozen Yogurt.  David immediately picked up on that and so some of us
drove over there.  That was a great treat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Sunday, July 10, 2016 - </b>Sandi and Gary
prepared breakfast of Dutch oven Hungry Man’s Breakfast along with muffins. 
After breakfast Sandi and Gary packed up to go home.  Some of us got ready to
attend Church.  Just before leaving for church Grant called Ken to inform us
that Bob (Floyd Robert Young) had gone into a coma.  Hospice was there, and
they said that it would just be a matter of time until he passed away.  Ken
thanked him for letting us know and told him that Ken would call later. 
Shellie, Gail and her children, Mae and I attended Sacrament meeting.  By the
time we got back home Sandi and Gary had left for home.  After getting home,
Shellie prepared Chicken Enchiladas and tossed salad for lunch.  Ken helped
Scott and Mishelle get packed to go home.  They left shortly after 3pm.  The
rest of us played some table games this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Monday, July 11. 2016 - </b>Shauna prepared a
tater tot breakfast casserole that was very good for breakfast.  She had made
enough for all the family but due to many already gone home there was quite a
bit of it left over.  David, Shauna, Shellie, Roy, Ken and I then got packed up
to leave.  Shellie, Roy, Ken and I went to Twin Falls to get gas in our truck
and a Frozen Yogurt<b>.  We got home about 2:30pm</b>, there was a Thank You
card from Sister Neilson on our door.  <b>After some lunch we took Roy to the
Ogden Air Port where he flew back home.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b> </b><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Shellie &amp; Jase
will stay with us for a couple of weeks</span>.</b>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken went over to Chancellor Gardens assisted
living and saw Bob and spoke to Bob for a few minutes before coming home.  <b>Grant
called Ken at 4:40pm to tell us that Bob passed away at 7:35pm</b>.  Ken spent
some time this evening trying to help Grant and Stacy notify family and friends
about Bob’s passing and funeral plans.  We watched a show on TV and visited
late into the night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Tuesday, July 12</b> - Shellie and I went
shopping this afternoon.  Ken was asked to speak at Bob’s funeral, so he worked
on it and Jase played games or did “Mindcraft” on his computer.  This evening
we played games and watched “Yours, Mine and Ours” before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Wednesday, July 13</b> - Ken made egg omelets
for breakfast.  Shellie and I washed the car and stopped at Harmon’s for a few
groceries.  Shellie &amp; I played games and visited, and this evening Shellie
played Ken a game of chess using the timer.  Shellie, Ken and I played a game
of Racko and then we watched the show “Trouble With Angels” before going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Thursday, July 14 - </b>This morning we got
up early so that we might leave for Salt Lake by 7am.  We did have one traffic
slow down but made it to S.L. in time to let Jase and Shellie off at Temple
Square.  Then Ken and I went up to the V.A. hospital to the Audiologist where
Ken had a hearing test.  Their test results look about the same as the other
tests he has had.  The Audiologist wants more tests and would like Ken to bring
the other tests that he has had, so that he can get a comparison and try to
find out why his hearing keeps changing.  We met Jase and Shellie and the four
of us then went through the Church History Musician.  Following that we went to
lunch at JB’s where we all had a great meal.  We then went to the Conference
Center and really enjoyed our time there.  We were all very tired and ready to
come home by 3pm.  After getting home we watched a show that Jase had.  I think
between Shellie, Ken and I we slept through most of it.  For dinner we enjoyed
grilled hamburgers.  We played games until bed time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Friday, July 15</b> - After getting up with
the normal morning routine, Ken and I went down to Gifford’s and picked beans,
raspberries, black berries and Logan berries.  Shellie and Jase were already up
and had found them some breakfast.  I then cooked us some hot cakes and we
enjoyed them with Yogurt and fresh berries on them.  <b>Shellie and Jase are
meeting Sandi for lunch in Salt Lake and will stay with her tonight.  </b>At
5pm this afternoon Ken and I went to a <b>back-yard party for the choir members</b>
and their spouses, put on by the choir director sister Barbara Dainard.  We had
a very nice time.  After returning home Ken worked on his talk for Bob’s
funeral tomorrow.  I helped him some.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Saturday, July 16 – </b>Ken worked on his
talk again, he is really struggling with it.   We left for the viewing and were
some of the first to arrive at the chapel.   Shauna had ordered a beautiful
spray of flowers from the Ken Browning Family.  Later when we went to pay our
share for them David refused to have us pay.  We had the Knutson’s, the Neiderhauer’s,
Morgan and Marge Thomas, Glen Higley and Dian Graf plus those from the Relief
Society Presidency, who took care of the lunch.  Cole’s grandparents, members
of Carroll’s family members were there.  I believe that all of Bob and
Carroll’s family were there, most of Irven’s family were there, as well as all
of our children and most of their spouses and children.  Of course, Lois, Janet
and Elise came.  They are always so supportive of the family.  Also, the owners
and other staff members of Chandler Gardens came to show their respect for
Bob.  The services were appropriate, but the only music was an opening song and
a closing song.  We were very pleased with the dedication at the cemetery. 
Full Military Rites were given in Honor of Bob having retired with 20 years of
service in the U.S. Air Force.   Shortly after we returned home from the
funeral, Ken got a call from Barbara Smith asking about Bob.  Evidently Roy
didn’t remember Ken calling him to inform him that Bob had passed away.  Ken
believes that Roy was the first one that he called after Grant informed him of
Bob’s death.  Ken also called Roy back when Grant informed him of the funeral
date and time. When Ken informed Barbara that we had just returned from the
funeral, she was so sorry that Roy hadn’t remembered Ken’s messages.  Barbara
told Ken that Roy called them Saturday morning and said that Ken had called him
about Roy, but he didn’t remember what Ken had told him.  She said that had
they known, they would have gotten Roy here as well as some of their family. 
She wanted Ken to express apologies and their love to his family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Right after the funeral, Shellie &amp; Sandy
left to meet Gary and they were going to Gary’s property and then to Roosevelt
to meet Shellie’s best friend, Angie, when we lived in Grantsville and her
husband and go to Roy’s sister, Carolyn’s and husband Todd’s restaurant in
Roosevelt to have dinner with all of them.  Angie also invited them to her home
for a barbecue on Sunday.  Jase wanted to stay with us.  He just likes to be on
his computer.   This evening Ken and I just collapsed and relaxed.  Jase did
play a couple of games of “Spot It” with us, before we went to bed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.           <b>Sunday, July 17 – </b>We slept later than we
hoped and when I realized how late it was, I jumped up and got dressed.  Jeff
called and said that Gail had to be home for Church as she is giving the lesson
in Relief Society today.  They therefore didn’t stop.  Ken prepared breakfast
of eggs and bacon.  After breakfast Ken went into the bathroom and became quite
dizzy and almost fell.  He finally laid down and went back to sleep.  This
morning when he got up his hearing was very good but after becoming dizzy his
hearing went away and the ringing in the right ear returned also.  After church
and dinner, we tried to visit Sister Hilton and Brother Siglin but neither were
home, so we stopped and visited Brother and Sister Sheers for a few minutes.  
I started working on the presentation which Verla has asked me to give at the
Porter Family Reunion.  She asked if I would give memories I have of Grandpa
&amp; Grandma.  Ken has been concerned that maybe his stories were lost when
our computer crashed, but I was able to find them on the External Hard Drive. 
We were both so happy that I was able to find them.  Ken has great stories of
his life, his family, his dog, etc., etc., and we don’t want to lose them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.           <b>Monday, July 18 We</b> got up about 7am and
then went to go pick berries at Gifford’s.  There weren’t very many berries but
that was ok.  After breakfast Ken started filling water bottles and then took a
3-gallon bottle over to Jackie.  Ken took water over to Jackie, our 90-year-old
widow neighbor, who we love.  Ken stayed and visited with her quite a while and
then Assenacio was outside and he got talking with him and that turned into a
lengthy conversation.  Ken isn’t feeling the best.  Shellie and I did laundry,
visited and played games.  This evening we played Racko.   It was mid-night
when we finally quit to go to bed, but Shellie needed to vent so her and I were
up until after 2am.  I love this beautiful daughter and feel so bad that her
life hasn’t gone how she was hoping, and we were hoping, but life doesn’t
always turn out as we hoped and planned.  Roy and her boys don’t have a
testimony either, like 3 of our sons. (Don’t know about Jase).  They don’t go
to church and don’t pay tithing, so she is depressed.  She wants to get her
temple recommend back, even though Roy doesn’t – so I hope she is strong enough
and will ask her Bishop for one.  I can’t see how why she can’t get one.  She
says that because Roy doesn’t want to pay tithing, that she can’t – but other
sisters are in the same boat and they can get recommends, because they would pay
if they had jobs and earned money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Tuesday, July 19 -</b> After breakfast,
Shellie and Jase got ready to go to Lagoon.  This is the first year that I
haven’t gone with them, but I didn’t for two reasons.  First, they used to let
seniors go in for a minimal fee if they didn’t plan on going on many rides. 
Also, Shellie has paid for my ticket some years.  The second reason is that
since none of her other family came this year and Sandi wasn’t going with her,
that meant that there were just two of them and they could go on rides
together.  Other years, with having more family, I went on rides with them.  It
is our ward temple day and Ken is in charge of it, so he and I went into the
Ogden Temple this afternoon.  We met Brother Fife and Dave &amp; Pat Presnell
at the church.  Brother Fife didn’t want to eat afterwards, so he drove alone. 
Another couple from our ward, the Wimmers met us at the temple.  They are one
of the “Transplant couples who come to help our ward for three years as we
don’t have enough leadership in our mobile home court.  They are all wonderful
couples and we are thankful for them, but it’s hard to say “Goodbye” when their
three years are up.)  We enjoyed visiting with the Presnells as we ate in the
cafeteria.  Shellie, Ken and I played a couple of games before going to bed and
Ken lost every game. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Wednesday, July 20 Ken</b> woke before 6am
and was up for a few minutes when I woke.  We both went back to bed and slept
for a little longer.  Later I was going to go run an errond and I couldn’t find
the keys, they were not hanging on the hook where we keep them.  I asked Ken if
he knew where they were, and that started a search that both of us were looking
off and on throughout the day, without success.   Ken talked with Shellie for
quite a while and I was worried that Jase was hearing it.  He was in the front
room with his computer and he did have his ear buds in, but Shellie &amp; Ken
were getting loud, so I suggested they go into the bedroom.  I got in on some
of the conversation, but Shellie was so upset, and Ken wasn’t helping (I didn’t
think), so I told them I was leaving as the spirit of the Lord wasn’t there.  I
shut the door and was upset.   Shellie has certainly gone through her share of
challenges, even more than anyone should, but I guess the Lord knows she can
and maybe there’s much to be learned for all of us in this.  Later, Shellie and
I went to visit Deanna.  We sure enjoyed our visit with Deanna and Bryce. 
Bryce kept giving us all kinds of food – fruit, nuts, dried fruit, banana nut
bread, etc.  When we got home, we fixed leftovers for Ken and Jase as Shellie
&amp; I weren’t hungry.  Shellie and I had a good talk on the way to Deanna
&amp; Bryce’s and on the way back.  Ken got Jase to help him and they hauled
some trash away for Sister Marianne Ray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Thursday, July 21</b> When we got up this
morning Shellie had breakfast almost ready for us.  We ate and then went to the
Viewing and Funeral for Eugene Tew’s, Rick’s Father.  It was very nice and had
beautiful music too.  We left after the funeral, so I could stop at the
Distribution Center in Layton.  When Shellie and I were there quite a while
looking at books and tapes, so Ken got tired and I suggested he go sit in a
comfortable chair they had there. He did and took a short nap.  Mae and I took
a nap for almost an hour after getting home.  Shellie loves working with the
Banamagrams we have.  You make words out of the chips and it is like a
crossword puzzle.  We bought her a set when we were at WalMart the other day,
so she put the chips from both games together and spelled out the names of all
our family.  I took a picture of her with them.  Ken has been hurting through
his legs and feet most of the day.  I had chicken thawed when we got home so
Ken grilled those and hamburgers for Jase.  This evening we watched a show on
TV until quite late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Friday, July 22 After</b> breakfast this
morning Ken went to Dr. Gray’s and had his teeth cleaned.  He then went to
Murdock Chevrolet and got a new transmitter, two new keys and a key ring, which
was a total of $235.05.  I wasn’t too happy that he did that as I thought we still
might find the keys and that’s a lot of money to spend right now.  We ate lunch
and then Ken, Shellie and I played a couple of hands of Rackco and then Shellie
went up to visit Georgia.  I made a potato salad for our Glendon Porter Family
Reunion that we are holding tomorrow.  Ken installed a new print cartridge into
our printer this afternoon.  It has been indicating that it needed a new one
for about three months now but finally quite working.  We watched a show on
Netflix this evening that was ok but had quite a different outlook on death and
heaven that any we have seen before.  Ken, Shellie and I played a few hands of
cards before going to bed late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Saturday, July 23   Ken </b>prepared
breakfast this morning of egg omelets.  We basically prepared for the reunion
that we will hold this afternoon.  Ken has been quite dizzy today and, so he
took a nap.  This afternoon we set up for the Reunion and had a fair turn out. 
Mike had planned on being there but somehow hurt his back and so called us to
say that they weren’t coming.  Except for Shellie and Jase being there, none of
the rest of our family came.  We had a pretty fair turn out.  All of Georgia’s
and Rick’s family were there and they were disappointed that our families were
not there.  Terry, Angela, Maleah and children came from Idaho.  Maleah had
been to Alaska with her husband, Troy, who works there most of the time, but
make sure she was home to come to this reunion.  Kim, Summer, Daniel and their
daughter came late and even later, Dezeree, Joshua &amp; His partner, Calab,
Mishelle and their children came.  Most of that generation played volleyball
after dinner and everyone seemed to enjoy the event.  It was almost 10PM before
we got home.  Terry and his family have to travel back to Chubbuck, so they will
be lucky if they make it by mid-night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Sunday, July 24 We</b> got up about 6:30am to
get breakfast for Shellie and Jase and see them off.  They left for home about
7:30am.  We have sure enjoyed having them here.  We just hope and pray that
Shellie can find more satisfaction in life.  She is one person that is sure
trying to live the Gospel and teach it to her children, and is depressed that
they and her husband have dropped into inactivity now.  We pray for all of
them.   After Shellie and Jase left, we had some breakfast and then took
showers and laid back down for a while.  Today Bishop Mullins and his
councilors were released from their calling and a new Bishopric was sustained. 
David Presnell was sustained as Bishop with Sam Hess as 1<sup>st</sup>
councilor and Gary Johnson as 2<sup>nd</sup> councilor.  We certainly agreed
with the choice of the Stake presidency and feel that we could and will sustain
them in their callings.  Ken hasn’t felt the best today.  I fixed dinner and
then we were going to take a ½ hour nap and then go visit Evie Hilton at the
rehab.  Ken laid down and the phone rang.  It was Marianne Ray, so I talked
with her while I did the dishes and Ken took the nap.  I called Evie and she
was too tired for us to go visit her, so we will another night.  I was still
tired, so I took a short nap while Ken played a game of Hearts on the
computer.  I needed to do some work on the ward history, so Ken let me use the
computer.  After that we planned to watch the BYU channel to see if they had
something on the Pioneers.  I had seen that there were some videos and
information on Pioneers on Family Search, so thought we could watch them, but
they had been removed (not sure why as today is the 24<sup>th</sup> of July to
celebrate the Pioneers arriving in the Salt Lake Valley).  As Ken turned on the
TV, it had a show starting with Jimmy Stewart and both Ken and I really like
him.  It was titled “Bend in The River” and was a Western Movie.  It was good. 
We are going to bed early – first time in many days since Shellie has been
here.  We received a text from her when we got home from church saying she was
in Flag Staff and another at 7:30pm saying they were home.  We were happy to
hear that she and Jase made it home safely.  We are grateful to the Lord for
answering our prayers and watching over her, as she didn’t get much sleep last
night, so was tired and had 12 to 13 hours of driving to reach their home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Shellie texted the next morning after
arriving home and said “Thanks for a wonderful time in UT</b>.  Can’t believe I
was gone for 24 days!  Time flies when you’re having fun.  It’s good to be back
though.  I almost forgot how much I love my home and the beautiful lake.  Our
backyard view truly is gorgeous and it’s not any hotter right now than it’s
been in UT though our evenings don’t cool off.  Garrett and Nora came over last
night to welcome us home &amp; Nora wanted to spend some time outside, but I
choose to pass as it was way too hot.”  She texted again saying “My little
Maggie missed me.  She was hugging on me all night –I loved it!! So cute!”   I
had asked her to text us when she got to Flagstaff and again when she arrived
home – and she did.  I was relieved as she was tired when she left her as she
hadn’t had a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Monday, July 25</b> I didn’t sleep much last
night, so Ken let me sleep in later this morning.  I had wanted to get up
early, so I could work in my flower gardens and yard.  I did that anyway, for a
while, before breakfast as it would be hot soon.   It has been a “hot” summer –
over 100 degrees many days.  At 11am I came in and fixed us some breakfast and
we just set down to eat when the doorbell rang.  We thought “I wonder who that
can be this morning because Bishop Mullins has been released, so it couldn’t be
him”. So, I answered the door and guess who, but Bishop Mullins.  I think he
just wanted to visit.  That is ok, as we sure love and appreciate him.  Ken got
water bottles filled and one taken to Jackie, across the street.  He got all
the coolers, chairs and games that we used at the Family Reunion Saturday, put
away.  He made up a batch of Almond Butter.  I did laundry all day as I had
sheets &amp; pillow cases from all the beds and towels along with all our usual
laundry.  I cleaned the house, made meals, made Ken’s smoothie drink, etc.  We
were both tired, so we watched part of a Western show on TV this afternoon.  
Charles and Carolyn Saunders and Ken and I were invited to Graf’s to visit play
games and have refreshments.  We had a good evening, getting home after 10pm. 
We soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Sunday, August 7, 2016.</b>  Other than going
to church, I have been working on my presentation for our Porter Family Reunion
tomorrow night at the Layton Park and “Surf &amp; Swim”.  I hope it won’t be

widowers that have lost their wives due to death, the one is in his late 70’s
and his wife passed away 2 years ago, and the other lost his wife to death
three years ago.&nbsp; He told us that he is reaching close to 88 years
old.&nbsp; Brother Okey asked him what he was planning after reaching age 88
and he just said, with a twinkle in his eye, I have got to first reach that and
then we will see.&nbsp; A third couple did not let us in because he has been
sick for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; His wife has severe osteoporosis and has been
operated on two or three months ago and the doctors have put steel rods up her
back to hold her spine in place.&nbsp; The operation so far has not healed
properly and she has had to return to the hospital for additional
operations.&nbsp; Doctors cannot find anything wrong with the husband except
they feel he has Dementia and due to his wife’s condition, he is reacting to it
emotionally.</span></p>

color:#222222'>&nbsp;I don't speak Arabic, but I have read the Qu'ran in French
and it explicitly states that families who are faithful will be reunited in the
afterlife. Forgive me grandpa, but to me the claim the LDS church's doctrine is
unique in this respect seems uninformed. 1.6 billion people are both&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>members
of the LDS church&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>believe in continuing relationships
after death. Also, of note: the judge that married my wife and I used the
language, &quot;as long as you both shall live&quot;. To me this has any sort
of afterlife covered.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:31.3pt;line-height:normal;background:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>I really appreciate the
language in this phrase. It explains my stance almost perfectly. The afterlife
is indeed a gamble. There is no way to be certain of the outcome!! Personally,
I consider myself an agnostic atheist. This means that though I remain unsure
on the matter of god and an objectively true religion I tend to find their lack
of existence more plausible than their existence (See Occam's Razor). The
bottom line for me is that we can't&nbsp;<i>know</i>. Since we can't know, I
find it a much better use of my time to spend it with my family and bettering
myself than to lose what little time I have worshiping a deity that may or may
not exist and trying to figure out what he/she/it wants me to do. People have
been trying for thousands of years, and I personally don't believe we're any
closer than we were 4,000 years ago.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The global population is 7.4 billion. Church membership is 15,634,199. This
means that for every 1,000 people, 2 are LDS. From a gambling stance 500:1 odds
are not very good!!! I find it much more likely that god, whatever it may be
will be much more appreciative of the fact that I looked, I searched, and that
ultimately there was no reliable means by which I could determine what the
outcome of death was so I decided instead to try and be a good person, improve
myself, and treat my family right.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>Consider the following: I
die tomorrow. The LDS church WAS indeed THE single path back to God!!&nbsp;<b>Why
would an all-powerful god punish me for the rest of eternity when he/she/it
didn't actually make him/her/itself or desires known to me in this life?</b>&nbsp;note:
the spirit is purported to convert followers of almost every religion to said
religion. I have explicitly replicated what I believed growing up to be
'feeling the spirit' I can do it on command. I believe the devout catholic has
every thread of conviction a devout mormon does. This is not a statistically
nor repeatably reliable means by which to receive important
information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal;background:
white'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>The call to
action you ended with was somewhat hurtful. I'm going to man up and call it
out. That was a deliberate attempt to guilt those of your children and
grandchildren who have chosen to leave the LDS religion into conformity. I know
I have several family members behind me when I say we don't plan on it. I know
that isn't what you'd like to hear, but for those of us who have left, we don't
like to be belittled either.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>There is a line when it
comes to religion. Whenever it is crossed with myself or my family, you can
expect a response similar to this one. If we can maintain that line, no more
feelings need be hurt. Just to clear up any confusion, unless you are willing
to come at a religious conversation willing to accept the possibility that you
may be wrong (I'll do the same), please don't start a religious conversation
with me. (This includes passive aggressive email activity). If you would
honestly like to have a discussion on the subject, I need a brief summary of
what it would take to convince you that LDS doctrine is not true. For me to
convince me of the truthfulness of the LDS gospel, I would need God himself to
come down, shake my hand, and ask me for the first couple tokens. (It happened
to Alma the younger, and I'm not trying to bring down the church, besides, an
all-powerful god who lives outside of time and who actually does care about
each of his 'lost' sheep would deem it a menial task in my opinion). In
fairness, I think witnessing a priesthood blessing restore the arm or leg of an
amputee (no surgery) would also suffice. The evidence against the church being
the one and only true church on the face of the earth is too damning to concede
anything less in my honest opinion. The interesting conundrum being that if
that actually happened (miraculous vision), almost no one in any LDS ward would
believe me. I'd probably be excommunicated for preaching false doctrine.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mike</b> talked with Ken on the phone, while driving home
from work the other day.  He does this every so often and we appreciate it. 
Anyway, in the course of the conversation, this email came up and Mike told his
dad that if anyone writes more than three lines in an email, it can get
misconstrued.  He says he never does, that if he wants to communicate feelings
and emotions, he always either talks to them over the phone or in person. 
Guess that’s good advice for us. Mike is the only one of our sons who still
believes and is strong in the church.  We are thankful that he and Becky are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ken was talking with our son, <b>David</b>, and he told his
dad that he was about to send a response to his email, when he noticed that his
nephew, Dave, had sent this one, so he opted not to send his.  His might have
been similar to Dave’s as he, Jeff and Scott all feel about the same.  They all
don’t have testimonies of the church, the prophet, Joseph Smith, our current
prophet and the Book of Mormon.  David and Scott still take their families to
church, when they don’t have other plans, and we are grateful for that and they
still believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, when Jeff and Dave don’t. 
It breaks our heart to see how so many of our family are leaving the church, as
it is so important to Ken and I and we know it is all true – but they are good
people and we love them and always will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We didn’t get a response from Scott or</b> <b>Shellie</b>,
but we know Shellie is struggling.  Her husband and sons are struggling with
their testimonies and her husband and two middle sons don’t go to church now,
pay tithing, etc.  Shellie has always been a “straight arrow”, so strong in the
church, but her trials have been hard on her so she is struggling too, but she
is going to church and trying to remain strong and go forward in faith.  We
pray for her and all our children, their spouses, our grandchildren and great
grandchildren.</p>
