hspace=12 alt="Home in Clearfield just after Mike was born">We had moved into
Uncle Dale and Aunt Esther's home in Clearfield.  They had built a new home in
West Point and had moved there and were just going to rent this home in Clearfield.  They rented it to us.  It was a beautiful home with beautiful landscaping.  It
had about 3 large blue spruce trees, a rose garden, beautiful shrubs all around
the home, ivy that covered the brick by the end of the summers.  It had a
circular driveway.  In the front room there was a gas log fireplace which we
enjoyed.  It had a large kitchen; a family room and bedroom were downstairs. 
It had a large front porch and land in back to have animals.  We did have
rabbits (for Sandi to care for and learn responsibility) and horses.  Larry
&amp; Ken had gotten horses instead of pay for a job they had done.  The man
couldn't afford to pay them, but would give them his horses.  We had Bonnie, an
older stubborn horse and Kendee, a young Appalachia.  Kendee was great and we
all loved her, but Bonnie was slow, so she was good to put the younger children
on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We moved to this house in February of 1969.   We
rented the home in Ogden for about three months.  The people didn’t pay us the
rent on time.  They were wrecking our home so we finally were able to sell it
and get the people out this way.  We lost $90.00 and had to paint the entire
house, put in new screen doors, windows, etc.  The people who bought our home
didn’t have cash for the equity so we agreed to let them have it and pay our
equity to us on escrow.  We later had to give our escrow to Moyes Glass and
Paint Company for the bill we owed on Larry &amp; Ken’s Contracting business –
B &amp; B Contractors.  We had gotten so far behind on our bills with the
business not working out.  We lived off of our two years supply as long as we
could and finally had to go on church welfare to try and get caught up.  This
was very embarrassing for me, but humbling, as I wanted to be independent and
hated to ask for help.  Also, Uncle Dale helped us by letting us get behind on
the rent and catching up later when we were able.  Dad and Mom also gave us
money and bought food and clothes occasionally.  They were wonderful to us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>South Fork above Huntsville</b>
–When we were living in Ogden and Clearfield, we used to take the children
camping or for a picnic up South Fork Canyon to the campgrounds there.  It was
a pretty area and fairly close when we lived in Ogden.  One or more times, we
continued on that road up to Monte Cristo and camped there.  I didn’t like it
as well as there were large horse flies there and they bit hard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>My first position in the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup> ward was <b>Trekker teacher in Primary.</b>  It was in the middle
of the year when they had called the Trekker teacher to be the chorister in
YWMIA.  She loved these boys and so hated to leave them and couldn't understand
why someone else couldn't have been the chorister, but she being a faithful
member of the church, accepted this position.  Her trekker boys loved her too
and were very upset that she wasn't going to be their teacher any longer.  So -
this was a hard position for me to step into.  I remember my first day at
primary very well.  Before opening exercises started, I tried to be friendly to
the boys, but they wouldn't warm up at all.  In fact, the one boy scooted away
from me and gave me a dirty look.  In class, it was a nightmare.  They were
yelling, climbing under and over the chairs and benches.  (Our room was the
scout room) They wouldn't listen to me give the lesson and were &quot;out of
control&quot;.  When I got home, I fell into the big chair and wondered what I
had gotten into by accepting this call.  I have had many challenges in my
experience of teaching positions and this was surely another one of them.  I'm
not a quitter - so I began thinking of different ways to present the lessons,
of ways to show the boys that I cared about them, I made them a birthday cake
for their birthday, etc.  A couple of hard months later, I gave a lesson on
knot tying.  I was good at this because I had been over girl’s camp so much and
the certification program.  When the boys saw that I could tie knots, they were
impressed and that was the turning point.  It got better and better and by the
end of the year, the boys loved me and I surely loved them.  One of the boys
was named Lane Adams.  He was the hardest to warm up to, but in the end was one
of my favorites.  He would come over to our home and help me weed my rose
garden, etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Randy Higley was a challenge because he had been
brain washed by his mother and others that he had a learning disability and
couldn't learn and do like other children his age.  The boys had to pass off
certain requirements to earn badges.  His mother told me, right in front of
Randy that he wouldn't be able to do all these things and that school teachers
and other church teachers had made allowances because of his learning
disability.  I didn't buy that.  Randy could do more than his mother
acknowledged.  The elementary school was just across the road from our home and
so I had Randy come over after school and I would go over and over with him the
articles of faith, tying knots and the other things he needed to learn. 
Sometimes he would get frustrated and blurt out &quot;I can't do it&quot;.  I
would say &quot;yes, you can Randy and I will help you&quot;.  He did learn
them and pass them off much to the surprise of his mother.  She was proud of
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            About this time, I was called to be the <b>Primary
President.</b>  Since we had just moved into the ward a few months ago and I
had been in Primary and hadn't gotten to know very many sisters, I didn't know
who to call for my counselors.  Kent Murdock was the counselor over the primary
at that time and he told me to fast and pray about it and go over the ward list
and I would be able to choose the ones the Lord would have serve with me.  I
was in the PTA of the elementary school as Sandi was in the 2nd or 3rd grade. 
I finally choose two of the sisters I worked with in the PTA from our ward.  <b>I
called Bro. Murdock and gave him the names. He said &quot;I feel good about the
one, but I think we better fast &amp; pray a little longer about another
name.&quot;  I felt very good that he had been fasting and praying also to help
me choose the right ones.  Finally, I felt good about another sister and called
him.  He said &quot;yes, that’s the one I feel should be your other
counselor&quot;.  They were excellent counselors and we grew to love each other
as we worked together as a presidency.  I was thankful for Bro. Murdock and for
the Lord giving me these sisters to be my counselors.  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I decided to have the secretary stay in from the
last presidency since she had not been in very long and was doing a good job. 
Ione Adams (Lane Adams's mom) was my first counselor and Carolyn Cue was my
other counselor.  That was in 1969.  It is now 1998 and Carolyn and I have kept
in touch throughout these years.  We used to get together for lunch once in a
while, but now we just keep in touch at Christmas through notes and letters and
Christmas cards.  They are great women.  I have special memories of working
together on the Primary Sacrament meeting program, Mom &amp; Miss party, Ward
dinners that we were in charge of, pennies by the inch, etc., etc.  I can't
remember how long we served together (probably only about a year as we only
lived in Clearfield two years).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>While I was Primary President, one Saturday I
was at the church for a &quot;Miss and her Mom&quot; party when we heard fire
Syrians.  Someone ran into the church where I was and told me it looked like
smoke was coming from our home.  I ran outside and looked, and sure enough it
looked like it was coming from there.  One of the ladies offered to take me
home, so I jumped into her car.  We had a hard time getting there because the
traffic was so bad and they had the road blocked off.  I jumped out of the car
and took off running.  I was very relieved when I saw Sandi and the younger
children standing on the other side of the street with our neighbors.  It
wasn't our home that was on fire, but the old canning factory which was just
south of our home.  They were spraying down our home though as the flames were
so hot that they were afraid our home would catch on fire also.  Sandi was
tending her younger brothers &amp; sisters while I was at the party at the
church.  She was very responsible and I believe had been the one who called the
fire department.  She had quickly gotten the younger children outside and
across the street.  She was holding David and Shellie &amp; Mike were standing
by her.  I was so thankful they were alright</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Also, while we were living in Clearfield, Larry
&amp; Ken decided we should go on a<b> pack-in trip for a vacation and go to
Pinedale, Wyoming.  </b>(Anyway, I think it was Pinedale) They wanted to take
Tammy &amp; I and also invite John &amp; Linda &amp; Bob &amp; Pauline, our
other good friends from Ogden.  They wanted to go for a week.  I was against it
for several reasons.  1) Ken was saying we were going and I didn't like to be
told I had to go.(Guess I'm pretty ornery sometimes) 2) I was nursing Mike and
he was only about six months old and I usually nursed my babies until they were
at least 9 months old and I didn't want to have to quit nursing him, and I
would have to if I were to be gone for a week. 3) I had had a couple of bad
experiences with horses and going with Larry.  The most recent was going up one
of the canyons, coming home scratched up from following Larry through the trees
and bushes, saddle sore, sunburned and feeling miserable.  I liked going on
short rides on the horses, but not all-day rides.  I felt with going on a
pack-in trip, it would be another miserable time.  Ken really wanted to go and
was stubborn and wouldn't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer.  I got pretty
upset and I remember my wonderful dad coming over for lunch (he worked
part-time for my Uncle Dale at his farm manufacturing company &quot;Clear-field
Manufacturing&quot; which was next door on the north.)  He would come over for
lunch sometimes and I enjoyed visiting with him.  One day I was telling him
about Ken wanting us to go on this pack-in trip to Wyoming.  I told him how I
felt and he told me I needed to stand up for myself - that I was a lot like my
sweet little Grandma Bushnell, and that Grandpa Bushnell always bossed grandma
around and didn't treat her very good, but when she finally stood up for
herself (after her children were raised) he respected her more, treated her
better and they had a much better relationship.  He told me that if I didn't
want to go on this pack-in trip, I shouldn't have to.  He was cute.  Well, Ken
still won out in the end - but I am glad he did as I did have a wonderful
time.  Larry &amp; Ken borrowed some big pack horses and cattle trucks from a
friend in Wyoming that they built a home for (actually a home out of a
schoolhouse) We drove to their place, put the horses in the big cattle trucks
and headed up to the mountains.  We parked at a certain place, put everything
on those pack horses, then we got on our horses.  I think I was riding Bonnie
and Ken was on Kendee and us four couples started off.  The area where we went
was so beautiful.  No motorized vehicle could go there, only horses or hikers. 
It was so beautiful.  We followed each other on a trail and rode by beautiful
lakes, river, and meadows.  We saw lots of wildlife.  It was so beautiful and
peaceful.  I don't think I have been to a more beautiful, wonderful, peaceful
place.  We camped at a lake.  The guys fished and Tammy, Pauline, Linda and I
visited and relaxed.  It was so wonderful.  <b>We had a close call on the way
back, however.  Ken was driving one of the big cattle trucks and one of the
horses slipped and caused the truck to swerve off the road.  The Lord was
watching over us because over half of the truck was over the mountain.  The
only thing that was holding it back, keeping it from going over the cliff was a
small tree.  As we think about it now, it was truly a miracle.  Larry quickly
stopped, ran over to us, opened the passenger door and helped us out.  Ken had his
foot on the brake, but Larry helped Bob, Pauline and then me out of the truck. 
Larry then ran over, jumped back into his truck and backed it behind the truck
Ken was in.  He took a big chain and fashioned it to both trucks and then
pulled Ken's back onto the road.  It was hard to watch, and I was praying with
all my might that Ken would be OK.  The horses were all upset and were rearing,
etc., and the truck was swaying back and forth.  I could just imagine at any
moment that little tree breaking and Ken being hurled off that mountain in the
truck.  If that had happened, there would not be any chance that he could have
come out alive.  I'm so thankful to the Lord that our lives were spared that
day.  Pauline was so shaken that she would not get back into the truck.  She
started walking down the road.  She had walked quite a way before we all
convinced her that she couldn't walk all the way to the bottom of the mountain,
so she finally got back in, but was very nervous until we got home.  To tell
the truth, I was also. </b> Pauline was an English girl and had a cute assent. 
Her &amp; Bob are special friends.</p>

alt="Bishopric of Clearfield 1st Ward - Bishop Kent Murdock, Ken is 1st counselor &amp; John Ross as 2ns counselor"><b>Kent
Murdock was called to be the Bishop and he asked Ken to be his 1st counselor</b>. 
With us having a young family, they didn't want both of us to be in executive
positions so I was released. After Ken was put in the Bishopric, I asked him if
he would talk to the Bishop about letting me be the <b>Young Marrieds’ leader
in our ward.</b>  I had enjoyed it so much in the Mount Fort Ward and we didn’t
have one going in the Clearfield lst Ward.  I was sustained in this position in
September.  Our opening social was September the 12<sup>th</sup>, the day David
was born, so Delvin and Dalene Reed, my assistants took over.  Later Ranae
Barney was put in as my assistant and we became great friends.  Ranae is a
different lady, she is a worker and very creative.  She did an amazing job as
my assistant.  However, she offended many people by the things she said and the
way she said them.  The funny thing is that she would become offended very
easily,  But, her and I got along great and grew to love each other.  In
January Dona Kolb, the Relief Society President moved to Roy, and Maurine
Sanders was put in as the new president.  She asked for John’s wife, Amy, and
myself to be her counselors.  I turned it down as both Ken and I felt that with
the size of our family and with them being so small, it would be too hard as I
would have to leave them so much.  I talked to Dona and she verified it.  She
said it was too much on a woman with a small family.  That she couldn’t have
done it except that her husband worked nights so he tended the children while
she went to Relief Society and visited the sisters and had her other meetings. 
She was my age and had three small girls.  Our Relief Society meetings and
activities were held during the week, not on Sundays like they are now.  Later
on that month they asked for me to teach the Spiritual Living class in Relief
Society as Maurine had taught it before she was put in as President.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I remember well the night the Bishopric came
over to ask me to be the Spiritual Living Teacher in Relief Society</b>.  I
wanted to say &quot;no&quot; because I was really nervous about teaching the
women in our ward, especially the Spiritual Living lessons.  There were many
older sisters who were very well versed in the scriptures and I felt one of
them should have been the teacher, not me as I was young and not very well
versed.  I guess the Lord knew I needed to study the scriptures more - so I
accepted.  I remember being so nervous about giving that first lesson.  I had
about a month to prepare so I studied hard, made visual aids, fasted and
prayed.  Our Relief Society meetings were on Tuesday mornings.  I remember
going there, going to prayer meeting and sitting on the front row in the Relief
Society room.  I felt like I would pass out, and was sure that when I got in
front of these sisters, I would pass out, but when I got up there and started
to give the lesson, all the fear went away from me and I was able to give the
lesson better than I had prepared and I felt the spirit of the Holy Ghost
guiding me and helping me.  It was such a warm, wonderful feeling and I was
actually enjoying giving the lesson.  When it was over many of the sisters came
up and told me what a good lesson it was and how they had enjoyed and gained a
lot from it.  I was so happy.  <b>I knew my Heavenly Father had answered my
prayers, and then I knew the meaning of the scripture which has come to be my
favorite. Nephi is speaking - &quot;I will go and do the things which the Lord
has commanded for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children
of men save he shall prepare a way that they can accomplish the thing that he
has commanded them&quot;.  This has given me courage to accept the calls that
have come to me, even though many times I felt inadequate.  My patriarcharal
blessing tells me that I would be a leader among women and so I know that I am
not to turn down these callings, and I have tried to accept and magnify them
with the Lord's help.  As I would try to do my best and ask the Lord for help,
he has helped me greatly and I have been very blessed throughout my life.</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While here in Clearfield, my Mom really
encouraged me to finish the requirements and get my &quot;<b>Golden
Gleaner&quot; award</b>.  They don't have these awards anymore, in fact, they
did away with them right after I received mine.  You had to finish all the
requirements for this award before the age of 30.  I was 29 and Mom said that I
should get an application and see if I hadn't already accomplished most of the
requirements.  I did and found that I had, indeed, fulfilled most of these
requirements from being in Leadership positions, speaking in church, fulfilling
other church callings, etc.  I did have several to finish up, however, and I
was expecting David and didn't feel up to all that I still needed to do.  Mom
kept after me, however, and so I did eventually earn this award before the age
of 30.  They recognized me at Sacrament Meeting and presented me with a
medallion.  Up to this point, the church had a special recognition banquet in
Salt Lake City for all who had earned this special &quot;Golden Gleaner&quot;
award for the women and &quot;Golden M Men&quot; for the men.  With the church
becoming so wide spread and even thought this was a small percentage of the men
and women of the church who had earned this award, it was still getting harder
to have a banquet for this many people - and so they discontinued it.  I didn't
go to a banquet, but that was ok.  I'm sure I grew from doing these
requirements</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I didn’t love sewing, but <b>I was excited that I could make
clothes for our children and I loved dressing my daughters in “Look Alike”
clothes.  I also made pull-over shirts for our sons and many times I would make
them out of the same material, so they all matched too.  They didn’t mind it
when they were young.</b>  I made dresses, tops, shawls &amp; pajamas for the
girls, and shirts and pajamas for the boys.  I tried to make levi’s, but that
was too much work.  I made clothes for myself too and some of my favorites were
clothes I had made.  When we were living in Arizona, the first time, Shellie
was mopping around and I asked her why she was sad.  She said “You make clothes
for Sandy, but not for me”.  I hadn’t realized that it had been that long since
I had sewn anything for her.  I told her that we would go shopping the next day
and she could pick out the pattern, material, lace or whatever she wanted and I
would make a dress for her.  She was so excited, and we had fun shopping
together.  She picked out a cute pattern and material, and after it was
finished, she looked so cute in it and she loved it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Larina</b>, our Indian Foster daughter on the Indian
Placement Program, was still living with us when we lived in Clearfield.  She
graduated from Clearfield High.  When we moved to Clearfield, Larina became
friends with Debbie Higley.  Debbie was a darling girl.  She was overweight and
a little plain, but had a darling personality.  We were glad her and Larina
became friends. Debbie quickly grew to love our children and would love to come
to our home and play with the kids and read them stories.  Larina, it seemed
came second place, when Debbie was at our home.  After Larina graduated and
went back to Idaho, we had Debbie baby sit for us.  Even when she had other
plans, she would cancel them to come and tend our children.  She was the best
babysitter we ever had.  She loved the children and they loved her, and Ken
&amp; I loved her too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Mike was only about 7 months old, I got
pregnant again.  I was concerned because the baby would just be 16 &amp; ½
months younger than Mike and I didn't know how I would manage especially since
Ken was gone so much with being in the Bishopric.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When we moved to Clearfield, Ken
decided he had better try to get a job back in computer programming.  With him
being out for about two years, it wasn't easy.  <b>Browning Arms up in Mountain
Green</b> was looking for a programmer so Ken went to apply for it.  At first,
they didn't want to even consider him, but he told them he would work for such
a low wage and that after he proved himself, they could raise him to the wage
that were planning to pay.  The supervisor said &quot;What can we lose&quot; so
they hired him.  It was such a low wage that we were not able to pay our bills
so we used our food storage instead of buying groceries.  Ken did prove
himself, but about that time the owner of the company, Val Browning, who was a
alcoholic had bought a company, Jarmans, at a party when he was drunk.  Jarmans
was about bankrupt - so that put Browning Arms in a tight squeeze.  When Ken's
supervisor went to get the raise for him, he was told that there was a freeze
on wages and they couldn't give him the raise he deserved.  By this time, we
had used up our food storage and had to be put on church welfare.  I hated
this.  I always want to be self-sufficient and I didn't like being on church
welfare.  We were only on it about 2 or 3 months when we felt we needed a
vacation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken needed to get away and I did
also.  Larry &amp; Tammy had moved to Mesa, Arizona because of Larry's health. 
He had rheumatoid arthritis and it was really hard on him living in Liberty
so they had moved to Mesa for the warm weather.  They invited us to come down -
so we took Mom so she could visit her brother, Uncle Van and his wife, Aunt
Allison, who were living there while Uncle Van was going to Arizona University
in Tempe to get his doctor's degree in business.   Mom said she would pay for
half the gas since she was going with us.  That really helped with our
finances.  We really enjoyed the vacation.  We went in March I believe, which
is the best time in Arizona.  The orange blossoms are out and it is beautiful
with the flowers, warm weather, etc.  We stopped at Hoover Dam on the way down
&amp; other places.  Larry &amp; Tammy were happy to have us there as we had
missed each other, and the children were really happy to be together as they
had played together so much and were good friends.  Lori &amp; Sandi were the
same age, Holly was a few months older than Shellie, Lonnie was a little older
than Mike and David &amp; Jody were the same age.  In fact, they were born on
the same day.  Tammy was due a month later than I was and she had made the
comment that I should go 2 weeks over and she should come 2 weeks early and we
could be together in the hospital.  I told her that it would be great for her,
but I didn't want to go two weeks over my due date.  Well, it turned out that I
did go over two weeks and the doctor finally scheduled me to go in on the 12th
of September and he would start me.  The night of the 11th, Tammy called me and
said &quot;well, Mae, I'm on my way to the hospital.  The pains are 5 minutes
apart - so I'll save you a bed right next to me&quot;.  We had a friend in the
ward who was a nurse at the McKay hospital and after Tammy had Jody and was in
the ward.  She asked this friend if she could save the bed next to her for me
as I was at the hospital now.  She said &quot;sure, that would be great&quot;. 
It was great.  Tammy &amp; I had a wonderful time being together with our new
babies for four days.  It was funny, thought because she was sure she was going
to have a boy and I was sure I was going to have a girl, and we each had just
the opposite.  They were both beautiful babies and have been special children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Anyway, back to the vacation.  Larry had a
friend and neighbor, <b>Ron Shumway</b>, who was the <b>data </b><img

hspace=12 alt=P1190651><b>processing manager at Hughes Air West Airlines</b>.  They
called it the “The Yellow Banana”.  Larry introduced Ken to Ron after church
and told Ron about Ken.  Ron needed to hire another programmer so was
interested and had Ken go in to his office for an interview.  He gave Ken some
Cobalt (new programming language) books to study and then would fly him down to
test him on it later.  That happened and Ron offered Ken the job.  We were
excited as it was a big raise - a lot more than he would have made at Browning
Arms even if they had given him the raise.  We were sad to leave our parents,
brothers &amp; sisters and their families, however and so Ken approached his
boss at Browning Arms to tell him of the offer.  He asked Ken how much he would
have to have in order for him to keep him at Browning Arms.  Ken quoted a
figure and it was less than he had been offered by Ron.  His supervisor said
&quot;keep working, I need you here, I'll go approach the big boss.  He came
back after a couple of hours and said &quot;Ken, you're crazy if you don't
accept that offer.  They say the freeze is still on and won't let me give you
the raise&quot;.  So, Ken quit.  Ron wanted Ken to start as soon as possible so
he did.  Because he was working for the airlines, Ron told him he could fly
home Friday after work and fly back Sunday night.  He stayed with Larry &amp;
Tammy for three months as I hated to take Sandi out of school and have her start
in a new school just 3 months before school was out.  Anyway, it gave me time
to sort through everything and get packed and with Ken coming home every
weekend, it wasn't so bad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Delvin and Dalean Reed had moved so I carried on
the Young Married program alone.  (I still held this position as well as
Spiritual Living Teacher) RaNae<b> Barney</b> offered to help me as she also
loved this program and hoped to activate her husband through this program. 
RaNae really has a different personality.  She says what she thinks and throws
digs at people, and many people are offended, but she doesn’t mean it that way
and doesn’t mean to hurt people.  In fact, if she thinks she has offended
someone she worries and really lets it upset her.  She was also really sensitive
so you had to watch what you said to her as she might take it the wrong way. 
We <img width=178 height=134

hspace=12 alt="DSC03318 (2)">got to be good friends working closely together,
and she went out of her way to do things for me.  I really appreciated her
friendship.  When we moved to come down to Arizona<b>, the Young Marrieds gave
Ken and I a beautiful cake (it looked like a wedding cake, it had two little
kissing cupids on top) which Beverly McMillan had made</b>.  She was the Junior
Sunday School Coordinator, a wonderful sister and a cake decorator.  They also
gave me a beautiful orchard for me to wear for “Mother’s Day” which was the
next day.  They had a sign by the cake which read - “You are our angels sent
from Heaven above.”  RaNae and Shirley Murdock were largely responsible for
this, collecting money, making arrangements, etc.  RaNae gave a beautiful
speech about us, it was really a surprise and a thrill.  The Bishopric and
clerks gave a party for us also and gave us a beautiful electric living room
clock.</p>
