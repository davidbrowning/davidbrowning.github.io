<p class=MsoNormal>            I love the Holiday season, and one of the great
things I love about it is hearing from our friends and loved ones.  Some send
photo cards, and Ken and I love these to see how their families have grown. 
Some send letters and we love these so we can hear what they and their families
have been doing during the past year, and some send Christmas cards, and we
also love these as we know that they are thinking of us and sending their love
and good wishes.   Because we love to receive them, we like to send them as we
love and appreciate all of them very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I enjoyed our mission to California at
South Valley Farms.  We received permission to return home the end of February,
which was a week early, so we could be with our grandson, <b>David Michael, as
he was set apart for his mission to Africa </b>and also be with our family as
David spoke in their Sacrament Meeting prior to leaving the following
Wednesday.  We stayed with Mike &amp; Becky &amp; their family until David
left.  It was great to be home with our family again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Some of the other highlights of this year are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

     step grandson.   Sandi &amp; Nick live close to Sandi’s daughters &amp;
     their families in Tooele County. </li>

alt="2008-03-05 017"><b>For Ken’s birthday, we again went snowmobiling at Trail
Canyon Lodge with Sandi &amp; Nick.  It’s a fun tradition</b>.  We couldn’t go
last year as we were on our California Mission.  I think it was this year that
Ken decided to head up a steep mountain.  I wouldn’t ride behind him, but he
didn’t want me to anyway.  Neither Sandi nor Nick wanted to go either and Ken
shouldn’t have as it was too steep and the snowmobile couldn’t make it and
rolled over on top on him.  We were at the bottom and when we all saw that, we
panicked and Sandi ran up the mountain to her dad as fast as she could. Boy, I
couldn’t believe how fast she got up there. I ran after her, but it was so
steep and slick that I was having a really hard time getting to Ken.  Both
Sandi &amp; I were trying to pull it back off him, but it was too heavy and Ken
said not to.  Nick was trying to get to us, but really having a hard time and
we yelled for him to hurry.  When he got there, Ken told us to roll the
snowmobile forward off him.  We were worried about crushing him, but we did and
Nick grabbed hold of the handlebars as it turned right side up, and flew down
the mountain holding on to it and was able to guide it down safely.  Ken was
alright, thank goodness, as he had his helmet on and that protected his head,
but he said he was having a hard time breathing and was thankful we were able
to get it off him as soon as we did.  He agreed that that was a foolish thing
to do and he promised us he wouldn’t do anything like that again.</p>

and I were with them most of this time except we stayed longer at Lava Hot
Springs as Scott, Mishelle &amp; family and Jeff, Gail &amp; family were coming
up and we wanted to spend time with them also.  Scott &amp; Mishelle &amp;
family were there when Shellie, Roy &amp; sons and Sandi &amp; Dawson were
there so we all went rafting down the river a few times.  It was fun.  We also
went to the mineral hot pools in Lava for one evening and we all enjoyed that. 
Jeff &amp; Gail came the next day after Shellie &amp; family and Sandi &amp;
Dawson had left.  We all enjoyed being together.  We ate together, played
games, visited and played on the teeter totters which were in the campsites.
After Scott, Jeff and families left to go home,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and I drove on up to Cody
Wyoming to join up with our daughters and families.  Roy’s parent’s, Veldon
&amp; Patsy, were on a mission there so we stayed with them and spent the
following day with them showing us around Cody.  We went to the church, where
they serve, as it is also a museum and they took us on a tour of it.  They then
took us to the Buffalo Bill Cody museum and it was a fun place.  They even had
lots of guns and other memorabilia from Jonathon and John Browning.  They had a
Wild West show enactment on the streets in the evening.  It was ok, but we saw
much better ones at Old Tucson, Arizona when we went there, while living in
Arizona. </p>

alt=P1040251>            The next day we left Veldon &amp; Patsy and drove on
to Jackson Wyoming and spent the night there in a great motel.  We all ate
dinner at a cute café and then Ken and the boys went back to the motel and went
swimming and in the hot tub.  Ken’s feet were hurting so he didn’t feel like
walking longer, but Shellie, Roy, Sandi and I walked down town and into the
shops.  Sandi, Shellie &amp; I bought a T shirt and we had fun being together. 
The next morning, we ate at a nice café and had a good breakfast, then went on
our way to<b> Flaming Gorge</b>.  We set up camp and then let everyone take our
boat and go boating while Ken and I fixed a Dutch Oven Dinner for all of us. 
They didn’t stay very long as it started to rain.  We enjoyed visiting and
singing around the campfire that night.</p>

to go on their way to Durango Colorado where they spent another couple of
days.  Then they separated, and Sandi and Dawson left them and came back home
and Shellie, Roy and boys went on to their home in Arizona.  Ken and I wanted
to stay longer at Flaming Gorge, so we enjoyed camping there for a couple more
days.   Ken caught fish in the stream by where we camped, and we took the boat
and went fishing in the Gorge.  We had a great time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Another vacation was going to
Zion’s National Park again this year with Jeff, Gail &amp; kids,</b> we went in
September instead of October and it was way hot.  We had to go on the trails
during the morning hours and then play in the river in the afternoons.  We were
glad we had the river close by.   One of the things I remember about this trip
was when all of us hiked up the mountain trail on the other side of the tunnel,
we met three oriental men.  Don’t know if they were from Japan or china.  They
had expensive cameras and were taking pictures of all the landscape.  When we
arrived on top, they asked if they could take a picture of us.  We agreed, but
they wanted more and more pictures.  This made us a little nervous.  We finally
said we had to head back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We didn’t go to Zion’s in 2012 as Jeff started a new job and
didn’t have vacation time yet. </p>
