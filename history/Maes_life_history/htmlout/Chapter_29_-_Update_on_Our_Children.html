hspace=12 alt=P1190690.JPG>            <b>Sandi and Shellie</b> were good
friends growing up.  Sandi was a good big sister to Shellie, Mike &amp; David. 
She would make things for them to play with, she would play school with them,
Barbies with them - Mike &amp; David thought this was great fun at times also. 
They thought Sandi was great.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The main problems Sandi &amp; Shellie had was
when Sandi got to be a teenager and wanted to be with her friends more. 
Shellie would tease Sandi - wanting attention, and Sandi would get out of
patience and they would start fighting.  Shellie was very stubborn and wouldn't
give up even though she was getting the worse of it since her big sister was 5
½ years older than her.  I would come in and break it up, but before I got out
the door, Shellie would be back to fighting as she wouldn't give up.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Sandi got married at the age of 17, Shellie
was devastated.  She only had one sister and now that sister was leaving her. 
She disliked Dave for taking her sister away from her.  I didn't realize how
hard it was on Shellie until years later.  Sandi didn't either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=214 height=285
src="Chapter_29_-_Update_on_Our_Children_files/image003.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=P1190617.JPG>            <b>Shellie</b> was content as a child. 
If she had cousins, friends or her brothers or sister to play with, it was fine
and she had a good time, but she was also happy playing by herself.  When she
was between the ages of 2 and 4 years old, we lived in Clearfield.  The stairs
going down into the basement were by the back door of the kitchen.  Shellie
would play on the stairs with her toys for hours while I worked in the kitchen
cleaning or preparing meals.  She was that way as she continued through youth
and adolescence.  She loved to put puzzles together and read.  She read about
every Jack Wayland, Blain &amp; Brenton Yorgenson &amp; Gerald Lund
book there was.  (They are &quot;good&quot; books).  If I needed Shellie and
couldn't find her, I would go to her room and she was usually there reading or
putting puzzles together.  She also loved to listen to good music or play the
piano.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I've talked about Shellie being stubborn - or strong
willed.  Ken &amp; I were concerned that we might have problems with her when
she became a teenager - but we didn't have to worry.  She had gained a
testimony of the gospel and was very strong in choosing right from wrong.  She
has said many times since, that she always felt like she had to pull her
friends along and keep urging them to do the things they should be doing.  I
remember when she was in High School in Grantsville that some boys would go
behind the girls and pinch them.  It only happened once to Shellie.  Mike told
us that Shellie whirled around and smacked the kid so hard that he fell against
the lockers and hit his head.  He, nor any other boy, ever tried pinching her
again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=205 height=274
src="Chapter_29_-_Update_on_Our_Children_files/image004.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=P1190523.JPG>             A boy, who had a crush on her, wanted
to take her to a school dance, but she wouldn't turn 16 for a couple of weeks. 
Shellie &amp; I were in the car and he came over and asked me if Shellie could
go with him to this dance.  I told him that Shellie wasn't 16 yet.  Some girls
would have been upset that their Mom wouldn't let them go when their birthday
was that close, but not Shellie.  She told me that she would have been upset
with me if I had told him she could, even though she liked the boy and would
have liked to have gone had she been 16.  I was very proud of her then and I
always have been. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another boy wanted to date her, but she wouldn't
consider going out with him because he would go on &quot;beer parties&quot;,
etc.    He told her one day that she didn't have any fun - that she wouldn't go
to parties and drink or smoke, that she wouldn't &quot;make out&quot; with guys
and that she wouldn't even watch &quot;R&quot; rated movies.  She said &quot;I
have more fun than you do and I don't have to wake up with a hangover the next
morning.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Shellie became a flag twirler for the band and
Mike and David were in the band also.  Mike and David both played the trumpet,
but later the band teacher asked Mike if he would play the sousaphone.  They
had a great band teacher.  I was talking with him one day and he told me that
as youth are involved in both music and sports, it helps them academy.  They
get better grades, that is if they take time to study also. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Shellie also tried out and became a cheer
leader.  I loved to go to the Grantsville games and watch her cheer.  She was
very good at it.  When she had talked to me about wanting to try out to become
a cheer leader, I told her that many girls, when they became cheer leaders, the
popularity  went to their heads and they thought they were better than the
other girls and didn’t treat them good.  I told her that if she did become a
cheer leader, I would support her, but I didn’t want that to happen to her.  I
told her she was a wonderful, beautiful girl, but that Heavenly Father loves
all his children, and she is to treat them that way.  She promised she would,
and she did.  I was proud of her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It has been fun going to the children's games,
activities, plays, recitals, etc. throughout the years.  Even though it took a
lot of my time to go to these events, I loved every minute of it.  I feel sorry
for parents who don't support their children in the things they do, they hurt
their children, but they hurt themselves as well - by missing out on all the
joy and happiness it brings and the closeness to their children.</p>

alt="Children singing for family home evening while Sandi played the panio - in Erda">            <b>Sandi</b>
took <b>tap dancing lessons</b> for four years (ages 4-8) when we lived in Ogden. 
Our neighbor, Pat Wiggins, was the teacher. <b>We started Sandi on the</b> <b>piano</b>
soon after, and found she really had a talent for music.  She took longer than
the other children because she enjoyed it and practiced without being told to. 
We put her with an advanced teacher when we lived in Sunset and she did really
well.  From the time she was 12 years old, she has been a Pianist or organist
for most organizations.  Sunday School, MIA, Primary and for Sacrament
Meeting.  When we lived in Erda, Connie King was over the Tooele County Beauty
Pageant and had Sandi play for it.  After she was married, Dave's grandmother
was the organist and had Sandi substitute for her several times.  She was also
the pianist for Relief Society in her ward.  I always enjoyed hearing Sandi
practice the piano.  She also played for us, as a family, while we sang at
Family Home Evenings, Family Christmas parties, etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            With her <b>talent of art,</b> she painted
scenery for road shows in MIA, made posters, etc., for other organizations. 
Both her and I felt they took advantage of her good nature many times - because
people would ask her at the last minute to do art projects for them, and hardly
say &quot;thank you&quot; afterwards.  I was proud of her for willingly giving
of her time and talents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sandi has many talents.  She won dance contests
in school. After her girls started taking dance lessons, their instructor asked
Sandi to help her teach.  She did, and eventually took over the dance school. 
She further developed her talent in dancing by making up dance steps &amp;
routines to teach her students, designing and sewing dance costumes, putting on
dance recitals and accepting invitations for her and her classes to dance at
church, community &amp; other functions.  She was very successful as a dance
teacher and later on, JaNae, her oldest daughter, taught also.  </p>

hspace=12 alt=P1190959>            Dave encouraged her to take oil painting
lessons, which she did.  She paints beautiful scenery and animal pictures.  She
has won awards at fairs.  She has given each of her brothers &amp; sister a
beautiful oil painting for their weddings.  She has given Ken &amp; I several
and we love them.  She has painted on canvas, saw blades, cupboard doors, etc. 
Friends and others have asked her to paint pictures for them or to give as
gifts, so she has sold several paintings.  I loved to go to her home in
Grantsville during the different holidays because she usually had painted a
cartoon holiday scene on her front window.  A restaurant owner in Grantsville
asked her to paint a &quot;50's&quot; mural on his walls and he would pay her. 
She did and it was really cute.  She painted a girl with pony tail, full felt
skirt complete with &quot;poodle&quot;, bobby socks &amp; penny loafer shoes
sitting at a counter sipping a drink through straws which her and her boy
friend shared.  She painted a jute box, etc.  She has painted a beautiful
landscape picture for Ken &amp; I. (This is the picture).   She also painted
pictures for her grandparents, and her brother’s &amp; sister as they get
married.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            She also did a beautiful cross-stitch of a deer
jumping over a log.  She made it for her dad for Father's Day.  She had told
Dave she would make him one also, but it took so long - that this one was all
she made.</p>

hspace=12 alt="Brothers, Mike &amp; David having fun playing2.jpg">            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Mike and David</b> were different
personalities, but, for the most part, they were &quot;best friends&quot;. 
Mike took more after the Browning’s and was stockier like his dad &amp; grandpa
Browning.  David was thinner and took after the Porters.  Mike is red headed
and David, Brunette.  Mike was soft hearted and just a cross word from us, when
he was little, would bring him to tears. But, not David, even when David was
being spanked, he wouldn't cry, even though it hurt.  David was more stubborn
and more daring than Mike, and so it was interesting to watch them together.  Since
David would dive off the high diving board when very young, Mike didn't want to
be outdone by his little brother - so he would do it also even though he
probably would rather not have done it.  David would climb the highest trees,
walk fences, go cave exploring and hiking, etc., and Mike would follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike was more cunning than David, however, as he
would think of things to do that were sometimes dangerous - like making a bomb
at the farm in Grantsville and then telling David to light it.  Mike would run
and hide.  David did light the makeshift bomb and was blown against the shed
with his eye brows and eye lashes burned.  It was a wonder that he wasn't hurt
more seriously.  The shed was shaking and Mike saw us coming up the road - so
he said to David &quot;Here comes Dad &amp; Mom, help me hold the shed and try
to stop it from shaking&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In Grantsville, they made a tote goat together
from a lawn mower motor Mike &amp; David bought from Mike's friend, Larry. 
They had a ball with this tote goat.  I even had a few rides on it.  They built
a tree house together down the lane from our home in Grantsville.  They built a
&quot;hut&quot; on the farm.  I can't remember if it was a one story or two
story.  It seems like it was a two story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike &amp; David had their share of fighting - like
all brothers do.  When they would wrestle, it was fun to watch because first
Mike would be on top, as he was the biggest, but then David would be on top
because he was the fastest and because he was stubborn, he wouldn't give up, so
it was usually a tie - both getting so tired that they would both give up. 
However, sometimes, it turned out to be a fight and they would both be so angry
that Ken or I would have to break them up.  I didn’t like to see that happen.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember soon after we moved to Grantsville,
taking Mike &amp; David to school and telling them we would pick them up after
school.  When we drove up, we saw a bigger, older boy beating on Mike.  I was
upset and ready to open the car door and run over to help Mike, but Ken saw
David coming out the school door and seeing what was going on with his
brother.  Ken stopped me and said &quot;watch David&quot;.  I did and David's
eyes got wild like a tiger’s and he ran as fast as he could over to the boy and
jumped on his back, kicking and clawing at him like a wildcat.  The older boy
didn't know what had happened to him, but as soon as he could get David off his
back, he ran for home.  It was neat to watch that.  Maybe David could fight
with Mike, but no one else better as he would defend his brother - like no one
I've seen before would, and Mike would do the same for David.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike had a temper and would sometimes have
temper tantrums.  When we lived in Arizona the first time and lived in our
first home, he was about 3 or 4.  When he would start yelling and screaming, I
would put him in his room and tell him he needed to stay there until he could
calm down.  He would scream even louder and kick the door.  I was afraid the
neighbors would think I was beating him.  I remember one time I was telling him
that Heavenly Father would be disappointed in the way he was acting and that he
was making Satan happy.  He yelled “I don’t care, I want to make Satan happy.” 
When we moved over into our newer home a couple of blocks away, I was in the
primary presidency and we were having our presidency meeting at my home.  Mike
had gotten himself in trouble and I had him sitting on a chair when they came. 
After a while one of the ladies said “How come your son is sitting so long and
so quietly on that chair, is he being disciplined?   I said “yes”.  She said
“How do you get him to sit there without trying to get off, my children won’t
do that.”  I said “He knows if he gets off, he will be in more trouble so he
knows he can’t get off until I say he can.”  Soon, I went over to Mike and talked
to him and we hugged and he got off and went off to play.  That was one of the
main ways I disciplined the children when they were young.  When Mike &amp;
David were about 9 &amp; 10, they were fighting so I had one sitting on the
couch and the other in the big stuffed chair.  I went in the kitchen to fix
supper and I heard them laughing.  I went in to see what they were doing, and
they were both mostly off their seats and were trying to touch each other with
their feet and still have part of their bodies on the seats.  I scolded them
and made them sit up again.  Wow! They were a challenge sometimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=245 height=327
src="Chapter_29_-_Update_on_Our_Children_files/image008.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=P1190695.JPG>            I also counted to 5 when the children
didn’t quickly obey.  They knew they better be moving by the time I reached 5. 
They jokingly tell me now that as I got close to 5 and they were not moving,
that I would say 3 ½, 4, 4 ½ , etc.  I DON’T THINK SO!  Another thing I tried
was pinching them on the shoulder blades.  I had read in a book (I read a lot
of parenting books) that if children don’t obey when you ask them once, don’t
ask or tell them again, just go to them and pinch in a certain spot (which they
showed) and it brings pain, but no damage to them.  They didn’t like that and I
don’t think I used it very often.  I also tried many positive methods – they
could put marbles in their jar when they did something good for someone else or
obeyed quickly, etc.  We had different reward systems.  What works for one
child doesn’t always work for another, so it was a challenge, but they were
basically good kids and I loved them and usually always enjoyed being with
them.  Some mothers would be so happy when the summer was over and the children
had to go back to school, but I was sad as I enjoyed having my children at home
with me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mike and Shellie didn’t get along.  They would argue and
sometimes end up fighting.  Sometimes Shellie would hear Mike &amp; David
teasing Scott and would come out to defend Scott and she says they all would
turn on her, including Scott.  One time Ken came in and the boys were hitting
and punching Shellie.  Ken was really angry because boys are not to hit girls,
even if it’s their sister, so he took the boys out to the shed and gave them a
licking.  Mike cried out, but David was not going to let his dad know it hurt
it, so he wouldn’t yell or cry out.  I wasn’t there, but that’s the story I
got.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mike and Shellie still don’t agree on everything and they
don’t enjoy each other, like I wish they did.  They have raised some of their
children, and still have some at home.  I guess they tolerate each other when
they are together and they can still talk and have fun, but I guess it’s good
that they don’t live close together.  I think the feeling is mutual between the
two of them.  They are both wonderful children, so I wish they could get over
it and look for the good in each other and love each other as they should. 
Maybe some day.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Mike would get upset with Ken or I, he
would say <b>“I’m going to run away”.</b>   When he was a little guy and we
lived in Arizona, we didn’t have a fence and there was a big field behind our
back yard.  About halfway in that field, they had a big tall sign. When Mike
wanted to run away, I would say to him:  “You can run as far as that sign, but
you can’t go any further.”  You can stay as long as you want and then come back
home.  He would run as fast as his little legs could carry him down to that
sign.  He would stand by that sign for a few minutes to cool off and then come
trudging back home.  He had learned to obey, so I was able to trust him as
there was a busy road on both the south and especially the west sides of that
field.  I would have been worried if he wouldn’t have stayed there.  If he had
disobeyed, I wouldn’t have let him go there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we lived in Grantsville, he again would get
mad as he felt we always blamed him when there were problems or him and the
other children were fighting.  He is such a good kid, but he was a tease and he
usually did start it.  He would want to run away again.  I told him he could go
as far as the corrals, which were at the north end of our property, so probably
a third or half mile away.  I was thankful he was obedient then also.  When we
lived in Firth, Idaho, I only remember him running away once.  He was 16 &amp;
17 when we lived there.  I realized he had gotten mad and had taken off through
the back of our property.  I was worried about him as I didn’t know where he
would go so I took off after him.  I met up with him and we talked and worked
it out as we walked back home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike has always loved “toys” and sometimes he
would talk David into going in with him to buy something “neat”.  It’s fun to
see the two different personalities, and yet to see how close they have been
throughout the years.  I guess that’s true of mine and Ken’s moms.  They are so
different in every way except for their love for their children and the Lord. 
And, yet, Ken and I are really compatible.  </p>

hspace=12 alt=P1120805>We have enjoyed our little <b>Scott.</b>  He was such a
cute little guy and very good natured.  He was his father’s shadow in Erda. 
The other kids were in school and Scott loved to be with his dad so Ken would
take him about everywhere that he could.  He would take him with him to Salt
Lake when they went for parts and they would stop for ice cream on the way
back.  One time when they went to the John Deer place for parts for Ken’s
tractor, they had a small tractor that children could ride.  Scott got on in
and loved it.  Ken wished he could afford to buy it for him – but he couldn’t. 
The man looked at Scott and said “I bet your dad calls you Scotty Skaboo.” 
Scott was so surprised and asked Ken when they got in the truck to go home “How
did he know that you call me that?”  Ken also took Scott with him when he used
the tractor to disk, plow, bail hay, etc., as it was a beautiful closed in cab
with air conditioning, etc.  Scott would ask his dad to tell him stories and he
would tell him the stories of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears”, “Three Little
Pigs”, “Red Riding Hood”, etc.  Ken would, on purpose, tell them differently
some times, and Scott would say “Dad, it doesn’t go like that” and Ken would
laugh and ask him how it went.  Scott would follow Ken as he went to feed the
animals, etc.</p>

hspace=12 alt=P1190657.JPG>            In October of 1975, Scott got the
Rubella measles.  From that time on, he has been sick with one thing or
another.  He got the red measles and mumps, ear infection, tonsillitis and
every flu or virus that came along.  Finally, in May, we took him to an eye,
nose and throat specialist.  We had taken him to a children’s doctor, but they
just kept giving me prescriptions for him.  We knew his tonsils were infected
because when we’d look into his throat, they were so swollen and his breathing
was irregular.  When I took him into the specialist, he said both his tonsils
and adenoids needed to come out.  They also took a test on his ears and found
fluid in both ears and a 20 to 30 percent hearing lost in the right ear and
some in the other, so tubes would also be needed.  That was the reason he had
never slept through the night.  All our other children, when they got a few
months old, began to sleep through the night, but Scott never did.  He would
wake up crying.  Neither he nor I had gotten a good night’s sleep since he was
born.  Ken also was up with him many times.  With the fluid in his ears, when
he would lie down and go to sleep, the pressure would build up and hurt his
ears and he would wake up.  He woke up several times most nights.  He was
operated on the 28<sup>th</sup> of May in the Primary Children’s Hospital. 
They found a growth on his throat behind his tonsils that was 1½ inches long
and as big around as a man’s thumb.  Dr. Zobell had him put in intensive care
because of precautionary measures - swelling might occur and infection could
set in easily.  That was quite an ordeal for Scott.  (Also, me) They tied him
down (his hands and feet to the bed) because they had an IV in his arm to feed
him through the veins.  They also had the heart machine on him and he was in a
mist tent.  He was terrified, but they gave him shots to keep him asleep most
of the time.  One thing which really helped him was that he had become attached
to a “kittie pillow”.   Sandy and Shellie had become attached to a blanket, but
I had made Scott a pillow.  The material was a cat.  He loved this pillow and
slept with it and carried it around some times.  He always wanted to take it
with him when we went somewhere.  It was like a security blanket for him.  I
made him a new one before he went to the hospital because the other one was
about gone.  They did let us have that pillow in his bed with him in intensive
care.  I guess because it was new.  I’m sure they wouldn’t have let him have
the old worn out one.  I was thankful for that, but it was so hard not to be
able to hold him and rock him.  I stayed with him during the two days and Ken
stayed with him during the nights.  We brought him home and he recovered
quickly.  </p>

hspace=12 alt=P1190511.JPG>I had <span style='font-size:14.0pt'>“<b>Their day”</b></span>
for each of the children where I would spend at least an hour or more with them
on a one-on-one doing what they wanted to do.  With my sons, sometimes I would
play marbles, or go insect exploring, bike riding, going to get an ice cream,
etc.  With the girls, I would play barbies, go bike riding, go for ice cream,
etc.  I enjoyed these times as much as the children did.  It was relaxing and I
could enjoy that child and we could visit and have fun together.  I wanted them
to know how much I loved them and that they were special.  I would work it out
so the others were playing together or one of them tending the younger ones
while I was with another.  I got this idea from a lady in the Mt Fort Ward
during Relief Society.  She was doing it with her children and they loved it,
so I wanted to incorporate it into our children’s lives. (I don’t know why
Sandi was not in this picture.  She must have been with her friends or to an
activity.)</p>
