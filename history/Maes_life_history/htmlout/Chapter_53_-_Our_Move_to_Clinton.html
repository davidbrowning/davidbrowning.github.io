alt="2009-06-21 172">While we were on our mission, Scott graduated from college
and got a good job so he and Mishelle wanted to buy a home.  We wanted to sell
our home so we could build up on our property in Star Valley, Wyoming so we
asked them if they would like to buy our home.  They said they couldn’t afford
it.  We asked how much they felt they could pay for a home and when they told
us, we lowered our price to that amount - $25,000 less than we had asked before
when putting it up for sale.  Ken figured it out and knew we would be getting
$50,000 from our equity if we sold it to Scott &amp; Mishelle and he felt that
would be enough to purchase the lumber, cement and other building materials to
build our home in Star Valley and we wanted to help them out and wanted to keep
this home in our family, so we did sell it to them.  We had given Mike our
power of attorney so he was able to sign the papers for us.  He was concerned
about us dropping the price that low, but did what we asked him to do.  To our
surprise, the cost of lumber, cement and the other building materials had gone
up three times while we were on our mission and now that we were home, Ken
realized that we couldn’t build our home for the $50,000.  He still wanted to
build it, but we would have had to get a loan and either one or both of us
would have had to go to work to pay the loan off.   I had felt good about us
building in Star Valley before the mission.  I knew that David &amp; Shauna
lived in Idaho Falls so just a half hour or so away from us and with Sandi
&amp; Terry having their cabin there, there would be family around for us to be
with, but while we were away on our mission, David &amp; Shauna moved to Utah. 
They had wanted to be closer to family and David was able to be transferred
down here.  They bought a home in Enterprise, which is close to Morgan.  The
couple, who had purchased the cabin with Sandi &amp; Terry, built them a big
new home so couldn’t afford their share of the cabin so backed out.  Sandi
&amp; Terry didn’t feel they could afford the cabin by themselves so asked our
family and other friends if any wanted to go in on it with them.  None did, so
they ended up selling their cabin, much to Sandi’s sorrow as she loved that
cabin and had furnished and decorated it so beautifully.  Her &amp; Terry, or
her and her daughters, or just her alone sometimes went there and enjoyed it. 
They invited Ken and I to go with them sometimes, and we loved being with them
and loved the cabin and area also.  My Uncle June and his 2<sup>nd</sup> wife,
Banita, lived in an adjoining town so Sandi would always stop and visit them
while she was there.  She and Uncle “George” became really close.  (He was
named after his father, so was given the name of George Jr.  All the family
called him “June” (for Jr.) so they didn’t get confused with the two Georges. 
Uncle June loved Sandi and looked forward to her visits, so did Banita.  Ken
and I visited them also when we were there.  When we realized that we would be
alone up in Star Valley as Uncle June wasn’t there either, as he had passed
away and Banita moved back to Utah to be close to her daughters, I wasn’t as
anxious to build up on our property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> Ken and I drove up there and I
prayed there among the trees and I didn’t have the good feeling that I had had
before.  I thought of the cold, hard winters and that if Ken got sick during a
winter and had to go to the hospital, which was several miles away in another
town, I would be really nervous driving on those icy roads and I would be
nervous being there without our family to help us.  I have always wanted to be
close to my family so I could go to our grandchildren’s ball games, recitals
and other special events and I wanted to be close so I could invite them for
Sunday dinners and spend the holidays with them.  If we lived here in Star
Valley, that wouldn’t be the case as it is four hours away from most of them
and five hours away from Sandi, Terry &amp; their family and Mike, Becky &amp;
their family, and it would put another four hours on our already twelve hours
to Shellie &amp; Roy’s home.  I know why I had the good feeling before, but
didn’t now.  It was because it was such a good investment.  <b>We bought the
land for $10,000 and we sold it for $60,000.  If we hadn’t sold it at that
time, the economy went bad and the land dropped way down in value.  The Lord
blessed us as He knew we would need the money to live on.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bob &amp; Carroll had enjoyed having us live in
the basement apartment with Mom.  They didn’t want anyone else to live here,
but they invited us to do so.  Bob said “Your furniture is already here, why
not move back in, and you can share the utilities and other expenses with us.” 
I felt that was our answer.  Ken wasn’t too happy about that as it had always
been his dream to build his own home and he had already drawn up the plans for
our home.  I loved the plans too and I know it would have been a beautiful
home, but I was worried that since Ken would have to get a job, (me too
probably) that it would be too hard on him to work and then come back and work
on our home, and work all day on Saturdays.  It was the same fear I had when he
wanted to build our home, while he was working, when we bought our home in Layton. 
It was really hard on his health when he built this basement apartment for
their mother.  When he had built this apartment, I loved it and said “I could
retire in this apartment”, but at that time, I never thought I would be doing
it and now we were.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We love the ward, there are several
couples around our age, who love the gospel and have gone on missions too.  Two
of the couples are our neighbors here on 1300 N.  We have all ages in our ward,
which makes it a great ward.  Ken was again called into the High Priest Group
Leadership.  He was first assistant to Morgan Thomas, who is the Group Leader. 
Charles Saunders is the second counselor.  Charles and Carolyn and Ken and I
love to play games so we try to take turns getting together at each other’s home
once a month.  We have invited our back-yard neighbors, Marilyn and Kelly
Bodily to join with us as they love to play games also.  Their daughter, Jill,
who we love and her husband came over one night and we had fun playing games
with them.  They were living with Marilyn and Kelly at the time, but have since
moved to their own apartment.  They now have a cute baby daughter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Our Bishop, Steve Smith, called
both Ken and I to be Family History Consultants.  We were excited, especially
me as I love Family History.  There was so much to learn.  We took classes at
the Ogden Family History Center, we volunteered to serve at the Clearfield
Family History Center and was trained there.  We served each Tuesday evening
from 6 to 9 pm.  We enjoyed the others who served there and we learned a lot as
we helped others register and find ancestors.  They also called Marie McEntire,
a single lady in her 50s as a F.H. Consultant, so Marie and I met with several
sisters in our ward, at their homes, to help them and teach them about Family
History.  Ken and I were asked to teach the Young Women in our ward, during
their mutual night, how to register on FamilySearch.org and also how to do
indexing.  That was an enjoyable evening.  We were also asked to show the
Priesthood/Relief Society at one of our 5<sup>th</sup> Sunday meetings, how to
do family history and indexing.  We used our Power Point Projector. We didn’t
have enough time to show them all that we hoped to.  Marie, Ken and I were
asked to take the Laurel and Priest representatives from our ward to the Family
History Center in Ogden and there help them learn about Family History.  All
the wards in our stake were there and did this.  We did this one week and the 2<sup>nd</sup>
week, we taught them at our ward building.  Marie, Ken and I taught several
Family History classes during Sunday School.  As we were about to teach another
class, our bishop asked that instead of teaching a class, we just open up the
doors to the computer room and let whoever wanted to come during Sunday School,
to come meet with us and we could help them on an individual basis.  This was a
good idea, and some did come, but after a while the Ward Mission Leader asked
the Bishop if they could use our room to teach their investigator class/Gospel
Essentials.  This was granted so we didn’t do Family History again on Sundays. 
We were disappointed that this class couldn’t find another room.  They could
have, but they wanted our large room.  Ken and I attended several Family
History conferences at different stake centers and also at the ?? in Salt Lake
City</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>.  I kept taking online classes
and watching F.H. videos for Family History Consultants on FamilySearch.Org.</b> 
<u>I also spent time trying to find more of my ancestors who needed their work
done.  I was able to find a couple, but that was all.  Ken and I went to the
Bountiful Temple and had James Harris sealed to his parents and siblings.  That
was a great experience.  We felt the spirit strongly as did the sealer and
others in the room, so we knew he was happy to have this work done for him</u><b>. 
I was also able to get my brother, Hal, sealed to his wife, Jean, and then
their daughter, Cindi’s work done and her sealed to her parents.  We took
Georgia with us and she was proxy for Cindy, Ken was for Hal, and I was for
Jean.  We were thankful to have them sealed together.</b>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>You can add photos and stories of
your ancestors, so I have added many photos and I have gathered many stories. 
We were released from these positions when we went on our mission to
California, but when we returned, the Bishop called us in and asked if we would
again fulfill the positions of Family History Consultants.  I was excited, not
sure if Ken was, as it was harder for him and he had a hard time getting
motivated.  He did some great things, however, getting his cousins involved in
Family History, especially one, whose mother and father had been killed in a
car accident when she and her brother and sister were small.  They were raised
by grandparents and hadn’t been involved with the Hill family relatives that much. 
They also were not close with each other, but this made a difference in their
lives as Ken found a baby brother who they didn’t know about, who died shortly
after birth.  Ken also got interested in doing indexing and spent hours doing
this and really enjoyed it.  He also taught others, especially a widower, who
is a neighbor, Dee Francom.  Dee has really enjoyed it too and since he has
diabetes, and doesn’t get out much except to church and the store, this has
helped fill his time and given him something to do which he feels is important,
which it is.  Ken and I were released this past year (2013) and I were called
to teach the 10-year old’s in primary.  I team teach with a sister who has been
less active, but has determined to start coming regularly and even went to the
temple to take out her endowments.  We have a cute class of mostly girls and
they are attentive and well behaved.  I already had a second calling to serve
on the Relief Society Committee.  These two callings keep me busy.  Ken is
still serving as 1<sup>st</sup> assistant in the High Priest Group Leadership
with Morgan and Charles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have enjoyed our home and have
enjoyed our association with Bob and Carroll.  Bob likes to fix meals and cook,
so he would usually prepare Sunday dinner and when we hadn’t invited our family
members to dinner here or if they hadn’t invited us to their homes, then Bob
would want us to come and eat with them.  Sometimes I would make a salad, and
with our diet, I would make brown rice for us as he would make potatoes for him
and Carroll.  Ken and I enjoy playing Canasta with Bob &amp; Carroll.  It’s
usually the men against the ladies and it’s about a 50/50 tossup on who wins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Mark, Bob &amp; Ken’s cousin,</b>
who had come to help care for his mother, Aunt Vida, stayed on after his mother
died and rented a bedroom from Bob &amp; Carroll as he didn’t want to live in
the basement with Ken’s and Bob’s mother as they didn’t get along.  Ken’s Mom
didn’t want him down here either.  Ken’s mom died prior to us going on our
mission to the Philippines, but Mark stayed on.  I guess Bob &amp; Carroll had
told him that he could stay for a couple of months until he found something
else.  Well, he didn’t have any intention of finding something else, as he
liked it here.  Anyway, he always ate Sunday dinners with us too.  We had a
large garden and Mark was excited about that.  We worked out a deal that he
would mainly take care of the garden (water and weed) and Ken and I, and Bob
&amp; Carroll would pay for the plants, seeds and other expenses and we would help
plant the garden and help harvest it.  That way, Mark could have what he wanted
and needed from the garden, and so could the rest of us.  It worked pretty
well.  But Mark had a different personality.  He felt he was always right and
he was overbearing about it.  I could see why he was married three times and
each time his wife divorced him.  None of his children are close to him
either.  He was a good dentist, but lost his practice and equipment because he
fought the dental association because he had found out that mercury fillings
were dangerous for our health.  He couldn’t win and it ruined him, he lost
everything including his last family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> Mark was taking advantage of Bob
&amp; Carroll by eating their food without asking, by not only using their
washer &amp; dryer, but also using their laundry detergent.  He burned some of
their pans, he would argue with them and spoke cross to Bob a lot of the time. 
Finally, Carroll had had enough and she told Bob, she wanted him out.  She
wanted her privacy and wanted his bedroom for her children to be able to use
when they came to visit as Kathy lives in Texas and Bruce in Arizona.  When
they told him, they wanted him to move out, he was upset and didn’t do anything
about it.  After a while, Bob spoke to him again about it, but he said he
couldn’t afford to move.  Bob gave him some money to put down on an apartment,
but he used it to pay bills, so that upset them more.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Finally, Bob told him that either
he was out by January 1<sup>st</sup> or Bob’s kids would help him move Mark’s
things out on the lawn.  It was a bad scene and he blamed Ken, for some unknown
reason.  It wasn’t Ken’s idea, although we agreed with Bob &amp; Carroll, but
it was them that wanted him out.  He found an apartment (while Ken and I were
visiting Shellie &amp; family in Arizona) and our Bishop and other ward members
helped him move down to Provo in a student cheap apartment.  Don’t know how he
was able to get that.  Maybe he told the landlord that he would be taking
classes at BYU.  Bishop was so amazed at all the junk Mark had and took down
with him.  He said they stacked it in his apartment and there was hardly room
for him to walk to the bedroom and bathroom, and that the cupboards and table
were filled too.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mark’s son and his wife lived in
America Fork so he wanted to live closer to them.  They did invite him for
dinner once in a great while.  He died a few months later.  He was in his late
80s.  The landlady found him dead in his apartment.  We never found out the
cost, but we assume it was a heart attack.  Mark had a gold watch on a gold
chain.  He used this to see whether food or different things were good for
him.  He argued with our Bishop and Stake President over what the church mills
sold and should sell to church members.  He just felt they should stick with
the basis – wheat, rice, powdered milk, etc., but not things like pancake mix,
muffin mix, chocolate milk, etc.  He was a different guy.  He was nice some
times, but difficult at other times.</p>

alt=P1100090><b>While living in Clinton</b>, in the basement apartment of Bob
&amp; Carroll’s home, which Ken built for their mother, we had a hugh back
yard.  When Mark moved to Provo, he didn’t take his volleyball poles, so Ken
put the fittings in the ground so we could just slip the poles into them when
our family would come for <b>family backyard parties and barbecues.</b>  We had
several each summer.  Our children and grandchildren love to play volleyball so
we played that at each family party.  I love to watch them play.  Each family
would bring their own meat and a side dish.  I usually asked Becky if she could
bring her delicious broccoli and bacon salad as I love that and everyone else
does also.  Mishelle makes wonderful rolls, so she would bring rolls at times. 
All our daughters and daughters-in-laws make delicious food.  I usually made a
potato salad and an Acini de pepe salad.  We bought two “Lifetime” picnic
tables, from a neighbor who worked at “Lifetime” in Layton, and we have surely
used them a lot and enjoyed them.  We also bought two smaller picnic tables so
our young grandchildren could sit at them.  Our apartment wasn’t large enough
to have all our family inside at one time, but in the summer, it worked great. 
In the winter, we would invite one or maybe two families at a time for Sunday
dinner or for special occasions.   </p>

alt="Easter Egg Hunt for grandchildren in our back yard">We also had <b>Easter
Egg Hunts</b> each year in our backyard. Those were fun.  I would buy lots of
plastic Easter eggs and put candy in some and money in some.  I would color
lots of boiled eggs also.  Sometimes some of our younger grandchildren would
come and help me color the eggs.  Ken and I would hide the younger
grandchildren’s eggs in the back yard and the older grandchildren’s eggs in the
far back of the property where we had our chicken coop, shed, rabbit pens and
large garden area.  I bought Easter baskets for them at the Dollar Store and
gave them a list of how many money eggs, candy eggs and boiled eggs each of
them could find and keep.  On the signal they would all run around to find
their eggs, it was so fun watching them and seeing the excitement on their
faces.  We would usually start the Easter Egg Hunt about 10 am and then we
would have a barbecue afterward, play volleyball and visit.  Good memories!</p>
