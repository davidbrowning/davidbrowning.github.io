<p class=MsoNormal>            This past year has gone by so quickly, but it
seems like they all do.  When we look at our grandchildren and great
grandchildren and see how they have grown, we wonder how this could happen so
fast.  It seems not that long ago that we were holding our children in our
arms, and then we were holding our grandchildren and now we are holding our
great grandchildren, but it’s great and we have had a wonderful life.  Ken and
I still have relatively good health, so we can enjoy being with our family and
friends.  With living here in the Monte Vista Mobile Home Park, and seeing many
with health problems due to age, disease and disabilities, we feel very blessed
to be able to help ourselves, our family and many of our neighbors and
friends.  We also have several couples our age, who we have become friends with
and enjoy being with them.  We have a great ward here with a special bishop,
who is truly a “Shepherd”.  We are thankful that we live fairly close to most
of our children and we sure enjoy being with them.  We love going to the
grandchildren’s ball games, recitals, and choir &amp; band concerts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This past year has brought us two more great
grandchildren.  Mike &amp; Becky’s son, David, and his wife, Sierra, had a baby
boy, which they named <b>Henry David, born on the 15<sup>th</sup> of May</b>.  
Shellie &amp; Roy’s son, Garrett &amp; and his wife, Nora, had a baby boy,
which they named <b>Damon Bryce, born on the 5<sup>th</sup> of September.</b> 
That gives us 10 great grandchildren.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Jeff &amp; Gail</b> needed to
leave their beautiful home in Layton <b>and move to Kimberly, Idaho</b> a few
months ago because of work.  Kimberly is close to Twin Falls, Idaho.  They have
a lovely home there too on an acre of land.  We won’t see them as often as we
did, but when we go there, we will stay longer.  Jeff is a Controller over
finances in his company.  He works for Chobani in Twin Falls.  Gail is a “stay
at home mom” and loves being home with her cute family, but keeps busy as all
moms do.  Ben is 9, Rachel is 7 &amp; Matt is 6 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Scott &amp; Mishelle</b> love
their nice home &amp; area in West Layton.  They have done a lot of work in
their yard and it is beautiful.  Mishelle knows a lot about plants and flowers
and has helped me with our flower gardens here too.  Scott works for a company
who does custom programming for Hill Air Force Base and he works a couple of
nights a week at the DATC tutoring and helping in their data processing
classes.  Mishelle is a “stay at home” mom, but works hard there to keep her
home &amp; family going smoothly.  Kylan goes to Layton High, Ashley to Legacy
Jr. High, and the twins, who turned 7 in October, enjoy their elementary
school.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>David &amp; Shauna</b> have a
beautiful home in Enterprise, which is close to Morgan.  David is a PA in
Dermatology and works in South Ogden.  He is very good at what he does and
loves helping his patients.  Shauna works part time from home and she is
amazing at how she juggles work, home &amp; family.  Tyler, who is 17 and
Emily, who is 15, go to Morgan High, and Connor, who is 11 goes to their Middle
School.  They are all straight A students, most of our grandchildren are.  We
are proud of all of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> <b>Mike &amp; Becky</b> have a
lovely home in American Fork.  Mike is the principle of Orem High and Becky has
been working at the elementary school so they both keep really busy with
school, home &amp; family.  Their two oldest, David &amp; Paige, are both
married to wonderful spouses and live in Logan where they go to the University
and work.  We were invited to spend a Saturday with the two couples and had a
wonderful time eating, visiting and playing games.  Little Henry wasn’t feeling
the best, but we held &amp; enjoyed him anyway.  Mike &amp; Becky’s two younger
girls, Maddi, who is 14 &amp; Jessie, who is 12 enjoy school, and being in
Young Women’s with all the great activities &amp; classes.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Shellie &amp; Roy</b> moved from
Queen Creek back to Chandler, AZ and have a lovely home on a manmade lake.  Roy
&amp; Shellie did a lot of remodeling on it and it is amazing what they can
do.  Ken &amp; I went down in May and had a wonderful time.  Jase (their
youngest, who is 14) was excited for Grandpa to teach him how to fish.  They
fished from the shore and in the paddle boat and caught a few fish.  We also
enjoyed being with their older sons, Quint &amp; Kevis, and their oldest son,
Garrett &amp; His wife, Nora and their little daughter, Maggie.  Damon wasn’t
born at that time.  Roy is a good provider so Shellie hasn’t had to work
outside the home, but she has always kept really busy.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> <b>Sandi</b> <u>divorced Nick this
year, and she is happier now</u>.  She still lives in her beautiful home in
Tooele and works at Grantsville High as their Registrar.   She is planning to
retire in about 4 years.  She has a cute dog named, Pipper, and they go running
most nights.  She is a leader in the classified association for Tooele
District, so keeps really busy.  JaNae &amp; Her family and Chelci and her
family both live in Grantsville.  JaNae has 3 children and Chelci has 4 and
they are sure growing up fast. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> <b>Chelci sings with a Country
Western Band, named “EXIT NINETY NINE</b>”, and we enjoy going out to listen to
them on various occasions. They are very good</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>August 2015</b>     I want to record another tender mercy
from the Lord.  Irven &amp; Sandy called yesterday to see if Ken &amp; I could
go to Orem with them to hear Rand Paul speak.  Rand Paul is campaigning for the
Republican presidential nominee.  Rand is a good man and is a senator.  He has
worked hard to sponsor &amp; co-sponsor bills to lower our taxes, take power
from the federal government and give back to the states, help us keep our
religious freedom, etc.  His father, Ron Paul, ran four years ago and we were
so impressed with him too.  Ken can't go as he is doing some work for our friends,
Ron &amp; Diane Graf in Clinton, but I told them I would like to go.  He was to
speak at 10 am.  We decided we needed to leave at least by 8:30 am so we could
get a good seat.  I was over to their home by 8:10, but they were not ready so
it was 8:30 by the time we left.  Sandy drove their car and I was glad.  When
we arrived, we had to register and then we were ushered upstairs.  There were
no chairs anywhere, so we all had to stand.  We were there 35 minutes early. 
It is hard for me to stand very long.  I wouldn't have come had I known I would
have to stand.  I didn't even wear my good shoes that David had told me about,
which the kids gave me money for Mother's Day, to buy them.  They do help, but
I hadn't worn them.  There were two big TV screens with the previous debate
showing.  We couldn't hear as it was so noisy in there.  We were all excited
when Rand Paul came.   I had to strain to see him.  I had my I-pad with me and
it has a camera on it so I tried to take a picture of him.  I couldn't get a good
enough picture and the man behind me could see that, so asked if I would like
him to take it for me.  I did and he got a good one.  By the time it was over,
my back &amp; legs were hurting so bad that I could hardly stand the pain.  As
we went down stairs, I saw a very comfortable white sofa chair there in the
foyer.  I got there in time before anyone else sat in it.  Wow, did it ever
feel good.  They had announced that Rand would be in the adjoining room where
they would be selling his books and he would autograph them and you could also
get a picture taken with him.  Sandy wanted to do that, but I didn't have the
money to buy a book and I sure didn't feel like standing in a long line to get
one and have it signed.  Irven didn't either and there was a comfortable stool
for him to sit on also.  We sat there until Sandy came back and then we went
home.  **I felt that was a tender mercy from the Lord that that comfortable
large chair was there and no one was sitting in it.  There were a few other
chairs, but they were just regular chairs and people were sitting on them.  I
know Heavenly Father loves us and wants to help us and he answers our prayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Other than spending time with our family,
extended family &amp; friends, fishing is our favorite pastime in the summer. 
We love to be out in nature and on these beautiful lakes and reservoirs.  We
love to fish and we love eating them too.  We take grandsons and other family
members and friends with us some of the time, and that is great too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are so thankful for our Savior, whose birth
we celebrate on this holiday.  We have been studying “Jesus The Christ” in our
Family Home Evening group each week, and have gained a greater love and
appreciation for our Savior.   </p>
