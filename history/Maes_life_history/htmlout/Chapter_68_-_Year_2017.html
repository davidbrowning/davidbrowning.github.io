<p class=MsoNormal><b>SIBLING &amp; SPOUSE GET TOGETHER – JUNE 17, 2017</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was our turn to host my siblings/spouse get together
which we have every three months.  Kim &amp; Jeanenne are on their mission to
South Africa, so of course, they were not here, but the rest of us were – Bryce
&amp; Deanna, Terry &amp; Angela, Georgia &amp; Rick and Ken &amp; I.  I made
twice cooked potatoes, mixed vegetables, fruit salad, tossed salad, my delicious
cake/Danish desert/strawberry desert, and I bought &amp; warmed up the rolls.
Ken grilled big trout, chicken breasts and steaks.  We enjoyed visiting as we
ate, and we sat at the table quite a while and kept visiting, then us ladies
went into the living room where we continued to visit and the guys went out on
our patio and played games on the patio table &amp; chairs as it was cooler out
there.  Then we all got together and played Mormon Bridge and Catch Phase.  It
was an enjoyable day.</p>
