<p class=MsoNormal>            When David was about 18 months old, we had gone
to Utah for Thanksgiving and he got sick while we were there.  I took him to
the doctor when we got home, and he said David had tonsillitis and ear
infections and that he would need a &quot;double&quot; penicillin shot.  (They
used to give shots a lot in those days, now they mainly give liquid or pills)
When the doctor told me that, immediately a terrible sensation came over me and
the feeling that I shouldn't let David have the shot.  I rationalized that when
I was in Utah, Mom &amp; her friend had been talking about penicillin and how
you could have terrible reactions to it.  Deep inside I knew it was the Holy
Ghost warning me not to let the doctor give David the shot, but I guess I was
weak and thought &quot;well, he's the doctor and David is really sick, what
else do I do?&quot;  Well, I let him have the shot and as I went out to the
car, I fell apart and started crying because I knew that feeling was so strong
that I shouldn't have let it happen, that I should have heeded the warning. 
David suffered terribly for several years because of that, and I suffered along
with him and wished I could take the pain and other problems that came along
with it, instead of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=285 height=214
src="Chapter_23_-_David's_Health_Problems_files/image002.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=DSC03004>            We did take him to another doctor to see if
the doctor gave the shot in the wrong place.  (Since David went into the
medical field, he found out from another M.D. that the doctor had given it in
the wrong place, and that the other doctor wouldn't &quot;rat&quot; on him as
they cover for each other.  We were told back then, that David was terribly
allergic to penicillin and that if he had been 15 or older when he received the
shot that he would never had walked again.  The doctor said that if he should
ever have penicillin again, it could kill him.  He advised us to get a chain
around his neck or a wrist bracelet showing that he was allergic to it, so in
case he was taken to a clinic or hospital without us being there, that they
would see it and not give it to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I took David home from the doctor, who gave
him the shot, he couldn't walk, it was too painful.  He would scream as I
changed his diaper, dressed him, put on his shoes, etc.  It paralyzed his left
side.  The doctor said that with him being so young, it would heal an inch a
month - so about a year later, the paralysis was gone, but it left him with a
&quot;club foot&quot;.  We had taken David to all kinds of doctors to get
help.  One orthopedic surgeon had him do foot and leg exercises and come back each
month.  He would check it and tell us to continue doing these same exercises. 
We finally could see that it wasn't helping; all it was helping was the
doctor's bank account, so we quit taking him there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David not only had to contend with the paralysis and club foot,
but he also still kept getting sick a lot.  He coughed so much that he
developed what they called a &quot;chicken breast&quot; (I think that was what
it was called) Anyway, the bone in his chest protruded.  The doctors kept
putting him on antibiotics.  I hated to have him have so many drugs and I
couldn't see they were helping - only temporarily.  It wasn't fixing the
problem.  We took him to an ear, nose and throat specialist who lived in our
stake in Lehi.  When I took David into his office, he said &quot;that child
needs his adenoid out&quot;.  He could tell by the way he was breathing.  He
operated and took out his tonsils and adenoids and put tubes in his ears.  That
seemed to help for awhile, but he was still sickly and it really worried me. 
He was going on four at this time.  He got so bad that he would have coughing
spells which started out just every so often. He would cough so hard at nights
and couldn't breathe.  Ken &amp; I would prop his bed up so he could breathe
easier, but it got progressively worse until we would be up most of the night
with him for several nights in a row and then he would be so exhausted and weak
that he would just lay around and not have any energy to do anything.  About
this time Ken &amp; I had been to a party that our Bishop's house.  The Bishop's
wife had been really sick for a long time and told me that she heard of a Dr.
Swanstrom in Scottsdale who was a homoeopathic doctor and had helped so many
people.  She had gone to him and he put her on different vitamins, minerals,
etc., and she couldn't believe the difference.  She was afraid she was dying
and now she was well.  I was really interested, but soon forgot about it.  My
Mom &amp; Dad had been down visiting for Thanksgiving or Christmas, I can't
remember which and Ken's Mom &amp; stepdad were also there.  Dad &amp; Leo gave
David a blessing.  I remember Sandi coming into the kitchen the next morning
and saying &quot;Mom, my grandpas gave David a blessing, why isn't he
better?&quot;  She had heard him continue to cough so hard all throughout the
night.  I didn't have an answer for her then, but when she came home from
school, I did.  About 11:30 that morning, the thought came to me about Dr.
Swanstrom and that I should take David to him.  I called the Bishop's wife and
got his phone number.  I called and his wife told me that all his appointments
were taken.  She must have sensed how desperate I was as she let me talk to
him.  At first, he tried to make an appointment for a later date, but he also
sensed my concern and told me to bring him right in.  I later found out that he
gave up his lunch hour to see David.  When I carried David into his office, he
took one look at him and said &quot;I'm glad you brought him in, girlie&quot;. 
He always called me &quot;girlie&quot; from that time on.  Dr Swanstrom was a
cute little white-haired man who was in his 70's.  He had studied to become a
medical doctor, but had gone to Germany for more education.  While there he
learned about homoeopathic.  He didn't get his M.D. because he believed more in
homoeopathic.  He even started a college in Chicago and worked there until he
started having health problems because of working too hard and too long.  He
and his wife were religious.  I can't remember what faith they belonged to, but
he was their organist.  He had a special gift from God and had a lot of faith
in Heavenly Father.  His wife was his receptionist and she also sold
&quot;Shackley&quot; products.  Her name was Dorothy and she was a very special
lady also.  He used a machine to test with, where you could use blood, saliva,
or urine. He usually used saliva as it was the easiest.  He would have you
close your mouth on a paper towel.  He would draw around it with a pen and test
it with his machine.  He also worked on your body - like a chiropractor, but
much more gentle.  He would run his fingers down your spine and tell you not
only what was wrong with your back, but other problems with your body.  He
would sell homoeopathic vitamins &amp; minerals.  They were little white pills
which you would put under your tongue and dissolve.  They tasted good - so it
was not a problem to have the children take them.  I loved this little old man
and knew the Lord sent us to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyway, back to David.  He told me that David was at a zero
with oxygen - that was why he coughed so much and so hard, he didn't have
hardly any oxygen in his body and thus no energy.  He sent us home with iron,
magnesium, calcium, etc.  He also said his blood sugar was low and told me what
to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Sandi came home from school, I told her the
Lord had blessed David - that Heavenly Father usually doesn't just immediately
heal someone, but helps us to know what to do, and that he put the thought in
my head to take him to Dr. Swanstrom which I had done and now he was going to
get well.  I had faith that this would be so.  My parents had left that morning
to go home, and Mom telephoned me later, that when they had left, she told dad
that she didn't expect to see David alive again.  She said he had been so sick
and his skin was turning blue and she felt he wouldn't live much longer.  I
don't think he would have either, if the Lord hadn't blessed us to go to Dr.
Swanstrom.  After a couple of weeks and David was still having these coughing
spells, I became impatient and again called Dr. Swanstrom.  He told me that it
had taken a long time for David to get this bad and it would take awhile for
him to get built back up.  When he was feeling well again, I thanked Dr.
Swanstrom and he said &quot;Don't thank me, girlie, thank the Lord&quot;.  He
always gave the credit to the Lord.  I know that was why he was able to help so
many people.  Over the years until Dr Swanstrom died, Ken &amp; I went to him
and took the family a lot too.  When he first tested the other children, we had
moved down and left the farm in Erda.  He told us he hadn't tested such a
healthy family in a long time.  He told us that we must be feeding them good
nutritious food, and taking good care of them.  We told him we were health
conscious and had always tried to get &quot;whole&quot; milk for the family to
drink.  If we didn't have a cow, then we tried to find someone who had one and
buy milk from them.  We also told him we just moved from a church farm where
the children got lots of exercise and fresh air being out working and also
playing on the farm.</p>
