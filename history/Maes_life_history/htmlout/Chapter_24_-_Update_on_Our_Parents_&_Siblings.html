<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Mom &amp; Dad</b> moved from their little
home in Sunset to a nice new home in Clearfield in Feb. 1970.  They are
enjoying it there.  Mom was very reluctant to move as she loved her little home
in Sunset, being near the church, highway, her friends, etc.  They had lived there
for 28 years.  Mom was a “Horter”, so when we were helping them move, Hal took
a truck full of stuff to the dumps.  Mom found out and was so angry at Hal. 
Ken &amp; Hal also took a load of old magazines, papers, etc., to their new
home.  Ken finished the basement for them and he put those magazines in the
rafters before he put the ceiling tile up.  Mom asked him where her magazines
were and he told her that he brought them there, so they must be there
somewhere.   Mom soon adjusted and made good friends.  One of the reasons dad
bought mom this home was hoping she would be a better housekeeper now that she
had a new home, but that didn’t happen.  I remember going to their home and Mom
was away getting her hair done or with friends.  Dad and I would visit and he
would say “Mae, let me show you these closets”.  They were bulging full.  He
said, “Your mom can’t throw anything away and we have way too much stuff.” After
Georgia married, he told mom he was going to have her room as his room to study
and rest in.  He had a desk, filing cabinet and Georgia’s bed.  He told Mom
that she couldn’t put anything in it as it was his room, but eventually she put
stuff in their too, so he showed me that too<u>.  I didn’t blame dad, he liked
a clean, uncluttered home.</u>  <b>Later in life, he told me “Well, I can’t
change your mom, but she has so many other wonderful qualities, so I just have
to overlook this one.”</b></p>
