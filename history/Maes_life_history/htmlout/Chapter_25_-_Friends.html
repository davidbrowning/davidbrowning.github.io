alt=DSC03535>We have had many friends while living in our several wards.  Some
are very special.  <b>Bishop and June Moulton</b> will always hold a place in
our hearts.  They are very spiritual, humble people.  They were like our second
parents<u>.  Ken was Delmar’s first counselor in the bishopric</u>.  Larry was
the 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor. We loved their children also.  I taught three of
their daughters in YWMIA – Luwana, Ardel, and Debra.  Myrna was the 2<sup>nd</sup>
oldest in the family and we became good friends and since she was a beautician,
I would go to her, and while she was doing my hair, we would have wonderful
visits. Delmar &amp; June were wonderful parents, and wonderful friends.  We
visited them occasionally whenever we lived close enough to do so.</p>

alt=DSC02769>            Our dearest truest friends are <b>Larry and Tammy
Braithwaite</b>.  Tammy is just like a sister to me, except as she has often
said, we never fight like sisters do.  We were together a lot, either just the
two of us with our children or with our husbands or with our families.  We ate
at each other’s homes, played games, went on trips together, went camping
together a lot, we had so much fun together.  Either she or I would call and
say “What are you doing today?”  And then we would say:“Let’s take the children
and go to the park, or get a sitter and go shopping, or let’s bake together
today.”  We had so much in common that we could talk about anything.  Pat Bradfield
&amp; I were always best friends, but I think Tammy &amp; I were even closer,
we really enjoyed being together.</p>

alt=P1190439>            We were good friends with <b>Pete and Grace Mooney</b>. 
Pete was so much fun.  He was really a character.  We enjoyed getting together
with them.  Sometime after we moved, Pete was put in the Bishopric.  We went
over to the ward as they were having something special - missionary farewell or
something (can’t remember for sure), anyway, we were five or so minutes late
and when we walked in we saw a row in the middle isle partway up in the chapel
and as we walked up there, Pete was conducting and he said “Well, if it isn’t
our good friends Ken &amp; Mae Browning and their family.  Wow, you’ve got a
big family now, don’t you?  You take up an entire row.”  Everyone chuckled.  We
were a little embarrassed, but that was just Pete.  Grace had some bad health
problems, and we were saddened to hear that years after we had moved, Pete had
an affair with a younger woman, he couldn’t forgive himself so he took his life. 
We were so sorry to hear that.</p>

alt=DSC03415> Our other goodfriends are Bob &amp; <b>Pauline Hein, and John and
Linda Willerton</b>.  When we were in the Mount Fort Ward, we got together in
the Young Marrieds Program and had a lot of fun together.  Since we enjoyed
each other’s company, we started going to the temple together, getting together
for family home evenings and eating at each other’s homes.  John &amp; Linda
moved into a home in Syracuse.  Bob &amp; Pauline bought a home in Salt
 Lake, we moved to Clearfield and Larry &amp; Tammy to Liberty.  We still get
together once or twice a month at each other’s homes for family night and
Sunday dinners.  Now Larry &amp; Tammy &amp; Ken &amp; I have moved to Arizona, but we write to the others and hope to get together with them occasionally.  We
have been fortunate to have wonderful friends.  I am also thankful for my
wonderful brothers and sister, and my wonderful sisters-in-law.  Jean and I
have been very close and I miss not being able to get together like we used to,
but we write and get together whenever Ken and I get up. <u>John &amp; Linda
Willerton are the first couple in the picture on the left, and Pauline &amp;
Bob Hein are just behind them.  The same is true on the picture on the right. 
Then Tammy &amp;Larry Braithwaite.  The Arvey’s are the other couple are the
left picture and then me as Ken is taking the picture.  I am taking the picture
on the right and Hal &amp; Jean are sitting by Ke.</u></p>

friends.  Ken loved being Kent’s counselor.  I write to <b>Ione &amp; Carolyn,
who were my counselors when I was Primary President in Clearfield and we go out
for lunch when we are living close by.   RaNae</b> and I call or get together
when we can also.  I think a lot of them, they are great friends. RaNae &amp;
Richard are the second couple from the left – next to Bishop &amp; Shirley. I
am on the end, holding our son, David, and Mary and Dale Cottrell are next to
me. I don’t remember who the couple on the other end are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our friends from the other wards and long time
friends are put in other chapters, mainly they are in the chapters when we
moved to their neighborhoods and wards.</p>
