<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Chapter 70 -CHERISHED
TRADITIONS, FAVORITES, ETC.:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Surprise Time:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I used to like to surprise the children with a small gift or
treat.  I would hide it behind my back and go into the room where the children
were and say &quot;Surprise Time&quot; They would close their eyes and hold out
their hands and I would put the gift or treat in their hands and then they
could open their eyes.  They were always happy when they saw the treat and were
appreciative.  I've always liked to do special things for my special children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Put up your dukes:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the children would argue, quarrel or fight, sometimes I
would go to them and say &quot;Put up your dukes&quot; and I would dance around
them with my hands quenched and being in a boxing position.  They would usually
start laughing and this would end the quarrel.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I tried all different methods to have peace in our home.  I
liked this one the best.  Sometimes I would send them to their rooms, sometimes
I had them sit on the couch or a chair, sometimes I would have them apologize
to each other, sometimes I would lecture them.  I tried all different ways. 
Sometimes, I lost my temper and I didn't like myself when I did that, and I
would try to go back to them afterwards and apologize and explain the problem
we had and how we should have handled it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tucking the children in at bedtime:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I always liked to tuck the children in at bedtime, give them
a hug &amp; kiss, tell them I loved them and to sleep well.  When I was growing
up I always wanted my mother to do this for me, but I don't remember her doing
so.  I would usually go to her and give her a hug and go off to bed alone. 
That isn't such a terrible thing, and I knew Mom loved me, but I always wanted
to be tucked in.  When we were living in Idaho and Mike was a Junior in High
School and David a Sophomore, they still liked me to tuck them in.  Ken's mom
was visiting us at one time, and David yelled up &quot;Aren’t you coming to
tuck us in, Mom?&quot;  I called back &quot;I'll be right down&quot;.  Ken's
mom said &quot;Oh, those boys are too big to be tucked in, you shouldn't have
to go down those steps and tuck them in at night.&quot;  I said to her
&quot;Mom, as long as they want me to tuck them in, I will be glad to do it. 
That's the time when I get to talk to them and express my love for them.&quot; 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>12 days of Christmas;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second Christmas when we lived in Firth, Idaho
was one of the hardest (financially) for us.  Ken had been very successful as a
building contractor.  With just word of mouth, he was kept very busy with
building new homes, &amp; remodeling<b><u> </u></b>others.  He had work
scheduled for several months ahead and had to turn work down.  We were very
blessed, but when November came and the farmers found out that the potatoes in
their cellars were spoiling because of frost when they were harvested, and they
would have to throw all of them out, many went bankrupt, and others were
holding on just by a thread as this was the 3rd year in a row that they had
crop failure.  All of a sudden, Ken was without work.  The people could no
longer afford to build new homes or remodel old ones.  Ken called other
contractors to see if they had work and they did not, many were leaving the
state.  I could see as Christmas drew near that we were not going to have a
very big Christmas.  I had purchased a few gifts earlier on sale as I usually
do each year, but it still wasn't very much.  I wondered what to do, and
finally decided to purchase small gifts or treats for each of the children and
do the 12 days of Christmas for them - to make this Christmas special even
though they would not receive much on Christmas Day.  Each day just before they
came home from school, I would put a small gift or treat on their pillow with a
note.  It was fun to watch them.  The first day, one of the children went to
their room and happened to find the treat, was excited and came out eating it. 
When the others saw it, they asked where he got it.  When he told them, they
ran to their rooms and were excited to find the treat.  From that day on, each
day they were excited to go to their rooms when they got home from school to
see what was there.  It brought fun, and happiness into our home and joy to me
to see my children happy.  I feel the Lord inspired me to do this as I had
prayed to him about Christmas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Waking up the Children in the Mornings:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many mornings to wake the children up, I would go into their
room singing &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning, How are you this Morning.  Good
Morning, Good Morning to you.&quot;  or &quot;Good Morning to you, Good morning
to you.  We're all in our places with Sunshiny faces, oh this is the way to
start a new day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the children were easier to wake up than others. 
Some I would have to call several times and others, especially, Scott, woke up
usually on their own.  If Scott didn't wake on his own, I would only have to
call him once.  I know, from experience, that they liked me to wake them gently
and show love.  Sandi, for example, asked that I not have Larina wake her in
the mornings as she was unkind to her.  Jeff, on occasion asked that I sing as
I woke him.  I wasn't a good singer, in fact, it was usually funny, but most of
them liked it anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Children’s Days:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was at Relief Society one day when we lived in Ogden and a
friend was sharing how she had “Children’s Days” and she explained that she
would spend at least one hour and longer if she could, with each of her
children on a different day.  The older children would tend the younger
children while she spend a one-on-one time with each of her children doing what
they wanted to do.  I wanted to incorporate that into my children’s lives.  I
was just starting our family at that time so we had Sandy and Shellie.  As we
had more children, I kept trying to do this.  They would each have their day of
the week (not the weekends when Ken was home) and I would spend at least one
hour with that child.  Sometimes the boys wanted to go exploring, play marbles
or other games, go bike riding, go get an ice cream cone, or go for a walk. 
With the girls, they wanted to ride bikes, play barbies or other games, go for
walks, get ice cream, make cookies, etc.  I enjoyed this time as much as they
did, and I felt it was important as we could have good talks sometimes while
having their day and I could find out if they were concerned about friends,
school or other things and they could also share the things that made them happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>MAE'S FAVORITES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FAVORITE SONG:  &quot;LOVE AT HOME&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FAVORITE COLOR:  PINK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FAVORITE SCRIPTURE:  1 NEPHI 3:7  &quot;I will go and do the
things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no
commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them
that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FAVORITE DAY OF THE WEEK:  Sunday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I look forward to Sunday to rest from the daily cares of the
world and focus on the Lord and the blessings he has given me.  I enjoy going
to church, feasting on the good word of the Lord, &amp; taking the Sacrament. 
I enjoy relaxing &amp; being with our family on this special day.  My mother
taught me to wear a dress or skirt &amp; blouse on this day - which shows more
respect to the Lord.  I am thankful for her example and I do dress up some
instead of being in my casual clothes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Some have said Keeping the Sabbath Day Holy is
one of the most important commandments to observe.  I sometimes worry that I
have not fully taught our children the importance of strictly obeying this
commandment.  They observe this day as the Lord's, some of them more than
others, but I wish all of them would realize the important of studying the
scriptures and pondering them on this day, and of doing all that the Lord would
want us to do on his day.  I would hope that they all would realize that there
are 6 other days to clean, do laundry, press clothes, go to the store, go to
places of recreation, watch TV, etc.  <b>I need to practice what I preach and I
don’t always observe the Sabbath as strictly as I should and I need to do
better. I am trying harder.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“LET THE SUNSHINE IN”  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roy Rogers and Dale Evans sang it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So let the sunshine in, say it with a grim, smilers never
lose and frowners never win.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So let the sunshine in, say it with a grim, so open up your
heart and let the sunshine in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you forget to say your prayers, the Devil jumps with
glee, but he feels so awful, awful when he sees you on your knees.  So when you
are unhappy and you never seem to win, just open up your heart and let the
sunshine in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you are unhappy, the Devil wears a grim, but oh he
starts to runnin when the light comes pourin in, I know he won’t be happy cuz
I’ll never wear a frown, maybe if we keep on smiling, he’ll get tired of hangin
round.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you don’t go to Sunday School, you’ll grow up to be bad.
Never know just what you missed, but some day wish you had.  If you want to
someday see the Lord, you’d better start today and climb up on the     , a long
the upward trail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>DIFFERENT SONG – DON’T KNOW TITLE – Roy Rogers and Dale
Evans sang it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So go to the highway, tell them at the byway, tell them that
you’re their friend.  Tell them the Church is open, they’re welcome to come
in.  Sing just a little bit, talk just a little bit, throw in a smile or two. 
Go heavy on the howdy do, for the Lord is counting on you, on you.  The Lord is
counting on you.</p>
