<p class=MsoNormal><b>SANDI: Our oldest child and beautiful daughter</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=213 height=284
src="Chapter_63_-_UPDATE_ON_OUR_FAMILY_files/image002.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt="Sandi with her Mom">Sandi is still working at Grantsville High
as their registrar. The beginning and ending of each year are the hardest and
busiest times for her.  She hopes to retire in about four years.  She is
married to Nick Drake and they have a beautiful home in Tooele.  It is up on
Bench View Drive, so she has a beautiful view from their home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Sandi is always so thoughtful and
kind to us, her family, neighbors, friends, etc.  Sandi is active in the church
at this time.  She was a counselor in Young Women’s, and now is the chorister
in primary.  Nick occasionally comes to Sacrament Meeting with her, but doesn’t
stay for the other meetings.  He really isn’t interested in becoming active. 
We are somewhat disappointed in him as he doesn’t do much to help Sandi with
the home or yard.  He just mainly wants to watch sports on TV.  Ken &amp; I
have enjoyed going fishing with him &amp; Sandi, especially at Fish Lake, and
we have enjoyed going to Country Creek Lodge in the mountains above Soda
Springs, Idaho to go snowmobiling on those beautiful hills.  We stay a night or
two, usually for Ken’s birthday and Sherrie fixed wonderful meals for us and we
love playing games at night.  Nick does like to play games, so we get together
occasionally for dinner and then play games afterward.  Nick &amp; Ken stand
Sandi &amp; I.  Marbles is one of our favorite games we play with them. Sandi
has two daughters and they are both married. <b> </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Sandi has so many talents.  I saw
her talent of music, dancing and art while she was growing up, but as she
married, she developed these talents so much more.  She started oil painting
and is so good at it.  She is so good at sewing.  I think I have already
written how she <img width=227 height=303
src="Chapter_63_-_UPDATE_ON_OUR_FAMILY_files/image003.jpg" align=left
hspace=12>designed and sewed costumes for her students when she taught clogging. 
She now makes costumes for Halloween for her and one time she made witch
costumes for her two daughters and their daughters and they went to Gardner
Village for the Halloween festival there.  She has made some fun costumes for
her and Nick and I think her and Gary now.  At Grantsville where she works as
their register, they have a day, once a year, when they have a theme, and
everyone is encouraged to dress up in that theme’s costumes.  She has made
fantastic costumes.  Two years ago, the theme was on the Disney movie “Ariel”
and she was asked to be Urcela.  Here is a picture of her in that costume.  It
blew me away that she could make this costume and fix her hair and makeup to
match that character.  Of course, she wasn’t big like Urcela.</p>

hspace=12>Sandi is like her dad, she can do almost anything.  Both Sandi &amp;
Shellie take after their dad that way.  They aren’t afraid to do most
anything.  Sandi has lots of Christmas villages with houses, churches, people,
trees, vehicles, etc.  She saw a wooden tree that was built like a Christmas
tree and asked her dad if he would help her make it. That way she could put her
villages on it. She said if he would, she would make a big, decorated, lighted
wreath to put on the outside of our house as a beautiful decoration for
Christmas.  We were excited about that, so they went to work.  She sent Ken the
picture and he planned it out, bought the wood, and Sandi came out one Saturday
where they both spent the day working on it.  Ken spent other days putting it
together.  This is them making the tree, and this is the finished product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fast forward to 2018.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In 2014, I think it was in July,
that Sandi &amp; Nick had two condos at Lake Tahoe.  Sandi invited her
daughters, JaNae &amp; Chelci and their families to go with them.  Chelci,
Steve &amp; kids did go, but JaNae, Brad and children didn’t.  Sandi also
invited Shellie, Roy &amp; their family and Ken &amp; I to go also.  Quint
&amp; Kevis couldn’t go, so there were 14 of us.  We had a great time, but when
Sandi &amp; I were walking together one day, she said “Mom, I hope you won’t
hate me, but I have decided to divorce Nick.”  I told her that of course I
wouldn’t hate her, I loved her very much and always would.  I told her I wanted
her to be happy and I knew that she wasn’t happy with Nick.  Another time when
we were talking, she told me that if she divorced Nick, she probably wouldn’t
be active in the church any longer.  I felt bad about that, but it is her choice. 
I know she has a testimony of the Savior and His gospel, but not strong enough
to want to live it. </p>

align=left hspace=12><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
color:black'>             </span></b><span style='color:black'>In 2017</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;color:black'>, </span>Sandi divorced Nick Drake.  He
was lazy and didn’t help her with housework or yard work; she had to do it all.
He wouldn’t go walking, biking, or any of the fun things she wanted to do.  All
he wanted to do was watch sports.  When she married him, he was a sports editor
at the Tooele Newspaper and he played sports and refereed them.  I guess she
should have known that his life revolved around sports. Shellie, Mike &amp;
Jeff tried to talk her out of marrying Nick.  Her siblings knew that he was
lazy and was all about sports.  They also knew that he didn’t have any money,
so they wondered why she was going to marry him.  She told me later that she
was tired of dating and it was hard for her to be alone and to go to family,
church and other activities alone.  She thought he would be good.  After she
married him, he didn’t even show affection to her.  On their wedding night, he
went to buy groceries for a stop &amp; shop kind of store that he had been
doing this for.  When they went on a few trips, she said he just complained and
made it miserable for her.  Finally, she decided she couldn’t take it any
longer and wanted to do fun things and enjoy her life while she was young.  <span

had known <b>Gary Martinson</b> because they both were involved with the
Classified Association from their schools.  She had met Gary some years before
at a school association conference.  They had become friends over the years. 
Gary had had an unhappy marriage and so was divorced, and with Sandi not happy
with Nick and getting a divorce, they started seeing each other more.  After
Sandi’s divorce, Gary moved in with Sandi.  Sandi didn’t want to marry as she
felt that after marrying a guy, they would change, and she didn’t want to have
to go through that again.  Gary felt the same way.  Gary is a great guy and he
is so good to Sandi.  He gets her flowers every week, or as soon as the others
start to die.  He helps her with the yard work, housework, cooking, etc.  He is
OCD, so is a perfectionist and is quick and good at whatever he does.  Gary is
always telling Sandi he loves her and wants to spend the rest of his life with
her.  He is always showing her affection and they love doing things together –
going fishing, biking, on trips, etc.  They have fun together and Sandi says
she didn’t know she could be so happy.  They have been together for four years,
and Gary now wants to marry her.  Sandi is sure that he won’t change after
marriage now, so she has agreed to it.  They got engaged in June of 2018 and
had an engagement party at their home.  They invited family, neighbors and
friends and we all had a wonderful time.  They have a condo in Las Vegas in
December, (this year 2018), so they are planning to get married at that time. 
They are having an Elvis Presley impersonator wedding.  I don’t know if he has
a license to marry them, or if a justice of the peace will do it, but the Elvis
impersonator will sing some of Elvis’s songs.  I think that’s weird, but that’s
their choice.  It will just be the two of them as Sandi felt that with this
being her 4<sup>th</sup> wedding, it could just be her and Gary.  Ken and I are
happy that they are getting married, now we can call her our son-in-law as it
was awkward, when introducing him to other family or friends or when telling
others about Sandi &amp; Gary, to just call him her friend, partner, etc., and
we worried that they were living together and breaking a commandment of God. 
We are thankful Gary is such a good guy and is making Sandi so happy. </p>

of dancing). </u> Later, Sandi helped teach as she has always had a talent for
dancing.  She later took over the studio when the owner wanted to sell it.  JaNae
was a “natural” at this dancing, like her mom, and she had such a beautiful
smile.  JaNae and Chelci were both cheerleaders in high school and both were in
beauty pageants.   They both are married to wonderful men.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>  <b>  </b>JaNae has a beautiful
smile and is a beautiful woman.  She married <b>Brad Caires</b> and they have three
children – <b>Dawson, Kennedy and Emma</b>.  (This picture was taken in 2016). 
Dawson was 13, Kennedy was 11 and Emma was 9.  They are all born in March, two
years apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>JaNae taught clogging in
Grantsville, like her mom for a period of time, and was very good.  I went to
watch her one time when she was teaching her oldest class, which Kennedy was in
that class.  JaNae has that talent for dancing like her mom, and it was fun
watching her dance as her class followed her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Brad was on high pain pills because
of terrible pain from his operation that resulted from a fight with a burglar
who was in their garage stealing expensive equipment and tools that Brad had
there.  He also had arthritis from hurting himself while as a youth riding motorcycles. 
Brad had had a good job at Tooele Army Depot disarming explosives, so they
bought a beautiful home in Stockton, a nice truck and other toys and
furniture.  Brad quit this job to go into business for himself, making special
tools for mechanics.  He was doing pretty well, until this happened and he couldn’t
work anymore.  Brad is a good man and a good husband and father, and it is sad
to see how his health has deteriorated since all this has happened.  They ended
up losing their home and practically everything they had.  It was a hard time
for them.  Bishops helped them with church welfare and got them into a trailer
home in Grantsville. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>JaNae and her Mom had problems with
each other.  It was a big problem and they hadn’t communicated with each other
for 3 or 4 years (Maybe longer, I don’t remember) I was so sad as I love them
both.  JaNae wouldn’t let her mom see the grandchildren, and that was so hard
on Sandi, but also the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I had kept in touch with JaNae and
had called and talked to her several times.   We had good visits, but if ever
she slammed her mom, I came to Sandi’s defense as Sandi has been a good mother
and grandmother and she is my daughter.  I had invited JaNae and her family to
come here for dinner and one-time Ken and I took dinner out to them in
Grantsville and we all <img width=280 height=211

our stake center here in Roy (2017), JaNae, Brad and the children came.  After
that terrible time, JaNae wouldn’t come to any family parties or activities as
she knew her mom would be there and she wouldn’t come if her mom was coming. 
Wow!  This was hard on all of us, but this time they came and we were all so
happy to see them again.  Sandi and Gary, JaNae &amp; Brad, Chelci &amp; Steve
and I think some of the older children all played games together, after our
dinner, and they laughed and had so much fun together.  This made me so happy. 
This year, JaNae called and said the missionaries were teaching Emma, as Emma
hadn’t been baptized and was ten years old, and asked if we could come to
Emma’s baptism and if Ken (Emma’s great grandpa) could baptize her.  Of course,
we were thrilled.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>JaNae called her sister, Chelci,
and asked if their family could come also.  I loved hearing that Steve’s family
always has their family party every year, on the Saturday that Emma was to be
baptized.  Sandi told me that when Chelci told Steve about it and asked him
what they should do, that he said “My family has this party every year, and
Emma’s baptism is a once in a lifetime event, so we need to go support her and
her family.”  I was so proud of Steve and thankful he felt this way.  I think
Chelci asked JaNae if her mom could come also, and she said “yes”, so we all
came and it was great to be all together again.  The baptism was special. 
JaNae had asked if I would give one of the talks, so I gave the baptism one,
and one of the Elder’s who taught Emma gave the talk on the Holy Ghost.  Sandi
played the piano and Chelci lead the music.  Ken baptized and also confirmed
Emma and gave her the gift of the Holy Ghost.  I had made a Texas cake and
passed that out to all who attended the baptism, and there were many.  We were
thrilled that so many of the ward had come to support them, and also other
missionaries came.  Chelci’s family, JaNae’s family, Sandi &amp; Gary and Ken
&amp; I all went out to eat afterwards and as we were all leaving, we gave hugs
as we said our “goodbyes” and I saw Sandi and JaNae hugging and telling each
other that they loved her.  That surely made me happy as I have always wanted
them to be close again and love each other.  </p>

beautiful and special woman. Chelci married <b>Steve Holste</b> in the Salt
Lake temple.  We were there with them and it was a beautiful ceremony.  Of
course, Sandi and Terry were there also and Steve’s parents and brothers and
sisters-in-law.  We all went out to lunch afterwards.  They had a beautiful
reception.  Chelci &amp; Steve both have strong testimonies of the gospel and
are active in the church.  They have four children now (2018) –<b> Nathan</b>, <b>Addison
Mae “Addie” the twins  - Luke &amp; Jacob.</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chelci &amp; Steve are good parents.  Chelci went to college
and became a dental hygienist.  She got a job with a dentist in Grantsville and
now with having her family, she only works one day a week.  After the twins
were born, Sandi took care of them while Chelci worked one day a week, and
helped her with them whenever she could.  They are so cute, but so are Nathan
and Addie.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Steve has a good job and they
bought a beautiful home in Grantsville.  Chelci is a wonderful housekeeper and
homemaker, like her mom.  </p>

and sings whenever she is asked.  She has sung at queen pageants, Tooele Army

Chelci’s performances.  (This picture is at Sandi’s home when her and Chelci
were practicing for Chelci to sing in her Sacrament Meeting.  Ken &amp; I were
there visiting, so got to hear them.)  Ken &amp; I love to go out and watch Chelci
sing whenever we know about it and can go.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Chelci is in a band called “<b>Exit
99”,</b> which is the exit turning off the freeway into Tooele County.  Chelci
is the lead singer and plays a guitar.  They practice every Friday night.  We
have gone out to some of their performances, and enjoyed listening to them.  I
have always loved hearing Chelci sing from the time she was young.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On their 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary, Chelci
asked Ken and I if we could tend the children while they went on a cruise. 
Sandi had a conference, with her work, in St George, so couldn’t tend them and
neither could Steve’s parents.  We were going to Shellie’s to spend a couple of
weeks with them, but we postponed it a week and said we would do it as Chelci
&amp; Steve needed this time together.  The children were so cute.  I was
afraid the twins wouldn’t be good for us and really miss their parents, but
they were great!  It was cute to watch them play.  They went down for naps
really good, as long as they had their own binkie, and they knew which one was
theirs.  They were good while we changed their diapers, they ate good.  We took
them for walks in their stroller.  We watched them play in their play room and
had fun with them.  Sometimes, if I was downstairs cleaning up or doing dishes,
I would hear them fight, but by the time I got up there, they were fine and
having fun together again.  Nathan was so good.  He is a cute boy and is
growing up so fast.  He is good in sports.  Addison “Addie” Mae is their only
daughter and she is so sweet and pretty.  We loved being with these special
great grandchildren and getting to know them better.  Nathan was sick and so
was luke.  Both Ken and I got sick towards the end of the week, and Chelci felt
bad that she had to leave them when they were sick, and that we got sick, but
we did fine.  Ken had the roughest time, but we were glad we could tend these
children.  Steve got sick, from the kids too, while they were on their cruise,
so it wasn’t as fun for them as it could have been.</p>

style='color:#222222'>  I am here in Arizona with Shellie, Roy and their
family.&nbsp; I flew down on Friday and will be going home on this coming
Friday, the 20th.&nbsp; My grandson, <b>Quint</b>, their 2nd oldest, was going
into the military and since I hadn't seen him for quite a while as we hadn't
been down for a year, and when Shellie came up, Quint and Kevis didn't come,
the last couple of times, as they had jobs here.&nbsp; Shellie said this would
be a great time for me to come.&nbsp; Ken couldn't come because he is driving a
school bus route so he told me to fly down.&nbsp; I had only planned to be here
a week, but Shellie &amp; Roy asked if I could stay an extra week so that they
could go on a week vacation to San Diego (where they were planning to take
Quint) as their youngest son, Jase, has Asperger’s and is on a special health
diet, even stricter than the one Ken and I are on, so they wanted me to be here
with the boys so Jase could get the food he needs.&nbsp; It turned out that
Quint didn't go into the military.&nbsp; He had a leg injury from skiing and as
he met with the Marines to work out before going into basic training, it
started bothering him.&nbsp; Since the military has been cut&nbsp;back so much,
they really didn't need him, and didn't want him if he couldn't do what he
would need to do in the Marines, so they let him out.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Shellie
told me, I thought maybe I should try to change my flight to our Christmas
vacation so Ken could come with me, but it cost way too much to change it, so I
came anyway, and I'm glad I did.&nbsp; </span></p>

Quint.&nbsp; He&nbsp;is a special grandson.&nbsp; He didn't stay on his mission
and&nbsp;told the mission president that he didn't have a testimony, he
believed it was true, but couldn’t say it knew it was true.  They wanted him to
say he knew it was true.  He was in Washington DC and had a
Tongan&nbsp;companion as his trainer and that didn't work well.&nbsp; Quint
goes to the Young Adult ward each Sunday, and even last Sunday, when his
parents were gone, and he had to work from 4 am until 10 am at Target unloading
trucks, he still came home and got ready and went to church.&nbsp; I was
surprised, but thrilled.&nbsp; We had Family Home Evening Monday night and he
had a great attitude and all three of the boys participated and we had a great
evening.&nbsp; I gave a lesson on the Holy Ghost and gave some experiences; we
sang songs, prayed, played Pictionary with using scriptures stories and had
refreshments.&nbsp; Mine and Jase's was a healthy snack.&nbsp; I am enjoying
this time with these special grandsons.&nbsp; They&nbsp;say I am spoiling them,
but I told them that I don't get the opportunity to do that very often, and
besides that's what grandmothers like to do.</span></p>

style='color:#222222'>&nbsp;           I have enjoyed this time with Shellie,
Roy &amp; the boys as I don't get to see them enough. However, Shellie came up
three times this past year and that was great!&nbsp; Roy came up with her &amp;
Jase once.&nbsp; She mainly came up the first time to get Jase and herself into
Nancy, our nutritionist, to see if&nbsp;Nancy could help Jase.&nbsp; Nancy told
her to read the &quot;Gut and Psychology Syndrome&quot; Natural treatment for
Dyspraxia, Autism, ADD, Dyslexia, A.D.H.D., Depression, Schizophrenia, etc. by
Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride MD, MMedSci(neurology), MMedSci(nutrition).&nbsp;
Shellie bought it and read it and realized she needed to follow this diet even
though it is so hard, but she could tell from reading the book, that this would
help Jase.&nbsp; Nancy tested Jase, Shellie &amp; Sandi and found they are all
allergic to Gluten, Dairy and Sugar and that processed foods are so bad for us,
so not to use any.&nbsp; Sandi is on our diet, but Shellie opted to do the GAPS
diet.&nbsp; Shellie is great at fixing all this food from scratch and doing exactly
what the book says to do.&nbsp; I thought I would be going to the Health Store
to buy the bread and other items I need for my diet, but instead I am eating
the foods she is fixing for herself and Jase.&nbsp; It's different, but some is
pretty good.&nbsp; The book says if they eat this way for two years, they will
be over allergies and&nbsp;their guts will be healed.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be
able to add more foods in gradually.&nbsp; However, they will still eat healthy
and not eat junk food, pop, or much processed foods.&nbsp; With eating this
way, I am feeling good and I'm not hungry between meals like I used to be, even
though I don't eat a lot.&nbsp;They have been on this diet for 8 weeks and
Shellie has lost weight and looks great.&nbsp; Her skin is much better.&nbsp;
Nancy had commented that her skin was bad.&nbsp; She was allergic to wearing
any jewelry and now she isn't.&nbsp; The best thing is that Jase is doing so
well.&nbsp; He was very picky before and I worried that she wouldn't be able to
get him to eat healthy, but after explaining to him about what has happened to
people because of eating junk food and processed foods and how he will be much
healthier and happier if he eats this way for two years, he decided he wanted
to do it.&nbsp; He is great at it and he is doing much better with his Asperger’s.&nbsp;
His teacher called Shellie and told her that where they used to have a tutor
for Jase to keep him on task and help him so he wouldn't fail the tests, etc.,
now they don't have to and that his grades have improved dramatically.&nbsp;
The teacher said &quot;Whatever you are doing, keep it up as it is
working.&quot;&nbsp; We are all thrilled about that.&nbsp; One day at home, I
called the family and Jase answered and said <b>&quot;Grandma, I didn't used to
like the meals Mom fixed, but now I look forward to them.&nbsp; She fixes good
healthy food.&quot;</b></span></p>

style='color:#222222'>    Jase and Shellie are off the Gaps diet.  Shellie
thought it was really helping Jase and she at first, but now she isn’t so
sure.  It was a lot of work and expense, so they have gone back to eating the
way they used to eat.  They still eat pretty healthy, but not so strict as the
Gaps diet was. <u>Jase is a sweet boy, but with Asperger’s, they don’t have
social skills so the kids at school and in the neighborhood just pretty much
ignore him</u>.  <u>Jase likes to be by himself and on his computer. </u> Shellie
home schooled him during his Junior High School years, but Garrett talked her
into getting him registered in High School as he felt it would be better for
him.  The home-schooling classes on the computer were harder than what they are
at the high school, so Jase does well.  He got good grades, but he was on his
computer doing schoolwork and homework from morning until night.  He didn’t
even have a break on weekends and holidays, so that was hard on him and his
parents.  This is much easier for him now and he has time for himself.  He
loves “Mind Craft” on the computer and other programs.  I bet he will do well
after he graduates if he gets a job doing these things as he is a whiz on
them.  When Shellie &amp; Roy go on their trips, Jase wants to stay home.  He
fixes his meals and keeps the house clean and they can trust him.</span></p>

hspace=12><b><span style='color:black'>Kevis:  </span></b><span
style='color:black'>He had moved out since he wasn’t going to college.  His
parents had told him they would pay for his college, if he would go.  He is
such a smart young man that he could have gotten a scholarship if he had turned
in his homework in high school.  After he took his ? test at high school, he
got such a high score that colleges and universities were calling to have him
come to their school.  Shellie said that he even had more than Garrett did. 
Kevis just wanted to sleep and play video games, so Shellie &amp; Roy told him
that if he wouldn’t go to college, then he better move out on his own.  Kevis
has an inferior complex.  I could see that, when I was tending them when the
children were young, while their parents went on trips.  I would walk him to
school and his friends would call out to him, but he wouldn’t acknowledge
them.  We never know why our children or grandchildren have these darn inferior
complexes as we as parents feel we give them praise and love.  Sandi had one
too and yet she was so pretty, talented and smart.  Anyway, Kevis finally saw
that his life wasn’t going anywhere.  He had a job in a men’s clothing store,
but that wasn’t anything great and he didn’t have good hours, so he decided to
enlist in the Marines.  He passed the basic training easily as he had learned
Karade.  He is a strong young man.  In fact, he has always been strong.  I
remember when they had their pool at their other home in Chandler, and I was in
the pool with Kevis, and we were teasing each other by splashing water at each
other.  I thought I would duck him, as he was only about 8 or 9 years old. 
That was the wrong thing to do as he about drowned me.  I couldn’t believe how
strong he was.  He takes after his dad as Roy is very strong.  I remember
Shellie and I took on Roy years ago, and he had us both down so quickly we
didn’t know what had happened.  Anyway, Kevis is stationed in Okinawa.  He was
happy to be transferred there as he and Quint have been studying Japanese and
now he can speak it with the natives when he goes off the base.  The picture of
him with his parents above, was when he graduated from his schooling.  </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:
0in;background:white'><span style='color:black'>            <b>Kevis was lost.</b> 
When Kevis was a scout and went to scout camp up in the mountains.  They were
playing a game where you and a buddy run and hide and then two of them are left
to find the others.  Kevis got separated from his buddy and went further than
he should have and got lost.  His mother had told him that if he ever got lost,
he should stay where he is, so he can be found.  He did, although he called out
and tried to look around.  After a while when the scouts couldn’t find him,
they told the scoutmaster and they all went looking for him.  Finally, the
scoutmaster called the bishop, who called Shellie &amp; Roy and Rescue people. 
Everyone, including neighbors, family and members came to start looking for
Kevis.  Shellie called me to ask if I would pray for him.  I surely did, but I
hated to wake Ken as I knew he wouldn’t sleep and he needed to go to work the
next morning.  I didn’t sleep and kept praying hard.  They had to call off the
search late that night and continued it the next morning with helicopters helping
also.  Kevis spend the night shivering as it was cold in the mountains and he
only had on a light jacket.  There were bears in that area, which Shellie
didn’t know about until later. (Hope I get this story right).  Finally around
noon the next day one helicopter spotted him.  He had made a large S.O.S. with
big rocks.  Without water, he finally drank some from a dirty pool or puddle as
he was so thirsty.  He was glad to be found as all of us were, especially his
parents and siblings.  When our children found out the next morning (while he
was still lost), they called each other and headed down to Arizona to help
search for him.  Sandi went with them too, I think.  Ken and I wanted to go
too, but Shellie had told us not to come as it was too far and they were many
there searching for him.  When I told Scott this, he said:  <u>“I don’t care
what Shellie said, he is our nephew and we are coming to help search for him.” </u> When
Shellie heard that, she was really touched.  We have a close family and love
and want to help each other.</span></p>

left him for that week.  Our sons and some grandsons were getting together for
a football game at David &amp; Shauna’s home, and they invited Garrett to come
and be with them.  He did go and had a good time.  I was happy they invited him
as he doesn’t get a chance to see his uncles and cousins often.  I also invited
Chelci, Steve and their children one Sunday afternoon for dinner and visiting,
so Garrett could see his cousin, Chelci, again and her family.  We enjoyed

told that he had to tell the investigators and others that he “Knew the church
was true, that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God and that our present
prophet was a true prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon was true.”  He
told them that he “Believed the church was true, etc.”, but that he couldn’t
say for sure that he “knew” it was true.  He had hoped to gain a stronger
testimony on his mission and then be able to say it was true.  They kept
insisting that he say it now, so he got upset and told the mission president he
wanted to come hope.  At least this is what Shellie told us.  She called to ask
if we could send a email to Quint to help persuade him to stay.  We did and
Quint wrote back saying he had always tried to please everyone, but now he was
going to please himself – so he came home.  Shellie was really sad, but she

background:white'>            Quint was working at Target for some time, and
finally decided his life was going nowhere, so wanted to go to college.  He
doesn’t like the sun and heat, and he loves Utah, so he called and asked if he
come and stay with us for a couple of weeks or so until he could get an
apartment close to the college and some roommates. He told us he wanted to pay
us for him staying here.  He wanted to pay us $200 or more a month, but we told
him that we would only take $100.  We told him that, of course, we would love
to have him come stay with us.  And we did love him being here with us.  It
didn’t work financially for him to live in Utah as he had hoped to get grants
and school loans, but since he was coming here from out of state and paying
three times the normal school tuition and he couldn’t get the funding he
needed, he was only able to stay here for the one semester.  He loved the
school, the campus, his classes and he made several friends.  He was always so
appreciative of the food and everything we did for him.  He always told me that
the food was so delicious, even when I didn’t think it was.  He was always
willing to do anything we asked him to do.  When we were packing to go to
Jeff’s for a few days, I couldn’t believe all that he could carry in one load. 
I guess he is strong, like his dad and brothers.  He would help me in with the
groceries and carry most, if not all, in one load.  I sure appreciated that.  I
loved, when he would come home from college, and tell me about his classes and
what he had learned.  Quint would mainly spend a few minutes visiting with us
and then go into his room to do his homework.  He would come out to eat dinner
with us and then go back to finish his homework and then call Kevis and he and
Kevis would play video games together into the wee hours of the night
sometimes.  He and Kevis have always been close, and even now that Kevis is
stationed in Okinawa, they have worked it out that when Kevis is back in his
barracks, he can still do these games with Quint.  Kevis came home on leave and
it was about the time that we were having our family vacation at Pinnacle Peaks
Resort, which Sandi and Gary had reserved for our family, so he came to Utah
with his family.  Quint and Kevis only came up one afternoon and then they left
the next morning to come back here so they could spend time together alone. 
All the family was disappointed that they didn’t spend more time with all of us
as the aunts, uncles and cousins don’t get to see them often, but I could also
understand that they don’t have much time to be together since Kevis is in the
Maurine’s. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike got a job as an assistant principle at a
junior high school.  Later he was a principal at a new junior high which had
about 3000 students.  That was hard.  The next year they changed boundaries and
the student population went down considerably so this was a much easier year
for Mike, besides he knew the staff and teachers and it was his second year
there.  The superintendency wanted him to come to the district as one of their
resource directors as he knew the law so well.  He told them he would for one
year, but then he wanted to go back to a school.  He did, and the following
year was given a assistant principal ship at another junior high school<b>.  He
is now the principal of Orem High.  </b>It is a beautiful school and he is a
great principal.  He loves the students, yet they know if they don’t obey the
rules he can give out discipline too, so they like and respect him.  He
supports them in all their games and activities.  He is really busy, and it is
stressful too especially as the world is becoming more wicked.  There have been
shootings in schools, so Mike took training and has a permit to carry a gun. 
He says he would use it too if he had to, to protect his students and
teachers.  I worry about him because of the stress and because he is a big guy,
he could have a heart attack.  He had told me before that he didn’t think he
would live beyond 40 years old.  He will be 44 on the 28<sup>th</sup> of this
month (April 2013.), so thank goodness, he has lived beyond that.  I hope he
can live to see his grandchildren<b>. HE DID!  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>Mike is now at the district office, and
it is much easier on him.  He loved the students at Orem High and most of the

come and tend their children while he took Becky with him to St. George for a
school conference, or on some other trip for their anniversary, etc.  I don’t
see this family as often, so I am always happy to go and be with these children
whenever I can.  When David &amp; Paige were young, I would take them to the
park or around the block pulling them in their wagon or sometimes David would
ride his trike.  As they grew older and as the other sisters came along, we
would usually take them bowling at least one night while we were with them. 
I’m not a good bowler, I usually put mine in the gutter as I have a curve, and
can’t seem to get the ball going down the alley straight as it curves to the
side and drops into the gutter.  Sometimes I have done better and even gotten
strikes.  It was fun watching the children bowl.  We would usually stop and buy
some ice cream at the store and go home and eat some.  When David &amp; Paige

almost to the top, the 2x4’s that were holding the jacks up from the ground,
buckled allowing the jack with the scaffolding boards to start sliding down the
roof.  Both Ken and David instantly grabbed for the ridge of the roof and David
then turned to Grandpa and said:  “What do we do now?”  Grandpa said “Go hand
over hand moving towards the still permanent scaffolding and they were then
able to get to the ladders and climb down safely.  As they got to the ground,
David made the comment:  “Grandpa, I didn’t think I could grab anything so
fast.”</p>

Henry.<b>  </b>Ken had decided to come with me as he was concerned that it
would be too much for me, and I was sure glad he did.  We had an enjoyable
time.  The baby is so cute and just mainly sleeps.  Henry is so full of life
and fun to be with.  Ken took him outside in the backyard where he blew
bubbles, that Henry just loved to chase and pop.  He is sure full of energy.  I
drove Sierra, Charlotte and Henry to a Doctor’s appointment that afternoon. 
Ken was on his computer, while we were gone, and when David returned from work,
Ken enjoyed visiting with him.  David is enjoying his work and the company that
he is working for.  They seem to have good benefits and the employees that he
works with seem to feel good with the company.  When Sierra, the children and I
returned, we told David and Ken that the Doctor said that both Henry and the
baby are doing fine.  I had made a casserole for dinner, and Ken made a tossed
salad, to go with the casserole.  David asked Ken some questions about past
experiences, which lead to some stories.  We started to bed shortly after 9PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Tuesday, May 22, 2018:  Everyone seemed to sleep
quite well last night.  David was up and gone to work early.  Henry had Ken go
outside and blow bobbles again this morning.  I made lasagna for dinner this
evening.  After David returned home from work, he and Ken got visiting about
Ken’s experiences in programming.  Of course, that led to some stories.  David
asked him about his journals and asked if he would give him a copy of his
journals that he has on his computer.   Both Ken and I have a little concern
about that, as sometimes our concerns about our family are expounded on.  But
we hope that not only will our family know his concerns, but also our love for
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Wednesday, May 23, 2018:  I didn’t sleep as well
last night, so am sure glad that Ken stayed with me, so he could help out, and
he surely does.  He helped her prepare breakfast this morning.  David gets
himself off to work as he starts work at 6AM and works a 10-hour day.  This way
he has Friday’s off.  After breakfast we took Henry for a walk and found the
play area.  There Henry had fun on the toys and even had Grandma and Grandpa on
the toys with him.   Sierra’s mom brought lunch in for us, so that was a nice
treat.  This evening I made  South Western Chicken in the crock pot.  After
dinner, David put a Bowling Game on his computer, then Henry, David, Ken and I
played a game of bowling.  I won the game.  After Henry went to bed, David, Ken
and I played a game of Rummy at which David and Ken tied, although we only
played three hands.  We quit as David needed to get to bed.</p>

hspace=12 alt=P1190185.JPG>            Thursday, May 24, 2018:  We again made
pancakes and scrambled eggs for breakfast.  Henry is sure a very bright child,
and because of it, he almost seems older than he is.  Between playing with
Henry and helping me, he did some Indexing.  Henry wanted to play with a race
car set, so Ken got down on the floor and put it together for him.  He was
tired when they quit and got up off the floor.   We got the car packed and
ready to go.  David was late coming home from work as his boss needed some
equipment moved and asked for David’s strong help.  After dinner, Mae and I
came home.  </p>

“Paige</b>” is going to Utah State University now and getting straight A’s. 
She is a beautiful and smart young woman, and works hard.  She is going into
interior design and during her senior year, she got a job in that field, but in
the summer, she received another great opportunity to work for a contractor
during interior design for the homes he was building.  He really likes the work
Paige is doing, so he continues to use her when she comes home for weekends and
even while she is in college.  <b>Paige met and dated a neat young man,
Garrett,</b> who served his mission in the Philippines. They were married in
the Timpanous Temple. In 2017, they were blessed with a beautiful little
daughter, who they named Wren. Wren reminds me of Paige when she was a baby. 
Paige was a cute little rowly powly baby, and Wren is too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>Paige is a smart, dedicated, talented,
beautiful young woman.  She has always been a sweet granddaughter.     Before
Wren was born, Paige and Garrett went on several trips, and several outside the
US.  One was to the Philippines where Garrett had served his mission.  The
Philippines had had a major Typhoon, so several of Garrett’s missionary
companions were going there to help rebuild.  Garrett &amp; Paige went also,
and Paige fell in love with the Filipino children and they loved her.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Garrett &amp; Paige just bought a home in
Saratoga Springs, which is west of Utah Lake.  Paige invited Ken &amp; I to
come and see her home and then we went to lunch at a cute restaurant at
Thanksgiving Point.  We then went to the Family History Center in Lehi.  We
sure enjoyed being with Paige and little Wren.  When we got to their home, Wren
was taking a nap.  Paige woke her, after showing us their beautiful home, and
when Wren saw me, she stretched out her arms and came right to me.  She cuddled
with her arms around me and her head on my shoulder and stayed that way for
several minutes.  <u>I loved it.  </u></p>

hspace=12 alt=P1200861.JPG><b>Maddie</b> is a beautiful young woman.  The years
fly by so fast.  She was tending their neighbor’s twins for a few years, but
they have moved now.  Maddie cleaned older sister’s home or does odd jobs to
make money to pay for her “Color Guard” uniforms, etc.  It is quite expensive. 
Mike &amp; Becky pay half, but they walk their children to be responsible and
learn the value of work, and that is good.  Maddie loves being in Color Guard,
but their coach sure expects a lot of time and effort from the girls in Color
Guard.  Ken and I spent a few nights with them, which their parents were on a
trip, and we didn’t see much of Maddie as she was up really early and had to be
at school at 6 am for practice (I think it was), and they practiced after
school.  They practice on Saturdays and most holidays.  Maddie couldn’t even go
with the family to their condo at Park City for their family vacation.  I think
Mike said she came up one evening.  That seems a little too much.  The American
Fork Color Guard usually always wins first place at their competitions – they
should with that much practice.  Becky let us know about a competition that
they were having at Roy High, and we were able to go to it, and enjoyed it.  We
watched Maddie, and she was good.   This is her junior year at high school, and
she is the captain of their color guard team this year.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Maddie is fun to talk with.  When she was young,
she was a chatter box, and Jessie was so quite, we had to pry anything out of
her.  Maddie has always loved young children and when we had family parties or
activities, you would find Maddie playing with these young children, and they
all loved her and had fun with her, and they still do  Maddie wants to become a
beautician, so wants to go to beauty school after she graduates from high
school.  She will be good as she loves to style, braid, and curl Jessie’s hair,
and does it for others too.  Maddie’s hair always looks great. </p>

little, and I was tending them, I would play the piano (my two or three little

lessons for a while, and I was hoping she would continue, but that wasn’t her

down.  Becky always had us come for dinner, and her parents would come also. 
Becky is a great cook and always served wonderful meals and had the table
looking so nice.  Now that Jessie has grown up and gotten involved in drama,
she has blossomed.  She is fun to talk to also.  Both girls have good friends,
both boy and girls and have parties, go to games, etc.  Jessie was a good
actress, and we would be invited to come and watch the plays she was in.</p>

with us, when he went to Weber University and he would come home and tell us
about his experiences and what he had learned.  He met Shauna Howard in one of
his classes and asked her out.  He was dating two Shauna’s, Shauna Jones and
Shauna Howard.  At a dance that Ken and I were there with Rick &amp; Georgia. 
David introduced Shauna to Rick &amp; Georgia.  He introduced her as Shauna
Jones.  Shauna thought he had just made a mistake, but when he introduced her
another time as Shauna Jones, she knew he must be dating a Shauna Jones too. 
He was busy with finals, so hadn’t dated either for a while, and then he wanted
to go to a dance and asked me about who he should take.  I told him to take
Shauna Howard as she was a pretty and sweet girl.  He did, and they continued
dating and eventually they were married in the Salt Lake Temple in 1994. He got
accepted to the PA Program at Pocatello University in Idaho.  We went to visit
them one time and saw squirrels scurrying all around the campus as there were
lots of trees &amp; grass on the campus.  A friend told him about a position as
a Pharmaceutical Representative which would make him great money and was still
in the medical field.  Even though David was doing great in the program and the
professors and those over his program hated to see him leave, he did join the
Pharmaceutical team and they moved to Idaho Falls.  They bought a nice home and
lived there where <b>Tyler and Emily</b> were born.  They are such cute and fun
little children and they get along so well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             In <b>2011</b>, David and Shauna made the
decision for David to apply to the University of Utah to become a PA. He had
always wanted to become a doctor or PA.   He didn’t know if he would be
accepted as he had already been in the PA program in Pocatello and dropped out
and David said that they usually don’t accept people who have been in the
Pharmaceutical Industry, but he was accepted.  He graduated with honors in
August 2013??  He has loved learning in this field and has had the high scores
in his classes.  <b>Shauna </b>graduated as a nurse before their children were
born and worked until they moved to Idaho.  A great position at McKay Dee
Hospital opened up and Shauna applied for it and got it.  She had wanted to
wait to go back to work until Connor was in school, but this opportunity was
now.  She was able to work it out that <b>her mother and I would each tend
Connor one day a week</b> and she was able to put him in the preschool at the
hospital for the other days.  I enjoyed this time with little Connor.  He was
so cute, and we had great fun going to the park, playing marbles, and many
other games.  Parcheesi was his favorite. Sometimes David or Shauna would drop
him off here and sometimes I would go there.  Shauna insisted on paying me, but
that wasn’t necessary as I enjoyed my time with him.  David is a great husband,
father and son.  We love him, his beautiful wife and special children.  David
will make a great doctor as he has a great personality, cares about people,
studies hard, knows what he is doing, and loves helping people. (It is 2017,
and David is a great PA and has almost or more patients than Dr. Harris does. 
Everyone loves him because he loves people and wants to help them, and because
he is knowledgeable and keeps on top of everything.)  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            2018</b>: David loves his work as a PA in
dermatology, working with Dr. Harris.  David is a people person and has great
skills and knowledge, so he has many patients.  Shauna is smart as well as
beautiful and she has a great job and is able to work from home.  She was a
nurse when her and David got married, and this job is in the medical field. 
They have a beautiful home in Enterprise, near Morgan.  They have three
exceptional children – Tyler, Emily and Connor.  They all get straight A’s and
help their parents keep the home and yard beautiful.  All three kids get along
great.  I have never seen them argue or fight.  Tyler &amp; Emily used to drive
together to high school.  David &amp; Shauna are wonderful parents and are so
good to us.   David invites his brothers up there sometimes to play video
games, watch a football game, etc.  Mike &amp; David have always been close and
they go on trips together, sometimes they ride their motorcycles</p>

hspace=12 alt=P1190968.JPG><b>Tyler: </b>Tyler grew up to be a smart and
talented young man.  He played most sports, but excelled in basketball and
track.  We loved going to his basketball games and he was one of their best
players.  He liked track also and was really good at it.  He did the hurdles,
long jump and high jump.  It was amazing how far he could jump on the long
jump.  Tyler always got straight “As” and didn’t have to be asked to do his
homework.  He worked for a neighbor cutting down trees and grinding them up. 
That job was kind of dangerous with their equipment, so David was able to get
Dr. Harris, who David worked with, to hire Tyler and Emily to clean their
clinic.  They have always had chores to do around their home and were taught
the value of work, so they did a great job, and this gave them the extra money
they needed.  Tyler took honor classes and college classes in high school.  He
got a Presidential scholarship to two or three universities but choose Weber as
his parents said he could live at home and save money.  David asked his dad if
he would finish his basement and he would pay him.  Ken did the framing,
plumbing and finish work and other subcontractors did the electrical,
fireplace, sheet rocking, flooring and cabinets.  It turned out beautifully. 
David &amp; Shauna told Tyler if he decided to live at home and go to Weber, he
could have his bedroom in the basement and study downstairs.  He did and is
enjoying that as well as college, and is getting straight As.  He is going into
medicine, like his dad.</p>

with them, when their parents were gone, I was amazed at how they would come
home from school, get a snack and then get right on their homework.  When it
was finished, they would do their chores or go to their jobs.  They played
video games once in a while or went with friends, but they had a balanced life.

she is a grade above her peers the same age.  With being so smart and
dedicated, she was able to keep up with the others and even excel over them. 
Emily has always seemed older than her age.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Emily started taking violin lessons when she
was young girl and has excelled in it.  She has a great talent, but it is
combined with lots of practice.  Her parents didn’t have to remind her to
practice the violin, she loved it and practiced most every day.  We have asked
her to play in our Family Christmas programs and we all loved hearing her
play.  I think it was in 2016 that we asked her to play in our ward Sacrament
Meeting and everyone was amazed at how well she played, and I kept getting
compliments on her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            She loves horses and was able to get a part time
job training horses and training riders.  For her High School Graduation
present from her parents, they took her to a place, I can’t remember whether it
was Virginia or where, to a Dude Ranch where she and her parents were fed good
food and were able to stay in nice rooms and be able to ride the horses wherever
they wanted to go on that large ranch.  The horses were well trained and very
obedient.  Shauna was nervous about riding horses, so she went where Emily was
working and had her train her the in’s and out’s of riding and being with
horses, so she loved the trip also.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Emily got a presidential scholarship, like her
brother, Tyler.  She is going to Utah Valley University?  This is her first
semester.</p>

time as Sandi used to buy Jewelry from JaNae, when JaNae was selling “Cookie
Lee” jewelry and then Mishelle started making jewelry for me.  Mishelle can fix
about anything.  Scott isn’t a handyman like his dad, but Mishelle is, and if
she doesn’t know how, she either asks Ken or looks it up on “UTube”.  Scott
&amp; Mishelle are struggling with their testimonies but take their family to
church and Scott teaches Sunday School and Mishelle serves in the Relief
Society on the activities committee.  Scott &amp; Mishelle have four special
children – <b>Kylan,</b> who is thirteen, <b>Ashley</b>, who is eleven and <b>the
twins, Kaden &amp; Kaitlyn</b> who are five.  They are a cute family. <b>It is
2017 now so Kylan is a senior,</b> has his driver’s license, dates some, still
loves RC airplanes and goes to the fling field most Saturday mornings and flies
his planes and drones (many of which he has made himself).  He wants to become
a pilot and I hope he can, and will be surprised if he doesn’t.  <b>Ashley is a
Sophomore</b> at Layton High.  She is, and always has been, a “Straight A”
student.  Friends are a problem this year because the Jr. High School where she
attended, branches out to several different high schools, so depending on where
her friends live, is where they go to high school.  This has made it hard since
most don’t go to Layton High, where she goes.  She has a Hispanic friend, which

hspace=12 alt="20180601_120207.jpg">Scott &amp; Mishelle are concerned about. 
I sure hope she can find good friends that will pull her up, not pull her
down.  Ashley is a good, sweet girl, but shy.  <b>The twins are 9 years old and
they are very active. </b> They are loud at times and it hurts Ken’s ears. 
They invite me to go to “Grandparent’s Day” at their school, and I enjoy that
time with them.  We watch them for Scott &amp; Mishelle at times.  They haven’t
been baptized as Scott has lost his testimony and doesn’t want them baptized. 
That sure makes Ken &amp; me feel bad, as they need to be taught the gospel at
home and at church, so they can gain a testimony which will help them find
peace and happiness in this life and in <img width=267 height=200

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Kylan:  </b>(Write about Kylan’s personality – so easy to
talk to, has temple, especially with Kaitlyn, love for airplanes since 3 years
old, is training to become a pilot, helps some – lawn mowing, took us and
picked us up from airport when flying to Shellie &amp; Roy’s home, helped Ken
tile our guest bathroom and laundry room floors.  Kylan’s 3D printer,  which he
can program and will make things he wants or things others want, especially his
mom.)  In picture to left, Kylan made this chess board for his grandpa so Ken’s
chess set, which we bought while on our mission to the Philippines, could fix
on it as this chess set was too big for other chess boards.  Kylan made it in
his shop class for one of his projects.  Kylan is very talented and creative.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Kylan plays the piano and keyboard from ear, and
can play about anything.   He is really good.  I love to listen to him play. 
He played the drums and other percussion instruments in the band and was very
good at that too.  He doesn’t read music, but could play these instruments
perfectly.  Scott usually let us know when Kylan was playing in a band concert
at school or in other band competitions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ashley:</b>  Ashley is a sweet, good and beautiful young

diligent and concerned about her grades.  In fact, when her parents take the
family skiing or camping, when school is on, she won’t go with them as she
doesn’t want to miss any school.  She loves the computer program “Mind Craft”
and is very good at it as she is creative.  Her and her mom are very <img

each other.  I told Mishelle that Hal and I were the same way when we were
young, and that we became close when we got older and were dating.  </p>

Mishelle found out she was pregnant, and that she was pregnant with twins and
told the children, Ashley wasn’t surprised.  When the twins were born and they
were a boy and a girl, Ashley again wasn’t surprised as she told her parents
that she had prayed to Heavenly Father and asked him to give her a sister and
Kylan a brother.  She had told him that if he only gave her a sister, then she
would be happy, but Kylan would be disappointed as he would like a brother. 
But if it was a boy, then Kylan would be happy, but she would be sad not to
have a sister, so she asked Heavenly Father to send them both a sister and a
brother.  Heavenly Father loves little children and had answered her prayer.  </p>

hspace=12 alt="029 (2).JPG"><b>Kaitlyn:</b>  Kaitlyn and Kaden were born when
Kylan was 10 and Ashley was 8.  Scott and Mishelle had wanted more children and
had tried for all these years to have more, but she couldn’t get pregnant.  I
remember when our family rented a home at Bear Lake for our family vacation and
both Gail and JaNae announced to the family that they were both pregnant. 
Later I hadn’t seen Mishelle so I asked Scott where she was and Scott didn’t
know either, so he went to the bedroom where they were staying and found her
there crying.  She was sad that she wasn’t going to have a baby.  She was happy
for them, but sad for her.  It wasn’t long after that, that she found she was
pregnant, and with these beautiful twins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Kaitlyn is a cute girl.  Her and Kaden will turn
ten this month (2018)  She loves to go with her mother to garage sales, and she
finds all kinds of cute toys, beads or other things she would like, for maybe
25 or 50 cents or a dollar.  Kaitlyn is very creative and loves to make
bracelets and other jewelry and loves to draw and make cards.  Many times,
after their family have left our home to go back to their home, I find cute notes
or cards Kaitlyn has made for us.</p>

hspace=12 alt=024.JPG>            Kaitlyn is a funny little girl sometimes as
she makes funny faces or movements, etc.  She is cute thought and has a lot of
energy.  She wears glasses as they found out a couple of years ago that she had
a lazy eye.  She was to wear a patch on the one lense of her glasses to shut
out the good eye and make the lazy eye work.  Mishelle didn’t want kids to make
fun of Kaitlyn, so she made several cute patches and the kids thought they were
neat.  She had to wear them for several hours each day.  I think she still has
to wear them for a couple of hours at night.  They have helped and she is doing
better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Kaden:</b>  Kaden is a handsome boy and was born with
beautiful long eye lashes.  He is energetic and loves to run and play.  He also
loves to play games on his phone or watch movies on it.  Kaitlyn loves to watch
movies on hers also.  I used to tend the children more often than I do now
since Kylan and Ashley are older and can be with them.  I still do sometimes as
I like to spend time with the children.  Scott does call me sometimes if the
older children are busy and they have been invited to their friend’s home for
dinner &amp; games.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have taken the grandchildren to Dinosaur Park
in Ogden, by the mouth of Ogden Canyon, for several years as I get a yearly
Grandparent’s pass for $60 and have taken all my grandchildren at one time or
another, and I have done that over the years.  Now that Jeff’s family have
moved away and the twins are getting older, I didn’t buy one last year or this
year.  The twins say they miss it.  I try to take the twins, when they are off
track, to McDonalds for lunch and then to the Layton Park to feed bread to the
ducks &amp; geese and then they play on the playground equipment.  I have taken
them to the Children’s Playhouse (I think that’s what it’s called) in Ogden,
and I have taken Paige, Maddie &amp; Jessie, when they were younger to this
place also and also Jeff’s children.  I like to do special things with our
grandchildren.  Ken has a hard time with his hearing and the grandchildren’s
voices as they are laughing, yelling and having fun, bother him, so he doesn’t
go with me to be with these grandchildren very often, but he is supportive of
me doing it.  Scott or Mishelle let me know when the twins are having
“Grandparent’s Day” at the school, where grandparents are invited to come and
have lunch with their grandchildren.  I have done this, I think every year
since they have been in Elementary School.  I probably did it with Kylan and
Ashley also.  </p>

they separated for a few months.  Jeff was the controller at the plant in Clearfield. 
He was able to transfer to the Ohio plant.  He rented the upstairs apartment of
a home there in Greenville.  It was cute as it had a screened in room where
Jeff could go and enjoy relaxing.  It also had a wrap-around porch with a
swing.  Jeff had gotten a black lab from a lady he worked with at the
Clearfield plant and took it with him.  He had a small car, so dad helped him
pack it.  If he hadn’t had the dog, it would have been much less crowded, but
we were glad he had it as we were worried about him going off by himself.  Ken
&amp; I visited him there in Ohio and had a wonderful time.  We flew there and
he picked us up.  He took us sightseeing to beautiful parks, downtown to the
small town of Greenville, and other places.  We enjoyed the cute apartment he
was living in.  It was a nice home with an upstairs and downstairs apartment. 
Jeff was renting the upstairs apartment.  The home had a nice yard and a wrap
around deck with a swing.  One night Jeff showed us the fire flies, which we
had never seen before.  Jeff let us borrow his car, during his work week, so we
could go to Nauvoo and Kirtland.  We also visited our friends, Jim &amp;
Maryann Frazer.  We stayed with him two weeks, and were sad to leave him.  We
sure hope he and Gail get back together again.</p>

hspace=12 alt="IMG_6228 (2).JPG">            Jeff &amp; Gail had two children, <b>Ben
and Rachel</b>, and Gail was expecting their third.  She didn’t know she was
expecting this baby when they decided to separate, but he (<b>Matthew “Matt) is
our miracle baby</b> as he brought the two of them back together.  They sold
their home in South Weber and Gail &amp; her children moved into her widowed
mother’s home.  During these seven months of separation, they realized they
really loved each other and they viewed marriage counseling classes on the
internet and discussed them when they talked on the phone.  They listed the
things they would expect of each other and decided they would make their
marriage work.  We are proud of them as they have a wonderful marriage now. 
Jeff came home for a visit and stayed with us for a few days.  He invited Gail
and the children to come here, and their cute little son, <b>Ben</b>, <b>wouldn’t
let Jeff out of his sight</b>.  Jeff was cute to play and wrestle with him, but
if he walked into the other room or went to the bathroom, Ben was right behind
him.  He loved his dad so much and kept saying “<b>My Dad, My Dad”.</b>  It
just broke my heart, as at that time we didn’t know if they would get back
together.  When Jeff walked Gail and the children out to the car for them to go
back home, little Ben kept saying “Come with us, dad, come with us.”  Gail told
him that dad couldn’t come home with them tonight and he started to cry.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I am so thankful that they were
able to work things out and get back together – for their sakes and for their
sweet children.  They bought a beautiful home in Layton up by highway 89.  It
is perfect for them as they live in a nice neighborhood, but the best thing is
that their back yard is part of the hollow.  The people, who owned it made a
tree house for their children, part-way down into the hollow and they build a
fire pit with log benches around it.  Further down, they put their trampoline. 
It was too hard for them to bring up, so they left it there for Jeff and Gail’s
family.  Jeff needs the outdoors to get away from the world and its stresses,
and this is great for him.  Their basement has a large family room and a large
bedroom with an attached bathroom, but the great part for Jeff, was that the
owner of the home had his office, a big room with patio doors leading out into
the covered patio, there in the basement.  The patio is covered because they
have a deck above it which is really nice, and Jeff loves that too, especially
as they have such a beautiful view of the hollow with its shrubs, trees, etc.,
and the mountains on the other side of highway 89.  I love to go there and sit
out on the deck and enjoy that beauty.  Jeff works part of the time from home,
so he loves his office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Gail </b>is such a great
daughter-in-law, she is so easy to talk with and she is a wonderful wife and
mother and the best part is that she does truly loves our son.  She told me
that he is a gentle giant.  That he is so kind, and is such a great dad.  He
plays with them, takes them special places, shows his love for them in many
ways, but he is good at disciplining them too.  Afterwards, he talks to them
and assures them of his love.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Gail was a school teacher when Jeff
married her, she taught 2<sup>nd</sup> grade and she invited me to programs her
class put on.  Gail always invites Ken and I to special entertainment or
activities, and she always treats us so good.  In 2013 (I think it was) She
wanted to take the children to Disneyland.  Jeff doesn’t like amusement parks,
like his dad, and didn’t really want to go, so he asked me if I could take his
place and go with them.  I was excited to go.  He said he would pay my way and
that it would be good for the children as Marcie, Gail’s mom, was going too,
and each of the three children would have someone to go on the rides with
them.  He said it would be great for them to have their mom and both grandmas. 
We did have a fun and wonderful time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Gail is good at having the children
do chores each Thursday.  They all work together taking turns each week, and
pretty much clean all the house.</p>

and is a peacemaker.  He loves lizards, and has most of his life.  I remember
when we would go to Zion’s Canyon for a vacation with his family, he loved to
take his net and try to catch lizards.  His dad helped him catch them and one
day when his parents went for a hike and I stayed with the children, Ben asked
me if I would help him catch lizards.  I did, and that shows how much I love
him, because I don’t like to hold lizards, snakes or anything like that, so
that was hard for me to help him that day.  Nolan, my nephew, was staying with
us there also, and he saved me when I told Ben I was tired and needed to go
rest.  He told Ben that he would help him.  Nolan’s legs and feet were very painful
for him to walk on, so that was a sacrifice for him.  Ben has had several
lizards as pets and still has a big one (Can’t remember what kind it is).  His
parents bought it and the cage for him for Christmas about three years ago. 
Ben loves to hike and climb.  He goes hiking with his dad to high peaks, he can
out hike his dad.  We feel bad that he has depression, like his dad and suffers
from it.  He likes to run now (2018) and they say that exercise is the best
thing to help depression if you don’t want to take medication, so with his
running, hiking and climbing, that should help him.  Ben loves to play with his
siblings and they wrestle together and have fun, but he hardly ever fights with
Rachel or Matt, but Matt &amp; Rachel fight a lot.  Ben takes more
responsibility with the caring of the home and yard and is now mowing their
lawn on this nice riding lawnmower.  It looks pretty fun.</p>

beds.  They wanted to sleep in our camper, so they said they would.  I heard
them again and was determined that they would go sleep in their beds.  Rachel
objected and kept pleading that they would go to sleep and please let them have
another chance.  I told her that I had already given them three changes and had
warned them the last time.  I was pulling her out and she was fighting to stay
in, it made me fall out of the camper onto their cement driveway.  She fell on
top of me, so wasn’t hurt, but I was.  She was scared and went running into the
house calling for Grandpa.  When her parents came home later (we had been

here, had great friends and neighbors.  They lived close to Gail’s mom, to us
and most of their siblings.  Jeff’s plant was dissolved and if he wanted to
stay with the company, they had to move to Texas (I think it was) and they
didn’t want to move that far away, so Jeff had to look for another job.  He was
hired as a Financial Manager at Chobani in Twin Falls, Idaho.  He has a very
good paying job there and <u>a beautiful home and yard (the picture below)</u>,
but they still wish they lived in their home in Layton where they loved it
there and were close to all of us.  We wish so too.  Jeff would call us on a
Sunday afternoon and asked if we were doing anything that evening.  When we
said “no”, he would say “Do you want to come over and play games with me and
Gail?”  We always said “Yes”, because we loved being with them and playing
games.  We would play with the children for a few minutes, then they would go
to bed and the four of us would play Rook, and other games.  We all miss that. 
They want us to come up to visit them in Kimberly as often as we can.  Jeff
told us we should come up every month for a week or more.  He even pays for our
gas.  We do go as often as we can, but it isn’t every month. </p>
