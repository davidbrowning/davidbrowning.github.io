to June 1969</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were excited to move into our home in Ogden.  The home
had two bedrooms &amp; a bath, a long kitchen and long living room and a full
unfinished basement. We had fun landscaping it and putting in our garden.  We
didn’t have sprinkling systems at that time and so we had to drag hoses, with a
sprinkler on, throughout the day.  Boy, did I appreciate sprinkling systems
when they finally came out.  Our neighbors were wonderful.  They were a lot
older than us - most old enough to be our parents or grandparents, but they
were wonderful to us.  There were two neighbors about my age and we became good
friends, but I loved all my neighbors.  Pat &amp; Ray Wiggins lived across the
street.  Pat was a dance teacher.  They only had one child, Susan.  They were
only semi active in the church.  We became good friends with them.  Pat and
Susan taught dance lessons and when Sandi was only three years old, Pat felt
Sandi would do good in dancing as her legs were strong, so we let her start
taking lessons.  Sandi did do very well.  She took lessons until we moved –
when Sandi was seven.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The Ericksons who lived next door
on the west of us had a beautiful yard and had 3 beautiful Horse Chestnut
trees.  They have such beautiful blossoms that last for a long time in the
spring - so Ken &amp; I have always wanted one.  We finally bought one in 1996
at our home in Layton - 778 E 700 S.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Brother Erickson's nephew lived with them.  He
was a bachelor and was almost the same age as Bro. &amp; Sis. Erickson.  His
name was Leonard and he &amp; Ken used to enjoy visiting over the fence and
comparing the vegetables they raised in their gardens.  One year, before
harvest time, Ken came home from work and found Leonard pulling up all his
tomato plants.  Ken asked him what he was doing and he said:  “You win, you
win.”  All his tomato plants were producing tiny yellow bell tomatoes and he
didn’t want them.  He had been sold these plants instead of the plants he
expected.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people on the east were nice people also.  They were not
members of the church, but good people.  He was a sheep herder and he demanded
that his wife fix meat, potatoes &amp; gravy for supper every night.  His
brother also lived with them.  I thought that was a coincidence.  This brother
only had one arm. (Can't remember their names).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken wanted me to stay home and raise our
children after we started having a family and I also wanted to do this.  We had
borrowed some money from Uncle Dale for our down payment on our home, so Ken
got a part-time job with a grocery store nearby, named &quot;Stop and
Shop&quot;.  He worked full-time as a computer operator at 2nd street in Ogden
(Army Depot) and enjoyed it, but they were making some changes and Ken thought
they were going to put him in the IRS dept and he didn't want that - so he
transferred to Hill Air Force Base.  He didn't work long there because there
wasn't enough work to keep him busy and he hated that.  They needed a computer
operator at Commercial Security Bank on Washington Blvd. in Ogden - so he
applied and got the job.  He worked there 7 ½ years - first as a operator, then
as a programmer, then supervisor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken had to work on crazy shifts.  The one I
remember was from 4 a.m. to 12 noon, but he worked all different shifts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We lived in the Mt Fort Ward.  For the first few
weeks we came home feeling bad because no one welcomed us there or was friendly
to us.  Ken said, as we left church one Sunday &quot;if we come next week and
no one speaks to us, we'll go to another ward. Well, the next week we had
practically everyone speak to us - at least it seemed that way and from that
time on we loved the ward. It was a ward that had all ages and we became
friends with all of them.  Pete &amp; Grace Mooney were quite a bit older than
us, but we became good friends.  Grace was a sweet lady and Pete was a
&quot;hoot&quot;.  He always kept us laughing.  We enjoyed being with them. Ken
can retell lots of stories Pete told us.  They were about 10 or 15 years older
than us, but that didn't matter.  I taught one of their daughters in MIA. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Hansen's were old enough to be our
grandparents, but they took us under their wing and were wonderful to us.  They
invited us to their home for dinner, they took us to the temple with them - to
do sealings and endowments.  That was the first time we had done sealings. 
Sister Hansen made our temple clothes for us (robes, sash, veil &amp; cap) and
she wouldn't let us pay her.  We used them from that time until 1997 when we
replaced them on our 36th wedding anniversary. - So we used them for about 33
years.  Sis. Hansen was a tall lady and so my robe never fit really well and it
would slide off my shoulder so I had to always pin it, but I never said
anything to her as I really appreciated her making them for us as a gift.  They
were special people.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another special sister was Sister Butler.  She
was a widow and had an apartment in her basement where usually the missionaries
lived.  We enjoyed her and also another elderly widow, Sister Thompson.  Sister
Thompson was a little Dutch lady - a widow and about 75 years old when we first
met her.  She lived in a basement apartment up by the church.  She had long
white hair and wore it in a bun or braid at the back on her head.  She was
really sweet and she became our second grandmother.  She was the mother to
Carol Petersen.  Alfred was Carol's husband and they lived in the ward too. 
Sister Thompson was such a sweet little sister that we really enjoyed going to
visit her or sitting by her at church, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Blaine &amp; Launa Barrows</b> became our
good friends also.  They were about our age.  She &amp; I were pregnant about
the same time.  When Ken took me to the hospital to have Sandi, they put me in a
prep room and in the room next to me I heard a lady screaming.  I got really
scared and thought &quot;Oh no, is it going to be that bad?&quot;  In fact, my
labor stopped.  The doctor, on call, gave me a sleeping pill, told me to go
home and go to sleep and if it was false labor, I might be a few more days, but
if it was the real thing, he would probably see me back later that night.  It
was the real thing, and I woke up a couple of hours later in hard labor.  I
didn't wake Ken as I didn't want him to take me back to the hospital and have
the same thing happen again.  So I waited it out, until I finally had a
showing.  I got scared and woke Ken.  I wasn't long at the hospital until Sandi
was born.  In fact, I was lucky I had the showing or I might have had her at home. 
That was dumb on my part.  Well, I found out later that the lady screaming in
the room next to mine was Launa.  She was having a miscarriage.  Blaine's hair was red and since Sandi's hair was red (strawberry blond) it was hard for her
and Blaine to see Ken &amp; I with Sandi since they had lost their little
girl.  We have seen Blaine &amp; Launa a few times since we moved and Launa
always asks about Sandi.  They did have other children though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Ken wanted to go homestead in Canada</b>.  He
tried to talk me into going.  I knew it would probably be beautiful in Canada
so I was thinking about it until one night when Sandy woke up with the croup
and she could hardly breathe and the next morning we took her to the doctor and
was able to get medicine to help her.  I knew then that I didn’t want to live
out in the wilderness where I didn’t have close access to doctors and
hospitals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Denver, Colorado and Rocky
Mountain Nat’l Park in 1962 – </b>Ken and I took Sandi and drove to Denver,
Colorado as we had heard that there were lots of jobs there for computer
operators and Ken was working at Hill Air Force Base and didn’t like it as you
had to look busy when you were not.  Ken has always been a hard worker and
wants to give a full day’s work for a full day’s pay.  It turned out that there
were not needed computer operator jobs there.  We had been misinformed.   Ken
and I couldn’t afford to stay in motels and hotels all the time so we had taken
our tent and camping equipment and we camped in the beautiful Rocky Mountains
National Park. Sandi was not quite a year old, but she was very good traveling
and camping.  We went to the Ranger talks at night and camped for a couple of
days there.  Something happened to our car, which was an Oldsmobile.  We had gotten
decent gas millage before, but since going over the mountain, we got terrible
gas millage and could hardly make it from one gas station to another.  We had
to go into a bank in Denver and draw money from our savings to make it home. 
We had to get another car and Ken was able to get us a beautiful little red
car.  I loved it and my neighbor friends and I would wash our cars at each
other’s home while we visited.  I wanted it to stay clean and pretty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>When Sandi was about two years old, we bought
a small dog, a chiwawa</b>.  It was a highstrung little dog - so we didn't have
it too long.  It was a house dog and Ken didn't like pets in the house anyway. 
One morning after getting Sandy dressed and fed, I hadn't slept very well that
night so laid down on the coach and fell asleep.  I shouldn't have done that as
when I woke up I found that Sandi had gotten into my lipstick and got it all
over the dog, herself and other things as well.  Thankfully, there wasn't too
much on the walls - anyway, it could have been worse, but wasn't very pleasant
to wake up to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another time, I remember coming into the kitchen
and hearing Sandy counting slowly and distinctly from 1 to 5 and she was
pointing at the dog with a frown on her face.  I used to count to five slowly
to her when she didn't want to pick up her toys and put them away.  I had to
laugh to myself upon seeing that.  I guess the dog didn't do what she wanted it
to do, so she was counting at him for him to obey.  I have always used that
method of discipline (along with many others) to get the children to obey.  I
don't remember ever having them not obey or complete the task when I would
count at them.  Sometimes it took for me to reach the count of 4 before they
started to move, but they did move because they knew I meant business. 
Sometimes they would look at each other and laugh when they were older, but
they still would obey.  I remember wondering what I would do if they didn't
obey, after they were older and even taller than I was.  I'm thankful that they
were respectful of me and would obey.  Maybe they knew they better because if I
told their dad, they would be in big trouble.  If Ken took off his belt, they
knew they were in trouble.  He did use it a couple of times, but usually all he
had to do was take it off and act like he would use it and it got their
attention in a hurry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>GIVING BLOOD – BIG MISTAKE:  While
living in Ogden, we had a family down the street from us, the Beus family, who
had a son with leukemia.  He needed blood transfusions and so our bishop had
asked the ward members to donate blood for this boy.  I had never given blood
before, but wanted to do this to help him.  I had another neighbor who also
wanted to give blood, so I picked her up and we drove up to the Dee Hospital,
where we were told to go.  After testing me, they said I was on the verge of
not being able to give blood, but they would still take it if I wanted to go
ahead with it.  I told them I did.  After they were through, they had me rest a
little and then had me sit up and gave me some orange juice.  After drinking
it, they asked me how I felt and I said I felt fine.  They were going to let me
go, but just then I fainted and I started into convulsions and they quickly
grabbed a wood stick to stop me from swallowing my tongue.  After I woke up,
they had me rest for several more minutes.  Then they asked if I had someone
who could drive me home.  My neighbor, who had come with me, wasn’t able to
give blood as she was anemic and she didn’t drive.  She had never learned to
drive, so I told them “no”, but I was sure I would be fine now.  We walked out
to the car and I started driving us home, but I only made it a few blocks when
I felt like I was going to pass out again, so I quickly swerved off to the side
of the road, stopped the car and threw it in park and I did pass out.  This
happened several times and my neighbor were very frightened, so was I, but I
finally got us home.  She got out and I drove into my driveway and passed out
again.  I could hardly walk and almost fainted getting to the door.  I finally
got the door open, crawled in and pulled myself up on the couch and stayed
there until Ken got home from work.  I had lots of problems for quite a while
and finally Ken took me to the doctor.  He tested my blood and told me that I
barely had enough for myself and not to ever give blood again.  I haven’t.  He
told me it would take months before I had my full strength back again and to
take it easy.  I did.  The Beaus boy did pass away.  Everyone was sad.</b></p>

hspace=12 alt="Bryce Canyon">            <b>We have had some wonderful
vacations since our marriage</b>.  The next year after we were married we went
down to the parks - <b>Bryce, Zions and Grand Canyon</b>.  It was very
beautiful and we had a glorious ten days being together and enjoying the out of
doors.  We visited my relatives on the way and tried to attend a session at the
St. George Temple, but we missed the morning session and they didn't have an
afternoon session.  The next summer I was pregnant with Sandy so we didn't take
a large vacation, but we did take trips to Idaho to visit his relatives.  The
summer of 62 we didn't take a vacation as we thought Sandy was too little, but<b>
the following summer, 1963 we went to Denver by route of the Cascade Mountains.</b> 
I had been tending Deon Mayberry's children, Jan, Scottie and Kevin, during the
summer months and she got Luane Moulton to tend them while I was gone.  We
decided to go to Denver mainly to try to find a different job for Ken as he was
discouraged with his job at the bank and we were both discouraged with our
ward.  The mountains and camp grounds were beautiful and we had a wonderful
time there, but when we got into Denver, it was so terribly hot, it was so big,
and we were running out of money due to our terrible gas millage, and there
weren't any jobs to be had in I.B.M. so we were quite discouraged and disappointed. 
Our car was running fine when we left, and we don't know what happened, but it
got so bad we practically had to stop at every gas station.  We had to stop at
a bank and draw more money out of our account in Utah.  When we got home, we
had to trade it in on another car.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The summer of 64 we decided to take short
vacations to Salt Lake and Provo just the two of us.  Mom took Sandy
for us.  We enjoyed these more than the one to Denver the year before.  We went
to shows, went swimming and ice skating, ate out, stayed in motels and just
enjoyed ourselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             This year, 1965, we took our vacation up at
Ireland Park, just a few miles from Yellowstone Park.  We camped at Buttermilk
Camp Grounds, fished with our boat in the lake, and enjoyed ourselves.  At the
first of the week, we went to Lava Hot Springs.  Bob, Carol and their kids met
us there and we went swimming and sightseeing.  We stayed there that night and
the next day and Sunday night we stayed at Rich and Lois's.  We stayed in Pocatello Monday and Tuesday, then on Wednesday we went to the Idaho Falls Temple
to do baptisms for the dead with Rich and Lois.  Afterwards we went on to Ireland
 Park.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>South Fork above Huntsville</b> –When we were
living in Ogden and Clearfield, we used to take the children camping or for a
picnic up South Fork Canyon to the campgrounds there.  It was a pretty area and
fairly close when we lived in Ogden.  One or more times, we continued on that
road up to Monte Cristo and camped there.  I didn’t like it as well as there
were large horse flies there and they bit hard</p>
