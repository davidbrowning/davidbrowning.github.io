<p class=MsoNormal>We enjoy <b>David &amp; Taylor</b>.  They are such cute
little grandchildren - so well behaved,<img width=210 height=280
src="Chapter_46_-_Grandchildren_files/image001.jpg" align=left hspace=12
alt="David &amp; Tayler.JPG"> bright and fun to be with.  Mike &amp; Becky are
doing a good job of raising these children.  Sometimes I feel Mike is too
strict on them, but he loves them and both he &amp; Becky teach them what's
right and set a good example for them and are good parents.  We are proud of
them.  (They were older, than this picture, in 1998, so were Shellie &amp;
Roy’s sons.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shellie &amp; Roy also have three such well-behaved &amp;
bright sons, <b>Garrett, Quint and Kevis</b>.  When we go down to visit them,
usually once or twice a year, we join with them in kneeling for family prayer
both night and morning.  We join with them in reading scripture each night
before bedtime, and we join with them in Family Home Evening each week.  They
take turns giving prayers, conducting, giving the lesson, preparing the
refreshments and planning games or other activities.  I am amazed at the
questions and comments they make.  They are being taught well and are special
children.  Shellie, takes the lead in seeing that these things happen, and Roy
is not always with them as he is doing projects, working late or sleeping in,
etc.  Shellie struggles with this, and we wish he was more spiritual, but he is
a good man and a good provider.  Shellie has the boys do chores too, which is
teaching them the value of work.  Since Roy is a good provider, they go on
trips, buy fun vehicles, games, etc., and have beautiful homes.  I, and
sometimes, Ken, have gone down to be with the boys while Shellie &amp; Roy take
vacations and that has been fun getting to be with these grandsons which we
don’t see as often as our grandchildren in Utah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since I'm mentioning our grandchildren, I wouldn't want to
leave out <b>JaNae &amp; Chelci</b> either.  They are beautiful girls, and it
has been great watching them grow up and attending their special events in
life.  I'm proud of Sandi.  She loves her girls and has done a lot for and with
them.  I loved tending the girls when we lived in Grantsville, but then we
moved to Firth for a couple of years and then to Arizona for nine months, but
they came to visit us in Firth and we loved visiting them.  Sandi brought the
girls and came with Grandma Jensen once while we were living there.  When we
moved to Grandma Jensen’s, I had the girls come for a week each summer and we
would have fun going swimming, making cookies, going to the Mall, playing
games, etc.  We pray for each of our children and grandchildren.  This is both
an exciting and wonderful, yet frightening world in which to live.  There is so
much goodness, yet so much evil.  Satan has a lot of power and we have to be so
careful to stay on the straight and narrow path which leads back to our
Heavenly Father.  I pray that we can all make the right decisions and live
righteously so we can be an eternal family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            David &amp; Shauna had a beautiful baby son, <b>Tyler</b>,
on Oct. 28, 1998.  We are enjoying him.  David &amp; Shauna are sure happy with
him and are wonderful parents.</p>
