TO LAYTON, UTAH – KEN’S MOTHER’S HOME AT 419 W PAUL – APRIL 1987 TO DEC. 1990</span></b></p>

hspace=12 alt="Mom Jensen's home, our family lived there for 4 years">We ended
up living at Ken’s Mother’s home longer than we had anticipated.  It was mainly
because Shellie got married, and Mike and David went on missions while we were
there and our money went for those things rather than for a home.  I know this
was a blessing, however, as I always wanted to give our children a nice
reception when they got married and I always wanted our sons to go on
missions.  We couldn’t have afforded it if we had stayed in Arizona, and if we
had rented a home, we probably wouldn’t have had the money. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Shellie</b> had come down to Arizona with her dad so she could get a job and earn money to go to the Study Abroad with
BYU to Israel.  They would be the first class to stay in the new
  Jerusalem Center.  She had read the book “One in Thine Hand by Gerald Lund,
when she was a teenager and she loved that book.  She wanted me to read it, but
I didn’t feel I had the time so she read it to me as I did other things.  I
loved it too.  It was about the Jews and Arabs.  She had the desire to go to Israel
from that time on.  When she was at BYU her Sophmore year and heard about this
travel abroad semester in Israel, she called and said she wanted to drop out of
school for now to work and earn money to go with them.  She said she knew we
didn’t have the money to help her go, and she didn’t want us to anyway – she
wanted to do it herself.  We approved of her decision.  After we moved to Ken’s
mother’s house in Layton, I was talking to a friend in Firth and they were
going up to Island Park to manage a gift shop in Max’s Inn.  She knew Shellie
and wondered if she would like to come work for them and if she wanted more
money, they were sure she could be a waitress there for the restaurant at Max’s
 Inn.  Shellie was excited with the offer.  Her board &amp; room would be
furnished.  She went and did make good money, but as she neared the end of the
summer she was worried that she didn’t have enough money to be able to go.  Her
dad told her not to give up, to keep praying and trying to do her best and if
she was supposed to go, it would happen.  He said “Don’t give up until the
plane leaves without you.”  She didn’t give up.  She had sent in her papers. 
One of the questions asked something like “Where will the money come from to go
on this semester abroad?”  She answered that she was working to earn the
money.  She received a letter with a check made out to her for $1,000. (I don’t
remember for sure how much it was) but it was the difference she needed to be
able to go to Israel.  She was so excited and so were we.  They said in the
letter that they were proud of her for earning the money herself, that the parents,
of most of the kids who were going, were paying the entire amount, and so they
were giving her this money to help her finance this semester abroad.  Wow! What
an answer to her (and our) prayers.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>While she was at Island Park, <b>Roy
Seymore</b>, who she had met and dated in Arizona and they had communicated
back and forth by phone and letters, <b>came to Island Park and proposed marriage
to her</b>.  She told him that she would, but that she had been working and
saving to go to Israel on the semester abroad which left in September and
returned in December.  She told him that this had been her goal for a long time
and she was going to go.  He understood and gave her the ring.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie finished her jobs at Island
 Park and got home just a week before she was to leave for Israel. 
  Roy came up and stayed with us as he wanted to be with her as much as
possible before she left.  They had set the date of their marriage for the 18<sup>th</sup>
of December, so that meant that we had this week to get most of her wedding and
reception planned and do as much as we could.  With Roy there, it wasn’t quite
as easy, but we did get a beautiful wedding dress &amp; veil rented for her for
that day, we talked to a caterer and decided on the refreshments, we talked to
a company who decorates for receptions and Shellie picked out what she wanted. 
We tried to be frugal, but we wanted it to be nice also, and it was.  We picked
out the material and patterns for the dresses for her maid of honor (Sandi) and
her brides maids (her friends) and her flower girls (her nieces, JaNae &amp;
Chelci). We got the engagement picture taken and the photographer lined up. 
Wow!  We accomplished a lot and I did the rest while she was gone –
invitations, etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The night before she was to leave,
she came out of her room all frantic saying she couldn’t find her passport. 
She was to leave early the next morning and this was about 10:00 pm, if I
remember right.  Roy, Ken and I all started helping her look and she was
getting more and more worried and upset.  Finally, she asked us all to leave
her room.  A few minutes later she came out with her passport and a smile on
her face.  She said she knew she needed to pray and ask Heavenly Father to help
her find it, as she knew that He knew where it was.  Right after she arose from
her prayer, she went right to her journal and there it was.  Then she
remembered that she had put it there as she knew she would be taking her
journal with her.  We were all relieved and thankful she had thought to pray.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Not long after she had gone, we
received a letter from her telling us that she wasn’t sure she wanted to marry Roy. 
She felt she didn’t know him well enough and wasn’t sure she loved him enough
to marry him.  Her dad wrote back and told her not to marry him if she wasn’t
sure, and that we would hold up the wedding plans until we heard back from
her.  He said I don’t want Mom spending the money if you’re not sure.  Shellie
fasted and prayed and we did too and she wrote back telling us to move on with
the wedding plans as she had received an answer that she was to marry him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie had a wonderful experience in
  Jerusalem, learned a lot and loved being there.  She determined that someday
she would take her husband and go back, and she did.  </p>

hspace=12 alt=60><b>When Shellie returned from Israel, she only had a week
before her wedding</b>.  Roy came up to spend the week with her.  All was going
well until one night when Ken &amp; I returned from a meeting.  Shellie was
sitting on the couch crying.  I asked her what the matter was, and she said she
didn’t know if she could marry Roy.  They had been talking and both became
upset.  Roy was downstairs.  As we talked, she said she didn’t know if she
would be a good wife and mother as she didn’t like to cook, etc.  I calmed her
down and she felt better and then I went to talk to Roy.  He was very upset as
he didn’t think she wanted to marry him.  When I explained how she felt, he
said “I’m not marrying her to be a slave for me, I will help her cook and clean
house.  I’m marrying her because I love her.”  I told him to go back up and
talk to her and he did and they worked things out.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The wedding was at the Salt Lake Temple</b> and Ken and I
were so happy that she was worthy and had chosen to be married in the house of
the Lord for time and all eternity.  We were so proud of her.  I beamed with
pride as I sat by her during the endowment and the wedding.  The wedding was
wonderful and Shellie looked so beautiful in her wedding dress.  We had pictures
taken afterward <img width=298 height=237
src="Chapter_36_-_Our_Move_to_Layton,_Utah_files/image003.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=61>and then went to their wedding breakfast at the banquet room
at Chuck-A-Rama in Salt Lake.  The reception was held at the church and it was
decorated so beautifully and everything went perfect.  There were lots of
people who attended, even more than I even hoped for.  Sandi and her daughters
looked so beautiful too.  Roy, the fathers and brothers looked so nice in their
tuxedos.  The flowers were beautiful – everything was wonderful and the best
part was that Shellie thought so too.  Roy’s parents were having an Open House
for Roy and Shellie at their church in Taylor, Arizona.  The rest of our family
couldn’t go, so Ken and I rode down with Rich &amp; Lois in their motor home. 
We paid the gas and they used their motor home.  We went on over to Disneyland
too before coming back home.  The Open House was not formal and there wasn’t a
line so the bride and groom just milled around and talked with the people who
came.  It was nice and we appreciated the hospitality that Veldon and Patsy
showed us. They are good people.  She told me that she had prayed that Heavenly
Father would find a beautiful, righteous girl for Roy to marry, and her prayers
were answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Disneyland </b>–.  Ken and I
went with Rich &amp; Lois in their motor home.  We stopped at Disneyland on the
way to Taylor, Arizona for Shellie &amp; Roy’s Wedding Open House held at Roy’s
church.  This was after Shellie’s reception in Layton.  We paid the gas for the
motor home.  This was in December of 1987.  The first time we went to
Disneyland, we took our young family and went with Larry &amp; Tammy, it was
probably 1972.  We had a great time</p>

hspace=12 alt=P1190479><b>Mike’s graduation</b> - Ken &amp; I drove up to
Firth, with our family, for Mike’s graduation from Firth High School.  It is a
small high school, so a small graduating class, but it was a nice graduation
exercises held in their school gymnasium. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Mike</b> told us soon after we
had moved to Arizona, and before he went back in the fall to Firth for his
Senior year, that he wasn’t going on a mission.  He had always wanted to go on
a mission so we were devastated.  Ken talked to him and found out that he knew
we didn’t have the money to send him on a mission – so he wasn’t going.  Ken
told him that things would work out, but he wasn’t convinced.  While he was
staying with the Mechams, Mike Mecham’s grandfather, who lived close by and was
a patriarch, asked Mike if he would like him to give him a patriarchal
blessing.  Mike did.  (I can’t remember whether we were there or not)  Anyway,
that changed Mike’s mind about going on a mission because in the blessing it
told him that he would go on a mission and that he would be able to convert
people that others couldn’t.  (Something like that).  Ken and I were grateful
for that blessing and we knew that he was supposed to go and that things would
work out for him to fulfill that mission.  We know if we trust in the Lord, and
keep his commandments; He can make things happen for our good.</p>

hspace=12 alt="Christmas at Mom Jenson's home"><b> We appreciated Ken’s mom for
her love and hospitality, but it was still hard to live with her</b>.  It was
both hard and yet good for her too.  She had been alone for several years and
all of a sudden, we move in with five of our six children.  We did pay the
utilities and buy the food, and since her home was paid for, she was able to
use this money for other things.  I did most of the cooking and cleaning. Both
of us cleaned thoroughly on Saturdays.  The boys mowed the lawns in the summer
and shoveled the snow in the winter - so we were a help to her, and it would
have been hard on us without her willingness to let us move in with her.  It
was definitely a blessing, and I think to her as well.  She told us afterwards,
how lonely she was without us.  The children got to know and appreciate their
grandmother better.  <b>Jeff had it the hardest because he was only nine years
old and grandma didn’t have much patience with him.  In fact, many times she
was mean to him</b>.  The main reason I decided I needed to work was because
Mike wanted to go on a mission and what Ken was making as a temporary employee
out at Tooele Army Depot wasn’t enough.  This was before the “equalized
system”, so foreign missions were expensive.  When our Bishop asked Ken &amp; I
how much we could put down that we would pay for Mike’s mission, we said $300.
or less.  He said “Oh, Mike wants to go abroad so let’s put $300. or above.” 
We said we could not afford more than $300, and he said “Well, the Elder’s
Quorum can help out if needed.”  So, we let it go at that and <b>Mike received
his mission call to Norway.</b>  We were all excited, but it was expensive -
$500. and it went up to $525.  The ward didn’t help pay and it was a struggle,
but we made it and were blessed in many ways.  Later, David wanted to go on his
mission when he turned 19, which was before Mike came home.  Again, we met with
the same bishop and the same senero occurred.  David was called to the
France/Belgium Mission, which started out at $525 and went to $550. Again, the
ward didn’t help out, but both Ken and I had better paying jobs, so finances
were better.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>KEN’S WORK</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When my Mom heard we were moving back to Utah
again, she told Ken about a contracting superintendent she knew that was hiring
workers.  Ken called, interviewed and was hired.  When Ken started work for
him, he found out the general contractor was a high councilman in the
Clearfield Stake when Ken was in the Bishopric with Kent Murdock.  That was
years earlier so he doubted if the contractor remembered him.  <b>Ken was able
to have Mike work with him</b> and they first framed a home in Roy. 
The material was delivered on the job and they started laying out the plates
for the walls.  That was about as much as they got done the first day, but
because the bunks of 2x4s had the shipping bands broke on them, before leaving
the job site, Ken took a can of red spray paint and sprayed two stripes across
the bunk.  The next morning when they came, it was obvious that someone had
taken quite a few boards.  Ken called the superintendent who called the Roy
police department.  A Police officer soon arrived on the job site and asked if
they could identify any of the material to which Ken told them that part of the
2x4s would have 2 red stripes on them and he showed the officer how he had
marked the outside boards of the bunk.  A little later, the superintendent came
over to the job site and said that the officer had driven down through the
neighborhood a ways and saw a new garage being constructed.  He went inside the
garage and inspected the walls and there were several of the studs in the wall
that had the two red stripes on them.  The superintendent told Ken that the
officer called him and told him that he had found where our material was.  He
met the police officer at the address and told the police officer what he would
take for selling the material to the man, which was double the price he could
have bought it out of the store for, but because of the inconvenience and delay
in work, he added that to it.  The officer told the man that he could pay it
and there would be nothing more done, but if you don’t pay it, I will arrest
you and take you into jail.  The man paid it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Snowbird </b>– Bryce &amp;
Deanna have a condo at Snowbird.  They let us use their condo a couple of times
when they were not able to use it.  One-time Ken &amp; Mike couldn’t go as they
were working on a house, so I took David, Scott &amp; Jeff.  Scott &amp; I got
up early Sat. morning and hiked to the top of the mountain and rode down on the
tram.  Jeff and David wanted to sleep in, so didn’t go.  Scott likes to hike
and I wanted to go, but halfway up the mountain, Scott got tired and wanted to
go back.  I told him we were halfway so we needed to go the rest of the way so
we could ride the tram free, which we did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>The second home that Ken and Mike built</b>
was in a new subdivision just south of the Hill Air Force Base runway.  As they
were framing the interior basement walls, several times during the day, jet
planes would leave the runway and would immediately climb in altitude which put
the roar of the jet going right down into the basement and almost deafening
them with each jet that took off.  Towards quitting time, the lady for which
they were building the house for stopped by to see how they were doing.  Ken
mentioned to her the deafening of the jet roar.  She kind of laughed and said
“Do you know the reason for them taking off that way?”  Ken said he didn’t. 
She worked for Hill Air Force Base so explained that those jets that come off
and then climb like that is the first flight that the plane has made since the
engine was overhauled.  The pilots of those planes receive extra pay for flying
those planes the first time.  When the pilot takes off, as soon as the tail of
the plane will clear the runway, he immediately drops it into a straight climb
up so that he can gain as much height as he possibly can and then he rolls the
plane to the west and flies over the Great Salt Lake.  By doing this, should
the plane have a flame out, the pilot should be able to have enough altitude
and speed so that he can either come back around and land on the runway or
ditch the plane in the Great Salt Lake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike and Ken finished the framing of the
stairwell from the main floor to the upstairs floor and then began laying out
the floor joists.  They had about half of the floor framed before quitting
time.  That evening, the superintendent called Ken at home and told him that he
had put the wall between the front room and the kitchen wall three feet off. 
Ken told him that it was exactly where the plans called for it, to which the
superintendent said “Well, let’s not argue about it on the telephone, but I’ll
meet you in the morning at the job site and we will try to figure out what
happened.”  The next morning as they met, the superintendent pulled out his
plans and pointed out where the wall was supposed to be.  Ken just opened up
his set of plans and told him that that’s not where my plans says it is to be. 
The superintendent took the plans from Ken and turned to the front page and
exclaimed: “Oh no, I gave you the wrong set of plans.”  They determined there
was nothing they could do but to move the wall three feet.  Ken explained to
the superintendent that half of the floor joists had already been cut and
nailed in place for the second floor.  As they looked over the plans, they
determined that the joists that had been cut, that would now be too short,
could be used on the second half of the second floor and cut more for the first
half.  Ken told him that that would take at least a day’s worth of work, plus
he would go through a good many Sawzall blades.  The superintendent said he
would figure out a way to make it up to Ken, but would prefer that the general
contractor didn’t know the mistake.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>About this same period of time, Ken
got a call from the personnel dept at Tooele Army Depot asking if he could come
and apply for a position.  Terry Matthews, who is over the maintenance and
grounds division, wanted to have him come to work for them.  Terry was a
personal friend of ours and we had gone out to an Erda Ward Reunion, where he
had talked with Terry and told him that we had just moved up from Arizona.  Ken asked the person from the personnel dept, that had called him, how soon they
would need him to start work?  He told Ken that Mr. Matthews would like him
just as quickly as possible.  Ken told him that he had at least two more weeks
of work on the house that he was presently framing and he wouldn’t leave it in
the middle of the job.  The person told Ken that they needed him before that,
so Ken told him that he wouldn’t be able to accept it.  The next evening, the
personnel dept called Ken back and said that Mr. Matthews said that that would
be ok and they asked Ken if he could find time to come out and take a physical
and turn in an application, to which Ken said he would.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>As Ken and Mike finished up the
house, the superintendent talked to Ken about the extra money that he would owe
him for the mistake in the plans and so he wanted to have Ken &amp; Mike work
on a Saturday, when the house was all but completed and add a red wood patio
deck, which Ken agreed to do.  A little later the superintendent got a hold of
Ken and said they were ready to put the patio on, so he would order the
materials for the following Saturday.  Ken told him to not have it delivered
until Saturday morning.  The following Saturday morning, Ken and Mike went over
to frame the patio and the material had been delivered Friday night but all
that was left was just the steel strapping bands and a set of truck tire
tracks.  Ken called the superintendent to let him know what had happened.  The
superintendent told him that he would see what he could get worked out, but a
couple of weeks later, Ken happened to meet him at a gas station and he talked
with him.  He apologized that he hadn’t been able to get him any money.  He
said that the general contractor had fired him using the loss of that material
as an excuse.  In reality, the superintendent hadn’t received pay for over two
months, nor did he get paid for any other outstanding expenses for any of the
jobs he had been running.  Because of this, he had to sell his back hoe to
clear several of the bills in which the company had refused to pay.  The
superintendent said he would pay it out of his own money, but he was now on the
verge of bankruptcy himself.  When Ken had first signed up with the
construction company, one of the conditions was that he put a certain percent
of his wage into a company profit sharing.  None of the employees of the
company received that money back because the owner took out bankruptcy on the
company. Boy, that contractor was a crook.  There are too many crooks in the
contracting industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Another incident with this house is
after they had framed the second-floor exterior walls, they put a glue lamb
beam from the north peak of the roof to the south peak of the roof.  That beam
would be the baring beam to hold all of the roof joists.  <b>While Ken was
studying the plans, Mike was just standing there and saw a bird land upon this
beam.</b>  He removed a 16-penny nail from his apron and much to his surprise,
hit the bird some 16 feet above and the bird fell directly down to the floor
and just laid there.  Mike kind of stammered in disbelief saying: “I didn’t
think I would come close enough to even scare it, let alone hit it in the head
and knock it out.”  The bird lay on the floor for a minute or so and then began
to shake, stood up and flew away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> Ken was called to start work<b>
for Tooele Army Depot in the maintenance dept.  Ken later became a
planner/estimator. </b> After three years they had a large reduction due to
most of the depot closing down, and Ken was one of those to go.  He then went
to work for <b>Fieldcrest Cabinets as a salesman</b> for a few months and even
though he feels they are the best cabinets built, and continues to recommend
them to people today, he had to quit because they didn’t give their salespeople
a large enough percentage to make a living.  About that time, <b>my brother,
Kim Byron, talked Ken into selling for Beneficial Life Insurance with him</b>. 
Kim likes selling insurance and does very well, but Ken, after trying it for a
few months, decided that wasn’t for him either.  Soon after that he applied for
the <b>Maintenance Director position at the Five Points Mall in Bountiful,
 Utah</b>.  He was hired, and enjoyed working there.  He oversaw the cleaning
people and the gardener and he made repairs on the mall, etc.  Russ was the
manager and did not have the back bone to stand up to the man who lived in Boise,
 Idaho and was the Owner’s middleman between them and Russ.  This man didn’t
want to spend any money.  At first, they did do some renovation, but towards
the end, he wouldn’t even pay to have the roof repaired and it got so bad that
Ken just had to take buckets to the shop owners when it rained.  Ken had a
helper working with him, John.  He was a good worker too and he knew karate. 
They had gang members spray painting graffiti on the outside walls of the
mall.  Ken or John had to sand it off and repaint it.  Finally, John, found out
the name and address of the leader of the gang and went to visit him.  He told
him that if they ever found graffiti on the walls of the mall again, he would
personally come and clean the walls with his body.  This was a large Samoan
youth and he knew John was good at karate, so it never happened again.  John
loved his wife and 2 daughters, but later his wife told him that she was a
lesbian and wanted her girlfriend to move in with them.  Of course, John was
devastated and told her “no” and they got a divorce.  Anyway, Ken finally got
fed up with the mall and quit.  He found a job with <b>Cape Construction</b>
and he gained lots more experience there as he built a large commercial
building in Clearfield, among many jobs and they also had him over their commercial
Center in Clinton doing all the underground cables, etc., for electricity,
water, sewer, phones, etc.  That was quite a project.  They were to put in an
Albertson’s store and many others.  The owner of Cape Construction fired Ken,
because he didn’t want to pay him the $28,000., he owed him for bonuses.  Ken
didn’t make a big salary, but was promised big bonuses.  Two weeks earlier he
had told Ken that he was his most valuable employee.  Why would you fire your
most valuable employee? – Because of money.  That was hard for both Ken and I. 
Utah is one of the states where you can fire a person without cause.  Ken took
a job with <b>Recon Construction</b> and worked there until he retired at age
62.  He then did <b>handyman jobs for family, extended family, friends and
others</b>.  He didn’t make much money, but it sure kept him busy<b>.  </b>Ken’s
last job, and one which he still works at (2013), is a <b>school bus driver.</b> 
He had driven past a K Mart store in Bountiful and there was a school bus
parked in the parking lot with a big sign on that said “Sub school bus drivers
needed”.  Ken decided this would be much easier than doing handyman and a
construction job so he applied, was hired and they wanted him to be trained
immediately.  Ken is good at whatever he does, and this was no exception.  He
has told me some of his experiences and I have said “No way could I ever do
that.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> I had two friends in Erda –
Eleanor Brown and Sally Matthews, who were school bus drivers and they told me
I should do that.  I said “No thanks, if I go to work it will be a secretarial
job because I love that, but I am not a good driver and I certainly don’t want
to be responsible for the children on the school buses.”  </p>

hspace=12 alt="DSC03153 (2)"><b>Another reason for going to work was I couldn’t
stand to be home with Ken’s mother all day</b>.  She is a wonderful person, but
very negative.  She complained a lot and was also strict in many ways.  I hated
to not be home when Jeff &amp; Scott got home from school, but I was naive at
that time and thought that Grandma would be ok with them until I got home, but
tragically she wasn’t.  If I had known then what I know now, I probably
wouldn’t have gone to work, although I don’t know how we would have made it
financially and with me working, we were able to qualify for a loan to get our
home later.  Ken’s mom was an emulate housekeeper and so she didn’t like Jeff
playing anywhere except in his room and she wanted all the children to keep
their rooms clean.  She didn’t want Jeff to bring his friends over.  (Ken said
he was never allowed to bring his friends over when he was growing up. They
could go over to friend’s homes sometimes or else play outside, but not in her
house because she didn’t want them to mess it up.)  I had a hard time with that
and stood up to her - so Jeff did have his one friend over a few times.  I had
to stand up for Jeff a lot, and it was her, not Jeff that was the problem. 
Many times, when I would come home from work, I would see “fire” in her eyes
and I knew she was upset about something.  I would like to have avoided the
confrontation, but I had to work it out with her since it was her home.  We had
brought the children’s dog with us when we moved up.  She had consented to it,
but soon she was upset because of the dog mess.  Ken &amp; I instructed the
children that they were to gather it up each day.  She was also upset that it
dug in the dirt a little - so it wasn’t worth it and we had Shellie take the
dog up to Island Park where she was working.  After Shellie was married she
gave the dog to Roy’s parents.  One Saturday Ken’s mom was really upset and had
lit into Jeff.  When I found out what it was (it seems like she was missing
some spoons and accused Jeff of playing with them outside and losing them.) 
Jeff didn’t play with spoons.  I went outside and found her working in the
yard.  After she got through spouting off, I just said to her <b>“It’s too bad
that you care more about</b> <b>things</b> <b>than you care about people,
especially your own grandson</b>”, and I walked back inside the house.  She was
nicer after that - at least for a while.  </p>

hspace=12 alt="Scott, David &amp; Jeff at home - Grandma Jensen's in Layton">She
had told us when we moved in that it was not just her home, but it was to be our
home as well.  We appreciated that, but she never let anyone else think that. 
She always made it absolutely clear to the neighbors, ward members, family,
etc., that it was “her home”, not ours, and we were living with her.  After we
had moved into our home in Layton, I found out from either Scott or Jeff (can’t
remember which) that Jeff had used some of our notebook paper to make paper
airplanes or use at targets, etc.  They said that grandma became so upset with
Jeff and said “why are you wasting your parent’s good paper?  Don’t you know
that they don’t have much money?  In fact, if it wasn’t for me letting all of
you come live with me, you would be out on the streets.”  When they told me
that, I was furious.  We would not have been out on the streets.  We were not
that poor, and Ken is a good provided, he would have done whatever it took to
get us either a home or apartment and I was working too and we could have made
it.  It would have been a struggle, but we would have been alright.  It just
made it easier for us since we had had financial problems in Arizona, to move
in with her to get back on our feet.  I was shocked that she would say such
things to our children<b>....  Scott was older and she wasn’t so hard on him,
in fact, he stood up to her several times for Jeff when we weren’t there.  I am
thankful he did and Jeff felt that Scott was his “hero” for doing so.  One
incident which Jeff wrote in his journal was a particularly hard day for Jeff
with Grandma.  Grandma had been yelling at Jeff and Jeff was crying.  Scott was
downstairs and heard it all and came running up the stairs and lit into his
Grandmother for doing that, and told her that Jeff was a good kid and that she
better never talk like that or act like that to him again.  Jeff said that
meant so much to him for Scott to stand up for him, and his love and admiration
for Scott grew so much that day.</b></p>

Scott &amp; Jeff had only gone to school for half the year.  <b>David was a
Junior, Scott was in the 8<sup>th</sup> grade and Jeff was in the 4<sup>th</sup>

and Jeff at Lincoln Elementary.  They finished out the year at these schools. 
Scott met some friends in the ward and they had fun together, so it wasn’t so
hard on him. It was especially hard on David so when we all went to Firth <img

hspace=12 alt=65>for Mike’s graduation, David’s friend, Jared Leavett and his
mom and dad came up to us and said “You let Mike come back for his senior year
and live with the Mechams, will you let David come back for his senior year and
live with us?”  David was excited as he really wanted to do that.  The Leavetts
were good people too, and we had felt bad for David, so we agreed.  I had paid
$50.00 a month to the Mechams to help with Mike’s groceries so I insisted on paying
that to the Leavetts also.  We went back home and David got a job at the
Safeway Grocery Store which was only a few blocks away.  It was by the Layton
Hills Mall.  I think he worked in the produce dept, but I’m not sure.  He was a
hard worker, dependable and they liked him. In the fall, he did go back to
Firth.  Jared had a girlfriend so was with her most of the time, so David &amp;
his friend, Scott, did a lot together.  That caused some problems with Sister
Leavett so it wasn’t as enjoyable a year as it was for Mike.  David really
liked Brother Leavett as he was kind and understanding.  David didn’t go to the
Junior Prom there as he said he couldn’t afford it.  I wish I had sent him the
money</p>

just made it.  They say the mothers should get a lot of the credit as they
encourage, prod and help their boys to get these awards.  My mom kept prodding
me to have our sons get these Eagle awards, even though her sons didn’t get
theirs.  I guess Mike &amp; David wouldn’t have gotten their Eagle Scout awards
if I hadn’t done this as they were not motivated to do it on their own.  They
didn’t have great experiences in the scouting program and didn’t have great
scout masters, like some do.  They put Ken in at one time, while Mike &amp;
David were in Scouting in Grantsville, and I was excited as I knew Ken would do
a great job, but soon after we moved again – this time to Firth, Idaho.  <b>Mike
received his Eagle Scout award in Firth and David got his when we were living
in Layton with Ken’s mom</b>.  Because Mike &amp; David didn’t like scouting,
they turned Scott and Jeff off, so they didn’t finish theirs.  Scott only
needed his Eagle project and one other merit badge to get his.  His scout
committee chairman was Brother Cottle, and he wanted Scott to finish it and was
trying to help him and had a project all arranged for him, but he wouldn’t do
it.  I tried to convince him to do it, especially since he was this close, but
he became upset and said “I don’t want it”, so I told him that if he didn’t
want it, I wouldn’t say another word about it, but I told him he might regret
it.  I started working with Jeff early and took him to his merit badge classes
and he was doing great, but then he quit and I couldn’t get him to keep working
on it.  A few months before his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, he asked me about it
and said maybe he would finish it, but you have to wait a certain amount of
time to go from one level to another and he didn’t have enough time.  I felt
bad about it.  </p>

savings account and he could pay for his mission until Mike got home and then
we could take it over.  We had Mike earn enough money to buy his clothes,
luggage and what he needed to leave on his mission and we paid from then on, so
we wanted each of our sons to do that.  David did that plus paid 2 or 3 months
of his mission.  I found out later, that Ken had told David that we would pay
him back after he returned from his mission as David was planning to use that
money to go to college.  I didn’t know about that – at least I sure don’t
remember either of them talking to me about it.  We didn’t pay David back, Ken
told him we couldn’t afford to pay him back.  David has resented that and I
don’t blame him, but I didn’t find out until years later and it made me sad to
find it out.  Many young men earn their own money and pay for their missions,
so I just thought that David felt fine about paying for the 3 months.</p>

hspace=12 alt="71 - Copy"> <b>David mission call was to Belgium and France.</b> 
It was hard for him to learn French at the mission home, but when he got out on
his mission, he did great with learning the language.  It was a hard mission as
far as baptisms.  It was also a hard mission for David since his mission
president wanted baptismal numbers, so David’s zone leaders told him that when
he was teaching investigators, that if they were not living the law of
chastity, then they told him not to teach that lesson, and if they were not
living the Word of Wisdom, then don’t teach them that lesson.  David told them
that he couldn’t do that, that he knew that’s not what the Lord would have him
do.  They said “You better or you will never be a zone leader.”  David told
them that he wasn’t worried about that, but that the investigators needed to
know the truth and be fully converted.  David said it was hard to bring
investigators to church as there were drug addicts there and all sorts of
undesirable people so he felt the investigators wouldn’t want to belong to this
kind of a church.  (David might correct me on some of this, but this is how I
remember it when he told us after getting home from his mission.)  David’s
first mission president’s time to go home came up while David was still there,
and his second mission president was much better and did want the investigators
to be taught all the lessons.  He was a good example and we wish he had been
David’s mission president the entire time David was there.After Mike came home
from his mission, he was able to get a good job working for a company who
harvested the brine shrimp from the Great Salt Lake.  Their grandma Porter had
told him about this.  When David came home from his mission, he was able to
work with Mike harvesting the brine shrimp too.  It was hard work, but they
made good money.  Mike &amp; Becky spent their first Christmas holidays out on
the Salt Flat watching over the equipment there and staying in a house
trailer.  They said they enjoyed it, even though they missed out on being with
family.</p>

contract and our high councilman over the farm had the contract and knew Ken
had been a contractor and he had seen the beautiful basement Ken had finished
for our home. He knew Ken wasn’t busy on the farm during the winter so asked if
he would go.  He did so Christmas morning we put up the trampoline and the
children were so excited.  All of the children loved the trampoline, but Scott
is quite a gymnast and learned to do forward flips, backward flips, etc.  When
we moved to Layton, we set it up in Ken’s mother’s back yard and Scott &amp;
his friend, David, would play on their trampolines as David had one also and
they got really good at doing tricks.  They were in an assembly and their dad’s
took both trampolines to the Junior High and set them up at the back of the

trampoline to the other and passing each other doing all kinds of flips.
