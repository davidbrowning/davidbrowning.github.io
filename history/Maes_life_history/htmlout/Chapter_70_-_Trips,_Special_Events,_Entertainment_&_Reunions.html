<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fish Lake by Zion’s Canyon</b> - when we went with our
family (Shellie, Roy &amp; family went also).  We had never been to Fish Lake,
but heard it had beautiful campgrounds and a beautiful lake.  I’m not sure if
it is the same Fish Lake that we go to now with Sandi &amp; Nick.  If it was,
we missed the campgrounds and ended up in some mountains north of the lake and
it was not very pretty and not a good camp site, but we had fun anyway.  I
don’t think we even went to the lake as we didn’t have a boat at that time. 
One day we found a skunk in camp, so we all took off for a walk hoping that
when we got back, it would be gone.  We had mice climbing all over in our tent
trailer at night, so that wasn’t fun. Ken and I had to go into the nearest town
to get some Decon to kill the mice.  We took some of the kids and their spouses
in the back of our truck to the narrows at Zion’s Canyon.  They had a fun time.
We watched the grandchildren.  We didn’t have a desire to go to Fish Lake again
until Nick wanted us to go there.  We are glad he did as we have loved it, it
wasn’t the same Fish Lake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Betsy Browning, Ken’s nephew, Devin’s wife, loves Family
History.  She has put in so much time, and has done so much for the Browning
lines and her lines.  There is a park, west of the train via dock, where she
was able to get the original Steven Abiel Browning’s home (Ken’s grandfather)
and put it in this park</b>.  She told us about all the interesting things
there and how beautiful it is.  She takes people on tours there, so we set it
up for her to take our family on a tour there.  I should have written this down
earlier as I don’t remember how many of our family went. It seems like David’s,
Scott’s and Jeff’s families went.  We went on a Saturday and took our lunch. 
It was beautiful there with lots of tall trees.  There was an Indian village
with the teepees and clothes they wore and items they used.  I think we all
enjoyed the time we spent there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Hill Reunions</b> (Ken’s family) These were usually held in
the canyon above Victor, Idaho<b>.  </b>Each family had their own campsite, but
there was a big area with logs around a fire pit where we met for our campfire
programs.  They usually asked me or Jackie to lead them in some songs and Ken’s
mom and her siblings would tell memories of growing up with their parents. 
Sometimes they had a talent night around the campfire and I remember Uncle
Irven &amp; Aunt Bernice doing “Hole in the Bucket, Dear Lisa, Dear Lisa”. 
They were dressed up in hill billy clothes and Uncle Irven had a bucket with a
hole in it.  I remember Uncle Albert telling stories.  We always enjoyed being
together and Ken and his cousins were glad to see each other again as they had
grown up together and stayed at each other’s homes during the summers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Browning Reunions – </b>The first Browning reunion that I
went to was held shortly after Ken and I were married and was held at the park
in Pocatello, Idaho.  These first reunions were the Steven Abiel Browning
Reunion (Ken’s grandfather, who he never knew in this life, Charles’s father)
When we got there, dad Browning’s children, from his first marriage were all
there with their families and Cleo came up to me and gave me a hug and said
“Welcome to our family, Mae.”  He was old enough to be my father, but here he
was Ken’s half-brother.  Dad Browning’s children from his first marriage are
Geneva whose husband was Clyde.  Geneva was about the same age as Margaret,
Charles’s second wife and Ken’s mother.  Cleo was the next oldest and his wife
was Norma. Florence, they called her Floss and her husband Keith, and Richard,
everyone calls him “Rich” and Lois.  Rich and Lois are the ones we have been
close with, but the others are all wonderful people who have raised wonderful
families.  They have all both since passed away, except Lois, as I am writing this
in 2013.  Anyway, we had a great time getting acquainted.  It was just an
afternoon reunion.  We all brought food and shared it and we took family
pictures.  Ken’s sister, Margaret, had gone to the restroom at the park and no
one realized she was missing when we took the pictures and when she came back
and found out we had already taken the pictures without her, she was very upset
and went off by herself.  Ken’s mom ran to her, but she couldn’t be consoled
and thought we had done it on purpose.  Why would anyone do that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had other Browning Reunions held at the park
in Pocatello.  I don’t remember a lot about those other than Ken’s second
cousin, Kay browning and his wife were there.  They are great people and they
live in Sunset.  He was an Allstate Insurance salesman.  .Also, there were
those I did know which were Rich, Lois &amp; their family, Roy, Linda &amp;
their family, Irven, Sandy &amp; their family and our family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Charles Browning Reunions</b> - We hosted a Browning
Reunion at our home when we lived in Firth, Idaho as we had five acres there so
there was plenty of room for tents, etc.  We played relay games, and other
games, had lots of activities for everyone, good food, and lots of visiting. 
Irven &amp; Sandy hosted one at their home in Goshen also.  We didn’t have them
for a couple of years and then Irven &amp; Sandy hosted one up a canyon in Salt
Lake, I believe.  Lots of the family came.  That’s the time I mainly grew to
know Larry, Ken’s nephew, who is older than Ken.  He is Cleo &amp; Norma’s
son.  Ken said that one time he was with Larry and they ran into Larry’s
friends and Larry introduced Ken to them as his “Uncle Ken” and he was much
younger and smaller than they were.  He said he was embarrassed.  Again, we had
lots of good food, visiting and evening programs around the campfire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The next three or more years, the reunions were
held at Ken’s niece, Carla and her husband, Craig’s home in Victor as they had
a large home with huge lawns.  Most of us came on Friday night, stayed the
night either in their home or in tents on their lawn and the next day was
filled with good food, laughter, visiting, games, etc.  It’s always good to be
with family.  We haven’t had a Browning Reunion since that time.  Irven &amp;
Sandy were talking to their daughter, Christine, and she knew of an area where
we could have one, but she was too busy this year and so were all of us, so we
didn’t have one. Linda cornered David this summer and asked if he would head
one up.  He said everyone would have to help him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>BUSHNELL REUNIONS:  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My mother was the first of her family to get a reunion going
for her parents and Mom’s siblings and their families, a Bushnell Reunion.  I
remember helping her with it and we held it at the Sunset Park, just below Mom
&amp; Dad’s property in Sunset, Utah.  The family came on Friday and part
stayed with Uncle June &amp; Aunt Marilyn in Bountiful, some stayed with
Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell and some stayed at our home.  The next day was
spent at the park with good food, games and activities and a talent show in the
evening.  After church we had a great meal and then we had family pictures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             The family decided to hold the reunions every
three years.  Since Mom is the oldest of Grandpa &amp; Grandma’s children and
she held the first reunion, they decided to go to the next oldest, which was
Uncle Elmo and his family would do the reunion in three years.  It was held in
Tropic at the park.  Many brought tents and were able to pitch the tents on the
lawn at the park.  They had a log building at the park and we held some of our
activities there.  One that this family added was a family auction, where every
family was supposed to make at least one or more items to sell at the auction
and the money would be used to help with reunions.  Koye and Keela helped their
parents.  We all had lots of fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Uncle Van was a professor at the college in
Cedar City and the college owned property and a lodge up Cedar Canyon.  The
faculty were able to reserve it, so that is where we held most of our Bushnell
Reunions after that until it was our turn again.  Uncle Farrell had passed away
and Aunt Joyce, his wife, didn’t want the responsibility of doing a Bushnell
Reunion, so it skipped to Aunt Joy and their family held it there at the lodge
in Cedar Canyon.  Uncle Van’s family was the host family for the next reunion
and of course, he held it there.  It had plenty of space for RV’s, tent
trailers, tents and the lodge had a nice large room with a fireplace, a
kitchen, bathrooms and a few bedrooms – some downstairs and some upstairs, so
that generation stayed in the lodge.  Uncle Van loved a big breakfast with
pancakes, bacon, eggs &amp; juice and the lodge had big grills to cook on.  We
had the same things as the other reunions with the auction, talent show and
other activities and good food.  I think Uncle Van had some of the meals
catered.  I know he did at the later reunion they were over and held there. 
Jeff, Chad &amp; Brady were just little guys at that reunion and we have a cute
picture of the three of them together as they came back from climbing partway
up the mountain.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Uncle June’s family helped our family put on one
reunion and we added colored T shirts. A different color for each family and it
said, “Bushnell Reunion” and the date on the back of the shirts.  Uncle June’s
family was over the T shirts and helped us with other activities, especially
the auction.   That’s the only reunion I remember Uncle June’s family doing. 
They were planning on doing one six years ago, but they were going to do it
together with Uncle Farrell’s family.  Aunt Joyce had passed away and so had
Dwaite, their only son, but Pat &amp; Bonnie said they would do it.  The two
families had problems as Uncle June’s family, Paula &amp; Nancy mainly, wanted
to have it in Idaho, but Pat &amp; Bonnie wanted to hold it in Meadow at the
park and church there.  I guess Paula &amp; Nancy became so upset about it,
that they just said to themselves, then let them do it themselves and they
didn’t come to the reunion, none of Uncle June’s family did.  Uncle June had
passed away by this time too.  Pat &amp; Bonnie hosted the reunion in Meadow. 
They had wonderful meals with a big breakfast like Uncle Van and everyone
likes.  They changed things some, they had Uncle Van take us on a tour to the
white sands and the warms springs where Mom and all her siblings were
baptized.  She had Uncle Van and Aunt Joy tell us about their lives and what
they did here in Meadow as they were growing up.  They then turned it over to
all of us if any of us wanted to tell memories of being with grandpa and
grandma.  We did have a wonderful time and they did a great job of hosting it,
but we all felt bad about the problem and that Uncle June’s family didn’t
attend.  I don’t think they attended the one which Keela hosted in 2009 either,
so Uncle Van asked me if our family could host the next reunion and they would
do the following one.  He asked me if I would make a special effort to get
Uncle June’s family to our reunion including Uncle June children from his first
marriage – Danny &amp; Kristy’s family.  Danny had passed away recently with a
heart attack, so I called his wife, Ann and talked to her.  She was nice, but
said they wouldn’t be coming.  There are problems with that family as Danny
&amp; Kristy were not included in Uncle June’s will and Danny was very close to
his dad and would visit him often, yet his second wife’s children – Paula &amp;
Nancy and his children by his second wife, Steve &amp; Jana, got everything. 
This was very hard on Danny and also his sister Kristy.  They and their
families don’t want anything to do with the other family now.  I think that is
so sad.  I don’t know why Uncle June didn’t include Danny &amp; Kristy.  I
guess Uncle June has had to face Danny now that they are both dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom was still alive when it was our turn to put
on another Bushnell Reunion.  We decided to have it up our way since it had
been down in Southern Utah for several times.  Mom knew a lady who had a ranch
up past Huntsville.  They rented it out for family reunions I helped Mom a lot
with this reunion.  She got the place and helped me plan some of it, but I was
mainly in charge and felt the responsibility of it.  Ken, Mom and I went up to
the ranch to look at it and I was excited as there was plenty of room for RV’s,
trailers, tent trailers, tents, etc.  It had a covered cooking area with
grills, etc. It had a pond with canoes.  It had corrals where we could have a
children’s rodeo.  They had a large covered pavilion where we ate and visited,
and Sandi taught line dancing to most of us and the older ones sat around and
watched.   It had a huge shade tent where we visited, and had programs.  I was
able to contact a man who belonged to a group which loved Mountain Men, so they
had the costumes, rifles, etc. and he came and demonstrated everything
including Indian memorabilia.  He told us all about the Mountain Men.  He was
very good.  The couple told us that he could take whoever wanted on a wagon
pulled by horses, up the mountain and around the ranch.  I contacted all my
aunts, uncles &amp; cousins and asked them to write a paragraph or a page
telling about their family and send it to me as I was making a book with all
this information and I added camp and other old songs for us to sing, histories
of Grandpa and Grandma, etc.  We did a Dutch Oven Dinner for the Saturday night
meal.  Sandi was still married to Dave at that time and he is great cooking
Dutch oven meals, so he was a big help.  Sandi was right there alongside him
doing tons too.  All our family helped with the meals and other assignments I
gave them.  I was worried about one main thing and that was if it rained, it
would wash out the dirt road leading up to the ranch as it was up a hill.  We
kept praying for good weather for the reunion and it was.  I was very
grateful.  The reunion was a success and everyone had a great time.  I was
glad, but relieved that it was over as it had been a lot of work and worry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bushnell Reunion in August of 2009 – </b>Uncle Van asked
Keela if she would host this reunion so since her and Pete own the Trail Canyon
Rides into Grand Canyon, Zion’s and Bryce’s Canyon and have land to raise the
feed for the horses and mules, she decided to have the reunion on that land. 
They had built a nice, large barn, cabins and a nice grassy area for
volleyball, etc.  The barn has a stage and tables all around the outside with
chairs, so the chairs can be moved into the center for people when
entertainment and programs are being presented on the stage.  Keela has
decorated the barn so cute with even a buggy hung up above the stage.  She has
red and white checkered tablecloths on the tables.  They have 25 cute log
cabins with porches.  They built all these as they have people from all around
the world come here and stay for a week and each day they take them to
different trail rides, then bring them back for wonderful catered dinners and
entertainment.  She did a great job hosting this reunion and gave family
members free rides into Bryce Canyon.  She had crafts, games, wonderful meals,
etc.  We had a wonderful three-day reunion. The only ones from our family who
went were Ken and I, Sandi &amp; Nick and David, Shauna and their family.  We
all had a great time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bushnell Reunion in August of 2012 – The Glendon Porter
Family were to host this reunion</b>, so me and my siblings and spouses were in
charge of it.  Keela had told me at the last reunion that if we wanted, we
could come to Tropic again and have it on her &amp; Pete’s land.  I was excited
as that is one of the main hard things is finding a place to accommodate that
many people.  My siblings, spouses, Ken and I get together every three months and
have dinner, play games, visit, etc.  We take turns hosting it.  With this
reunion coming up, we spent most of a year planning and preparing for it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Since I am the oldest, my siblings
expect me to take the lead so I did a lot of planning and making handouts, with
my ideas, prior to us getting together for our Siblings &amp; Spouse Get-to-gathers,
which we do every three months.  We take turns hosting it.  After our dinner,
we would spend the time making plans for the reunion.  They appreciated all the
work I had gone to in preparing for it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I gave them all a category to
choose from.  Deanna &amp; Bryce choose the children’s activities.  Kim &amp;
Jeanenne choose the youth &amp; adult activities.  Georgia &amp; Rick choose
the night activities and Sunday Meeting, and me and Ken had the meals.  I asked
Terry, who lives in Alaska, if he would also help us by getting the e-mail
&amp; other addresses and getting the information sent out advertising the
reunion and encouraging everyone to come.  I got him the addresses that I had. 
He did a fantastic job and I was sure grateful to him for doing this.  Georgia
&amp; Rick with the suggestions of all of us choose to have a family dance for
Friday night and a Talent night for Saturday night.  We all worked hard, and it
turned out great.  I did a lot of pricing for the foods to get the best deals
for the food we would need.  So when we packed up our camper, we went to
Costco, Winco, Macey’s, and the Hostess thrift store.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Keela and Crystal (her daughter in
charge of the trail rides) still wanted to give the family free three-hour
rides into Bryce Canyon, which was special of them.  Volleyball was a hit and
that was going a lot of the time.  The meals turned out great, with all my
siblings &amp; spouses helping.  I gave them all special assignments.  Other
family members helped too, which was great!  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had 150 in attendance.  I was
praying that it wouldn’t rain during the time of the reunion, and it didn’t. 
It started raining as we were cleaning and packing up to go home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had most of our family come for
this reunion, so we had great support.  Sandi, Nick and Sandi’s daughters,
JaNae, Chelci and their husbands and children came.  I think Nick’s son, Logan,
came also.  Shellie, Roy and Jase came.  Quint &amp; Kevis have jobs so they
didn’t come.   Scott, Mishelle and their children came as well as Jeff, Gail
and their children.  David, Shauna and their family didn’t come this time as
David is doing his internship for medical school.  August isn’t a good time for
Mike as he is principal of Orem High and he is in meetings usually starting the
first of August, so they didn’t come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Robinson </b>Reunions in California, Arizona &amp; Idaho. 
These were large reunions. They were several generation reunions.  The main
families lived in California, Arizona and Idaho.  The first one that I remember
going to was held at Max Inn at Island Park.  We all camped in the campgrounds
or stayed at the Max Inn cabins.  Elder LaGrande Richards of the quorum of the
twelve apostles is my dad’s second cousin and dad were able to get him to
perform Ken &amp; my marriage ceremony at the Salt Lake Temple.  He always came
to the Robinson Reunions and at the Sunday Meeting, he would always speak. 
Everyone loved to listen to Elder LaGrande because he told such great stories. 
In conference, when it was time for the speakers to stop, a little red light
would come on, on the pulpit.  I remember him saying “I think this little red
light is trying to tell me that my time is up, but I have one more story to
tell you.”  Everyone would laugh, but be excited to hear another of his
stories.  They were great spiritual experiences.   At the close of his talks at
the reunions, he would tell us that he didn’t know if he would be around for
the next reunion, but he was.  He was getting up in years. They had paddle
boats which you could rent and use on the river which was close by Max Inn.  We
didn’t go to the one in California, but we did to the one in Arizona.  It was
held in the White Mountains area, up where Roy, Shellie’s husband, is from.  It
is much cooler up there.  They had a rodeo, lots of activities, great food.  I
remember all the good corn on the cob, watermelon, etc.  At the last Robinson
Reunion that I remember them holding, was held again at Max Inn.  We were
living with Ken’s Mom in Layton at that time and Shellie was working at Max Inn
as a waitress and also in our friend from Firth’s gift shop.  She was earning
money to go on the “Studies Abroad Program to Israel” which was at the new
Jerusalem Center.  She was able to go with us to the reunion and again Elder
LaGrande spoke and everyone was thankful he was still around to be able to
speak to us again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b> Swallow Reunions</b> held in Meadow<b> – </b>I’m not
sure how many Swallow Reunions they have held, but the one I remember was after
dad had passed away and Mom really wanted to go to see her Aunt Lara and Aunt
Noreen and her cousins.  These reunions were held in Meadow and dad had passed
away, so Bryce and I were able to take her. Georgia and Kim were not able to
nor, nor were our spouses, but we had a great time visiting as we drove down
and back and it was fun to see how happy it made mom to see her relatives on
this side of the family again.  We took pictures of her with them.  It was just
a Saturday Afternoon reunion held at the church.  They had a good dinner and
program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Clark Reunions</b> – usually held in Farmington, Utah in
the old historic rock chapel.  It was the first chapel in Farmington when the
Clarks, my great, great grandfather, Ezra T and his family settled Farmington. 
That is the same chapel where the first primary was organized with ???? as the
president and my grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Robinson (May) was one of her
secretaries.  We still have a letter she wrote to May expressing her sympathy
when May’s mother passed away.  These reunions were well attended, and they had
lots of delicious food too and wonderful programs.  They were just Saturday
afternoon reunions as well.  I remember my dad introducing me to his cousins
and saying, “This is my daughter, Iva Mae, and she is 40 years old.”  After
this happening 2 or 3 times, I said to dad “You can introduce me to your
relatives, but you don’t have to tell them how old I am.”  He replied that I
should be thankful that I am as old as I am that he was 71 and he was thankful
he was that old.”  Now that I am 72, I am thankful that I am as old as I am
also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Porter Reunions</b> <b>(Sanford – </b>usually in
Porterville<b> </b>at the church and adjoining park there.  The first ones I
remember going to were great, with lots of people attending.  They had
wonderful food with Sloppy Joes, chips, lots of corn on the cob, watermelon
&amp; cantaloupe, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and lots of delicious salads and
desserts.  This reunion seemed to dwindle down until few were coming.  My
brother, Kim, lives in Morgan and they nominated him for President for the next
year.  He did and tried hard to get more people coming.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Kim asked me to and Aunt Beth to
tell our experiences of writing the Byron Porter books.  I did the first one
and she did the second one which had more of the Porter ancestors.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>He had a 5K run, but few
participants.  He even went to the work of getting T shirts for each to wear
and prizes for the winners.  He asked Ken and I and Georgia and Rick to help
him by being at different stops along the way to give them cold water and
encouragement.  We had good food, Jeanenne had made lots of barbecue and they
had lots left over.  Everyone was to bring salads or desserts.  Kim had gotten
lots of watermelons.  When it came time to nominate a new president for the
next reunion, no one would accept the nomination, so they asked Kim to take it
another year.  He ended up taking it 3 or 4 consecutive years and now they are on
their mission so there wasn’t one this year and I doubt if it ever happens
again.  The older generation has passed away and the young ones don’t know all
the people and they don’t want the responsibility of taking it on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Byron</b> <b>Porter Reunions</b> held at the West Point
Park in early years &amp; later at Layton Park &amp; Surf &amp; Swim</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Dale was the one who first started these reunions and
he held them at the West Point Park which was just across the street from his
home.  It was a Saturday afternoon reunion also.  We had good food which
everyone helped with.  We had a short program, some played volleyball or
softball while the younger children played at the playground and the older ones
sat in lawn chairs and visited.  Uncle Verle and Aunt Beth held these reunions at
their home in West Point a couple of times also.  They had lots of acreage and
a large old home.  I remember standing around the piano singing with Georgia
and my cousins, mainly girls, while Jeannie, my cousin who is Georgia’s age,
played the piano.  They had a children’s pool for the young ones to play in,
they had volleyball, etc., and lots of good food.  Aunt Beth is a great cook
and makes lots of yummy desserts.  Later, Uncle Dale was able to rent the
Layton Pavilion at the Layton Park and the Surf &amp; Swim.  He paid for it. 
We rotated family turns to host it and reserve the Pavilion and Surf &amp;
Swim, but the money always came from him and still does even after his death. 
He told his kids that he would like this reunion to continue here at the Layton
Park &amp; Surf &amp; Swim as we have lots who come even though many of the
later generations don’t know each other; they bring their families as they can
swim free and have a great meal.  Many sat with their parents and grandparents;
we do too, but us older generation love to visit with our cousins.  We are the
older generation now; our parents have all passed away.  They were all great
people, Grandpa and Grandma Porter raised a wonderful, righteous, humble
family.  They were all great examples and so were their spouses.  Aunt Beth was
the last to go, and she was a “jewel”.  She was a special aunt and one of
Heavenly Father’s choosiest daughters.  It was the Glendon Porter Family’s turn
to host it when we went on our mission to California, but I was able to arrange
with my cousin, Diane, for the checks to reserve the Pavilion and Surf &amp;
Swim for that reunion and had Scott take it and reserve it, since he lives in
Layton and you have to be a resident of Layton to get it for that price.  It is
our turn again.  Wow! Aunt Merlyn’s family has never taken a turn and her two
daughters hardly ever came.  LaDean, the oldest, has passed away so there is
only Lois.  But this next year, it will only be Bryce and I and our spouses and
families to do it since Kim and Jeanenne and Georgia &amp; Rick will be on
their missions and Terry &amp; Angela are still in Alaska.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Glendon Porter Reunions</b> –usually held at <b>Georgia
&amp; Rick’s home</b>.  Georgia &amp; Rick have a beautiful large home with a
large back yard.  It has playground equipment and a trampoline, not only for
their grandchildren, but she taught pre-school for several years and needed
these for her students.  They also had volleyball standards, net &amp; ball, so
they would invite all the Glendon Porter Family one afternoon/evening in the summers. 
Samantha (Cindy’s daughter) would usually come also.  Her adopted father, Bryon
Dugan would bring her and they would stay with Georgia and the rest of us for a
few days.  Now that Samantha is in college, she comes by herself or with her
boyfriend.  Georgia finally quit having them at her home as the family had
grown so large and some of the children were destroying her pre-school
equipment or other items, plus tracking dirt throughout the house.  She said
that after everyone had gone, she would go into her the room where she held her
pre-school and it would be a mess.  The parents hadn’t checked and had their
children clean it up.   The same thing was true of the Christmas parties she
had for all the family, so they finally discontinued too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After a couple of years, <b>I decided we needed
to have another one and I had heard of the Heber Valley Campgrounds,</b> which
the church owns.  They have it for a Young Women’s camp, but on the weekends,
families can reserve it for family reunions.  I was able to get it for a Friday
night and Saturday.  Georgia helped me plan it and we contacted all the
family.  Bryce &amp; Deanna were on their mission to Spain, but their children
acted excited as did everyone else.  I did a lot of planning and preparing,
Georgia &amp; our husbands helped too and we were disappointed that we didn’t
have more come to it.  It is a beautiful camp with cabins, large pavilion with
lots of tables with benches.  There was a room at each side of the pavilion
which has shelves, a fridge and grills.  They have a campfire area with lots of
logs around it, they had a volleyball court and a small lake with paddle boats
&amp; canoes on which we could use.  They have a camp host who looks after the
camp.  We had good meals and those who came had a wonderful time.  Chad &amp;
his wife some of the others didn’t come up until Saturday afternoon.  Nolan
&amp; Brandy came Friday night along with some of our family, some of Georgia’s
family and I can’t remember whether any more of Bryce’s family or Kim’s family
came.  I just know that for all the work and worry, I didn’t know whether it
was worth it for the few that came.  I wasn’t eager to do it again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Family,  (Year that Bryce &amp; Deanna were on their
mission)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Well, the time is about here for our <b>Glendon
Porter Reunion at Heber Valley Campgrounds</b> on July 27<sup>th</sup> &amp; 28<sup>th</sup>. 
<u>Our campground area is “Sarah, Site 1”.</u>  We have 4 cabins in our camp
site so room for 64 people.  At last count, we will only have 48 at max.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Mae’s family</b> - I think we
have 20 coming from our family - us, Mike, David &amp; Jeff and families. 
Scott isn’t sure, but hopefully they can come.  From <b>Bryce’s family</b>,
Nolan and Chad and their families are the only ones able to come.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Terry’s family</b> - Meliah and
family have been in Alaska with Terry, Angela and their family since the
beginning of June, but she was excited about this reunion and didn’t want to
miss it so they are flying home on the 26<sup>6h</sup> so they can be with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>From <b>Georgia’s family</b>, they
plan on 10 – Georgia &amp; Rick, Kristy, Brian &amp; family and Nathan &amp;
Jessica.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Kim Byron</b> and Jeanenne will
be there with Mysha and Kolessee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Facilities</b> - we have nice
restrooms in our camp site with hot water, flushing toilets &amp; showers.  We
have a nice eating pavilion with tables &amp; benches, grills, fridge, sinks,
etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Dinner on Friday night</b> - we
plan to eat our Friday evening meal at 5 pm.  Remember, we have asked each
family to bring either a salad or desert.  If we have leftovers, we can finish
them off with our Hogies for our Saturday afternoon meal.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Campfire program </b>on Friday
night will start at 7 pm - Remember to come prepared to have either a talent
from your family or someone to give a memory they have of Grandpa or Grandma
Porter or both.  The camp site has logs around the fire area, but the <u>adults
might want to bring lawn chairs</u> to sit in.  We can do some campfire singing
also and after the closing prayer, those who want to might stay and roast
marshmallows &amp; visit.  If you have roasting sticks, bring them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Breakfast</b> - we will have
breakfast of pancakes, bacon, eggs, juice &amp; milk at 10 am.  Since we have
to be out by 5 pm, we felt it would be best to have a late breakfast and an
early dinner at 3:00 pm.  If your children will have trouble waiting until 10,
you might want to bring them something to tide them over. <b> </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Dinner</b> - we will have
Hogies, chips, veggie trays &amp; leftover salads, deserts &amp; watermelon for
our 3 pm meal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>               Activities </b>– they have a volleyball
court in our area. We will have games for the younger children and some board
&amp; card games for youth &amp; adults.   The camp also does challenge
courses.  You could make reservations for these in advance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>               <b>Cost</b> – the cost for the camp site was
$160.00 so it will cost each family $12.00.  We don’t have the cost of the food
yet, but it shouldn’t be too expensive since we are having simple meals and you
are bringing salads &amp; deserts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>               <b>Drinks &amp; snacks</b> – If you want
additional drinks or snacks for your family, feel free to bring them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>               <b>Directions</b> to Heber Valley Campgrounds
&amp; Sarah, Site #1 – I am enclosing the map &amp; directions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>               Well, that is all I can think of, but if you
have other questions you can respond back to this e-mail or call me at
801-825-5112 or my cell phone is 801-499-6986 &amp; Ken’s is 499-6987, or you

<p class=MsoNormal>                               Mae</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We didn’t have as many come, as we had hoped for and some
came and went or came really late, so I was discouraged as I had gone to a lot
of work in planning and preparing for this reunion.  I haven’t been excited to
do it again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken and I held a Glendon Porter Family
Reunion in our big backyard in September of 2012</b>.  Everyone thought I was
crazy to do it especially since we had been so busy with the Bushnell Reunion
and had just held it in August, but this was just an afternoon/evening reunion,
so it wasn’t very hard.  We put up our big shad tent and we had everyone bring
their own meat to grill and then a salad, dessert or vegetable or fruit tray. 
We played volleyball, corn hole, some of the children played on our playground
plane or tree swing and some went over to the park.  We enjoyed visiting and
being together.  It turned out great!</p>
