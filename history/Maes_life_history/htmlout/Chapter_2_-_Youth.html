<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            I enjoyed my Junior High and High School
days.</b>  Eleanor Ewing moved into our ward during our 7th grade.  Pat &amp; I
were best friends, but Eleanor and I became good friends also.  We had another
friend, Patsy Morris, who lived close to Eleanor.  She wasn't a member of the
church either.  She had nice parents.  I grew up with Patsy, and she and I used
to play together in grade school, however, she was moody quite a bit of the
time and I didn't enjoy that. When we were in the 9th grade, Pat and her
parents moved to Syracuse.  I felt really bad, but her and I still did a lot
together and would stay the weekends with each other sometimes (or at least
Friday nights.  I'd usually go home the next morning if I stayed at her house).
I remember one-time Pat &amp; I were eating breakfast with her parents and got
the giggles.  Her mother told us to stop, but we couldn't.  She said if we
couldn't stop laughing, we should leave the table – we couldn’t stop so we did
leave the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Eleanor &amp; Patsy had become good friends, but
they took me in, after Pat moved and we became a threesome.  We had our main
group of friends – Joanne Hill, Margie Martin, Corrine Larsen (they lived in
the Sunset 1st ward, but we had grown up together and did a lot together) then
Eleanor, Patsy, Pat, Bonnie, Connie &amp; myself.  Connie &amp; Bonnie were really
cute, had plenty of money so had the latest fashions in clothes and were very
popular.  We didn't do as much with them (as they thought they were too good
for us) Bonnie was a cheerleader and she was voted the queen of several of the
school dances.  She always gave me a hard time.  She teased me about being
&quot;Preacher Porter&quot; and would say in Sunday School or MIA &quot;let
Preacher Porter say the prayer&quot;.  She always tried to make me look foolish
in one way or another.  If we were in a group and I tried to add to the
conversation, she would try to belittle me.  I've often wondered why.  Some
have said that she was jealous of me, but why would she be jealous?  She had
everything going for her.  She did a couple of terrible things to me that I had
a hard time forgiving her for, but think I have now.  However, I can still
vividly remember them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One incident happened while I was working
part-time at the Arctic Circle in Roy.   During this time, <b>Bonnie</b> played
up to me to get information about Geneal who was Bonnie's boyfriend's EX
girlfriend.  I didn't tell Bonnie anything bad about Genial as there wasn't
anything bad to say about her.  She was a neat girl and I really liked her. 
Bonnie came to the Arctic Circle one day when I wasn't there and told the other
girls that I was spying for her and telling her everything I could about
Genial.  The other girls really shunned me and were upset with me until I found
out the cause of it.  I finally convinced them that I hadn't said anything bad
and that I was Genial’s friend.  I was really upset with Bonnie, but I tried to
forgive her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=217 height=289
src="Chapter_2_-_Youth_files/image001.jpg" align=left hspace=12 alt=P1190721>Soon
after Ken and I were married, Bonnie came to me and said what a wonderful
reception we had, and that since her and David Jacobs were getting married
soon, could I help her?  I told her where we got our invitations, napkins,
decorations, etc., and that I had rented my wedding dress and where I rented
it.  She said she thought that was a good idea to rent it as you only use it
once.  She looked at our picture and saw my wedding dress again and said that
it was beautiful, but that she wouldn't rent my dress if she decided to rent a
wedding dress.  She later told me that she had rented a dress, but that it was
not the one I had rented, and she thanked me for my help.  She asked me and my
friends to serve at her reception.  I had to go early, so I went with Eleanor
and her mother.  What should I find when I got there? - Everything was the same
as mine, only much more elaborate.  She used the same colors - blue and pink,
the same napkin idea, same decorations, only like I said - more elaborate.  She
held it in the stake house instead of our chapel where I did.  Then when I went
through the line<b>, I was so stunned to find she was wearing my wedding dress that
I could hardly speak to he</b>r.  Eleanor's mother told me, when we were
talking afterwards, that I should be flattered that Bonnie thought I had such
good taste that she wanted to copy me.  I wouldn't have been so upset except
that Bonnie had told me she didn't rent my dress.  And I knew that behind all
this she mainly wanted to outdo me.  She had always tried to do this, and
usually she succeeded because my family didn't have as much money as hers
because her mother worked, and mine didn't.  I was glad that my mother didn't
work, however, and that when I came home from school, she was there, and many
times I would walk into the house and smell fresh homemade bread. Maybe that
was the reason she was jealous of me.   </p>

style='margin-left:-6px;margin-right:6px'>            It took me awhile to
forgive her of this, but what the heck, I'm happy with my life and my family
and so I hope she is with hers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I saw her and her husband in the Celestial room
at the Ogden Temple in Feb. of 1998, we hugged and had a good visit.  Her and
David have strong testimonies and have raised a wonderful family, so that’s
great.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My parents wanted their children to have
opportunities for music and dance so <b>I took tap dancing</b> lessons from Mr.
&amp; Mrs. Albright for three years - 2nd to 5th grades.  My friends, Margie
Martin and Bonnie Draper took them with me.  Also, a boy from South Weber, Paul
Thorpe took lessons with us.  We had fun being in recitals and performing in
the ward, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>My Accordion </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was twelve, my parents let me take
accordion lessons which I took for four years.  Mom &amp; Dad had bought the
accordion for Hal, but he didn't want to practice and didn't like it so they
gave it to me.  Later on,Hal they bought me a new one.  I loved the new one, it
was red and white.  I still have it.  As I mentioned earlier, Pat was able to
take accordion lessons with me plus two of our other friends, Margie and
Joanne.  Mr. Berry, our teacher, came out to Sunset and taught us in the church
for awhile, then he got a studio in Ogden and we went there.  Soon he had
enough students that we formed an accordion band and met one day a week for
lessons and another day for the band lessons.  We met a lot of neat kids and
flirted with the cute boys.  For the 24th of July celebration one year, Mr. Berry
had a float built and we all got to ride on it and play our accordions. 
Afterwards we played at the city park where there was also other entertainment
and concessions.  My friends and I played in ward and MIA activities.  One time
Pat and I played a duet at a ward activity.  That was fun, however, another
time I was asked to play a solo at a Ward Christmas party.  That was not fun. 
When I had my friends, I was confident and was able to do fine, but all by
myself, that was another story and I was really nervous so my fingers went cold
and I did awful.</p>

alt="Mae in accordian band"><b>After Ken &amp; I were married, he had me play
my accordion at least once a year for our family Christmas parties.  I usually
played &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; and had the family sing with me.  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=231 height=173
src="Chapter_2_-_Youth_files/image004.jpg" align=left hspace=12 alt=DSC03452>When
we were living in Clearfield, the ward had a talent show, had heard that I
played and asked me to be in it.  I decided to play <b>&quot;Washington Post
March</b>&quot;.  I practiced a lot, memorized it and got so I could play it
really well.  However, the night of the performance, I got scared again, my
fingers went cold (which isn't good when you have to play a song that is a fast
tempo) I made a lot of mistakes and felt awful, but I received compliments
anyway.  In fact, a young man in our ward, who had just come home from his
mission and was starting up a band approached me and asked if I would join his
band.  I was really honored because he was a very talented young man.  He told
me who the others were in the band, and they were great also.  I told him I
would think about it because we would be moving to Arizona shortly.  I later
called and declined saying that since Ken was already working in Arizona
and just flying home for weekends and I had young children, it would be
difficult to get away for the practices and I would be busy packing.  I also
felt it wouldn't be fair to him for me to just be in for such a short time.  He
said he was disappointed, but would honor my wishes.  I have later regretted
not taking the opportunity to do this.  It might have made a great difference
in my life.  I might have gotten more confidence and kept up with my
accordion.  It would have been great for the family for family home evenings,
camping, etc., to sing when I accompanied them on the accordion.  I really
missed out and mainly it was because of fear.  Fear is of the devil.  He
doesn't want us to progress.  I hope my family will learn from my mistake - to
take advantage of opportunities.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=245 height=163
src="Chapter_2_-_Youth_files/image005.jpg" align=right hspace=12
alt="2009-12-31 052">            I did take advantages of a few other
opportunities to play my accordion.  Somehow the word usually leaked out in
wards where we lived, that I could play.  I was asked to play at a High Priest
party and a Relief Society Birthday Party while living in Erda.  A few months
later, another woman moved into our ward who was very talented on the piano and
accordion.  Her name was Susan Derricott.  Susan and I were asked to play an
accordion duet at a ward Christmas party.  That was fun because, here again, I
had someone with me - not a solo.  She was so good that it was fun performing
with her.  She played the hard part and I played the melody.  We received lots
of compliments.    Sandi, Shellie, Mike &amp; David took piano lessons from her
for a while; they later took from a lady at Stansberry Park.  Susan was good,
but they didn't like going there because her house was such a mess and her
children unruly.  She was great at music, gardening, etc., and that was where
she spent her time.  They liked the lady at Stansberry Park better because her
home &amp; children were orderly.  <u>This picture is when our family asked me
to play my accordion at our family Christmas party.  This year it was held at
David &amp; Shauna’s beautiful home in Enterprise, Morgan County, Utah.  I
can’t remember the year.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I asked Georgia &amp; Rick to bring down my accordion, when
they came to visit us in Wasco, California, when we were serving our 2<sup>nd</sup>
mission there.  I practiced and played for the residents at the assisted living
center where I volunteered and also at the elementary school where I
volunteered to help in a third-grade class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Back to my youth</b>.  When I was a sophomore
in High School, I was tired of practicing my accordion and wanted to quit
taking lessons.  Mom was expecting Kim and her varicose veins were so bad that
she had to stay off her feet as much as possible.  I persuaded Mom and my
accordion teacher, Mr. Berry, that I needed to help out more with the home and
children and therefore, would need to quit as I wouldn't have time to
practice.  Mr. Berry was disappointed and told me to not put it up for good,
but to keep playing.  I didn't heed his advice very well though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I started dating when I was in the 8th grade. 
(The church hadn't come up with the standards of dating - no dating until age
16 - at that time) I went to the &quot;Night Dance&quot; that year with Harry
Campbell and thought I was on top of the world as he was one of the most
popular boys.  I was elated when he asked me.  However, I came down sick with
the flu that morning.  I made myself go to school because I knew my parents
wouldn't allow me to go to the dance if I was sick.  I also was afraid that
Harry would wonder why I wasn't at school - so I had to go.  I was still so
sick when he came to get me, but I wouldn't let on to anyone.  We double dated
with Harry’s friend, Jay Barlow &amp; his date.  Jay’s dad drove us.   I didn't
have a very good time because when we went out to eat, I didn't feel like
eating.  I wasn't a very good dancer or conservationist because I was too sick
so neither of us had a very good time.  I should have stayed home where I
belonged, but another reason I didn't was because I didn’t want him to have to
stay home too and it was too late for him to ask anyone else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In the Ninth grade I went with Burt Weaver.  We
were voted to be King and Queen of the &quot;Night Dance&quot; in most of the
home rooms, but then they decided to put the names in a hat and draw one out,
and it wasn't us.  Burt and I had a lot of fun going together.  A few months
later our ward was having a dance.  Most of my girlfriends said they were
going, but when I got there only one of my friends were there.  But there were
lots of boys, even some from Clinton.  They started asking me to dance.  Soon
they were cutting in on each other, and I was having a great time.  Burt also
came to the dance, but every time he asked me to dance, the other boys would
cut in on him.  Finally, he got mad and went home.  When it was almost time for
the dance to end, one of the boys, named Veldon Baird, tried to persuade me to
let him take me home and go out the back way so the other boys wouldn't see us
go.  I asked him why, and he said that something was going to happen, and I'd
better decide quickly.  I didn't know what to do, but I wasn't too worried
because they were all good guys and I trusted them, so I decided to stay and
see what would happen.  During the last dance, they all kept cutting in so fast
that we hardly had time to dance a step or two before the next one would cut
in.  Finally, it was over, and they said they would all walk me home.  When we
got to the door, the one boy who was the last to dance with me (Jimmy Petersen)
grabbed me and kissed me.  They had decided that the last one dancing with me,
when the dance ended, got to kiss me. They would all walk me home, but he would
kiss me.  Guess they forgot one thing - to ask me.  On well, it wasn't so bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At North Davis Jr. High, we had dances in the
gym before school, during lunch break and after school.  They played records.
One of my favorites was &quot;Sincerely&quot;.  Most of the kids attended these
dances.  Those who were going together or going &quot;steady&quot; went right
out on the floor and danced every dance together. Margie Martin was going
steady with Gary Nelson (who she later married) and Bonnie Draper was going
steady with Ronny Pauling.  Boy that was way too young to go steady.  I think
we had these dances at Davis High also.  I can't remember for sure.  Anyway,
the rest of the boys were on one side of the gym and the girls were on the
other side.  A boy my age, Gary Youngberg, liked me and would always come over
to ask me to dance.  Many times, I did dance with him.  He was a good kid, but
he danced so funny that I was embarrassed and didn't like to dance with him. 
Many times, when I would see him coming over, I would hide or talk my friends
into walking the halls with me.  I did like to go to the dances, however, to
dance with other guys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Elvis Presley</b> became popular about this
time.  The first song I remember was <b>“Don’t Be Cruel</b>”.  Wow! I loved
that song.  I still love it.  I bought the record and Pat and I would listen to
it over and over.  I loved a lot of the other songs Elvis sang, but especially
“Don’t Be Cruel”.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Hal and Religion</b>: When Hal and I were in
our teens, <i>one day he asked me why I didn’t open my mind to other religions,
why I believed everything our parents taught us.</i>  He told me that I should
go to other churches and investigate them.  Hal didn’t like going to church. 
He was expected to by our parents, but he didn’t want to go, so he never
studied the scriptures or rarely prayed – so he never gained a testimony of the
gospel<i>.  I said to him “Why would I want to do that?  I know for sure that
this is the true church, I have had my prayers answered and have felt the
spirit of the Holy Ghost testifying to me that it is the true church.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Pat, myself &amp; the Savior</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was about 14, my best friend, Pat
Kleitches and I were babysitting for a family in the ward.  They had asked me
to tend their children and I asked if Pat could come along.  Pat’s parents
weren’t members of our church, so, of course, she wasn’t either.  They were
antagonistic to the church and forbid Pat to join.  They had allowed her to go
to church with me.  She had always gone to Sunday School, Primary, M.I.A. and
sometimes Sacrament Meeting with me.  They had moved from Pennsylvania to
Sunset, Utah when Pat was seven years old.  She lived on the highway about 4
houses away from me.  We had become best friends.  Pat and I had discussions
about the church many times.  On this particular night, after the children were
asleep, Pat and I began discussing the church again.  I bore my testimony to
her and we began to feel the spirit of the Lord.  All of a sudden, I looked
over at the big chair which was to my left.  It was aglow.  There was a
beautiful brightness and in the middle of it was Jesus Christ - or an angel. 
I’m not sure which, although we felt it was Christ.  I was so filled with the
love of this being that I immediately began to cry.  Pat began crying almost at
the same time.  When I looked again, he was gone.  We cried and cried for a
long time.  When we at last gained composure, she said, “Mae, did you see
Christ?”  I nodded yes, and we hugged each other.  She had seen him the exact
same time I had, but he didn’t stay long, just long enough for us to see him
sitting in that chair and to feel his presence.  It was such a beautiful
experience and I know it helped to instill the desire in Pat’s heart to join
the church. Her parents wouldn’t let her join while she was in their home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>**I had e-mailed Pat the experience entitled “Pat, Me and
the Savior” to ask if I had recorded it corrected &amp; to make any changes if
she remembered it differently.  This was her reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Girls Camp</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The summer between my Freshman and Sophomore
years, I went to MIA camp up at Bear Lake.  We had lots of fun and I met three
boys with whom I wrote to for about a year.  Especially John &amp; Glen.  They
were quite the characters.  They wrote mushy love letters.  At camp, my friends
and I were the oldest, so the leaders were lenient with us.  We sunbathed on
the beach.  That’s where we met these boys.  There was also an inside swimming
pool right by the park where we camped.  That’s where I first experienced
kissing underwater.  Glen had talked me into kissing him underwater and when we
came up, the younger girls were up on the balcony, had watched us and were
laughing. (Not sure why I didn't get in trouble with the leaders.  Guess the
girls didn’t tell on me.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I always loved camp and went every year.  Our
stake had purchased some land but were developing it and building a lodge, so
we went other places until they had it finished. The first year we went to the
Meadows in the canyon up east of Huntsville, the second year we went to Lava
Hot Springs and stayed in cabins by the river.  We had lots of fun swimming in
the pools, soaking in the hot tubs, eating good food, etc.  The next year we
went to Bear Lake and the last year we did go to our stake camp.  I remember
helping to take the younger girls on a &quot;snipe hunt&quot; that year.  It
was fun.  We had them take their flashlights, we took them out in the woods,
gave them a paper sack and told them to call &quot;here snippy, here
snippy&quot; and snipes would run into their bag.  I'm not sure they knew what
a snipe was (no such thing) or that we told them anything about them.  One
Beehive girl came back crying and showed us a hole in her paper sack.  She said
one had run in, but had escaped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I guess because of my love for girl’s camp, I
was involved in the camping program in several of the stakes where we lived
after I was married. But one thing for sure, we had stricter rules when I was a
leader, than when I was a girl.  I guess I realized, from my experience, that
boys shouldn't be allowed in camp.  I hadn’t done anything really bad, but
kissing boys you hardly know, isn't too appropriate.  I'm sure my mother
wouldn't have approved.  I don't think I was &quot;boy-crazy&quot; as some of
the girls seemed to be, but I did enjoy the attention that some of the boys
gave me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            These older teenage years can be full of fun,
they can be hard, and they can be dangerous.  I wanted to have lots of fun and
I did.  I think, for the most part, I was a good girl - obedient &amp;
respectful to my parents &amp; others.  I always knew I wanted to be married in
the temple, but looking back I don't think I was as careful as I should have
been.  I didn't &quot;make-out&quot; with boys (well, maybe a couple of times),
but I enjoyed the &quot;good-night kisses &amp; hugs&quot;.  I can see the
wisdom the Prophets had in giving the council “not to date until age 16&quot;. 
That council didn’t come out until after I was married.  The world is getting
more and more immoral and the temptations are getting greater because Satan is
making a great thrust before the second coming of the Lord, Jesus Christ, and
so the leaders of the Church are giving more council to keep us on the right
path, if we will just heed their council.  Some of this council is: not dating
until age 16, not watching “R” rated movies, dressing modestly, etc.  If we
will follow the prophet, we will be safe from Satan’s grasp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I'd like to insert a couple of paragraphs
including a small example <b>Elder Marlin K. Jensen</b> of the Seventy gave in
a talk entitled &quot;A Union of Love and Understanding&quot;.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            “A very natural and wonderful consequence of
becoming a person capable of great love is described in this passage: &quot;For
intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth
embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light: (D&amp;C
88:40)  If we pursue the goal of an eternal marriage with purity and with both
our hearts and our minds, I believe in most cases we will eventually be
rewarded with a companion who is at least our spiritual equal and who will
cleave unto intelligence and light as we do, who will receive wisdom as we
receive it, who will embrace truth as we embrace it, and who will love virtue
as we love it.  To spend the eternities with a companion who shares the most
important fundamental values with us and who will discuss them, live them, and
join in teaching them to children is among the most soul-satisfying experiences
of true romantic love.  To know that there will be someone who walks a parallel
path of goodness and growth with us and yearns for the same eternal values and
happiness is of great comfort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I witnessed a powerful example of this principle
recently as I sealed a young couple in the Salt Lake Temple.  After I had
performed the sealing ceremony and the couple had exchanged rings and embraces,
I asked them to share their feelings about each other and the Lord.  The new
bride spoke first.  Her brief remarks expressed both gratitude and emotion as
she told how from her very youngest years she had desired to keep herself
virtuous and had hoped to find a companion who shared her values and righteous
aspirations.  She confirmed the goodness of her new husband by witnessing that
he was all she had hoped for and more.  Then the young husband spoke.  He, too,
was tearful as he shared how at age fourteen he had begun to pray to the Lord
that the wife of his future, whoever she might be, would be protected and would
keep herself virtuous while preparing for an eternal marriage.  He also told
how he had committed himself again and again over the years to that same path. 
Then he expressed his great joy at having met this wife of his prayers, and he
mentioned his high hopes for a truly exceptional marriage.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This is the kind of relationship that our
Heavenly Father wishes for all of his children.  None of his faithful children
will miss out on the opportunity for eternal marriage with one who is equally
prepared for eternal life.  Virtue loveth virtue! Truth embraceth truth!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I will insert here that this is what I hope and
pray for - for all our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, etc. Ken and
I do have this kind of relationship and it is so wonderful and brings us so
much joy and happiness.  It isn't a perfect marriage, we still occasionally get
upset with each other, but not for long.  We forgive each other and try
harder.  We pray continually that we will endure to the end and be able to have
each other for eternity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Well, back to my youth</b> - I dated quite a
bit in High School.  I dated some boys from my high school and some from Ben
Lomond High.  Dennis Ewing had moved out to Sunset and his friends came out to
visit him.  Me and my friends met them and started dating them.  We double
dated most of the time and had lots of fun.  We went to dances, movies, or just
went for a ride and got a cheese burger, fries and shake.  We also went to our
homes and learned new dance steps together or played games.</p>

alt="Iva Mae Porter at age 16">This is how we met the boys from Ben Lomond
High: When I got back from camp at Bear Lake, we met four boys from Ben Lomond
High who were riding around in a red convertible.  Actually, we saw them come
into Sacrament Meeting and sit in the back.  Remember, I said we sat with
friends, rather than families in those days.  I usually walked my friends
partway home after the meeting and then they would walk me partway back - so we
could talk and be together.  This afternoon, these boys rode past us, honked
and waved.  We waved back so they turned around, came back, stopped and asked
if we would like to go for a ride.  There were several of us, but we piled in. 
We weren't worried about being kidnapped, etc., like we would be in today's
world.  I'm not sure how we all fit in, we were like sardines, but it was fun. 
After awhile we told them we needed to get home or our parents would be
worried.  Since we were down west of town, they started dropping off my friends
who lived the farthest down.  They dropped off Bonnie &amp; Connie, then Margie
&amp; Joanne, then the next one to be dropped off was Eleanor and then I would
be left alone in the car with those four boys.  When I realized it, I whispered
to Eleanor my fear.  She said for me to get out with her and we would pretend
we were sisters.  We did, they acted surprised, but didn't say much.  I went in
her house and after awhile she said she would walk me part-way home.  As we
were walking, they drove by, stopped and asked what we were doing.  I had to
confess that she was walking me home as I was nervous about being in the car
alone with them since I didn't really know them.  They laughed and said they
knew we were not sisters.  We talked for awhile longer and Dallas Hemsley (the
owner of the car) asked if I would help him wash his car on Saturday if we did
it at my home, so he could get to know me better.   Dennis Ewing had recently
moved to Sunset, and these were his friends from Ogden, when he used to live. Dennis
and his friends were all seniors at Ben Lomond High.  Dennis had told these
friends to come out and go to Sacrament Meeting with him and maybe they could
meet some cute girls.  When they saw us in Sacrament Meeting, <b>Dallas </b>had
told the others<b> &quot;I get the sunburned girl in the white dress&quot;.  </b>That
was me.  (The white dress is the one I wore when I had my picture taken at age
16.)  Anyway, I consented to help Dallas wash his car, but on Saturday morning
I forgot and was sleeping in when Dad came in to wake me and tell me that a boy
was waiting for me in the front room.  Dad said the boy told him that I had
agreed to help him wash his red convertible.  I quickly dressed and went into
the front room and found him reading a &quot;Parents magazine” which dad had given
him to read while he waited for me.  I had to laugh at that. We had fun washing
his car.  I found out that Dallas was active in the church and we started going
together</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sometime later, Dallas traded in his convertible
for an Oldsmobile.  It had leaded pipes, etc., - really a neat car.  He hung
fur dice (trademark of the 50's) from the rearview mirror.  You could always
hear when Dallas was around because of the leaded pipes on his car.  Since
Dallas &amp; I were going together, and Eleanor started dating Dennis, we
double dated a lot.  Vern Barker and Bob Mansfield dated different girls from
Sunset off and on - so we had a fun time together.  At onetime, Vern was dating
Carol Fisher.  She was a year younger than me.  We had lots of fun going to
dances, drive-in movies, bowling or parties at each other's homes.  Many time
we would just go to get something to eat - hamburgers, fries, malts or Cherry
Cokes (Cherry Root beers when I dated Dallas because he wouldn't buy me a coke)
at the Arctic Circle or A &amp; W Root beer, and go for a ride. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Between my sophomore and senior years, I went
with Dallas, Vern and Bob off and on along with Ted Fifield and other boys from
Davis.  Dallas was getting serious and talking about marriage and how we would
bronze our first child's shoes, and I certainly wasn't ready for marriage at
that time of my life - so I lost interest in him and started treating him
indifferently.  Bob made the statement to Eleanor that no girl would treat him
like that and get away with it.  Later I started going with him, and soon he
also was getting serious.  It turned me off and I started treating him the way
I had Dallas.  He wouldn't break up with me.  He was starting to call my
parents, &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Dad&quot;.  Mom just laughed, but it really
upset Dad.  He was afraid that I would marry Bob and he didn't want that.  Bob
was an only child and really spoiled, and he wasn't very active in the church. 
Bob joined the Air force and wrote to me and sent me a beautiful 8x10 picture
of him in uniform.  He signed on it &quot;All my Love, Reny&quot; (His nickname
was Reny).  I sat it on my dresser, and every time dad came into my room he
would put it in my drawer.  I laughed about it.  I wasn't worried about getting
married, but poor dad was.  Later, however, I received a letter from Reny
telling me that he was getting me an engagement ring, and would bring it to me
on his leave.  I was surprised and wrote back telling him I wasn't ready to get
married.  I was only a Junior in High School.  When he came home on leave, he
was upset that I wouldn't accept his ring, and we had a long talk.  He reached
in his glove compartment and took out a pack of cigarettes and started
smoking.  Wow! I was glad I broke up with him.  He wrote later telling me that
he had met a nice girl in California and that they were going to get married. 
He said he would never forget me, but that he wanted to get married now.  I was
relieved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Vern was the boy I liked best.  He was really
handsome, a neat dancer and fun to be with.  When we would go to dances, Vern
would swing me under his legs, side to side, up high, etc.  It was lots of
fun.  One night, soon after we started going together and I had just broke up
with Reny the first time, we stopped at a drive-in.  Reny was driving by and
saw us, drove in by us, got out and started arguing with Vern that he was
stealing his girl and they started fighting.  (Oh brother, but I was scared.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Vern was a lady’s man. My mother knew his dad
and said his dad was the same way and she was worried that if I got serious
with him and ended up marrying him, he probably would be unfaithful.  While he
was going with me, he was going with two other girls in Ogden.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One time when I was on a date with Vern and we
double dated with Eleanor &amp; Dennis, they stopped at a drive-in in Ogden
and bought us all hamburgers and really large drinks.  Then we went riding
around out in the Plain City area.  We got a flat tire and while Vern &amp;
Dennis went to a house to borrow a jack to fix the tire, Eleanor &amp; I had to
go to the bathroom so bad from drinking so much pop, that we stepped outside
the car and as it was dark and out in the country, we proceeded to quickly squat
there by the car.  It was during the winter - so was really cold.  When the
guys came back, one of them slipped on some ice by the tire and remarked that
they hadn't noticed ice there earlier.  Eleanor &amp; I looked at each other
and smiled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Vern joined the Air force with Bob, and came
home on leave and married Gale, one of the other girls he had been dating.  In
fact, he was going steady with her before he even met me.  I was disappointed,
but my parents were really happy as they didn't approve of him.  I am really
thankful now too.  Dallas was active in the church and they liked him, but not
the others.  Dallas was tall, dark and handsome and a smart dresser.  The
younger girls in our ward really thought he was neat and they swooned over him
when he would come to church with me or to our church dances.  He also had neat
cars -  the red convertible, and then the Oldsmobile.   After we broke up, that
Christmas Eve, he came out and circled around the church several times. 
Finally, Mom told me to go out as he must want to talk to me and didn't have
the nerve to come to the door.  He had brought me a beautiful necklace for
Christmas.  I saved it because it was so beautiful, and I still wear it now and
always get compliments on it.</p>

alt="Mae in Pro Schola uniform">            While at Davis High, I was in Pro Scola
(the school drill team) my senior year.  You had to be a senior to be in it. 
It wasn't like the drill teams are now.  We wore modest clothes and didn't do
suggestive routines.  Not all drill teams of today are this way, but many are. 
Our outfits consisted of a long, flare dress with vest, a cute hat, brown socks
and brown &amp; white oxford shoes.  We marched during halftime at all the home
games - football and basketball and ended up by making a &quot;D&quot; with the
dart going through it (which was our symbol) and everyone would stand and sing
the school song.  &quot;Dear Old Davis High School&quot;.  All my children know
that song by heart as I sang it a lot especially whenever we drove by Davis
High, and also &quot;North Davis Junior High&quot; school song as we drove by North
 Davis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The words to Davis High's school song are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        Dear Old Davis High School</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        We'll shine for you</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        We'll shine for Davis, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        we're up to stuff we never, never, never
bluff</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        Against the men from Davis,
none can progress</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        Three cheers for Davis, our D (D) H
(H) S (S)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        (repeat - Against the men from Davis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The words to North Davis Jr High's song are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        School we all love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        We'll fight for you, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        We'll shine for you</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        just like the stars above </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        raw, raw, raw</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        You're the fairest school in all the
land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One experience I'd like to relate happened when
I was a junior in High School.  A cute boy sat in front of me in my Seminary
class.  We used to flirt back &amp; forth and visited before and after class. 
He had been going steady with another girl.  He broke up and asked me for a
date.  I accepted, he got my phone number and said he would call me later that
night to tell me what time he would pick me up.  I happened to tell a friend of
mine about the date.  She looked at me surprised and said, &quot;Do you realize
what kind of a guy he is?&quot;  I said I supposed he was a good kid - he was
taking seminary.  She told me that he wasn't a good kid - that he had a bad
reputation and that the girl he had been going with was on the &quot;wild&quot;
side.  She had heard that he couldn't keep his hands to himself when he was on
a date.  She said, &quot;if I were you, I would cancel that date&quot;.  I
asked others about the girl he had been dating and they verified that she had a
bad reputation also.  I wasn't sure how to get out of the date, but knew I had
to.  I didn't have the courage to tell him I couldn't go since I had already
accepted his date - so I went home and took the phone off the hook, so he
couldn't call me.  We had a phone downstairs and that was the one I took off
the hook.  My parents probably wondered why they didn't get any calls that
evening.  Anyway, the next day he told me he had tried several times to call
me, but the line was always busy.  He asked for another date and I declined. 
Soon after he got back together with his former girlfriend and that was good. 
It taught me a lesson to get to know a guy more before you accept dates from
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I always wanted to be a secretary as long as
I can remember.</b>  Pat and I determined that we would both graduate from High
School and then go to Henagar’s Business College, graduate and become
secretaries.  Well, we both ended up marrying young and didn't go to any
college.  I wish both Ken &amp; I had gone to college, we would have been much
better off financially.  I never wanted to work while I raised my family, but a
degree would have been good for me to fall back on now.  I am a secretary now
and I do enjoy it, but if I had a degree from either Henagar's or another
college, I would be making much more money.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I took lots of secretarial classes during high
school - Type I &amp; II, Shorthand I &amp; II, Accounting I &amp; II, Business
Machines, Office Practice and was a secretarial aid for the Dean of Girls -
Mrs. Carol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>My teenage years were during the 50's and
that was a great time to live</b>.  The clothes were fun.  We wore lots of full
slips.  Some were soft and had yards &amp; yards of materials in them, others
were made of net and we would starch them with heavy starch and let them drip
dry on the clothes line.  We had full skirts - some were felt with poodles on,
others were pleated or gathered plaid skirts.  We also wore long tight skirts
with cute sweaters or white blouses worn with colored scarves.  Jansen sweaters
were the “in” thing.  They were expensive, but Mom would buy me one or two when
they were on sale.  We also had large flowers - a rose, etc., that we wore on
our sweaters.  Sometimes we wore the fluffy dice around our necks and the guys
had them hanging from the rearview mirror in their cars.  We wore &quot;Joyce&quot;
shoes or saddle oxfords with white bobby socks.  We also wore a lot of cardigan
sweaters.  The coats were long.  We wore our hair in pony tails a lot like is
depicted in the 50's movies or many other hair styles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Joanne was &quot;sort of&quot; the leader of our
group of friends, and she talked us into wearing the same type of clothes on
certain days.  (I guess so everyone else knew we were all friends and ran
around together) She would tell us what to wear each day.  It was kind of fun
at first, but later Pat &amp; I resented it and decided we would wear just
opposite to what she told us.  When we did, and she would ask us why, we'd say
&quot;Oh, did you tell us to wear full skirts?&quot;  We called her &quot;King
Kong&quot; behind her back (Oh boy, I'm not proud of all the things I have done
in my life - guess my family should know the bad along with the good. 
Hopefully the good outweighs the bad).  Joanne, Margie &amp; Bonnie became
cheerleaders in High School.  Eleanor, Patsy, Corrine, Connie &amp; I were in
the drill team.  Pat's parents didn't allow her to try out for the drill team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>ARTIC CIRCLE</b>: When I was
fifteen, I wanted to get a job, so I put in an application at the new A &amp; W
Root Beer Drive-in.  They were one of the places during the 50s that were like
the “Sonic” is now.  You would drive in next to a stand and a girl on
roller-skates would come out and take your order.  When the order was ready,
she would bring it out and you would pay her for the order and “tip” her if you
felt like it.  I was hired and worked there for a while, but I didn’t like it
that much.  The tips were pretty good, but you took some guff too.  I saw that
they were hiring at the Arctic Circle in Roy, so I applied there and got on.  I
enjoyed it there much better as the customers just walked up to the windows and
ordered from there.  There was usually a cook (a guy about our age) and two
girls there at one time.  Our schedules changed so I got to know all of the
guys and girls who worked there.  They were all from Weber High and since I was
from Davis, they all wanted me to trade with them whenever there was a special
sports game or activity or dance.  That made it great, as I could always get
one of them to trade with me whenever I wanted to go to a dance or game, etc. 
DelGarn Smith was the owner and he wasn’t the greatest.  We had cash registers
at each window, but he wouldn’t allow us to write down the orders, we had to
keep them in our head and then add it up on the cash register for the
customers.  He wouldn’t allow us to let anyone stand in line, so we had to get
all the orders and it was really hard remembering all of them.  The cook had to
remember also.  It was really hard when there was a crowd.  We had to make the
drinks, floats, shakes, malts and cones and put the hot dogs together with the
catsup, mustard &amp; relish.  The cook would make the hamburgers and fries and
help us when he wasn’t busy.  We weren’t always really busy, so we could visit
with each other, but when DelGarn was around, we had to look busy and keep
cleaning things.  He was really picky and made us weigh the ice cream cones on
a scale. It didn’t take long until we could tell how much ice cream we should
put in a cone and, so we didn’t weigh them when he wasn’t there.   </p>
