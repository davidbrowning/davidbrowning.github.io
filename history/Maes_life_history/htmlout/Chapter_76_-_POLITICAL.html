<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>I Am The Flag of the United States
of America&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>I was born on June 14, 1777 in Philadelphia and I am as old as my nation.
There the Continental Congress adopted my stars and stripes as the national
flag.  My thirteen stripes alternating red and white, with a union of thirteen
white stars in a field of blue, represented a new constellation, a new nation
dedicated to the personal and religious liberty of mankind.  Today fifty stars
signal from my union, one for each of the fifty sovereign states in the
greatest constitutional republic the world has ever known.  My colors symbolize
the patriotic ideals and spiritual qualities of the citizens of my country.  My
red stripes proclaim the fearless courage and integrity of American men and
boys and the self-sacrifice and devotion of American mothers and daughters.</p>

<p>My white stripes stand for liberty and equality for all.  My blue is the
blue of heaven, loyalty, and faith.  I represent these eternal principles:
liberty, justice, and humanity.  I embody American freedom: freedom of speech,
religion, assembly, the press, and the sanctity of the home.  I typify that
indomitable spirit of determination brought to my land by Christopher Columbus
and by all my forefathers –&nbsp;the Pilgrims, Puritans, settlers at James Town
and Plymouth.</p>

<p>I am a living symbol of my nation's law: The Constitution of the United
States and the Bill of Rights.  I voice Abraham Lincoln's philosophy: “A
government of the people, by the people, for the people.”  I stand guard over
my nation's schools, the seedbed of good citizenship and true patriotism.  I am
displayed in every school room throughout my nation; every school yard has a
flag pole for my display.  Daily, thousands upon thousands of boys and girls
pledge their allegiance to me and my country.  I have my own law-Public Law
829, “The Flag Code”&nbsp;- which definitely states my correct use and display
for all occasions and situations.</p>

<p>I have my special day, Flag Day.&nbsp; June 14 is set aside to honor my
birth.  Americans, I am the sacred emblem of your country.&nbsp; I symbolize
your birthright, your heritage of liberty purchased with blood and sorrow.  I
am your title deed of freedom, which is yours to enjoy and hold in trust for
posterity.</p>

<p>If you fail to keep this sacred trust inviolate, if I am nullified and
destroyed, you and your children will become slaves to dictators and despots. 
Eternal vigilance is your price of freedom.  As you see me silhouetted against
the peaceful skies of my country, remind yourself that I am the flag of your
country, that I stand for what you are -no more, no less.  Guard me well, lest
your freedom perish from the earth.  Dedicate your lives to those principles
for which I stand: “One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all.”</p>

<p>I was created in freedom.&nbsp; I made my first appearance in a battle for
human liberty.  God grant that I may spend eternity in my “land of the free and
the home of the brave” and that I shall ever be known as “Old Glory,”&nbsp;the
flag of the United States of America.</p>

But this is predicated upon the person's becoming in every Facet an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.</span></pre><pre><span

there are many who can and should work to provide for themselves and their

government to take care of them.  That is sad for them and for all of us who
pay taxes which pays for these people </span></p>
