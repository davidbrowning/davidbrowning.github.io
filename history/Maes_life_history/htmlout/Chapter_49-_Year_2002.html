<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chapter 50 – year 2002</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Saturday, May 25, 2002.</b>  What a busy life.  Ken
called me at work yesterday to say he had gotten off work early and was
planning to clean the carpet in our bedroom, but noticed, after moving out the
furniture, that the walls really needed to be painted so wondered if he should
go buy a paint sprayer and start painting it.  We decided to do that since that
bedroom had not been painted when we painted the house when Scott came home
from his mission.  The sprayer cost $700.00, but we wouldn’t have to pay for it
until the first of the year.  Ken rationalized that he would need the sprayer
when we build our home in Star Valley.  When I came home, I helped Ken finish
moving the furniture, vacuumed the carpet and started washing the walls and
trim.  We then taped it and Ken sprayed it.  It was after mid-night when we
went to bed.  I was surprised that it took so long to get it ready to paint. 
We slept in the North bedroom.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken got up early the next morning and started
cleaning the carpet.  We then left for Star Valley as we wanted to look at some
other property to make sure our lot was where we wanted to build.  The other
property we looked at wouldn’t work out for us and when we looked at our
property again, we loved it and really want to build there.  We sure hope it
works out that we can.  We did meet a wonderful LDS couple who have a beautiful
home with a gorgeous view and had a good visit with them.  They are retired,
have gone on a mission and used to live in Taylorsville, Utah.  They, like us,
wanted to get away from the city and the traffic and have a slower, more
peaceful life.  Ken and I loved the drive up and back and loved being in that
beautiful valley.  We visited with Uncle June and his family.  He hasn’t been
well.  We were tired when we arrived back home that night, but we still had to
put our bedroom back in place as the next day was Sunday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Lake Mead/Los Vegas </b>– Ken and I were invited to go
with Mike and David’s families in <b>June of 2002</b>.  They rented a nice home
with a swimming pool for a week and we went boating and water skiing on Lake
Mead.  The home had a pool table and we took other games, so we had a great
time together.  We also went into Las Vegas one day and I was impressed by the
beautiful water fountains and how they dance to lights and music.  We had a
wonderful vacation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Motorcycle trip with Ken in fall of 2002 – </b>Quint had
sent us a paper cutout of himself (a flat Stanley) and we were to do something
fun and take the cutout with us and then send it back to Quint with pictures
and a report of what we did.  It was for a school project.  We decided to
borrow Jeff’s motorcycle and go on a trip to see the fall leaves.  We first
went to Denny’s to eat breakfast, then rode up Weber Canyon and on to
Coleville, then on to Heber City where we stopped for lunch and also eat a
frozen yogurt at Ken’s favorite yogurt place – Caroline’s.  We drove down one
of the canyon’s – Emigration, it seems like.  We had a great time.  We took
pictures all along the way and then sent them to Quint with his cutout and a
report of what we did.  It was a fun and beautiful trip.  I loved it, and loved
being with Ken.  I felt safe riding in back of him.</p>
