<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>May 2009 Dentist (Spiritual Experience)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I didn’t like the dentist who
replaced Dr. Cottle and he wanted to do so much work on my teeth and it would
be very expensive, so I decided to go to another dentist and get a second
opinion.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Bob, Ken’s brother, told me about
his dentist in Roy and that he felt he was very good and reasonable in price,
so I made an appointment and went.  After checking my teeth, there wasn’t as
much work needing to be done as this former dentist had told me, but still
there was plenty.  I went probably four to five times and it cost me well over
$1,000.  Later my bridge on my upper left side came off, so I went back in to
Bob’s dentist.  He fixed the tooth temporarily and put the bridge back on, but
said it wouldn’t last as my teeth back there were bad and needed to be pulled
and that I would need 3 posts put in.  Those are really expensive.  He also
said my caps on my front teeth were worn out and needed to be replaced.  He did
a root canal, but couldn’t find the last canal, so didn’t put a crown on it,
and said it needed to be done, plus other work.  I told him we would have to
wait.  I came home very discouraged as we didn’t have that kind of money to pay
for all that work.  <b>I decided to make it a matter of prayer.  I asked
Heavenly Father what I should do – should I get dentures, even though all the
dentists had told me I shouldn’t.  The thought came into my mind to call Aunt
Banita (Uncle June’s wife) and I had a good feeling about getting dentures</b>. 
I knew that Banita had dentures.  I called her and asked her about her dentures
and she said she loved them, that she had always had bad teeth, like mine, and
was also always in the dentures office and spending tons of money on her
teeth.  She said she finally told her dentist to pull her teeth, that she
wanted dentures.  He told her she would regret it, but she said “Pull them
anyway.”  She said she has loved them and has never regretted getting them. 
She told me who her dentist was and I was going to make an appointment to go to
her dentist, but he was in South Jordan (over an hour away). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> I went to church on Sunday and
spoke to my friend, ? Larsen and I noticed how beautiful her teeth were.  I
went to pick her up to go walking the next morning and she didn’t have her
teeth in.  I didn’t know she had dentures.  We talked about them and she said
she loved them and her husband had dentures and he loved them too.  I asked her
who her dentist was and she said <b>“Dr. Gray in Kaysvill</b>e, and said he was
LDS and a wonderful man and great dentist”.  I was excited, so I called the
next day to make an appointment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After examining my teeth and me
telling him about the problems I had had with them all my life, he agreed that
I needed dentures on the top, but said he wouldn’t have them on the bottom as
they never fit right since the tongue is in the way.  He said my bottom teeth
and bridges looked fine anyway.  I made the appointment to have the top teeth
pulled.  Ken went with me.  I was amazed that after deadening the teeth, they
came out so easily.  He had made the molds and put the new dentures in and told
me to leave them in until the next appointment or otherwise the gums would
swell and I wouldn’t be able to get them back in.  He told me how to take care
of them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Well, to make a long story short. 
I got along great!  My teeth look beautiful and many have told me that too.  I
can eat almost anything and I surely haven’t regretted getting them, I wish I
had done it years ago, like Ken wanted, and they would have saved us tons of
money – although, maybe I was supposed to wait and get this great dentist.  <b>The
Lord surely answered my prayer.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2009 (email to family)</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Dear family, </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>             I have been thinking
for some time about having an <b>Easter egg hunt</b> again this year, but since
Easter is in March - a week away and we had snow last Saturday and it has been
cold since, I'm not sure if it would be wise to have it next Saturday.&nbsp;
I'm wondering about having it&nbsp;three weeks from Saturday. &nbsp;Maybe the
weather would be better then.&nbsp; I thought we would do practically the same
thing as we did a couple of years ago - have the Easter egg hunt at 10 am, play
games and relays, eat - barbacue hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken or steak
(whatever meat you would like to bring for your family) and bring salads,
chips, vegetable trays and desserts.&nbsp; Dad and I would furnish a potato
salad and drink for the meal and furnish the Easter eggs for the Easter egg
hunt.&nbsp; We could visit and play games as long as you want, as dad and I
won't plan anything else for that day.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to being
together again, so hope you can make it.&nbsp; The tentative date would be
Saturday, April 12th.&nbsp; This way you can do your own thing for Easter and
yet we can still celebrate with an Easter egg hunt in April.&nbsp; What do you
think?&nbsp; Let me know if this would be a good time for you.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>              I have heard about
the <b>&quot;wheat shortage&quot; </b>from different people.&nbsp; Maybe you
have heard about it too.&nbsp; I had heard that the LDS mills still had some,
but I was talking to a friend yesterday in church and she said they are out
too.&nbsp; She and her husband volunteer at the church mill in Kaysville every
Wednesday.&nbsp; She said there was a rush on wheat and it is gone now.&nbsp;
She said they had a truck come in last week and people knew it was coming in
and within a few hours, it was all gone.&nbsp; She said she checks on the
internet regularly and found it is a major concern worldwide.&nbsp; We hope you
have already got some put away for your food storage.&nbsp; Maybe it isn't as
big a concern as she and others are saying, but maybe it is.  </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>            It has been great
getting together with most of you lately.&nbsp; <b>Thanks for the Birthday
dinners</b> for dad, and time spent with you.&nbsp; We've enjoyed being with
our <b>newest grandbaby, Rachel Lyn,</b> and her parents and brother.&nbsp; <b>Dad
wanted to celebrate his birthday at Lava and soak in the mineral tubs.&nbsp; He
also wanted to go snowmobiling </b>so he checked around and found the best
place to do that was at Soda Springs in Idaho which is just 25 miles from
Lava.&nbsp; Sandi and Nick went with us and we had a great time.&nbsp; We spent
one night&nbsp;at Lava and one night at Soda Springs.&nbsp; The Trail Creek
lodge was so fun there at Soda Springs.&nbsp; It is a bed and breakfast.&nbsp;
We were the only ones there at that time, so it was really fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
owner&nbsp;gave us a&nbsp;super deal since we were renting a double snowmobile
for $120.00 and since we weren't there on a weekend.&nbsp; He gave us 2 rooms
for $40.00 ($20.00 for each couple) and that included a wonderful breakfast of
sausage, eggs, hash browns, toast&nbsp;and orange juice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
lodge&nbsp;had a large screen TV with a DVD player, hot tub, fireplace, tables
to play games, etc. plus 25 miles of groomed snow mobile trails with lots of
hills and valleys to play around on.&nbsp; </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'>The four of us
plan to go again next year, and we'd like to invite any of the rest of you to
go with us.&nbsp; We will stay the two nights at the Lodge in Soda Springs
rather than stay one night in Lava.&nbsp; They have several snowmobiles to
rent.&nbsp; If you rent a snowmobile, they furnish the snowmobile outfits
free.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had all of that for Wednesday afternoon, Wednesday night
and most of the day on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only cost us&nbsp;$76.00 a
couple, (we shared the cost of the snowmobile and the rooms).&nbsp; &nbsp;Sandi
said it was the most fun she has ever had snowmobiling.&nbsp; </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'>This was the first
time Nick has been snowmobiling and I asked him if he liked it and he said he
loved it.&nbsp; If we go during the week, and if most of you wanted to go, we
could rent the lodge for a good price.&nbsp; It has 7 bedrooms, plus lots of
other space for sleeping bags.&nbsp; Let us know soon if you are interested as
we need to make the reservations soon.&nbsp; The owner&nbsp;says that many
people make reservations a year in advance.  </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>            Dad's Christmas or
birthday gift from you - Dad's guided fishing trip in August is another fun
trip we're looking forward to.&nbsp; We will take our&nbsp;boat and tent
trailer and plan to stay the week at Flaming Gorge reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad's
guided trip for the big fish is for part of a day, but since we will be there,
we wanted to stay a week.&nbsp; If any of you can come, we would love to have
you.&nbsp; Sandi and Nick will be there as he will be on the guided trip
too.&nbsp; Not sure if they are staying the entire week.&nbsp;That will be the
week of August 4th through the 9th.&nbsp; I'm sure we will be going to East
Canyon Reservoir again at least once or twice this summer and maybe to Willard
Bay and take &quot;Great Big Mable&quot;, so hopefully some of you can come
during those times too.&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>             Shellie and family
will be coming up again in July, so we will have a &quot;<b>Girl's Day
Out&quot; again</b>.&nbsp; We'll plan that later, but if you girls have any
ideas for what to do or where to go, please let me know.&nbsp; Shellie and
family always like to go to <b>Lagoon</b> while they are here, so maybe some of
you could go with us there too, plus we will have a family
barbacue.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>We&nbsp;will have at least 2 or 3 more Saturday summer
barbecues in our back yard too</b>.&nbsp; If any of you have ideas for fun
things to do as families or as couples, let us know that also. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>            Well, we hope you all
have a wonderful Easter.&nbsp; Come see us when you can.&nbsp; We know you are
all busy, but you don't need an invitation to come.&nbsp; We're always excited
to see you when you can.  We sure love you all.&nbsp; Mom &amp; Dad, Grandpa
and Grandma</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We went snowmobiling at Trail Canyon Lodge for Ken’s
birthday with Sandi &amp; Nick again this year, so we are making it a
tradition.  </b>We had a wonderful time again snowmobiling on the beautiful
hills and roads, eating good meals that Sherrie prepared for us.  She fixed
gluten free, dairy free and sugar free meals for Ken, Sandi &amp; I and made
regular meals for Nick.  That was great of her.  We had a fun time playing
games and visiting at night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We celebrated our 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year
on June 19<sup>th</sup>.</b>  My, it’s hard to believe Ken and I have been
married for that many years.  We have had our share of trials, like all of us
do; but all in all, it’s been a great life together.  Our love has continued to
grow over the years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> Our six special children, Sandi,
Shellie, Mike, David, Scott, Jeff and their spouses, planned a fun week for us
at that time.  They rented a lodge up in the pines outside of Soda Springs,
Idaho.  The people who own it fixed our meals while we went biking, hiking, 4
wheeling, fishing, swimming at Lava Hot Springs or soaking in the hot mineral
pools there, visiting, playing games, sitting in the hot tub, or watching late
movies on the big screened TV.  We had such a good time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It was just the adults there so we
had lots of time to enjoy each other.  <b>Just before we all left to come home,
our children presented us with a beautiful quilt they had made.  It was
Shellie’s idea and she asked the moms of each family to make quilt blocks for
each member of their family.  They were all so different, yet very special. 
They sent them to Shellie and she put them all together, adding family pictures
and the picture of Ken and I, on our wedding day, in the center of the quilt
with all the other blocks around them, and finished the quilt.  We were so
surprised and thrilled.  We love it.</b>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We were there from Monday through
Friday.  Friday night we went to the temple and on Saturday we had <b>the
baptism of Shellie &amp; Roy’s son, Jase, at our church</b>.  They were coming
from Arizona so wanted this side of the family to be able to attend this
baptism.  Jase’s other grandparents were able to attend also.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After the baptism, we went to David
&amp; Shauna’s home where we had a family party which included the
grandchildren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Since I got married right after I graduated from
high school, it was also<b> my high school class reunion</b> this year, which
they held in June.  It was a grand event held at the Grand American Hotel in
Salt Lake City.  It was so fun to see my old classmates and their spouses and
to reminisce on the past and get updates on what they have been doing since
that time.</p>

Idaho  (I wrote this up twice, so decided to put both of them in.)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our kids wanted to do something special for Ken and my 50<sup>th</sup>
anniversary.  They asked if we would like to have an open house since we have
so many friends all over, or if we would like to go on a cruise with just</p>

alt="Our family at Trailcreek Lodge on our 50th anniversary">They, their
spouses and Ken and I, or they asked if we wanted to go or do something else. 
Mike was hoping we would choose a cruise as he loves those.  They hoped we
wouldn’t choose an open house as they wanted to spend time alone with us for a
few days, but they said if we wanted it, they would be glad to put one on for
us.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The idea of spending several days
alone with our children and their spouses, rather than an afternoon/evening
opening house, appealed to Ken &amp; I.  We talked about going to Moab since
some of our friends love it there and our sons have gone there and enjoyed it. 
Shellie didn’t want to go as it would be so hot in June, some of the others
didn’t either.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Sandi with being the oldest was
kind of in charge of planning it with their help.  She was getting frustrated,
as were we, as some of the children wanted to do one thing, while others didn’t
and wanted to do something else.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We were about to give up and just
have Ken and I go off by ourselves or else do the open house, when Sandi
suggested Trail Canyon Lodge as they go with us there each February for Ken’s
birthday and go snowmobiling. We thought that was a great idea and so Sandi
called the others and told them we would like to go there.  There is Lava Hot
Springs not far away, Sherrie makes the meals for us and they are great, even
gluten free/dairy free ones for Ken, Sandi &amp; I.   Not everyone was able to
come for the entire week. Shauna was working so wasn’t in the above picture,
but was there most of the time. Some of the others had to come late or leave
early, Scott &amp; Mishelle needed to bring one of their twins with them, but
most were there most of the time, and we loved being with all of them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We all had a great time together
going to Lava and sitting in the hot mineral pools one night, going on the four
wheelers all around, playing games, visiting, eating good meals and just
hanging out together.  Ken and I loved it, we love being with our wonderful
children and their spouses.  They all paid for Ken’s and my share of the
expenses.  <b>The day before we left, they presented Ken and I with a beautiful
quilt which Shellie put together, tied and bound with Pecos.  She asked her
sister and sister-in-laws to make a quilt block for each member of their
families and put on things that represent that person’s hobbies, interests, or
skills and then to get them to her by a certain date so she would have time to
put them together and make the quilt.  It was a beautiful quilt and we were so
surprised, but thrilled.  They gave us a beautiful card also</b>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> We came home on Friday and Ken and
I went to the temple as we always love to do that on our anniversary.  It seems
like Shellie &amp; Roy went with us.  On Saturday all our family came to our
home for a backyard barbecue.  We enjoyed being with our grandchildren as well
as our children and spouses, so that climaxed our wonderful 50<sup>th</sup>
anniversary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a new grandson born in July to Jeff &amp;
Gail.  They named him <b>Matthew Lee</b> and call him <b>Matt</b>.  (This
little guy was supposed to come to this family, he saved his parent’s marriage.
He was how the Lord answered our prayers.)  That makes 3 children for them and
20 grandchildren for us.  We also have 5 great grandchildren.  Sandi’s oldest
daughter, JaNae has 3 plus a stepson, and her younger daughter, Chelci, has a
little boy.  We had two baptisms this year, Jase, Shellie &amp; Roy’s son, and
Maddi, Mike &amp; Becky’s daughter.  Our oldest grandson, Garrett, Shellie
&amp; Roy’s son, is serving his mission in Kennewick Washington.  We love his
letters.  He will return next August.  Jeff &amp; Gail moved to Layton, so all
of our children live close except for Shellie &amp; Roy who still live in
Arizona.  They moved from Chandler to Queen Creek.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><a name="_Hlk522486714"><b>Fish
Lake with Nick in August of 2009  </b>Nick was the one to tell us about Fish
Lake and how beautiful it is and what great fishing.  He and Sandi hadn’t been
married long when he suggested we go there together as he loves to fish like
Ken does.  It turned out that Chelci had her baby early (Nathan) and so Sandi
needed to be with Chelci and help her and the baby, but Nick went with us
anyway and we got to know him better this way.  He pulled our tent trailer and
we pulled our boat.  He helped us with everything and we had a great time
fishing and caught lots of fish, he likes to play games too so we played games
at night.  We were glad he went with us and we had a great time, although it
would have even been better if Sandi could have come.  We have gone several
years there together and loved it.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I keep busy with our church callings of
Family History Consultants where we help the people in our ward and work at the
Family History Center in Clearfield.  This summer, along with the above trips
plus several other trips with family, we enjoyed our garden and were able to
can lots of vegetables and fruit.  We now have rabbits and chickens too.  Ken
is still a sub school bus driver.  We enjoy tending our grandchildren and being
with our family.  When we get a chance, we get some fishing in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><a name="_Hlk522486749"><b>We went
to Zion’s National Park with Jeff, Gail &amp; family again this year</b>.  They
love it here and so do we.  Jeff &amp; Gail had added a daughter and another
son to their family.  Rachel was born in February 2008 and Matt was born in
July of 2009 so in October of 2009, we still have room for all of us in our
tent trailer as Ben &amp; Rachel could sleep on the bed when the table usually
goes and we put up the portable crib for Matt.  We loved it again this year and
the children were great!  Jeff &amp; Gail took a double stroller and Rachel and
Matt rode in it and Ben was old enough to walk on his own.  With the four
adults, we could manage the stroller and children on the shuttle buses and the
trails.  The four of us played games after getting the children to sleep on our
beds and afterwards transferring them to their beds.  <b>We didn’t go in 2010</b>
as Ken and I were on our mission to California</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>THANKSGIVING 2009  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thanksgiving was wonderful.  We met at Bryce's church where
Deanna, Bryce and Wendy and her children had set up tables, chairs and
decorated the tables and the room.  They had a Christmas tree which Wendy
decorated with Thanksgiving and autumn decorations.  She had asked Georgia
&amp; me to send her stories of our ancestors via e-mail and then she cut out
the ones she wanted and pasted them on cards and put their names on the front. 
She hot glued them to small pumpkins as centerpieces.  It looked so nice.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Me and each of my siblings cooked a
turkey, Bryce and Deanna did the mashed potatoes, me, Jeanenne and Deanna made
dressing.  Georgia brought the candied yams. Each brought drippings from the
turkeys and I made the gravy there, and everyone else brought salads, veggie
trays, rolls, vegetables, pies - so we had so much food.  It was delicious.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The next generations were anxious
to start playing volleyball so they helped us clear off the tables and put the
tables and chairs away and then they began their games.  I love to watch them
play.  They are all really good.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Meliah came down and she had the
younger children come to the nursery for a couple of hours after dinner and had
crafts for the older children and the little ones played with toys while their
mothers watched them and visited with each other.  Paige and Nathan's wife,
Jessica, helped Meliah.  Everyone had a wonderful time.  Misha, Kim &amp;
Jeanenne's cute daughter, brought her boyfriend.  He is a really cute young
man.  They seem so in love, so that's neat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> I thought I would insert this article “Gods Come Cheap
These Days” By Chuck Baldwin<br>
June 12, 2009, to show a little of what is going on in the world today.  We are
living in a turbulent time with so much evil, crime, confusion, frustration,
corruption, etc.<br>

            When President George W. Bush was first elected back in 2000, I
well<br>
remember the way Christian conservatives went gaga over him. They would deny<br>
it, of course, but it was more than hero worship: they acted as if he were a<br>
god. Life-size posters filled Christian bookstores. Religious broadcasters<br>
and televangelists swooned over him like 16-year-old girls used to swoon<br>
over Elvis Presley. Pastors invoked his name almost as a prayer. The<br>
Religious Right acted like they had died and gone to Heaven. In the minds of<br>
Christian conservatives, G.W. Bush could do no wrong. The result of all this<br>
sophomoric silliness was that the Religious Right became blind, impotent<br>
lackeys to a Big-Government, big-spending, Orwellian, and inept<br>
administration--maybe one of the worst in U.S. history.<br>
            And all of this was not lost to the political left. They called
Christian<br>
conservatives &quot;dupes,&quot; &quot;buffoons,&quot; &quot;gullible,&quot;
and a whole lot more. But now<br>
it is the liberals' turn to take a voyage in the vehicle of villainous<br>
vulnerability.<br>
            First, there was the major media's &quot;anointing&quot; of
President Barack Obama.<br>
Yes, I use the word &quot;anointing&quot; on purpose. Make no mistake about it:
in the<br>
minds of the major media, Obama was not inaugurated; he was canonized. No<br>
pope, king, or potentate of history received the coronation that Barack<br>
Obama received. To the liberals who dominate the news media and<br>
entertainment industry in this country, Obama is not a President: he is a<br>
god.<br>
            For example, did readers see the way NBC newsman, Brian Williams,
bowed to<br>
his majesty, Barack Obama? (If you missed it, see it here</p>

            Where are Keith Olbermann's eloquent rebukes of the Military
Commissions Act<br>
(MCA), the suspension of Habeas Corpus, and many other Big-Government<br>
intrusions into the private lives of the American people that were first<br>
instituted under George W. Bush and that now continue under Barack Obama?<br>
When he wants to, Olbermann can be a very convincing, articulate defender of<br>
constitutional liberties. However, it seems that Olbermann is only<br>
interested in constitutional government when it is a Republican trampling<br>
it. Since Obama became President, Olbermann has not only muted his criticism<br>
against unconstitutional policies emanating from the White House, he has<br>
joined the chorus of mindless worship of the new President.<br>
            (Here are Olbermann's trenchant comments on President Bush's
support for the<br>
Military Commissions Act and denying Habeas Corpus--something we will not<br>
see from Olbermann regarding the same policies emanating from the Obama<br>
White House:</p>
