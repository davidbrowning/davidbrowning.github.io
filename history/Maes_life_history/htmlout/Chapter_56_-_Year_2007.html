<p class=MsoNormal>     <b>2007 has been a good year for Ken and I</b>.  It has
gone by quickly.    Ken keeps busy doing repairs and remodeling jobs for family
and friends, and when it is out-of-town, he likes me to go with him.  I enjoy
being with him and enjoy being with our children and other family members, so I
have gone whenever I could.  I keep busy with church work, house work and
family.  I have been able to do some family history and am hoping to do more in
the coming year.  Ken really enjoys fishing, and I enjoy it too, so when Ken
isn’t working and we have the time, we go fishing.  Sometimes we have gone by
ourselves and other times we have gone with some of our children and their
families, or with cousins and friends.  We had a fun get-a-way this summer with
my sister, Georgia and her husband, Rick.  They have a membership to Camper
World, so we took our tent trailer and boat and went to the Camper World at
Coalville, Utah.  We had a great time </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>In March of 2007, we went on a tour to </b><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Israel </span>with our daughter, Shellie, her husband,
Roy, and 3 of their 4 sons.</b> <b>Roy’s parents went also.</b>   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We had a wonderful family vacation at Bear Lake with all

alt="2008-01-31 005"><u>We spent time this summer doing some remodeling,
painting and getting new carpet for our cute basement apartment</u>.  Bob,
Ken’s brother, and I were Ken’s helpers.  Ken took out the door going into the
sun room and also the window.  I asked him if he could make arches for the
window and door, and sure enough, he could and did.  When we lived in our home
in Layton, I had a large china cabinet, which our neighbor had given us.  I had
all the souvenirs, which our sons had brought back to us from their missions,
souvenirs from our missions and other vacations and beautiful items our
children and friends had given us.  This cabinet was too large for our basement
apartment, so Ken had glass shelves made and installed them on this west wall
of our sunroom, for my souvenirs, etc.  I was thrilled about that.  Our
apartment  looks so nice now</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I were just released as the ward nursery
leaders.  I enjoyed this calling more than Ken, but I was proud of him.  He got
down on the floor and played cars with the children or helped them put puzzles
together and he had at least one on his lap during the lesson.  He set up the
tables and chairs for our snacks, helped me and Camille set up the nursery when
we arrived.  He was wonderful and the children loved him.  The children are
precious.  It did get hard at times when one or more started crying and they
would start some of the others crying.  We had between 14 and 20 there each
week so we were exhausted when we went into Sacrament Meeting.  They just
sustained Ken as the Ward Family History Consultant.  I was excited about his
calling because he will be trained and we can work on family history together. 
He will have at least one other person to help him train the members of our
ward too.  I am still the discussion leader for our Relief Society Book Group. 
I have had this calling for 2 ½ years, but I really enjoy it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We love each other, our family, the Lord and his
gospel and our many friends.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>(I was asked to tell about my project of writing and
compiling the Byron Porter &amp; Descendents Family History Book.  This was
done while living in Grantsville, UT)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>BACKGROUND<b>:  </b>In June of
1980, my uncle, Dale Porter, called and asked me if I would be interested in
putting together a family history book for his parents - my grandparents, Byron
and Mary Elizabeth or “May” as she was called, and their descendents.  He knew
I was interested in family histories, and he told me of a family history
conference in Salt Lake City and said he would pay for me to go to it and he
would finance the expenses until the books were printed and then we could sell
them at a reduced cost to our families.  I was excited and gained much information
at the 3 day conference.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>WHAT I DID:  Shortly after the
conference, I contacted my parents, siblings and each of my uncles, aunts and
cousins and told them of this project and asked if they would get me a family
group sheet of their family, family pictures and a personal history of
themselves.   I set a deadline for them to have these items in to me. 
Meanwhile I worked on gathering journals, and histories of my grandparents
since they had already passed away and also what information I could collect on
a deceased aunt &amp; uncle, Maurine &amp; Royal. .  Grandma’s children were
sure that she had written a history, but no one could find it so I asked each
of them to write what they could remember about the lives of their parents –
spiritual experiences, trials, successes, etc.  I began compiling all this
information together to form histories for them.    Grandpa Porter was a
writer, so I wanted some of his poems and stories in the book.   I don’t know
that he had any of them published other than one story “Red Cloud”, which was
in the Morgan County newspaper, but I thought they were great and I know many
other family members agreed with me.  When the deadline for the histories,
pictures, etc., came, I only had a few, so I sent out a reminder and set another
deadline.  More came in and after doing this a couple more times, I called and
set up a time to come and pick up the materials of those I didn’t have.  This
way I was able to get histories from all of them.  Some histories were more
detailed and longer than others, but that didn’t matter.  It was important that
they had a history in this book for their posterity.   Shortly before the
manuscript was to go to the printer, my father, Glendon Porter, was going
through some papers and found his mother’s history.   We were all excited.  I
was able to add it to the history I had compiled.  I felt that our prayers had
been answered</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I enlisted other people’s help.  I
knew a lady who did calligraphy and asked her if she would write our title page
“Byron Porter Family Descendents”.   My cousin, Verla Porter was going to BYU
and also had a job there working in an office.  She volunteered to type the final
draft on her computer.  I was excited about that as I only had a typewriter. 
She also volunteered to proof read and make corrections where needed.  I would
type a section, get it to her and she would type it up after work and in her
free time..  That was a big help to me.  She gave many, many hours to this
project.  I appreciated her help so much.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>One member of the family had a
beautiful picture of Grandpa and Grandma Porter on their wedding day, so I was
able to use it in the book.  I included Porter songs, pictures of their homes,
a Pedigree Chart, histories of Grandpa &amp; Grandma’s parents &amp;
grandparents -  Lyman Wright, Byron’s father, spiritual experiences of Sanford
Porter, Byron’s grandfather; history of Mary Elizabeth Clark Robinson, May’s
mother;  parting instructions &amp; testimony of Ezra T. Clark, May’s
grandfather.  All these items were in the Introductory Pages.  I made a Table
of Contents with a chapter for each family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I put a family tree and family group sheet at
the beginning of each chapter.  Of course it started with the Patriarch &amp;
Matriarch, Byron &amp; May.  Next I put a personal history sheet, then pictures
of them, and then their history.  I also included Byron &amp; May’s Patriarchal
Blessings as well as the poems and stories for Byron.  At the end of this
chapter, I put pictures of the family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mary Maurine was the oldest child so her
information was in the 2<sup>nd</sup> chapter, then Elmer Royal had the 3<sup>rd</sup>
chapter, then my parents, Glendon &amp; Mildred, then Dad’s sister, Merlynn and
her husband Jeff Olsen, the 6<sup>th</sup> chapter was another sister, Enid and
her husband, Wayne De Graw. The 7<sup>th</sup> chapter was a brother, Joseph
Verle and his wife, Beth, &amp; family.  Aunt Beth will be speaking on this
program also.  The youngest child was a son, Dale, so he and his wife, Esther
and their family made up the 8<sup>th</sup> chapter, which was the last
chapter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>GRANT STEVENSON –  Uncle Dale, Dad
and their siblings suggested I talk to Grant Stevenson, our good relative who
owns a Genealogy or Family History firm in Provo, about printing the book.  We
made an appointment for me to bring the manuscript and come meet with him and
his staff.  Mom came with me, she was always a great support, as also was Dad. 
Grant Stevenson and his staff were so helpful and kind.  They gave me suggestions,
let me use their cutting tools, helped me with the layout and when I was
finished and took the final draft there, they printed the book for us.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Including the index at the back, this book has
358 pages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Grant asked how long it took me to
put together this book.  I was embarrassed to tell him it took me 3 years.  I
explained that with raising our family, helping Ken with the farm, my church
and my civic callings, that I didn’t have as much time to devote to this
project as I would have liked.  He told me that 3 years wasn’t that long to put
together a book of this size that many people took five to 10 years.  That made
me feel much better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had a Porter Family Reunion and
gave the books out to the families at that time.  Uncle Dale was very generous
in financing most of the cost of the books.  He wanted the family to pay a
little for the books as he knew they would appreciate them more if they paid
something for them, but he wanted the books to be reasonable enough so that
everyone who wanted one could have it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had a Glendon Porter Reunion on
the 27<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> of July and I was talking with a
nephew, Nathan Tew, about family history books.  He told me that he is in the
Elder’s Quorum Presidency in his ward and a few weeks ago, he gave a lesson to
the Elders on Family History.  He said in preparing for this lesson, he read
the 2<sup>nd</sup> Porter book, the one Aunt Beth did.  He said the more he
read, the more excited he got and he could hardly put it down.  He said he
learned so much about Byron, his great grandfather, and his other ancestors and
he enjoyed giving the lesson.  That’s how I got so excited about family history
work.   I started reading these histories and I wanted to read more.  I got to
know these wonderful people by reading about their lives.  They have helped me
because as I would read about the trials they had, I would say to myself “Wow!,
if they had those trials and yet endured to the end, I should be able to endure
with my trails.”   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>APPRECIATION:  I am very grateful
to Uncle Dale for giving me this opportunity.  It was a wonderful experience. 
I appreciate and love my grandparents even more as I worked to put together
their histories.  They were a righteous couple.  They had their trials and
problems, just like all of us do, but they loved the Lord and loved the
scriptures and faithfully endured to the end.    I am so grateful for their
examples.  I got closer to my aunts, uncles and cousins not only by working
with them to get their histories, pictures and family group sheets, but by reading
their histories as I typed them into the manuscript.  I am thankful that I was
privileged to be born into this special family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>KEN’S MOTHER’S HISTORY:  A few
years ago, I encouraged Ken’s mother to write her history.  She would say “Oh
nobody would want to read it if I did.  My life has been boring”.  One day I
started asking her questions about her life and as she answered these
questions, I would write them down.  Soon other things about her life would pop
into her mind and she would tell me those things or experiences.  It wasn’t
long until I had several pages and then I read it back to her.  I felt she had
some great experiences and so I kept encouraging her to write down things as
they came to her.  Pretty soon, she was excited too.  This went on for some
time.  Finally, I was able to compile it and add pictures.  She passed away in
November of that year.  She had wanted to give them as Christmas gifts to her
children and siblings, so we had them printed and spiral bound and gave the
books as her final gift to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I would encourage all of you to
read your family histories and learn about your ancestors.  I would also
encourage you to write your history if you haven’t already done so.  You will
be happy if you do, and your children and posterity will be thankful.</p>

over once a month to the District Office <b>and Jackie Thompson and I walk and
have lunch together and catch up on what we have been doing.</b>  Jackie is the
director of a new Equity Department now.  She called one day and asked if I
would be willing to come out of retirement and be her secretary.  This was
after we came home from our mission.  Ken didn’t want me to and I didn’t want
to either, even though I would have enjoyed working with her and Ken and I
could use the money.  I wanted to be able to enjoy our grandchildren and
families more, do more family history and temple work and enjoy life, so I
declined.  She understood and hired Patty Woodward.  Patty had left the
Planning Dept and was hired in Staff Development to take Billie’s place after
she retired.  Patty is a “flake” and not dependable.  She is a social
butterfly, so it caused a lot of frustration to Jackie, like Patty did to me. 
Jackie was so relieved when Patty quit.  I think Patty knew she better or she
might be fired.  Jackie got a good secretary after that.  Her and I still keep
walking, talking and going to lunch as often as possible.</p>
