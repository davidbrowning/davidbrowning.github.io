<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 58 – Year 2008</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  Ken and I are both retired, and between Ken’s and my
social security and my small retirement, from Davis School District, it isn’t
enough to live on.  Maybe we could live on just our social security and my
retirement if we didn’t go anywhere or do anything, but that isn’t our nature. 
We are not content to just sit at home and watch TV or read.  Ken has been in
construction work for many years.  Since he retired, he has been doing handyman
jobs <img width=264 height=197 src="Chapter_57_-_Year_2008_files/image001.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="Ken putting in water system for Carla &amp; Craig Browning">since he knows
every aspect of building.  But he doesn’t charge much and is always having to
replace tools and equipment, so our tax man told us that Ken went into the hole
over $6,000. last year on this business.  Some of that was the depreciation of
his trailer, but since it is hard work and Ken is 69 now, it is hard, and he
comes home so tired and hurting all over, and it’s not worth it when you lose
money instead of making money so he has decided to give it up.  Handyman jobs
were also frustrating (as you know) because of past work done on homes by
contractors or carpenters, electricians or plumbers who didn’t care and just
did the work any old way.  With Ken being a perfectionist, that was hard for
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>            He still wants to keep
busy and we need the money, so he is in training to be a <b>school bus driver</b>. 
Ken is a really good driver, but I hope he has enough patience with the school
children.  He will have to develop it as they have told him he can’t touch any
of them, or look angry as they take pictures with their cell phones (older
kids).  He seems to be enjoying the training and learning a lot – guess we’ll
see how it goes.  He hasn’t done this before.  Ken is a great school bus driver
because he is a great driver.  I have always felt confident when riding with
Ken, and much better than when I am driving myself.  He is good with the
children and youth and he commands their respect.  Everyone at the
Transportation Department likes him as he is dependable, keeps his bus clean
and maintenance done when it needs it, is fair with the children and others,
etc.  He enjoys it for the most part and they just made him the employee of the
month (Jan 2013) for the transportation dept</p>

alt=P1100725>            <b>Ken is a very good school bus driver.</b>  I knew
he would be able to handle the bus really well as he is an excellent driver,
but I wondered about his patience with the kids, but he is doing great.  If he
has any problems, he just pulls his bus over and talks to me and they settle
down.  Ken is always amazing to me how he can do just about anything.  He has
great talents and abilities.  I could never be a school bus driver as I don’t
have confidence in my driving and to drive a big vehicle like that would scare
me to death, especially with worrying about the safety of the children.  I love
secretarial work and I’m glad that is what I have been able to do part of the time
during my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>December, 2008</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  Last year we were in sunny Arizona with our daughter,
Shellie, and her family for Christmas and the month of January.  It seemed
crazy to be playing miniature golf, riding in paddle boats and enjoying the
Phoenix Zoo during the holidays.  We were invited there again this year, but
decided to wait and go in the spring since we have five of our six children
living within an hour’s distance from us and it’s fun to be with them and their
families for Christmas Eve and Christmas day also.  Besides, Shellie and Roy’s
youngest son, Jase, will be baptized next spring and we want to be there with
him and his family at that time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We’ve had several additions to our family this
year.  Our youngest son, Jeff, and his wife, Gail, had a beautiful baby
daughter, <b>Rachel,</b> born to them on February 12<sup>th</sup>, and the next
month, our oldest grandchild, JaNae, (Sandi’s daughter) gave birth to a beautiful
baby daughter, <b>Emma</b>, on March 10<sup>th</sup>.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=222 height=167

alt=Ashley>On the 26<sup>th</sup> of October, our son Scott, and his wife,
Mishelle, had <b>twins</b> born to them.  <b>Kaden</b> was born first and
weighed 5 lbs, 14 ozs and his sister,<b> Kaitlyn</b>, weighed 5 lbs, 8 ozs. 
When Scott &amp; Mishelle told their older children, Kylan and Ashley, that
they were having twins and that one was a boy and the other was a girl.  <u>Ashely,
age 6, wasn’t surprised.  She said “I know, I prayed to Heavenly Father for
that.  If the baby was a girl, Kylan would be sad not to have a brother and if
it was a boy, I would be sad not to have a sister – so we needed one of each.”</u> 
I know that Ashley received this blessing from the Lord too.  That makes 19
grandchildren for us and 5 great-grandchildren which includes a step great-grandson. 
They are all very special and we are so thankful for each of them.</p>

and Roy’s oldest son, Garrett, left for his mission in August</b>.  He was
called to serve in the Kennewick Washington Mission.  Ken and I flew down to
Arizona to help Shellie with the preparations for an open house they were
giving him and to hear him speak in Sacrament meeting.   Ken and Roy also were
able to be in the circle when the Stake President set Garrett apart as a
Missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  The next
morning, we flew home.  Garrett’s other grandparents, Veldon and Patsy Seymore,
had just finished their mission at Martin’s Cove in Wyoming. On their way home
they stopped at our place.  That evening the four of us drove down to the Salt
Lake Airport to meet Garrett as he flew in to report to the Provo M.T.C.  We
brought Garrett back to our place for the night.  The next morning the four
Grandparents had the privilege of taking our Grandson to the MTC.  It was a
wonderful experience.  Garrett is a great young man and from the letters we are
receiving, he loves his mission.</p>

activities and trips.  We usually always have a family barbecue at our home. 
One time we had a family breakfast of biscuits, gravy, bacon &amp; eggs, in our
back yard.  It had been a tradition to have Ken make biscuits &amp; gravy for
our family.  Everyone loves them.  We also go to <b>Lagoon</b> for one day and
sometimes get the “bounce back” ticket and go back the next day.  I have gone
with them most years and love being with this special family and having fun
with them on the rides, and enjoying the beauty of the flower gardens and trees
that are there..  Ken doesn’t love Lagoon, but sometimes would come in the
evening to have the picnic dinner with us and then walk around pioneer village,
have an ice cream cone and then go watch the good entertainment that was there
at that time.  Ken and I love having Shellie &amp; her family here with us, but
sometimes they go stay with her siblings for a day or two also. </p>

alt=P1030643>            I started doing this when David and Taylor Paige were
young.  They were about 7 and 9 years old, I think.  I took all the grandkids
there usually at least once or twice a year.  I usually just took one family’s
children at a time, but as they got older, sometimes I would take cousins.  In
our Buicks, I could take 5 grandkids, but now in our Chev Impala, I can only
take four.  Most of these grandchildren love to go there, even when they are
teenagers. I mentioned that to Shauna, one day, and she said it was mainly
because they wanted to spend time with Grandma.  Her comment made my day.  I
love to be with our children too.  Ken went a couple of times with us, but he
was usually working or doing projects for us or other family or friends.  Dinosaur
Park is a fun place, especially for younger children.  They have a great museum
where all kinds of Dinosaur skeletons are displays on the main floor and
upstairs they have displays of all different kinds of rocks made into jewelry
or other items.  They also have an area upstairs where they have robot
dinosaurs that growl and move somewhat.  The children love this area.  Outside
is lots of paths which take you to different full-size manmade dinosaurs, they
growl too.  They also have a playground made up of manmade dinosaurs, etc. 
They have an area where you can dig for bones – actually use brushes to uncover
dinosaur bones and eggs.  Another area is where you overlook the pond and can
buy food to feed the large fish, ducks &amp; geese.  They have other hidden
paths, etc., etc.  It is a fun place.  I don’t know how many times I have been
there, but it is still fun, especially to watch the grandchildren having such a
good time.  We usually take our lunch and treats as there are picnic areas all
around.  They also have a gift shop and snack bar.  The gifts are too
expensive, but I usually buy the grandchildren a ice cream treat, just before
leaving to go home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We always have a <b>family Christmas party</b>, but last
year we also had our first <b>“Grandchildren’s Christmas party</b>”.  I got the
idea from Sister Hinckley’s book about her life (can’t remember the name of the
book).  I liked this idea so decided to try it.  The first year I also invited
our great grandchildren (Dawson, Kennedy, Emma, Jaden and Nathan)  This was
almost too many for me to handle, but I had Paige help me</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We enjoy tending the grandchildren whenever possible and
supporting them in their sports, academic, music and other accomplishments. 
It’s fun to be grandparents.  <b>Emily, David &amp; Shauna’s daughter, will be

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and I decided it was too hard
on him to continue doing handyman and remodeling jobs to earn extra money, so
he started working for Davis School District last spring as a substitute school
bus driver.  He enjoys it.  He doesn’t plan to apply for a regular bus route as
he still wants time to go fishing, go to the temple, etc.  Ken and I are the
Family History Consultants for our ward.  We work at the Family History Center
in Clearfield on Tuesday nights and are learning a lot and enjoying it.  We
keep really busy with family and Church, but we have a good life.  We are

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tuesday, May 6, 2008 – Ken keeps really busy, but helps
others - Virginia Johnston today</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken has been really busy the last while
(although he usually keeps really busy as everyone wants him to help them with
one project or another, since he knows how to do everything).  Now he has been
training to be a bus driver.  Since he is getting older (69 now), he gets tired
easier and gets in pain if he works too hard or too long or if the project is
stressful – so he has decided he wants to phase out of doing construction jobs
except just for our immediate family, and Bob since we live here.  Although, he
will help others in an emergency, if needed, I’m sure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> We can’t make ends meet just with
our social security checks &amp; my small retirement check, so he needs to
bring in extra money some way, so he decided to be a school bus driver.  He
applied and they need bus drivers, so they were excited to have him.  The
training has been lengthy and several tests, but he has completed them.  He is
to work as a substitute for 6 months and then he can apply for his own bus
route if he chooses to.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyway, my brother, Bryce and his wife, Deanna, brought a
home in Perry, but it needed a lot of work done to it, so Bryce asked Ken if he
would help him.  My sister, Georgia and her husband need him to help them do a
project, our son, Scott and wife, Mishelle, need him to fix their bathroom, my
cousin, Randy needs him to do projects on remodeling their home, etc., etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>              On Tuesday, after morning school bus training,
he had planned to go to Bryce’s home to work there again, but realized he
wouldn’t have enough time as we had a meeting that evening with the High Priest
Leader in our ward about family history work, so he worked on projects for Bob
&amp; Mark on the yard and garden.  While we were eating supper, a neighbor
called and asked if he would go to Sister Virginia Johnston’s home and install
some hand safety railings in her shower for her.  The neighbor explained that
he didn’t have time and she needed it done right away.  Ken accepted, and we
stopped at her home on our way to the meeting to see what it entailed.  After
the meeting, Ken asked if I would go with him to Virginia’s home while he
installed them.  I had hoped to stay home and do more on-line training on the
internet since Irven &amp; Sandy had been to our home all day while we cooked a
meal in our solar oven.  They hadn’t planned to be there all day, but her and I
kept visiting about different things and the day was gone.  Time sure flies by
so fast.  I started to object about going with him but then I realized that it
was hard for him to spend the time doing this for her, since he was tired from
working so hard all day, but he was willing to do it and besides it wasn’t
appropriate for a man to go into a single woman’s home alone.  Virginia was a
widow – so I went with him.  I was glad I did because as I visited with
Virginia, she told me several spiritual experiences she had with raising her
family.  I felt the spirit and my love and admiration for this special lady and
her family grew in my heart.  I felt the Lord gave me this blessing since I was
willing to go with Ken.  Virginia was happy for my visit too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>May 2008 - Dentist</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I went to the dentist in May for a checkup and to have them
cleaned.  I found out after I got there that Dr. Cottle had retired and a new
young dentist was taking his place.  They took x-rays and the dentist told me
that the roots of a tooth on the back top right side were crumbling and because
I had had a root canal in that tooth, I couldn’t feel any pain.  He said the
tooth couldn’t be saved and I would need to go to an oral surgeon to have it
pulled as he didn’t have the equipment needed to get it out.  He also said I
had a cavity which needed filling and that I needed three new crowns in order
to save those teeth.  They gave me a paper itemizing the cost of the work which
needed to be done and it was $3,000.00 plus the cost of the oral surgeon.  Each
crown was $670.00 plus $150.00 for some other procedure they do with crowns. 
Needless to say, I was pretty discouraged when I left that day as $3,000.00 is
a lot of money even in today’s world, and we don’t have any dental insurance. 
They wanted to make an appointment for me to have the work done, but I decided
to call other dentists and get a second opinion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> I did make an appointment with the
oral surgeon.  I was nervous about going there since the dentist said the roots
were crumbling, I knew he would have to dig them out and it would be a painful
and stressful experience.  <b>I prayed hard to Heavenly Father that the tooth
would come out ok and to bless the oral surgeon as he took it out.  He deadened
all around the tooth and I felt it being numbed even up into my right eye. 
When he pulled the tooth, it came out all intact.  I was surprised and asked
him about it and he showed me the tooth.  I told him Dr. Harris had told me the
roots were crumbling.  He said I know, I am very surprised myself.  I knew my
prayers had been answered</b>.  I got along great and didn’t even have to take
a pain pill that he prescribed.  I only took Tylenol.  Mark Hulet, Ken’s
cousin, had been a dentist and he kept asking me how I felt and how I was
doing.  He was surprised that I was doing so well.  Ken had been with me as he
wanted to know how the oral surgeon felt about me having dentures instead of
having all this work done since my teeth have always been soft and I have
always had so many cavities, caps, bridges, root canals, crowns, teeth pulled,
paradonels disease, etc., and I take fairly good care of my teeth<b>.  We have
spent a lot of money on my teeth, plus what the insurance would pay<u>.</u></b><u> 
I always liked Dr. Cottle, but I don’t think he took as good of care of my
teeth as he should as prior to going on our mission to the Philippines, Dr.
Cottle had checked my teeth and said they were good.  But soon after I got
there I had an abscessed tooth and had to go to a dentist that the mission
president referred me to in Angeles.  She did a lot of work and also had to put
on three crowns</u>.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Now here we are again.  The oral
surgeon told me that if he were me, he would have the new crowns put on and
keep my teeth as long as I can.  He said “If you even decide to have dentures,
only do it on the top as you have a ridge on the bottom and the dentures would
slide back and forth and wouldn’t work.  I had other dentists tell me that
since I <a name="_Hlk522484361">had had paradonal’s disease my gums would never
adjust to dentures and I would be miserable.</a></p>

Saturday afternoon.  It turned out really fun.  They all enjoyed visiting and
getting reacquainted with each other.  I think all of Irven &amp; Sandy’s
children and families were here and I think ours were also.  <b>We had another
Browning/Young barbecue in our Clinton back yard</b>, and it turned out great
also.  Most of Irven’s and our families were here, and Bob &amp; Carroll’s
family - Bruce and many of his family came, as well as Robert’s family.  Grant
works on Saturdays, so don’t think he and Stacey were able to come.  It seems
like Kathy was up visiting, so was here, and also Sherry and her family</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ken &amp; I also hosted a Porter Barbecue one Saturday
afternoon &amp; evening </b>. Most of Bryce’s, Georgia’s, Kim’s and our family
were here, as well as Maleah representing Terry’s family as they live in
Alaska, but Maleah lives in Idaho, and she comes to all of our family
activities if she possibly can.  Everyone brings their own meat to grill, plus
a pot luck dish to share.  We eat, visit and then many play volleyball and some
of the ladies sit around and visit while watching the game, or watching the
children play together. (not sure what years these other family barbecues
were)  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We hosted a couple of High Priest parties here in our back
yard also and they turned out great!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I am thankful we have this big, nice backyard where we
can hold these parties and activities.</b></p>

alt="2008-07-20 096">We have a large back yard, but we have a small home.  We
have a living room, sun room, nice kitchen and 3 bedrooms, but only one
bathroom.  We can’t hold more than one family, during the winter, when we have
family dinners, but that’s okay as we get more time with that family.  Once in
a while, we invite two families but then we are crowded.  We love our family
and love to be together as often as we can.  Here is a picture of Mike &amp;
Becky’s family when they came.  We usually play games after dinner.  From left
to right is: Paige, David, Mike, Maddy, Becky holding Jessie and Ken.  I’m
taking the picture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other picture is of Jeff, Gail &amp; little Ben at one
of our family barbecues in 2008.  Boy, we surely have to enjoy these
grandchildren while we can, as they grow up so fast.</p>
