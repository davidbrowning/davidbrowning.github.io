<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chapter 45 - 1999  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Jeff </b><u>came home from his
mission in January 1999,</u> and we were excited to have him home.  He hasn’t
told us a lot about his mission, but from what he has said, <b>he had a hard
mission, but he stuck it out and did his best under very trying circumstances
and we are proud of him. </b> <b>He also had another hard trial.  His
girlfriend, Nicky</b>, who he had planned to break up with before leaving on
his mission, but felt the Lord told him she was the one for him, so he didn’t
break up with her and he expected her to wait for him.  She did wait up until
the last few months and ended up getting married two days after he returned
home.  Her family loved Jeff and felt she was making a big mistake.  Nicky’s
friends were getting married and she wanted to also.  She was dating a guy who
had graduated from college, had a good job and could afford to buy Nicky a
home.   I think she knew that Jeff would have to go to college and she would need
to work to help him get through with his education, so I think that was a big
part of it.  She used her free agency.  Free agency is a gift from God and he
allows us all to use it.  It was really hard on Jeff.   It was hard on all of
us.  It is really hard when your children are hurting, and you can’t do much
about it.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jeff didn’t date again for quite a
while.  He went to Weber State University in Accounting.  He got good grades so
got scholarships and was on the Honors program.  They had a trip to go with
doctors, nurses and dentists to Nepal.  He had been working so paid the money
and went with them.  It was a trip of a life time and we were glad Jeff had
that experience.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jeff had known a girl from school,
Gail Fairbourn, who he said everyone liked to be around because she was cute
and lots of fun.  He dated her off and on, but didn’t seem to be too serious. 
Trent had come home from his mission and married Anna, and Ben had married a
cute girl.  We were working on our papers to put in to go on a mission and Ken
mentioned to Jeff that if he was thinking of getting married, that he better do
it right away as we would be gone for two years and we wanted to be here for
his wedding.  We turned in our papers and it asked when we would be available to
go and we had put FEBRUARY.  The next thing we knew was that Jeff told us he
and Gail were going to get married.  We asked when and he said the 20<sup>th</sup>
of February.  We thought “Oh no, we said that we would be available in
February.  We called the bishop and he hadn’t sent the papers on to the stake
president as he had been sick with phenomena and they were locked in his file
cabinet at the church.  He told us we could change the date from February to
March.  We were thankful and felt the Lord had a hand in that.  <b>Jeff and
Gail’s wedding was beautiful.  They were married in the Salt Lake Temple and
all our children and their spouses were able to be there.  I felt that it was
the most wonderful day of my life as Ken and I were in the temple with all our
children and their spouses.  I felt the presence of Mom &amp; Dad there too and
I knew they would be there if at all possible as they loved their children and
grandchildren – family was so important to them, as it is to me.  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Payson Lake – </b>Payson Lake is
located up the canyon behind the town of Payson which is close to American Fork
where Mike and his family live.  We heard about that canyon so wanted to camp
there.  It is a beautiful area and a beautiful small lake with a walking path
around it with areas to go down by the lake to fish or just sit and enjoy the
view.  It’s not big enough for boats, but many put rafts and canoes on it.  We
invited our family and most came with us.  We had a tent trailer, but the
others had tents.  We fixed meals and ate together, sat around the campfire and
roasted hot dogs and marshmallows and sang songs and visited.  We have a great
family and love to be together.  We have gone camping with our family to Payson
Lake several years.  One-year David found a log sticking partway out of the
water and went onto it.  It was tricky trying to keep his balance, but he did
great!  Others wanted to try their luck, but some fell into the lake. 
Sometimes Mike took his raft and let us all take turns using it on the lake. 
That was fun.  One-time Ken and I went alone and Mike let us take his raft. 
They came up one evening to have a Dutch oven dinner and spend the evening with
us.  That was fun.  One-time Ken and I were there alone part of the week and we
took our float tubes.  That was fun at first until the wind carried us to the
other end of the Lake.  We kept trying to paddle back up or to the side, but we
wore ourselves out and it didn’t work.  When we got out at the other end of the
lake, we had to carry our float tubes back to the truck.  That was the last
time we used those float tubes.  If the air is perfectly still or you are
floating down a slow river to fish, they were alright.  They had belonged to
Sandi &amp; Terry, but after Terry died, Sandi gave them to her dad.  </p>
