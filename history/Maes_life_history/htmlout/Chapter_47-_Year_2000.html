<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sandi
&amp; Terry’s cabin in Star Valley, Wyoming</span> –  </b>Sandi &amp; Terry had
gone in with another couple (friends from Grantsville) to buy a beautiful cabin
among the pines in Star Valley, Wyoming.  There were other cabins there and
they had a golf course, swimming pool, etc.  It was a beautiful area and Sandi
and her friend decorated it so beautifully (Sandi mainly as she is very
talented at furnishing and decorating)  Sandi and Terry invited Ken and I to go
up to their cabin with them several times.  Ken, Terry &amp; Sandi would go
fishing on the stream which was close by, just west of the main road in Island
Park.  I would go with them and take pictures and read my book.  It was so
beautiful there in their cabin and on their property.  We played games, helped
each other fix meals, visited, rode their 4 wheelers in the summer and
snowmobiles in the winter.  We also went to the cheese factory and bought ice
cream and cheese curd. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b> Sandi and Terry invited all our
family one year.  I think it was 2000.</b>   Shellie, Roy &amp; boys came up
too.  It was after Christmas, during the holidays.  We stayed for several days
and we all had a ball.  Our family is great together and all work together for
meals, cleanup, etc.  We had lots of fun playing games, visiting, and riding
their 4 wheelers and snowmobiles.  Sandi &amp; Terry also had sleds, so we all
dressed up in our warm clothes, boots, hats and gloves and went sleigh riding
down the road that led just above their home to the end and then others would
be on the snowmobiles and pull the ones on the sleds back up the hill.  We all
had a ball doing that and we had snowball fights, etc.  That is the time we
found out about the property we bought.  Ken had been out on one of their 4
wheelers and had passed by a sign that said property for sale by owner
$10,000.  Mike told us and we couldn’t believe someone was selling it for only
$10,000.  The phone number was on the sign.  It was filled with quaking aspen
trees and was a large corner lot.  We called on it and to make a long story
short, we were able to purchase it with the goal of building our home on it at
a future date.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Aug 14, 2000</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I haven’t taken the time to write
down very much lately, but this summer has been a different summer so I wanted
to record it.  It has been a great summer in many ways, but almost too busy. 
It started <b>in February when Rich &amp; Lois invited us to share their
vacation condo in Island Park with them again</b>.  We love going there.  We
enjoy being with them as they are great people, plus we have so much fun
snowmobiling in Yellowstone and all around, going to the clubhouse and swim or
sit in sauna or hot tubs, or going site-seeing or playing games and visiting. 
They have two weeks starting the end of January, but we usually go on the second
week.  </p>

Shauna and Shauna’s parents &amp; brother in April of 2000</span></b>.              Ken
and I also went to London, England one day by ourselves.  This was a fantastic
vacation and another dream come true as I had always dreamed of going to Paris,
but never thought I would.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I stopped at David &amp; Shauna’s home
in Idaho Falls on the way to Island Park to be with Rich &amp; Lois in their
condo and <b>David asked us how we would like to go with them to <u>Paris, Fra</u></b><u>nce</u>. 
We thought he was just kidding, but he has always wanted to go back to France
since that’s where he went on his mission.  He had been looking on the internet
and was able to find tickets for $399.00 round trip.  It usually cost $1,750. 
We became excited.  I have wanted to go to Europe, but never thought I would be
able to.  </p>

alt=P1190805>            Since we had sold Mom &amp; Dad’s home in Clearfield, after
Mom passed away, each of us children received approximately $20,000.  We paid
off Ken’s truck with the money I received and that took almost $17,000.  We
decided we wanted to go on a nice vacation with part of it.  We had thought
about a church history tour as we have never been to Nauvoo or other church
history sites, or going on a cruise since we have heard so much about them, but
never been on one. But, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, so, we said
“yes”.  Shauna’s parents &amp; brother also went with us and we enjoyed being
with them.  It was a vacation of a lifetime.  Shauna spent about 40 hours
making all the arrangements - hotel reservations, tours, checking times to
visit places, correlating, etc.  They came down and we all met and decided
where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do and we basically planned it and
then she went from there.  (Actually, she and David had already done some
ground work by watching videos and reading books to find out what was
available.)  With David speaking the language so well and Shauna making all the
arrangements, it was a fantastic trip.  The flight over was great.  I had a
window seat and enjoyed looking at the sites below as well as the beautiful clouds. 
My first experience with the subway was fun, but hard since we had to carry our
luggage and hurry to make the next one as we had to get off and on several times
to get to our destination.  We had purchased a card to last us while we were in
Paris, which we used each time we went on it.  I really enjoyed the <b>subways </b> as
I had heard so much about them, but never experienced it before.  It was fun to
ride it and also to watch the people.  <b>The hotel was small, but quaint and
cute.  The elevator was tiny.  We opened our window in our room and it looked
out onto the street below where I liked to watch the people and to see the
pigeons and doves</b>.  It was fun to be in this country.  After getting
settled, we all went to the Notradame Cathedral.  It was so beautiful with cut
glass windows, all the beautiful carvings, statues, etc.  We climbed to the top
and looked out over the city.  It was magnificent.  I hated to leave.  We had
climbed over 300 steps as we climbed on up to the bell.  Going down was harder,
especially for Ken.  We then went to the Arch of Triumph.  I was fascinated
with the traffic.  It was a circle and cars and vehicles were going every which
way, we saw one collision, but thought there would be many.  I had never seen
anything like it before.  While others were looking at the Arch of Triumph, I
was looking at the traffic before me.  We did walk over (underneath) and I
enjoyed looking at it then.  The next morning (Saturday) we rode the RNR
(train) to <img width=320 height=240
src="Chapter_47-_Year_2000_files/image003.jpg" align=left hspace=12
alt=P1190820>Versailles.  That is where King Loui the 14<sup>th</sup> built his
palace out 30 miles from the city.  I don’t remember how many acres it covers,
but it was Hugh - the buildings and the grounds.  There are over 300,000
fountains on the grounds. The fountains were not on when we went because they
don’t turn them on until the 1<sup>st</sup> of May.  When we got back to Paris,
we went to a museum where Napoleon’s tomb was plus knights armor, etc.  It was
interesting.  That night we took a cruise on the Seine River then toured the
Eiffel Tower.  It was so beautiful looking down over the city from the top of
the tower.  It was really crowded and as we were loading the elevator, Ken was
being pushed back while the rest of us were getting on; I grabbed his arm and
hurled him on with us.  He was surprised and shocked that I could do that, but
I didn’t want to get on without him.   We toured beautiful castles and ate
delicious French pastries and took lots of pictures.</p>

alt=P1190827><b>Ken &amp; I decided we wanted to go to London, England</b>
while we were over there.  The others didn’t want to, but said for us to “go
for it”.  That was great too.  We left the hotel at 4:30 as we had to meet the
group at 6 am.  We had directions of where to meet the group that were going to
London and so we rode the subway, but when we got off, the directions didn’t
make sense, so we saw a shop keeper watching the windows of his shop.  We went
over and showed him our map.  He unlocked his shop and took us in, so he could
turn on a light as it was still dark outside.  He raised 2 fingers (indicting 2
blocks) and pointed the way.  We walked the two blocks, but still couldn’t see
the name of the building where we were to meet, so we saw two street cleaners
and showed them our map.  They indicated that it was just around the corner. 
We thanked them and found it.  We were thankful that there were people on the
street who could help us, as we would have hated to miss this trip.   We went
on the Euro train under the English Channel.  It went fast.......  We met some
wonderful people, on the train, and had fun visiting with them also.  It was
cold and rainy in England, but we went on a tour bus and had a great time
anyway.  To see the palace, Big Ben, London Bridge, etc., was exciting.  We did
get off and ate at a cute little café and had fun talking to the waiter.  We
saw signs all over that said “To let”.  We thought it looked like “toilet” and
we wondered why they were advertizing toilets so often.  We found out that it
meant “To Rent”.  They were renting buildings for businesses, apartments or
rooms in buildings.   We arrived safely back in Paris that night, and were very
glad we had gone.  </p>

alt=P1190819>            Thanks to David being able to speak French, we ate
good food at good restaurants.  I especially loved stopping at the little shops
on the street where we <b>bought a special yogurt, delicious cheese and long,
delicious bread.</b>  We would take them to the hotel and eat the bread &amp;
cheese while we drank the yogurt for our meal.  We also loved stopping at the
sidewalk cafes and ordering chocolate/banana crepes.  They were so delicious.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The morning when we were to head for home, we
were all packing and then everyone wanted to go to another museum before going
to the airport.  In packing, Ken and I couldn’t find our passports &amp;
tickets.  We were frantic and searched everywhere and through our entire
luggage.  We told the others to go without us and we would meet them later as
soon as we found our passports &amp; tickets.  We prayed, of course, and
finally we found them.  We had decided to put them in a special pocket in one
of our bags.  Wow, were we relieved.  We decided to go for a walk as we still
had plenty of time.  We walked through the park and I loved it, it was so
beautiful and fun to be there, especially with my wonderful guy.  We stopped at
a sidewalk café and bought another chocolate/banana crepe.  We met up with
David, Shauna, her parents &amp; brother.  David &amp; Shauna’s friends and the
friend’s brother &amp; his wife, had gone over with us, but didn’t stay with
us.  They did their own thing, but hadn’t done the planning, the preparing and
scheduling like Shauna had done, so things didn’t work out for them like it did
for us, and they couldn’t see or do near as much as we did.  </p>
