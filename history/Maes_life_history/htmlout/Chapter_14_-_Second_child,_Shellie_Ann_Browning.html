<p class=MsoNormal><b>Shellie Ann</b> was born on June 21, 1967.  She was a
beautiful, delightful, contented baby.  She never cried unless she was hungry
or couldn't see me or Ken.  As long as we stayed in the same room with her,
where she could see one or the other of us, she was happy.  If we left the
room, she would cry. I can still see her in my mind, sitting in her little
carrier or swing playing with her toys.  Sandi had been an only child for over
five years so we were concerned she might be jealous of the baby so we bought
her a cute little doll.  She loved the doll, but wasn't jealous.  She loved
Shellie and was a cute, helpful big sister.  </p>
