align=left hspace=12 alt="2005-02-17 Leaving Mission K&amp;M">When we received
our mission call on Christmas Eve 2002, it said we would go to the Angeles
Philippine Mission and be proselyting in the Tagalong language. We were so
surprised.   Because of our health, our nutritionist, Nancy Litchford, told us
that we would not go foreign.  I had high blood pressure and fibromyalgia and
Ken had yeast problems for which he had to be on a special diet and take lots
of supplements.  When the brother, from the mission department called, he said
“I bet you didn’t expect to go on a foreign mission.”  I said “No, we didn’t.” 
He then told me that all senior couples want to go on English speaking missions
as they don’t want to have to learn a foreign language.  He told me that they
don’t have enough places (United States, Canada and England) to send all these
couples to, and he said: “other countries need you senior couples.   He told us
that we would have a tutor call us three times a week to teach us Tagalong. 
This tutor’s name was Elder Black.  He had been a missionary in the Philippines
and was now going to BYU and was working for the church as a part-time job to
help make money for his studies.  We were told to go to BYU to pick up our
manuals and other materials, which we did.  We also got phone equipment so that
Ken and I could both hear him and use our hands to write down what he told us. 
Learning the language was very hard for Ken, but I was able to memorize enough
words to be able to bear my testimony and pray in Tagalong.  We had told our
children that we would come visit them and spend a few days with each of them
before going on our mission.  We had to take our books along, when we went to
visit our families, and we had a schedule of which day and time he would call
us.  Our sons were excited that we were going foreign because all of them had –
Mike to Norway, David to France and Belgium, Scott to Venezuela, and Jeff to
Mexico City, Mexico.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were able to talk to our family physician,
Dr. Gary Lee, who gave us a letter telling, the authorities at the airports,
that we needed these medicines and supplements for our health and we would be
gone for two years.  We bought and packed one suitcase with our two year’s
supply of supplements and my three-month supply of blood pressure medication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> I<b> will continue with my Homecoming talk since it gives a
summary of our mission.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>TALK FOR OUR HOMECOMING MEETING -</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My, what an experience we have had with going on
a full-time mission.  We are so thankful for this opportunity and blessing.  It
has been hard and challenging at times, just like anything we do in life, that
is good and rewarding, but it was a privilege to serve our Heavenly Father and
his children in the Philippines.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             When our stake president, President Sanders,
was interviewing me prior to coming on our mission, he asked if I felt worthy
to represent our Savior, Jesus Christ.  I became emotional and said “I hope so,
I do love him.   Now that our mission is over, I hope that our Savior was
pleased with what we did.   It was a great privilege to represent Him.     </p>

align=left hspace=12 alt=P1190468>            I have always loved the song
“Called to Serve”.  I loved to sing it in Primary with the children, when I was
serving in the Primary, and when it was added to our Hymn book, I was excited. 
As we joined, with all the other missionaries at our last devotional at the
MTC, before leaving for our missions, and sang that beautiful missionary hymn,
I could hardly sing at all because I had become so emotional.  “Called to serve
him, Heavenly King of Glory, chosen heir to witness for his name, far and wide
we tell the Father’s story, far and wide, his love proclaim.”  When we arrived
in the Philippines and went to our new little branch for our Sunday meetings,
the branch president asked us to sit on the stand and bear our testimonies to
the members.  One of the hymns we sang that morning was this beautiful hymn
“Called to Serve”.  As I looked down at my Filipino brothers and sisters and
heard them singing this hymn, and realized that Elder Browning and I were here
on our missions on the other side of the world, singing this special hymn with
them, again I could hardly sing.   We were “called to serve our Heavenly King
of Glory and chosen to witness for his name.  We had come “far” to tell the
Father’s story and proclaim his love.”  This was the mission we had set a goal
for when we were first married and for which we had hoped and prayed for all
our married life.  And NOW WE WERE HERE.  <b>(This picture is of the District
Choir in the Paniqui District. These were great friends of ours</b>)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=345 height=259

align=left hspace=12 alt=P1190467>            Elder &amp; Sister Clark, our
good friends who were the office couple, e-mailed us and one of the things they
told us was “You will love the people.  They are so friendly, hospitable,
affectionate and kind.  They said “When your mission is over, the office elders
will have to drag you to the airport as you won’t want to leave these people.” 
Well, Brother.  Clark, they didn’t have to drag us to the airport, as we were
anxious to see our family &amp; friends here in America, but it was really hard
to leave our wonderful friends there in the Philippines.  The Guimba District
gave us a “farewell party” and I think I cried most of the evening thinking
that I might not see them again, at least in this life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>This picture is from left to right: Sister &amp; Elder
Browning, Sister &amp; Elder Mcharry, Sister &amp; Elder Hyer and Sister &amp;
Elder Clark.  President &amp; Sister Brimhall are in front</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Small miracles took place making it possible for
us to go on our mission, and small miracles took place over there also.  One
such miracle, in the Philippines, was with our good friends Brother Roger &amp;
Sister Heidi Silvia.  They were a wonderful couple with two precious children,
but after setting goal to go to the temple, Satan jumped in was trying to
destroy their marriage.  They knew they had to pay tithing in order to get a temple
recommend, but they didn’t see how they could.  He had just lost his job and
they didn’t have much money to hold them over until he could get a new job.  He
had been trying to find a job, but hadn’t been able to. We told them that the
Lord blessed us after the trial of our faith.  We told them that if they paid
their tithing, the Lord would bless them.  They took the leap of faith and did
pay their tithing and a couple of days later, while he was out looking for a
job, his wife got a call for Roger to come in for an interview with a company
he had applied with.  She called Roger really excited; he went in for the
interview and got the job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am so thankful for the power of prayer and for
the love our Heavenly Father has for his children.  Elder Browning and I would
pray that we would be led and guided as to how we could help these people, and
we were led and guided.   We prayed for inspiration, and we were blessed with
inspiration.  We couldn’t have done what we did without the Lord’s help. 
Brother Browning is amazing.  Sandi, our oldest child, used to tell everyone
when she was little “My dad can fix it, my dad can do anything<u>”. And, he can
do practically anything</u>, but he too needed the Lord’s help on our mission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=151 height=150

align=left hspace=12 alt="President Brimhall"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we first met with our wonderful <b>mission
president, President Grant Brimhall</b>, and his wife, we asked him what he
wanted us to do and he said “Go to your area, see what needs to be fixed and
fix it.”  He said, “We prayed you here, so the Lord will help you.”  The Lord
did help us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We learned to rely on the spirit, as we were
called upon, many times at the last minute. to speak, give a lesson, lead the
music, etc. – the many experiences of a missionary.  Sometimes we would go to
meetings or activities and find our names on the program.  But as we read,
studied, prayed and fasted, the Lord was always there for us and it constantly
amazed us at the help he would give us.  We felt the spirit with us much of the
time, and when we didn’t, we knew it was because we didn’t do our part or have
the right attitude.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>              Many times, we would be prompted to go visit
someone, and sometimes to take something to them and when we arrived they would
say “Thank you for coming, I was praying that you would come.” Or, “How did you
know I/we needed you?”  Sometimes, it was just because they were lonely and
needed someone to come and visit with them, sometimes they were sick and needed
a blessing, and sometimes they had serious problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            That is the first problem we tried to “fix” was
getting the brethren to go Home Teaching and the sisters to go ‘Visiting
Teaching”.  This wasn’t happening like it should.  We felt that if the members
were doing this, there wouldn’t be so many lonely, sad, unhappy people, because
they would have their home teachers and visiting teachers, who were their
friends and who cared about them, and they would be the ones to go there and
help them.  They would be the ones, who would be prompted to go visit these
people.  In Mosiah 18:8-9, It says that we will be “willing to bear one another’s
burdens, to comfort those who stand in need of comfort, mourn with those who
mourn and stand as witnesses of Christ at all times, in all things and in all
places.”   The members were not fulfilling these assignments and we felt that
was the reason why there was only about 10% of the members attending Church. 
We fasted and prayed about what to do and we were soon giving H.T./V.T.
workshops and firesides, in our branches and districts and throughout the
mission.  Sometimes we held them with the help of the young missionaries, and
sometimes by ourselves.  At first, we thought we could just teach them how to
do H.T./V.T., teach them what to do, the importance of doing it and give some
inspirational experiences to motivate them, and WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD DO IT –
but it wasn’t that easy.  They are a more laid-back, easy going people.  They
would be excited at first, but it wasn’t long until it would die down again. 
Many of the leaders would get H.T./V.T. organized, but it was hard for them to
get the members to go.  We kept praying, evaluating &amp; changing, in the
hopes that somehow, we could get them to do it.  But, we didn’t feel too
successful in this area.  We hope we helped some.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Soon, we were given instruction, from our area
president &amp; apostle, Elder Dalen Oaks, through our mission president that
President Oaks would like the couple missionaries to go to 5 less-active
families from each branch and give presentations to them.  He gave us a list of
7 topics which we were to develop presentations on, and he said if we were
inspired to do others, that we should do it.  We were having some success with
that and enjoying teaching these families, especially one family – <b>the
Corpus family</b>.  They had one child whose name was “Joy”.   They lived in
our branch in Munoz.  She would call me “Mrs. Universe” and smile as she said
it, and we would kid each other about who was Mrs. Universe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             One evening as we were teaching them, it
started to rain.  They have a tin roof, so it was noisy, and they had to move
in closer to us in order to hear us.  It rained harder and harder and pretty
soon the water started coming into their home.  We decided we better close and
head for home as it looked like a typhoon was on its way.  Brother Corpus said
he would get their boots for us to wear, but Ken told him that we had boots in
the trunk of our car, and asked if he could go out and get them for us.  He did
this and when we went out, we were glad we had on boots as the water was so
high.  We were parked by one of their sewage ditches and as I walked to the
car, I forgot about the ditch as I didn’t see it since the water had filled it
up and overflowed.  I stepped into it and the water was high so it went inside
my boots.  We got into the car and when I got home, I quickly showered and we
poured alcohol all over my feet and legs.  The water is so polluted that it is
dangerous if you get it on you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One evening, as we were leaving a home and it
was raining, as I stepped out the door, <b>a gecko dropped off their roof and
down my neck inside my blouse</b>.  I stifled a scream, as I didn’t want to
embarrass the family.  I quickly ducked down a little, put my hand down my
blouse, grabbed the gecko and threw it out.  When we got into the car, Ken
asked me what that was all about, and I told him.  I was sure glad I was able
to get the gecko out, before it got any further down my body.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we first moved into our cute home in Munoz,
there were geckos on the outside of the screen, and I thought they were cute
and even named them, but as I saw more and more of them in our home and heard
the loud noise they made, I didn’t like them so much anymore.  As I would open
a drawer or cupboard and one would be inside and would scurry around, I would
be scared.  Marlyn cleaned our cupboards, drawers and countertops at least once
or twice a week, so I was glad for that and appreciate her so much.  Marlyn had
served a mission, and she had also been a domestic helper in Hong Cong, so she
really knew how to clean, do laundry and cook very well.  She was certainly a
blessing to us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>With leadership training, we saw more success.</b>  
We had been doing some leadership training, but after a few months in the
mission, Pres. Brimhall, under the direction of Pres. Oaks, changed our
assignment, asking that we go to a branch for a month at a time to train all
the priesthood and auxiliary leaders.  Elder and Sister Clark, who were the
office couple, were asked to help Elder &amp; Sister Maharry and Elder Browning
and I, with this, so we worked together to make a schedule.  We felt this made
a difference and we could see more progress.  We enjoyed getting to know the
members better by being with them at all their meetings and activities for a
month.   We would teach &amp; train, then repeat, follow-up, encourage and
praise them.  We used pictures, over-head transparencies, role plays,
demonstrated &amp; used power point presentations.  We taught them the importance
of having presidency meetings and what we do in presidency meetings as they
were not having them.  We told them “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” 
Many were failing – the children or youth were bored and misbehaving because
the leaders &amp; teachers were not prepared, and many of the children &amp;
youth were not coming.  After we worked with the presidencies and trained them,
many became excited and they held their meetings and came prepared.  Most of
these good people wanted help and they appreciated it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We met with President Gajonera, his counselors
&amp; executive committee at a PEC meeting, and they were excited.  President
Gajonera told us that all of his priesthood and auxiliary leaders were working
hard and magnifying their callings and were visiting and reactivating.  He told
us that the training we had given, had really helped their branch.  We were
grateful that we could help and to see them so excited.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The month went by fast and we would say
“goodbye” and go to the next branch.  We wished we had at least 2 to 6 months
with each branch as 1 month wasn’t enough, but with the Lord’s help, we were
able to help them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we started this schedule, President &amp;
Sister Brimhall asked us to make primary our priority, and attend there every
week.  They asked us to teach, train and help the leaders so they could
function like Primary should.  They said:  “Primary is where the foundation for
the testimony of the children begins, and we are losing too many children and
youth.”  Primary, in the Philippines, had mainly been a “nursery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first week that we attended Paniqui 1, we
went into primary.  The primary president was an older sister.  Primary wasn’t
functioning like it should, but she was trying.  She asked me to help her. She
had 2 counselors, but they were not helping her, she was doing it all.   I was
able to give her and her counselors some training after primary, and she said
“Sister, I was ready to ask to be released.  I have been the primary president
for 10 years.  I love the children, but I was getting tired and discouraged. 
No one seemed to care about primary except me, and no one visited or gave us
training.  Now I want to stay in and I can do it right.  She did do it right. 
We were invited to attend a district activity a few months later, and her
branch had more children than any, and they were really prepared with their
presentation and did so well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One primary president said “Sister, the children
want you to do “Sharing Time” and “Singing Time” because you make it fun.  I
told her “You and your counselors can make it “fun” also, just follow the
Outline for “Sharing Time and the Sacrament Meeting Presentation”.    Use the
Liahona, prepare well, pray for the spirit to be with you, and be
enthusiastic.  Sister Brimhall said “If you’re having fun, the children are
having fun too”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            President &amp; Sister Brimhall said our second
priority was to be YM &amp; YW and we attended at least one of their Sunday
meetings a month and attended mutual as often as we could.  We were also to
train the Relief Society and the Branch Presidency and Elder’s Quorum.  Ken
trained the men and I trained the women. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We also trained the district leaders, and had
them help us with the trainings whenever they could.  We asked these district
leaders to continue to teach, train, resolve concerns and help these branch
presidencies.  We found that many presidencies if they were not trained, became
overwhelmed and discouraged and just quit coming to church and then became
inactive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was so thankful for the experiences, knowledge
and testimony I had gained from serving, throughout my life, in various
positions in the church.  This helped me so much with being able to train the
leaders in R.S., Y.W. &amp; Primary in the 2 Districts and 14 Branches we
served in.   I was able to share experiences and give suggestions from having
served in these positions, along with teaching them from the “Handbook of
Instructions”.<span style='font-size:16.0pt'>  </span>I read and studied the
handbooks, for these organizations, as I didn’t want to lead any of them astray
– so I learned a lot more.  I was always referring to these handbooks,
highlighting and underlining them.  I’ve learned more about the Handbooks of
Instruction than I ever knew before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There is so much poverty over in the Philippines, and it made us sad to see so many suffer, but there was such a difference when
they joined the church and remained faithful. They had hope, and they were
happy even though they had trials as they trusted in the Lord.  Many of our
Filipino brothers &amp; sisters would delight in telling us about their
conversion and baptism and how it had blessed their lives.  They spoke fondly
of the missionaries who had baptized them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were in the Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch in
January and there is a sweet little sister in Paniqui 3, who had a stroke about
a year ago.  The right side of her body is affected and she can hardly walk and
can’t use her right arm or hand, but she comes to church faithfully and tries
to do whatever she can.  She confided to me that she suffers with much pain but
they can’t afford her pain medication.  She says as she reads the story of
“Job” in the Bible, it comforts her.  She says she reads the Bible, Book of
Mormon &amp; other scriptures every day and that way she feels close to the
Lord and feels his love for her.  She has hope that one day, probably in the
next life, she will be well and whole and if she remains faithful she will be
with her family and our Savior and Heavenly Father in the Celestial Kingdom. 
This sweet sister is only 42 years old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had many experiences we could tell you
about.  Elder Browning and I did a CSP with the young missionaries in our zone
of cleaning and painting hospital beds, and later going to this same hospital
with our batch mates, who were the humanitarian couple missionaries, to deliver
supplies and equipment, and this made it possible for us to take a girl there,
who had a terrible skin disease, to get help at no charge; and also to take 4
perspective missionaries there to get their exams, x-rays and dental work,
prior to going on their mission.  The hospital, doctors and dentists didn’t
charge us.  (More about this on p. 250)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was sad when sisters would confide their
problems to me and then say “Sister, you are the only one I can trust.”  This
is a real problem there – the gossiping and dishonesty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I love children and it was great being able to
meet with the primary children each week.  We also got close to many youth with
meeting with them in YM/YW, Mutual, Youth Conference &amp; other activities.</p>

Most of you know that Brother Browning has health problems and has to watch his
diet or he is in terrible pain.  One of the special blessings we received,
while in the Philippines, was Marlyn, our cute little “house helper”.  Pres.
Brimhall had suggested that we hire a house helper to do our laundry, cooking
and cleaning so we could spend our full time in the work of the Lord.  Elder
Kendall, our zone leader and his companion, Elder Ieniora, found Marlyn for us
(actually, the Lord brought her to us). Marlyn was surely a blessing to us. We
have kept in touch with Marlyn through Facebook and Messenger, and I just
received a message from her saying that her and her family were doing good and
that she just had four more months in Kuwait until she could go back to the
Philippines to her family<b>. (We are messaging back &amp; forth right now. 
This is amazing.  She is in Kuwait and I am here in Utah in the United States,
and we are messaging immediately.  It is October 25, 2017) </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We loved being with the young missionaries. 
They were so dedicated and obedient.  We learned a lot from them as we met with
them in district meetings and zone conference and heard them give workshops. 
Some of them, especially the Filipino Elders, had sad stories also, but we were
proud of them for their sacrifice to come on missions when many times they were
the only member in their family and didn’t receive any support from their
families, and some parents disowned them for joining the church.  We had the
Zone Leaders, who lived close to us, over for breakfast and other meals often,
and enjoyed being with them.  They were dedicated, good missionaries. <b>Elder
Daniel Hulbert</b> was one of them.  We loved him.  When we moved to the Monte
Vista Ward and went to church, we saw Daniel and were so surprised and
excited.  They live in another ward who meets in our building.  He introduced
us to his wife and three children.  They have four now.  We invited their
family to dinner and had a great time.  It is fun to see their family as we
pass by in the building and chat a minute or two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We don’t have time in this meeting to tell you
about these people, but maybe we could tell you some of these in a fireside and
show you pictures of these wonderful people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am so thankful for the gospel – for the <b>“Hope
and Happiness”</b> it brings us.  By living the gospel of Jesus Christ, by
keeping his commandments, we can be happy.  Our Heavenly Father wants us to be
happy.  He said <i>“Men are that they might have joy, that they might have it
more abundantly.</i>” We know many people live &amp; die without knowing of the
beautiful plan of our Heavenly Father &amp; it makes us sad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There is a little primary song that I have been
teaching the children in the Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> branch during the month of
January, and I’m sure these primary children have been learning it also.  It
says: <i>My life is a gift, my life has a plan, my life has a purpose in Heav’n
it began.  My choice was to come to this lovely home on earth and seek for
God’s light to direct me from birth.  I will follow God’s plan for me holding
fast to his word and his love.  I will work and I will pray.  I will always
walk in his way.  Then I will be happy on earth and in my home above.”</i> 
These primary children, along with the primary children throughout the world,
are being taught that they are children of our Heavenly Father.  What a
blessing that is for us to know that we lived with our Heavenly Father before we
came to this earth, that we are his children and he loves us.  Our Savior,
Jesus Christ loved us so much that he atoned for our sins and died on the cross
for us.  He says:  As I have loved you, love one another.”  He also asks us to
keep the commandments, for he knows that if we do, we will be happy.  Another
primary song says”  <i>Keep the commandments, in them there is safety &amp;
peace.”</i>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we would say “Goodbye” to these beautiful people, they
would say “When will we see you again?” and we would say “We don’t know whether
we will see you again in this life or not,” and most would say “Well, we will
endure to the end and be together in the Millennium.”  We told them we would
hope and pray for that.  It was hard to leave these special friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We would like to thank all of you for the love
and support you have given us –our children and their special families, our
extended family, friends, neighbors &amp; ward members.  We were like all the
other missionaries, we looked forward to getting mail whether it was letters,
cards, pictures, e-mail, or packages.  I especially want to thank the primary
children and their leaders &amp; teachers for the 6-foot colored paper
Christmas tree with all the stars, candy canes, presents with pictures, names
and messages.  Some messages said, we are proud of you keep up the good work,
others said ‘Remember who you represent, work hard” and others said “We miss
you and love you.”  This last year we received a 6 foot “Autumn Tree” with the
beautiful colored autumn leaves with names, messages and pictures.  We put both
trees on our walls in our living room and enjoyed them both until the time to
come home.  Then we gave one to each of our district primaries so they could
show them to the branch primaries and give them ideas of what they could do for
their missionaries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Our experience in the Philippines</b> when <b>Tina
Linderman</b> woke up in the night having a terrible feeling that something bad
was happening to us and that she needed to pray.  She did pray for our safety
and that was when Ken and I were dropping off the zone leaders after being to
zone leaders conference in Angeles.  Ken usually dropped them off on the side
of the road and let them walk across the road to their home, but this time we
had two boxes of Book of Mormons for them, so he looked both ways and started
to do a U turn to let them off in front of their home, when at that moment a
black car without his lights on was right there on us.  It was a miracle that
he didn’t hit us.  We all screamed and the Elders dove for the floor of the car
and I threw myself over to Ken as the car would have hit me broadside.  The
Lord just put out his hand and stopped that car.  Ken drove off the road and
stopped and we all shook and the black car didn’t move for some time and
finally went on.  I’m sure he was as shaken as we were.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Letter to our family (Home and Visiting Teaching Fireside
for the Tarlac Stake)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It’s 12:30
 p.m. Saturday afternoon and we just got back from Tarlac.  Elder &amp; Sister
Hyer had invited us to stay at their home in Tarlac since we were giving
another fireside on Home Teaching/Visiting Teaching to the Tarlac Stake last
night.  Since it was Halloween and there are many drunks on the road on
Halloween, they wanted us to stay with them.  They have a lovely home also.  It
is a very colorful home, with brightly colored walls.  It is a gated area, so
is safe.  They were in our area last Tuesday, so they called us and stopped in
to visit and see our home.   It was fun visiting with them and we had them stay
for lunch.  Marlyn, as always, fixed us a nice meal.  When they heard we were
giving this fireside, they ordered a bed so we could stay with them.  We
thought that was really special.  We really enjoyed being with them.  Elder and
Sister Maharry had come to hear our presentation since they will be giving them
also, so Elder &amp; Sister Hyer invited them to come over also for doughnuts
and ice cream Sundays.  It was fun visiting – it was like being home with good
friends.  After the Maharry’s left, we visited a while longer and then went to
bed.  They have a balcony, connected to the bedroom we slept in, and it
overlooks many pastures and farm lands.  It was really beautiful.  This
morning, Sister Hyer fixed bacon, eggs and pancakes.  She said she still likes
to fix and eat American food.  She had fruit also and it was great.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>.  Their assignment is much
different than ours.  We might have already told you that they are Employment
Specialists, and are assigned to five missions.  They are going all over the Philippines giving firesides and career workshops.  They are meeting with business leaders,
government officials, etc., to see about getting more jobs for the people.  I
worry about them as they have no one over them – except for the mission
department in Salt Lake.  They go all over and no one knows where they are or
how they are.  The people in Manilla told them they don’t have to report to
them. They do meet with us, and the other couples in our mission, when we go to
the mission home to meet with President &amp; Sister Brimhall for our “Couple
Conference”.  Us couples usually meet together for breakfast in Tarlac at
McDonalds.  We looked forward to these times, to be together and to eat this
food.  They made wonderful breakfast at McDonalds, over there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When they were at our home, it gave
dad an opportunity to talk with Elder Hyer about his idea of the Church forming
a coop.  The idea behind the coop was to help the farmers modernize their
farming methods, increase production and quality, build better marketing and
create jobs.  Brother Hyer said dad’s ideas were great, but if the Church had
anything at all to do with it, the government would not allow us to sell any of
the products outside of the coop.  This, of course, would defeat the whole
purpose.  I guess that’s one project we won’t try to pursue.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This fireside was intended for the
Leadership of the Stake, but they announced it in all the wards, so many other
members came.  We were able to use our Power Point Presentation because all the
stakes have a projector to which we can plug the cord into our laptop.  They
also have the big screen which comes down – so dad was happy.  He loves to give
the power point presentations.  I like them too as they are so much easier and
nicer than the overhead projectors.  I was a little nervous about this
presentation as we were making major changes to it again this week.  Last week
we were working on our presentations for the Paniqui District Conference and
this week, in our spare time, we were working on this one.  Dad awoke yesterday
morning saying “I’ve thought of some other slides we need to put into our
presentation.”  We were not even through with the narrative for what we had, so
it was frustrating for me as I hate to still be making changes the day of the presentation,
and we do that a lot.  We were only able to go through it once before it was
time to leave, as we had District Meeting in the morning, and we hadn’t gone
through all of it so I was worried about the time it would take and if it would
all fit together well so it would flow, but the Lord blessed us and it went
over really well.  We had a large crowd, even though it was Halloween.  Elder
&amp; Sister Maharry, Brother &amp; Sister Montemayor, and Elder &amp; Sister
Hyer came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Last Monday, for our “P” day, we
went with the Maharry’s to Cabuyaban to see another war memorial,</b> but first
we went to McDonalds for lunch.  Going to McDonalds is a treat for us.  Marlyn
cooks good food for us, and I occasionally make some American food for us, but
all of us couples, including President and Sister Brimhall enjoy going to
McDonalds.  Probably when we get home, we won’t go there again.  They have good
fried chicken with their delicious rice and it is much better than the
hamburgers &amp; fries that we get back in the United States.  Their breakfasts
are delicious also.  Dad &amp; I don’t go to Cabuyaban very often, just mainly
when we are asked to do a workshop, fireside or training there.   There are no
McDonalds in our area, so we don’t eat there very often, but when we go to the
mission home, there are McDonalds along the way in Tarlac and in Angeles.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We stood in awe at the remains of this Japanese
concentration camp, where the Japanese held our American soldiers as prisoners
of war and treated them so inhumanly.  If you read the series “The Children of
Promise”, you would have read all about this camp, along with the other war
memorials we have been to where there was the “Death March” and other camps. 
It was so terrible.  The grounds of this memorial, along with the other
American war memorials, are beautiful.  They are kept up so well.  We sent you
a couple of pictures of this one last week.  One of the pictures of me was
where I was sitting on one of the remains of the original camp.  I thought
about the men who were there and how they were treated, and it made me sad.  I
didn’t feel like smiling for the picture, so it is one of the few pictures of
me without a smile</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>Elder &amp;
Sister Swenson –Humanitarian couple missionaries over the Philippines – our
batch mates.  They invited us to go with them to the Guimba District Hospital
to get an order of supplies &amp; equipment.<b>  </b>As we entered the
hospital, our hearts sank because of the poverty</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>            We met Rose &amp; she
introduced us to the director &amp; head doctor. <b>  </b>After the order was
done, they asked if we would like to walk around the hospital – Sister Swenson
and I were able to take pictures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>I mentioned to
Sister Swenson that it might help some if the beds and other equipment were
painted.  She agreed and said they could probably furnish the paint &amp; supplies,
if our zone could do the service.<b> </b>Elder Browning and I were excited so
we talked to the zone leaders and other missionaries.  They were excited.  They
said what better way to spend Christmas Day than to give service, like the Lord
would have us do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>We received an
E-mail from Elder &amp; Sister Swenson – They said they could not furnish the
paint and other supplies as they found out that they could only do one order,
and the equipment and supplies for the hospital were more important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>Ken and I talked
to Pres. Brimhall about using the money, David had sent us to buy souvenirs for
our Christmas present from their family, for paint, etc.  He said “God Bless
Him”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>We went to
hospital and talked to Rose – She was excited and said we could do it on
Christmas day and New Years day as the families take the patients home on these
days.  Some take them home on the one holiday and some on the other holiday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>We met on
Christmas morning, and Elder Browning and some of the Elders washed down the
beds, tables, benches, etc, while other sanded them and others painted them. 
Rose came to help us and also our branch missionaries.  We all worked together
and had fun doing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            We enjoyed being

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>            When the equipment and
supplies were to be delivered, Elder &amp; Sister Swenson asked us to go back
with them when the delivery came. We were able to be instruments in the Lord’s
hands to help with these services and because of it, we were able to take Nomi
Balioli to get help there. Nomi was a young girl, eight years of age who had a
terrible skin rash and it hurt and burned so badly that she couldn’t sleep at
night and she hated to go to school as it looked so terrible and the kids would
make fun of her.  When I first saw her, my heart broke as she wouldn’t lift her
head up to look at anyone and her long hair fell over her face.  I asked the
counselor, in the branch primary presidency, whose child she was, and this
sister started to cry and said that this girl was hers, and that her and her
husband could not afford to take Nomi to doctors or pay for the medicine. 
Elder Browning and I were able to get her to a dermatologist and we paid for
her medicine.  Great changes happened and Nomi was at last a happy child when
the rash was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>We had four
young men who were ready to go on missions, but they, nor their parents, could
afford the medical examinations or the dental work which needed to be done
before they could turn in their papers to go on their missions. The doctor and
dentist, there at the hospital, consented to do this work for them for free
since our church had done so much for their hospital.  We were very grateful
and so were these young men and their parents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>What a blessing
for Nomi &amp; her parents and for these missionaries and their parents, and

opportunity that our Heavenly Father had given us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>September 30, 2004</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Sister Brimhall,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I enjoyed visiting with you
yesterday.  You are such a “special lady, I am privileged to be your friend.  I
hope to continue striving to become like our Savior and, hopefully, someday I
can be like you.   You are such a “good” person.  You are always concerned
about others.  You are concerned about doing what’s right.  You are very
supportive of your husband and all the priesthood.  You are close to the spirit
because you love the Lord and you love his children.  You are very dedicated
and serve with all your heart, might, mind and strength.  Everyone loves you
and loves being around you because of the way you live your life.  Thank you
for your love and example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I mentioned yesterday that Elder Browning has
received some massage therapy treatments from Sister Nida Valentino of the
Moncada 2nd Branch.  She has helped him a lot with his back and neck problems. 
He doesn’t get the treatments often, just when he is in a lot of pain and on a
Monday, if she is available.  We do stretch exercises each morning and they
help us and we try to walk in the mornings as often as we can, which helps a
lot.  I was thinking, while driving home, that maybe I should explain to you
that Elder Browning does have his garment bottoms on and also his pajama bottoms
on as she gives him the massage therapy treatments.  I know many massage
therapists prefer that you just have a towel over you so they can work the
muscles better, but we don’t feel comfortable doing that, and we certainly
wouldn’t do it while on our mission.   Just thought you should know that.  You
probably assumed that we wouldn’t undress anyway, but wanted to confirm it. 
The first treatment she wouldn’t let us pay her, but after that one, we
insisted as she needs the money so badly.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While I’m writing to you, I thought I would
share with you a little about Elder Browning’s nature.  He is such a good man,
as you already know, but he tends to be more negative than I wish he was. 
However, I can understand because his mother was the most negative little woman
I have ever met.  I grew to love her, but she was very negative and critical. 
Our children didn’t grow to love her as they did my mother, and I felt sorry
for her.  Both Ken and I tried to talk to her about letting us be the parents
and her just be a loving grandmother.  She was very critical with all her
grandchildren so not many of them cared for her.  She had a hard life, but we
all have trials in our lives and it depends on our attitude, and she had a
“bad” attitude.   She was a good person and did Family History work and was a
temple worker for a few years, and she did love her children and the Lord.  
She wanted to die for 25 years before she died at age 92, just prior to our
coming on our mission.  She did suffer from depression and took medication the
last several years, which did help.  I know many people suffer from this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Even though Elder Browning could see how
negative she was and tried to help her become more positive, he still struggles
with these tendencies.   She didn’t have much patience and he struggles with
this also.  He is impatient with himself at times too.  Of course, he isn’t
nearly as negative as was his mom.  I love him very much and we have a great
marriage.  I just feel bad when you or someone else is saying something
positive, and he says something negative about it.   I remind him of how you
said your friend “Missed her Mission” when he gets too negative.  He is a
perfectionist also, and he can’t “fix” all the problems over here so that
frustrates him.  I tell him to relax, that he doesn’t need to fix it all, but
just do what he can.  He does enjoy the mission and is doing a lot of good. 
The people love, admire and respect him.  He is always thinking of ways to help
them, not just spiritually, but financially as well, as he says “how can they
come to church and fulfill their callings, like they should, when their wives
and children are hungry and they have no job or have a job, but don’t make
enough money that they can eat enough.&quot;  He is also very concerned about
the widow or single lady who struggles.  He feels handicapped because we can’t
speak the language and he gets very frustrated.  I had hoped it would get
easier for him as it doesn’t seem to bother me and the other couples like it
does him.  I just ask questions of them when I don’t understand and am in a
meeting where I need to share or train them, but he doesn’t, he just gets
upset.  They do all speak Tagalog, when they are together, unless they are
speaking directly to us.  Last Sunday in P.E.C. Meeting, Elder Browning was
telling me that 3 times they asked for his opinion, and he told them each time
“I don’t know what you were talking about as I don’t speak your language.” 
Elder Hyer told us that he makes them speak English when he is in meetings with
them and he says they are doing it now when he is with them, but if they don’t,
he says “Speak English”.  Elder Browning won’t do that, I wish he would.  He
feels like he can’t help them because he doesn’t know if they are teaching
incorrect doctrine or not, because he doesn’t understand what they are saying. 
If the missionaries are in the meeting, sometimes he will ask them or sometimes
they will sit by him and translate for him (or us) which is good.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I don’t think I could get him to go on another
foreign mission again because of the language barrier.  I just hope and pray he
won’t say negative things when he gets home about the things that have
frustrated him over here, especially this problem with the language.  I have
talked to him about this as we want to encourage couples to come on missions,
not discourage them in any way.  He has helped &amp; influenced many for good,
with the help of the Lord, so I pray he will remember and give these
experiences for his Homecoming talk and as he talks with his family, neighbors
and friends.  I will do my best to share my feelings about these wonderful
Filipino people and the wonderful experiences we have had here.  Elder Browning
does love many of these people too, and surely has love and a high regard for
both you and President Brimhall and I do also.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Elder Browning is in Guimba now meeting with
President Buccay in the Guimba 1st Branch – so even though he is sick, he went
there to help them.  Wish he could realize the good he is doing.  He probably
wouldn’t appreciate me sharing all this with you, but I felt maybe it would
help you to understand him and why he is as negative at times as he is.  I
certainly don’t want to make myself look great or above him in any way, as I
have many faults and weaknesses of my own and I need to continue to improve
myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        With love and appreciation,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        Sister Browning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P.S. I’ll look forward to seeing you on the 6th.  Hope you
are feeling much better.  We are feeling some better and we slept better last
night than the night before, so that was good.  We are taking lots of vitamin C
and Echinacea and that is helping, also some zinc lozenges.  We brought these
with us.  With Elder Browning’s health, we are “health nuts”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>**I still believe our church is true coz I knew it. Im not
happy 2 be here but I need. I always read the prayer of women and I always cry.
Thank u.  I love u wrote me. Tnks. Luv u, Sis Browning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>09-11-04 Roda Dela Cruz.  This note was given to me by a
young single adult sister, who is the branch president’s daughter.  He is
branch president of the Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> branch.  Roda is one of our
branch missionaries.  I felt bad when I read this note, as I’m sorry that she’s
not happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As we have been asked to give a short history of
this past year, 2004, we have been reflecting on the many experiences we have
had, great people we have met, and wonderful friends we have made.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we first came on our mission, President
Brimhall, our mission president, asked us to go to our area, see what needed to
be fixed and fix it.  We could see that Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching was
not being done, and so we focused on that.  We spend much of our time, that
first year – 2003, on preparing and giving workshops and firesides on these
important assignments, which are given to each of us by the Lord, in our
branches and districts and throughout the mission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This past year 2004, we have still been doing
some of that, but our main focus, given to us this year by our area president,
President Dallin H. Oaks and our mission president, has been Leadership
Training.  We were to go to each branch in our two districts, for one month
each, attend all their meetings, and train the Priesthood Executive Committee
and all the Auxiliary Organization leaders.  Actually, we started doing this
the latter part of 2003.  President &amp; Sister Brimhall asked us to focus on
the Primary and get the primary organization, in each branch, functioning like
it does according to the “General Handbook of Instructions” and how they are in
Utah, and need to be throughout the world.  When we first went to each branch
primary, they were more like a nursery.  It has been challenging, yet
rewarding, as we have shown, taught and trained these primary leaders.  Many
are humble and after they are trained, they are excited and magnify their
callings.  Many have the handbooks, but they don’t understand them.  Some do
not have them so we ask them to get them ordered immediately and read and study
them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            These people are a beautiful people, very
friendly, hospitable and loving, but they are also very child-like.  We have to
keep evaluating our training methods and presentations to make them simpler and
easier to be understood.  We used the Handbook of Instructions, along with
power point presentation with lots of pictures, overhead projector
presentations, books we had put together with pictures showing how to
accomplish their responsibilities and what they are to do.  We gave out lots of
handouts and we did role plays, as well as we ourselves doing “Sharing Time”,
“Singing Time”, and giving the lessons at times.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our second area of focus was the Young Men and
Young Women.  Elder Browning mainly attended the youth Sunday school classes
and Aaronic Priesthood, because the primary rooms were so small, there usually
wasn’t enough room for both of us to attend Primary.  At least once during the
month I would visit the Young Women’s class and we tried to attend Mutual
(mid-week activity) as often as possible to help them and teach them what they
could and should do at mutual activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also trained the Relief Society Presidencies,
but didn’t attend their Sunday meetings.   I did try to attend their Home,
Family, and Personal Enrichment Meetings.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Both Elder Browning and I went visiting with the
branch leaders.  Elder Browning went visiting with the Branch Presidencies and
other Priesthood leaders and I went visiting with the Women’s Auxiliary leaders
to help do activation work.  We both enjoyed this very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            For four months – June, July, August and
September, Elder Browning served as the only counselor in one of our small
branches.  There were so few priesthood holders, who were active, that the
branch was just not progressing.  Our assignment from President Brimhall was to
stimulate activity until they could again be able to carry their own load.  We
found that the main success came through personal visits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We also trained the District Leaders and had
them go with us, as often as possible, to train the branch leadership, as after
we leave, they will have to take over doing this training.  We found most of
the Leaders to be very wonderful, capable, and willing to fulfill their
responsibilities, but a few were challenging to work with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As we have been training Priesthood and
Auxiliary leaders, we have tried to focus on getting them to read and follow
the Church Handbook of Instructions, and hold weekly presidency meetings. 
Although progress has been slow, we have seen progress, and so we are
encouraged.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We enjoyed helping with medical missions.  We
helped with humanitarian work by working with our “batch mates” who are the
Humanitarian Couple Missionaries, here in the Philippines.  We were able to
help bring equipment and supplies to a hospital in our district, and also help
with getting a well of clear, pure water to many families in one of our
districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have also had the opportunity of
helping to bring a wonderful and “Golden” family into the gospel by introducing
them to the Young Elders, who taught them, and we were able to fellowship and
help teach them.  They are now some of our dear friends, <b>Tony &amp; Leah
Garrison and their son, Michael</b>.  Tony was an avid reader.  He read the
Book of Mormon so quickly and wanted more LDS literature.  We gave him the
D&amp;C and Pearl of Great Price.  He read them and wanted more.  We had
brought with us several LDS books “The Miracle of Forgiveness” and “Faith
Precedes the Miracle” by Spencer W. Spencer, and several others.  He read them
over and over.  Each morning, Tony would get a cup of coffee, go out on his
patio and read in <img width=405 height=304
src="Chapter_51_-_Years_2003-2005,_Ken_&amp;_Mae's_mission_to_the_Philippines_files/image007.jpg"
align=left hspace=12 alt="a_003">his scriptures.  One morning his coffee tasted
terrible so he thought that maybe Leah hadn’t washed the coffee pot, so he
washed it and then made a fresh batch of coffee.  As he started to drink this
cup of coffee, he tasted even worse than the first one, so he dumped it out,
and just continued to read his scriptures.  The next time we met with him, he
told us about this experience and said he had been reading in the D&amp;C
section 88 where it talks about the Word of Wisdom and said “I guess I am not
supposed to be drinking coffee, is that correct?”  We said yes, that it is
against the Word of Wisdom, and the Word of Wisdom is to keep us healthy.  From
that day on, he never drank another cup of coffee.  We were proud of him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Tony had a little café in Munoz and was a
wonderful chef; Leah was also a great cook.  We went to this café sometimes and
so did the Elders who served in this area.  Tony and Leah invited us to their
beautiful home and prepared delicious meals for us. (Not many homes were as
nice as this one in the Philippines.  They also had beautiful furniture, china,
etc.  Tony had met Leah in Hong Gong.  She is Filipino, but was working there
as an entertainer.  Tony was born and raised in Holland.  They lived different
places and bought furniture there.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             One time when they had invited us to dinner and
Family Home Evening, they had invited the Elders also.  As we were sitting in
their living room listening to Tony give the lesson<b>, I saw a large rat
running back and forth along the top of their entertainment center.</b>  Ken
and I were sitting on a couch, in front of the entertainment center.  The
Elders were sitting on a love seat at one end of the living room and Tony, Leah
and Michael were sitting on a love seat on the other end of the living room. 
As I watched in horror at this rat, it jumped and flew across the room in the
direction of the Elder’s and lit on the back of their love seat.  It ran down
the back of the love seat and ran along the side of the wall and into another
room.  The others didn’t notice the rat, Ken hadn’t either as they were focused
on Tony.  I was so grateful that the rat hadn’t jumped in my direction, or I
would have screamed and ducked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Tony was baptized and then given the Aaronic
Priesthood and then he baptized Leah and Michael.  Leah’s 17-year-old niece
lived with them for a while.  When I told her about the Personal Progress
Program, she became excited.  I gave her the book and she started working on
the requirements to receive her certificate and her YW medallion.  This program
usually takes the girls at least 3 years to complete, but since she had to have
it finished before she turned 18, she worked and studied hard, she finished all
the requirements in less than a year.  We were proud of her.  When we returned
home, we were so busy that we didn’t keep in touch with them and later we found
out that Tony had been in a terrible accident and was in the hospital for a
long time.  He almost lost his life.  He was riding his motorcycle late at
night, coming home from his café, and ran into a caribou.  This accident left
him with many injuries and caused him to be by-polar, changing his
personality.  Finally, Leah couldn’t take it and she divorced Tony.  We were
very sad to hear that.  Tony told us by way of Facebook.  He was living in
Norway with his daughter from an earlier marriage.  He said that Leah didn’t go
to church anymore, but that he was still trying to go and to read the
scriptures.  We were happy to hear that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We saw other rats there as we would visit the
families – some in their homes and some outside.  I hated them.  One time I saw
a rat on top of the table in one of the homes.  We were sitting in the living
room, but I could see into the kitchen.  The rat was trying to get into the
food that was on the table, but they had covers over the food, thank goodness. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Elder Browning and I were asked by our
branch president to help him with the <b>Health Fair,</b> he took us to see the
<b>Mayor of Munoz.</b>  We needed to ask him if we could use a school or other
venue to hold this Health Fair.  When we arrived at the office of the Mayor,
his waiting room was full, and we thought “Oh dear, we are going to have to
wait a long time, and we don’t have a lot of time to waste.”  The branch
president <b>(find his name) </b>talked to the receptionist and the next thing
we knew, we were invited into his office.  We introduced ourselves and told him
the reason for our visit.  He was very gracious and made a couple of phone
calls and told us that we could use the elementary school.  He had talked to
the principal and she would be expecting us to come and look over it and give
her the details of what we would be needing.  He told us if there was anything
else we needed, to please come see him.  He told us that he would like to come
to our Health Fair too, and we were excited.  This was a big project.  This was
supposed to be the responsibility of the District Presidency, but they handed
it down to the branch presidency and they were over whelmed with it, and that’s
why they asked for our help.  We worked with the couple missionary who were
over these health fairs to get the instructions, etc.  We had many in our
branch help us and together we were able to pull it off.  There were displays,
presentations and demonstrations.  These were set up all around the outside of
the front of the school.  There was a nursing station where the people could
get vaccinations, their blood pressure checked, a minimal physical checkup,
etc.  There was a program at the end of each day.  This was a three-day health
fair.  The school children, from all the schools attended and some preformed at
the programs, families attended, business and political leaders and the church
leaders.  It was very successful.  It was stressful for Ken and I, but it was
well worth it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After this, whenever there was a cultural or
entertainment event that the city put on (which was several), the mayor sent
Elder Browning and I a personal invitation.  We would be excited and when we
went to the first one, we got there a little early, and just sat down about in
the middle of the auditorium.  Before long, here came the Mayor walking down to
us.  He told us to follow him and he lead us to the front of the auditorium and
had us sit on the front row with some other dignitaries.  He asked if we would
help present the beautiful leis to the performers at the end of their
performances.  We were happy to do this, but wondered why he would want us to
do this.  There were camera men there taking pictures and we realized we were
being pyrographed also. We worried that maybe our mission president wouldn’t
want us to spend our valuable mission time going to these events and thought he
might find out about it since we might be on the news.  We called President
Brimhall and told him about this and asked what we should do.  He was excited
and told us to keep attending them as it was good publicity for our church.  We
enjoyed these events and each time the Mayor would insist that we sit on the
front row and help present the gifts or leis.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We saw other rats there as we would visit the
families – some in their homes and some outside.  I hated them.  One time I saw
a rat on top of the table in one of the homes.  We were sitting in the living
room, but I could see into the kitchen.  The rat was trying to get into the
food that was on the table, but they had covers over the food, thank goodness.

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>(Tell about the mayor of Munoz here and the
activities he invited us to, etc…………….( I did write it up on Nov. 25, 2017,
find it).</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> We have also met several special
people and families while walking at the college near us, in the mornings.  We
are currently helping the Lord to prepare them to be taught the gospel.  We
have given other referrals to the Young Elders, as that is the Young Elders
responsibility to teach, but we, as couple missionaries, are to help with
activation, retention and mainly Leadership Training.  One such couple we met
while on our morning walks was the <b>Anywanu family.</b>  We met <b>Marie </b>first
and enjoyed visiting with her.  She told us about her family, how her husband
was from Africa and was here in the Philippines, at this college, getting his
doctorate degree.  They have these four beautiful children.  She wanted us to
meet them and invited us to dinner at their home.  We went and had a wonderful
time visiting and eating the delicious meal she prepared.  She made wonderful
home baked bread, and we bought loafs from her several times.  We invited their
family for dinner also.  They are Christian and 7<sup>th</sup> Day Adventists. 
We discussed religion.  We asked if we could show them some of our beautiful
videos on the Savior and they said they could reserve a pavilion near their
home and wondered if <img width=283 height=213

align=left hspace=12 alt=P1190461>they could invite their friends.  We were
excited and said “certainly”.  We took our projector, screen and videos and I
made brownies, and it was a success.  Many came and were impressed with the
videos and we all had a wonderful time afterwards discussing them and getting
to know each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We have helped to prepare couples and families
to go to the temple.  We were privileged to go to the Manila temple and witness
the temple marriages of one family and four young couples. We loved this family
and all these couples, but two of them we are especially impressed with <b>Ronald
and Crisanta Dator</b> and <b>William and Anna Liza Mactal Buccay</b>.  Roger
was single, when we met him.  He lived in our branch and we had visited him and
his parents and siblings.  We needed some electrical work done in our home, so
we hired Ronald and he did a great job.  We had him do other electrical jobs
for us after that.  He met Crisanta, a beautiful, wonderful, spiritual young
woman.  They fell in love and we were privileged to teach them the temple
preparation lessons and go to the Manila Temple with them when they were
married for time and all eternity.  It was a wonderful ceremony and a wonderful
day.  Ronald’s older brother married a righteous woman in the temple and they
had two little children when we first met them.  We hired him (can’t remember
his name right now) to wash our car at least once a week.  He had a trike with
a sidecar and had this as his main business – like a Taxi business.  Many men
did that.  He took our daughters, Sandi &amp; Shellie, for a ride on his trike
when they were visiting us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We met <b>Anna Liza</b> at a YW activity as she
was the District Young Women’s President.  She was a beautiful, outstanding
young woman with many talents and leadership ability.  We were very impressed
with her.  She lived in Guimba and we visited her, her parents and siblings in
the parent’s home.  We fell in love with all of them.  Her parents are such
wonderful people and her sisters were beautiful and special too.  William came
home from his mission and he and Anna Liza started dating.  They got too intimate,
so had to be disfellowshipped.  That was hard on them and on us.  They kept
coming to church faithfully, but they couldn’t take the sacrament or hold
positions, so she was released from being the YW president.  In time they both
fully repented and were able to make plans to be married in the Manila Temple. 
We were privileged to work with them and teach them lessons.  About that time,
President Oaks was released from being our Area President as his time was up
and we were sad to have him leave.  President Maines was his counselor and he
was sustained as the new area president.  President Oaks was pretty lenient
with the couple missionaries and let us go to the temple with our branch
members on their branch temple trips and with these special couples who were to
be married there.  He also let us couples travel with each other to see various
beautiful places here in the Philippines, on our “P” days or on holidays. 
Elder &amp; Sister Hyer had a van and us four couples fit in it and we enjoyed
these trips tremendously.  President Maines stopped all that and told the
mission presidents that the couples were not to travel outside our missions and
that went for going to the temple also as it was in Manila and outside of our
mission.  When we heard that and told Anna Liza and William that we would not
be able to go with them to the temple, they said that they were not going to go
to the temple without us.  We tried to explain to them why we couldn’t, but
they were insistent that we go with them, so we talked to President Brimhall
and he talked to President Maines and explained this situation, and he finally
made an exception for this one time.  We were thrilled and it was a beautiful
day in the temple with this special couple and their family and friends<b>. 
(This picture is of them with us. They are holding the wedding gift we gave
them).</b>  We keep in touch with them through Facebook and Email and we found
out that Anna Liza got her teaching degree and is teaching school.  They were
only able to have one child – a son, who they love very much.  William was put
in as branch president and later as a counselor to President Mario Gasmena in
the District Presidency.  She has had many positions in her branch and
district.  We love them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=380 height=285

align=left hspace=12 alt=P1190462>            Ken and I tried to talk to Anna
Liza’s parents about being sealed in the temple and then having their children
sealed to them, but her father said that they didn’t have the money to pay
tithing.  We talked to them about having faith, paying it first and then the
Lord would bless them.  Anna Liza’s sisters wanted to be married in the temple
and they found handsome, righteous men who they did marry in the temple.  We
found out later that the parents did take the leap of faith and started paying
tithing, got their recommends and were sealed to each other and their family. 
What a happy family they are now, however, the father has had health problems
and been in the hospital at times.  We love this special family.  Anna Liza and
her sisters put pictures of them, their families and their parents with all the
family together, on Facebook and we love seeing these pictures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were called upon to speak at many branch and
district meetings and activities, sometimes at the last minute, so we are very
thankful to the Lord for his help and inspiration.  On two different occasions
– one was a Guimba District Young Women’s conference.  I was handed a program
when we walked in, and my name was on the program as the main speaker.  That
caught me off guard as I hadn’t been asked.  In fact, we had just come from the
Paniqui District where we had done some training, and we almost hadn’t stopped
at this YW Conference.  Thankfully, the Lord blessed me again, as he did many
times and I felt He put words in my mouth.  I remember speaking on the Young
Woman’s program, but I don’t remember what I said.  Ken and others said I gave
a good talk.  Another time was when I went to the Guimba District primary
program and activity, and again my name was on the program and I hadn’t been
asked to speak. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we went to the Paniqui District Leadership
trainings, which they held once a month, President Nadado or one of his
counselors would either ask us as we came in, if we would train the R.S. or
Primary or YW for me, and the Elder’s Quorum and branch presidencies for Ken or
sometimes, they would just announce, from the pulpit, that we would be training
a certain organization or priesthood group – so we had to be prepared. I would
have been really stressed if asked to do that over here, but with the Lord’s
help, and “angels to bear us up”, like we were told in our priesthood
blessings, we were able to do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             We have gone through several typhoons during
this year, three of which caused quite extensive damage with considerable loss
to property, farm crops &amp; lives.  We had the opportunity to help render
relief to many victims of these storms.  We met with the district R.S. leaders
and they had a check from the district president, so we went shopping.  We came
back and with others helping, we divided up this food (rice, sardines,
crackers, medicines, etc.) into cloth sacks and went to deliver it to the
families.  Ken and I drove our car to different areas and then, with our boots
on, we walked through the water to deliver the food, etc.  We saw some sad
sights.  In November, there were two typhoons that caused quite extensive
damage and then followed reports of a “super” typhoon that was coming in.  <img

align=left hspace=12 alt=P1190464>There were massive preparations for this
storm.   However, when the storm hit, the winds stayed high, basically not
touching the ground and was only 24 hours of a high wind noise, almost like the
noise of jet airplanes over head.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We loved serving the Lord and serving these
wonderful Filipino brothers and sisters in our two districts<b>.  President
Mercado was the district president of the Guimba District</b> and <b>President
Patronilo Nadado was the president from the Paniqui District.</b>  We grew to
love and respect <b>President Nadado and his sweet wife</b> and their children,
and we became good friends.  They invited us to their home for dinner and I
think Family Home Evening.  They told us their stories of how they met and the
circumstances surrounding their romance, and the trials and difficulties they
faced.  Theirs was such a fascinating story that I typed it up and send it in
to the Ensign, hoping that it would be printed in one of the issues, but it
wasn’t.  The picture is of the Nadado family.</p>

align=left hspace=12 alt="Sandi &amp; Sandi came to visit us in Philippines">            We
had the opportunity of having our two daughters, <b>Sandi and Shellie, come to
the Philippines</b> and spend 10 days with us in February.  This opportunity
came as a result of our eldest daughter’s husband (Terry) being killed in a car
accident on November 21<sup>st</sup> of 2003.  This was the evening of Sandi’s
birthday, so what a horrible birthday that was.  After counseling with our
mission president, he asked that we consider remaining on our mission, rather
than returning home for the funeral.  His suggestion was that we have our
daughter come over and spend time with us after the funeral.  He said that it might
be good for her to get away, relax and enjoy being with us.  He said we could
take time off to take her to some of the beautiful places here in the
Philippines.  We called Sandi, and she agreed that we shouldn’t leave our
mission and that she would love to come visit us in the Philippines.  As we
were concerned with our daughter traveling alone, we also invited her sister,
who was excited to join her.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had a wonderful experience, of a
lifetime, with them and were able to take them to see some of the beautiful
sights here in the Philippines.  We took them up the mountains and through the
jungle to Balair.  Balair is located right by the ocean and they have a
beautiful resort there.  When Ken and I would go there, either by ourselves, or
with one of the other couples (Maharry’s or Clarks), to help the branch with
their branch conference or to do trainings for them, we would stay in the
beautiful motel on the sandy ocean beach.  We would walk along the beach in the
evenings, pick up sea shells and just enjoy looking at the ocean.  We knew
Sandi &amp; Shellie would love to go there, and they did.  We ate in the
restaurant there at the resort, but none of us enjoyed the food too much.   The
girls put on their swimming suits and enjoyed playing in the ocean while Ken
and I took pictures and walked along the beach.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We took them to Baguio, where we
had gone with the other couples for our Easter holiday.  We had stayed in the
Camp John Hayes Hotel, which is really beautiful and is a resort area.  Baguio
has a milder climate, not as hot and humid as where we live, and most of the
Philippines.  It is more on the mountains and is so beautiful there.  They
raise lots of fruits and vegetables.  There are many carving shops, jewelry
shops, etc., so the girls wanted to go shopping and we spent a couple of fun,
wonderful days at this hotel and in Baguio.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We also took them to another area,
where we had hiked the mountain with the Clarks to a beautiful waterfall.  The
trail isn’t too easy as we had to climb over large boulders and logs and cross
the river on makeshift bridges.  Luckily, both times we went there (with the
Clarks and with the girls), there were youth climbing also, and they were happy
to help us.  We sure appreciated them.  It was fun and very beautiful there.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We went lots of places – walked
over hanging bridges and took pictures of the beautiful rivers and lush, green
landscapes below. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> We also took them with us as we
went to meetings and did some training and teaching.  They were so graciously
accepted by the wonderful members here in the Philippines.  The children really
loved them too, and Sandi &amp; Shellie played with some children, outside,
when we were in one of our meetings, and they had a great time.  The children
didn’t want them to quit when Sandi &amp; Shellie got tired.  We hated to take
our daughters back to Manila to the airport at the end of their two-week
vacation, the time had gone by so fast.  We had such a great time and loved
being with these special, beautiful daughters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Unlike the young Elders, who often count their
success by the number of baptisms they have had, our success is in seeing the
wards and branches progressing and members excited as they fulfill and magnify
their callings.  It is also in watching member’s testimonies grow of the Lord,
Jesus Christ as they pray, study the scriptures and keep his commandments, and
to see families become active in the Church and be sealed together in the Holy
Temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            2004 has been an exciting year, filled with many
wonderful, as well as challenging experiences and meeting many wonderful
friends, who are our brothers and sisters in this part of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ken still has some health problems</b>.  I think they are
mainly caused by diet and <b><u>stress.</u></b>  He wants to “fix” everything
and he can’t fix everything over here and it is hard on him.  He gets
frustrated and discouraged.  Sometimes I don’t help him, as I get upset with
him when he gets to talking negatively, especially when he says he doesn’t
think we are accomplishing anything, when I am sure we are.  I tell him “I can
see progress even if you can’t.”  I wish he could relax more and enjoy the
mission more.  Satan wants Ken to get discouraged, I’m sure, as he knows how
Ken wants to help these people &amp; can help them.  President and Sister
Brimhall are always praising us for all we’re doing, so I tell him that the
mission president thinks we’re doing great.  When President Oaks left, he told
the people that in ten years, he feels the Church will be flourishing in the
Philippines.</p>

I told her that the District Presidency got the money from the PBO and gave it
to us and we got together with President Cabuyaban and other leaders to have a
meeting to decide what food we need and how many need it and who to how to
disperse it.  All 3 branches were affected.  Elder Browning got a little
impatient because they were not accomplishing much in the meeting and finally
he told them to give him the money and we would take the district R.S.
presidency and buy the food.  They could decide who the food is to go to, but   we
would get it and meet other sisters at our R.S. president’s home, Sister   Villanuela
and package the food and then we could all take it around – which we   did.  I
loved visiting the people as we gave it out.  We went over to where 7 families
were isolated and without food because the river was too deep and too  wide to
get across.  The bridge washed out last year in a typhoon and the government
won’t build a new one for them.  Ken bought a rope for them and a  tatay
(father) on this side of the river who has family over on the other side, went
into the water and tied the rope around a big tree and then swam across the
river with the rest of the rope and then tied it to another big tree on the
other side.  This way the tatays could get back and forth across the river.  We
left the packages of food with the older father and he will see that his
children get the food. </p>

but most men over here are lazy.  She works at a school as a custodian.  She
doesn’t make much money so they are struggling.  She has been a member of the

Sister De Guzman does handicrafts.  I went to her house to buy some and they
are very nice – klenex boxes, letter holders, purses, hats, etc.  I bought most
of what she had for P500.  She doesn’t have the lace, ribbon and flowers to
finish them up, so I paid her in advance for them so she could buy these
materials – but she used the money to take her husband to the doctor and get
medicine.  I gave her another P200 and ordered another purse &amp; hat, but she
again used the money for food for her family.  I think I will go buy the
materials, take to her and then pick up the items soon.  She is a nice lady. 
Their home is also tiny with a dirt floor.  She has a darling daughter who is
10 years old and in primary.  She is also a smart girl.  She has 3 teenage
daughters and an older son who is a drunk.  She feels so bad about him.  She
wanted him to go on a mission and kind of blames the branch for not helping him

<p class=MsoNormal><b>PROBLEMS IN THE PHILIPPINES:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marlynn’s, (our maid) brother has been having great trials
lately.  There have been robbery’s going on and he was a suspect.  We’re sure
he is innocent as he is a RM (“Returned Missionary “that doesn’t always mean
too much, especially over here), but he was home teaching and his partner
verifies that and also the people they visited, on the date that a witness said
he was in Cabanatuan helping with a robbery.  He was engaged to be married to a
fine young woman, who is also a RM, and they were to be married in December,
but a man from Tarlac, came to church today and reported to her Bishop that the
girl committed fornification with him and he wanted to come and get it cleared
up.  He has been excommunicated as he was a missionary, but she has not
confessed.  She also went on a mission and lied to do so.  Marlynn’s brother is
very distressed, as we can imagine.  He wonders why he is having such great
trials.</p>

car. Some farmers have converted a farm implement (kulikliks) which is like a
large hand garden motivator with the blades taken off and tires installed and
attached to a trailer.  Farm implements do not have to be licensed and taxed as
are other forms of transportation.  Public transportation is “Trikes” which is
a small motorcycle with side car. These are everywhere and often a cause of
traffic blockages.  There are “Jeepnies” which is a model of the old army jeep
with a long body and is built to accommodate 10 to 12 people but you often see
14 to 18 and sometimes we have seen as many as 6 to 12 people hanging on the
top and rear bumper.  Busses are used for long distance travel and are mainly
found only on major highways.  Because they are large the driver often is rude
and pushes the right of way.  We see many motorcycle operators with helmets,
often hanging from their arm.  If there more that on person on a motorcycle and
the operator has a helmet his passengers will not.  Often you see babies, 6
months old and up riding in front between the father’s knees.  We often see 3
to 4 passengers on a motorcycle.</p>

comes over to talk to them, they don’t just walk away from you or turn away
from you, they say “Please excuse me”.  If two people are talking and blocking
the hallway or doorway, etc., and a person needs to go in front of them, they
will crouch down, put their hands together and say “please excuse me” or “cuse
me”.  But, if they are in meetings, many thinks nothing of talking to other
people while someone is speaking from the pulpit or a teacher is in front
teaching a class.  They also think nothing of getting up and walking out –
whether to go to the bathroom, to txt someone, or just walk outside for a few
minutes.  Adults as well as children and youth, do this.  We are trying to
teach them reverence and that this is also rude.  They are also rude on the
roads and in traffic.  They walk, drive or stop anywhere or anytime they want,
and they are not concerned about how it affects other people.</p>

said she had just the position for me.  I wondered if it was to be her
secretary again.  She is the Assistant Superintendent.  I declined as I really
want to have time now to enjoy my family and have time to visit and travel,

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2005</b>    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The past two years we were on a
mission to the Philippines.  Our special primary, from our home ward, sent us a
6’ green paper Christmas tree with all kinds of paper ornaments, stars, candy
canes &amp; presents, taped to the tree.  These items had messages and names
from the primary children, their teachers and the presidency.  We taped it to
our living room wall and left it up all year so we could enjoy it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Filipino people celebrate Christmas a little
differently than we do.  They start celebrating in September and end the 30<sup>th</sup>
of December – they celebrate all during the “ber” months.  They start playing
Christmas music, putting up their lights and other decorations, and come
caroling right after the 1<sup>st</sup> of September.  Many children and youth
come caroling, but they don’t just do it as a service or something fun to do,
they expect to be paid.  That is the main time in the year that these children
can get some pesos.  If you give them treats besides the money, they are really
excited.   In one town, most of the people make beautiful Christmas lanterns
during the year and in September; they put up lots of little shops on both
sides of the road for about a mile.  These shops are made very simple, out of
bamboo poles, and at night they turn the lanterns on and they are so
beautiful.  We loved going to meetings and trainings in Paniqui at night, as we
would go through this town and see these beautiful lights.   The people don’t
have much money, they are a very poor people, but they love to have parties at
this time of year.  For their branch Christmas parties, they would plan the
party for 1 pm at the church, but they were always at least ½ hour to 3 hours
late starting as the people always come late.  They would play games, have a
program with lots of entertainment and eat a simple meal.  Their parties would
last several hours.  The weather was always hot in the Philippines, so it didn’t seem like Christmas, but we loved celebrating with them.  Last
Christmas, most of the members of our “home” branch came Christmas caroling to
our home.  They had guitars and beautiful voices – we loved it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Philippines is beautiful and lush in many
parts of this country.  There are beautiful jungles, the ocean with white sandy
beaches and also rock beaches, and beautiful green rice fields.  But it is
dirty; it could be a paradise if it was taken care of and improved.  They have
open sewers, rivers with garbage floating on top and very polluted.  Because
the water is so polluted, we had to carry a small plastic bottle of alcohol to
use to clean our hands often.  The alcohol was given to us when we were at the
mission home after we arrived.  The alcohol didn’t dry our hands out because it
is so humid there.  We had water coolers in our missionary homes and water was
delivered to us in 3-gallon bottles.  The plant in Munoz was very clean and
sterile, so we were thankful for that.  We had to take deworming pills to try
to kill the parasites. The public CRs (comfort rooms – bathrooms) were so
dirty, it made us sick to have to use them.  Few had toilet seats and you didn’t
want to sit on them anyway, so we would just squat over them.  In some CRs
there was just a hole in the cement.  There usually weren’t any toilet paper,
soap, or paper towels, so we carried Kleenex and alcohol with us. There were
nicer CRs in McDonalds restaurants and some gas stations.  The CRs were
terrible in most hospitals.  Ken found that out when he took a blind man
there.  We helped take supplies and equipment, with the humanitarian couple
missionaries to a hospital in Guimba, and because of that, they let us take
young men who wanted to go on missions there, to get a physical and their
dental work done.  It was horrible.  We saw the dentist drop her pick, whip it
off on her dirty apron and put it in the mouth of one of our
to-be-missionaries.  He did get an antibiotic and Ken told him to take every
single pill.  They did have a couple of beautiful hotels and hospitals in
Manila, and the missionaries were taken there when they had to go to a
hospital.  Most doctors and nurses who work there were trained in the United
States.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In the Philippines, there is the richest of the
rich and the poorest of the poor.  Most Filipinos would love to come and live
in America and that is their dream.  Catholic, Iglesio Cristo and our church
are the religions in the Philippine Islands.  Iglesio Cristo is mainly a mafia
because the people have to pay every time they come to church and they must
come often.  They are promised protection for their money.  They do dress very
nicely when they come to this church.  Anyone can preach or teach in this
church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There are many different types of homes is in
the Philippines.  Some are made of bamboo and are small, others are made of
rough cement with dirt floors and hardly any furniture or belongings.  Many are
just shacks made out of whatever they can find – tin, cardboard, odd shaped
boards, etc.  It is a very poor country, but most of the people are good and
sweet, hospitable and affectionate, especially the ladies and children, as most
of the men drink, smoke, gamble and are lazy.  Many cannot find work, if they
want to work, although the tradition is that the women work.  The oldest girl
in the family is to support the family.  Many times, she goes abroad as a house
helper, nanny or entertainer.  Some go to Hong Kong where they are entertainers
(prostitutes).  Some go to England, many go to Iran or Irack, some go to Canada
and the lucky ones go to the United States.  They send the money home to their
families. The government takes a big hunk out of what they send home.  One
couple in Munoz, who we loved and were richer than most, was because the wife
went to Iran and taught in a hospital there.  She was a nurse and sent home the
money.  They saved it so their children could go to college.  One daughter
became a doctor and the other a nurse.  The son didn’t want to go to college. 
The father raised the children while the mother was away making money.  She
could come home every few years.  Their daughter, the doctor, helped us in
different ways.   The Filipinos are very childlike.  When we were teaching or
training them, we had to keep changing our way of thinking and our
presentations to make them simpler, so the members could understand what we
were trying to teach them.  They love to have their pictures taken, so we would
take pictures of them with our digital camera and then put them in our Power
Point Presentation, and they loved that.  That would get their attention.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There were many beggars there.  Some came door
to door.  We had several come to our home.  Others had their children beg at
McDonalds, stores and where ever.  The dad would have the children give him the
money and then he would usually buy beer or cigarettes.   When we saw these
children, we would buy hamburgers for them and see that they ate it, and they were
so happy as they were hungry.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Many sold wares in the middle of busy traffic. 
Some men drove “Trikes” which are motorcycles with a side car.  They drive
people around for money. That’s how some make their living.  You could see a
man with his small child on his lap, while driving and one or two behind him on
the seat.  Several would be in the side car, but it was only room enough for
Ken &amp; I.  We had our own car, but we rode in one a couple of times.  You
could see one on top of the side car as it had a canvas top, and maybe another
standing on the back.  They had several accidents and you can see why.  One
branch president drove a trike for his living and Ken was talking to him and
asked him about the number of people they can put in a Trike as it looks like
it is dangerous and the president said “Yes, if you get more than 11 or 12 on a
Trike, it can be dangerous. The other main types of transportation were
“Jeepnies” which were jeeps made into kind of a small bus, with benches on both
sides.  You could get in and others would keep getting in and you would be
swashed.  They also had buses and some rode on top of the buses.  The traffic
was terrible and you would have vehicles drive on sidewalks and three across
where there should be one or two.  There were trucks too and you had to get out
of their way as since they were bigger, they figured they had the right of
way.  There wasn’t much law enforcement.  While Ken and I were sitting on the
top floor of a Jolly Bee restaurant, we looked down on the intersection in
which five streets entered the intersection.  This was in San Jose. We got
quite a kick out of a police officer trying to direct traffic, but most didn’t
pay attention to him.  One day we were there and were watching him, but when he
came out into the intersection, he had a pair of gloves on.  One glove painted
red and the other painted green.  We presume he thought this way he could
control the traffic, but in reality, it wasn’t working.  We also watched people
get onto one of their Jeepnies and we counted over 20 people that got on that
vehicle, which would be crowded for a dozen.  All the banks and most businesses
had an armed guard at the door with a loaded shotgun and pistols. They had the
Gadeantan Robbers and the Philippines National Police.  You got out of their
way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The women crouched down on their laurels (to put
their feet on the cement and sit on their heels) to do their laundry by hand in
a cement enclosure.  They hung their clothes on the fences or wherever they
could find a place.  Most did iron everything, at least our Marlin did.  She
even ironed our sheets, garments and socks.  Most of the people looked clean
and neat, and the school uniforms looked great.  We would see men waiting for a
bus or Jeepnie and they would be sitting on their laurels.  It looked so funny,
we thought they looked like magpies sitting on a fence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            During planting of the palay (rice), the fields
were flooded with water and they did use a mixer that looked much like our snow
blowers, but had barrels that were made out of iron strips.  This would work as
a mixer to mix the water and the soil together, and when the field was ready
for planting, the mud would be up to the knees of the planters.  Large batches
of pre-started seed would be given to the planter and he/she would take each
stem out, one by one, and plant it until just about an inch remained above the
surface of the mud.  As the palay was put into the mud, each person would take
an area about 3’ wide, and as fast as they could plant the starters in the mud
in front of them, they would back up, and when they finished, the entire field
would look like it had been planted with a transit.  The plants would be in
perfect straight lines going forward, sideways and on a 45-degree angle.  We
talked to an 80-year-old sister who said it was so hard for her to do this
work, but she had no other income.  They earn about 50 Pecos a day for a 10-hour
day.  They got two breaks, and if they cannot keep that pace up, they could get
out of the field as there were more to take their place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were surprised when they told us the branch
was having an activity at the church and it would start at 6 pm.  It rarely
started for one to two hours later.  They were usually always late arriving and
starting meetings and activities.  That was hard for us.  When Ken was the
counselor to Branch President Cabayaban, he worked on him to start his meetings
on time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a beautiful home in Munoz with a gated
block fence all around.  We did have power outages at times and since we only
had a window air conditioner in our bedroom, we would drive someplace in our
car to cool off as it had air conditioning.  Also, when the power went off, we
didn’t have water to take showers, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We loved the fruit, especially the mangos and we
had a large fruit bowl with all kinds of fruit in it that we enjoyed.  When we
were at the mission home, soon after we arrived in the Philippines, Elder &amp;
Sister Clark invited us for breakfast and they fixed pancakes with almond
butter and lots of fruit on top.  It was delicious and so we have almond butter
and fruit on all our waffles, pancakes and French toast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While we were on our mission, two more
grandchildren were born.  <b>Mike and Becky had a daughter, which they named
Jessica, and David &amp; Shauna had a son, which they named Connor</b>.  We
were excited to see them, as well as all our other grandchildren and their
parents, when we arrived home.  I’m sure that most of you already know that <b>we
also had a death in our family while we were gone.  Sandi’s husband, Terry, was
killed in a vehicle accident in November 2003.  That was surely sad news for
us, and it was hard for us not to leave our mission and come home to be with
Sandi during this hard time</b>.  Our mission president said it was his wish
that we would stay and then have Sandi come to the Philippines a little later
and spend some one-on-one time with us.  She brought her sister, Shellie, and
came for 10 days the following February, and we were able to show them some of
the beautiful places in the Philippines as well as meet many of our wonderful
Filipino friends.  We had a special time together.  We arrived home, from our
mission, the 17<sup>th</sup> of February and since that time we have had many
wonderful family get-to-gethers as well as visiting our good friends again.  </p>
