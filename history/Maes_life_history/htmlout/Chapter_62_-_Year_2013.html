alt=P1200308><b>Disneyland with Gail, her children and her mom, Marcy in May of
2013</b> - Ken and I were at Jeff &amp; Gail’s one Sunday evening playing games
when Gail started telling us that her and her mom were taking the children and
going to Disneyland in May.  She said that Jeff was going to take off a couple
of days to fly down and meet them and be with them for a day and fly back. She
said he didn’t have much vacation time, but she wanted him to be with her and
the kids for part of the time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In talking with them, it turns out
that Jeff really didn’t want to go.  He’s like Ken, he doesn’t like amusement
parks and he didn’t have time to take off.  He said: “Mom, you would like to go
in my place, wouldn’t you?”  He caught me off guard and I told him I would love
to be with Gail, her mom and the kids, but that I needed to be home with Ken to
keep him on our strict diet.  He asked Ken if he wouldn’t be alright for a week
as he thought it would be great to have two grandmas’ and their mom.  That way
each child could have someone to be with and go on rides with.  Anyway, it
turned out that he talked me and Ken into it, and Gail too, however, she was
disappointed that Jeff couldn’t go.  Jeff told me that since I would be going
in his place and doing a favor for him, he would pay for me to go.  I ended up
going and having a wonderful time.  Ken and I missed each other, but it was
good spending more time with Gail and the children.  Marcy was great about it
too and I enjoyed being with her also.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=247 height=186

alt=P1100217><b>Marcy</b> took her vehicle and she packed all of us into it and
all our luggage.  She drove most of the time with Gail trading her off for a
break now and then.  I was willing to drive, but relieved that I didn’t have to
as I was nervous driving her vehicle with all the precious cargo.  We stayed
with Gail’s sisters and their families.  We stayed at Lisa &amp; Ralph’s in St.
George on the way down and back and we stayed with Debbie and her husband and
children the five days we were there.  We spent three full days at Disneyland
and we had two down days where we could rest and relax at Debbie’s house and
the children could have naps since we stayed late each time we were at
Disneyland.  Debbie and 2 of her children came one evening as they have a
season pass.  We took lunches with us and we bought the evening meals there. 
Gail took two strollers so Rachel and Matt didn’t have to walk all the time. 
That worked good, so we could put our lunches, etc. in them too.  It was so fun
watching the expressions and excitement as the children rode the rides with us
or got their books signed by the princesses or cartoon characters – Mickey
Mouse, Miney Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, Goofy, etc and also got pictures with
them and with the Cars – Lightning McQueen, Mateur, etc. I enjoyed most of the
rides, but there were a couple I wouldn’t go on again as they were too hard on
my back &amp; neck and they were too frightening for me, for the children too. 
The children were really good most of the time and it was a lot of fun.  Gail
had bought me a Disney T shirt for Mother’s Day as she wanted us all to match
when we wore them there one day.  That was fun too.  Marcy is a wonderful
person and Gail is a special daughter-in-law and great to be with.  She is
usually always happy and bubbly and excited about life, which makes it great
for all of us.  I was worried about staying with Gail’s sister’s and families
as I am not one of the family, but they were all good to me and said they were
glad to have me. </p>

alt="Family &amp; reunion 014"><b>Camping and fishing trips with my honey, with
our boat and camper the summer of 2013- </b>Since Ken and I didn’t get to use
our boat and camper much last year because of working on preparations for the
large Bushnell Reunion which was held in Tropic at Keela’s property in August,
I decided we needed to use them more this summer and, so we had to plan way
ahead to get reservations at the places we wanted to go.  I went over the
calendar, selecting times we could be away and then I showed Ken and talked it
over with him.  I then made reservations at <b>Hyrum Reservoir for five days</b>,
Monday through Friday in June.  I made reservations at Fish Lake for a week in
July and I made reservations for a <b>Monday through Saturday at Payson Lake
for August</b>.  I also talked to Ken about us going to <b>BYU Education Week</b>
the 19<sup>th</sup> through the 23<sup>rd</sup> of August as we have wanted to
do that for a couple of years, but never got around to registering for it.  He
said to go ahead and make the reservations<b>. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We invited any of our family to join us at <b>Hyrum
Reservoir</b> and David, Shauna, Emily &amp; Connor came up on Monday and
stayed overnight and the next day.  Tyler was at basketball camp in St George. 
We had a great time fishing, relaxing at our campsite, playing games, eating,
etc.  We were glad they could come.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We also invited Bryce &amp; Deanna
and they came up for a fish breakfast with us one morning and stayed most of
the day.  We enjoyed being with them and had a good visit.  Deanna and I don’t
get a change to visit together often, so it was great!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We thought that Sandi &amp; Nick could go with us to <b>Fish
Lake</b> as they always have.  This year, <img width=288 height=216
src="Chapter_62_-_Year_2013_files/image004.jpg" align=left hspace=12
alt="2008-06-14 078 - cleaning fish">however, the government was furloughing
the government employees and he works for the government as a guard at Dugway
Proving Grounds, so he wasn’t able to go and Sandi had already booked a
vacation with one of her friends to Glazier National Park and Canada for two
weeks, so she couldn’t go either.  None of the others could go, so Ken and I
still had a great time fishing and camping together.  There was a good family
camped by us which we got to know and enjoyed visiting with them.  They were
kind to us by taking us in their truck down to our boat.  Ken and I love to be
alone together anyway.  We have fun whatever we are doing, especially
vacationing.  We have gone fishing at Strawberry Reservoir together also and
staying overnight in the cabin there.  That was fun too.  Ken and Nick have
gone together fishing both at Strawberry Reservoir and East Canyon Reservoir.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>In August of 2013</b>, Ken and I
reserved a campsite for a <b>week at Payson Lake</b>.  it ended up that only
Jeff, Gail and the children were going to be with us for Friday night and
Saturday and they were going to use our tent and share our campground, but
Sherrie, Bob’s daughter had passed away from a liver disease caused by drinking
alcohol, so we needed to leave on Friday as the funeral was early Saturday
morning.  When Jeff found out about it, they decided they wanted to go to the
funeral so wouldn’t be coming up.  We asked Scott if Kylan could come with us
as he loves to camp and fish.  Kylan was excited, so we had fun playing games
together in the evenings and he and Grandpa went fishing several times. 
Sometimes they caught some fish and sometimes they didn’t.  Sometimes I would
stay and read in the camper and other times I would take my camp chair and book
and watch them.  Kylan loved the meals and snacks we had.  He’s a cute boy and
we enjoyed having him with us.  Mike couldn’t come up, but Becky brought Maddi
&amp; Jessie and Jessie’s friend and spent part of one day with us and had
supper with us. </p>

alt="Bob with children before Carroll's funeral">            <b>Sherrie, Bob’s
daughter, (woman on the left), passed away</b> that week from liver disease
caused by alcoholism.  Bob didn’t know that her and her husband drank a lot, so
that was upsetting to him, and to lose his daughter just a couple of years
after losing his wife was really hard on him.  They were having the funeral on
Saturday, so we called Scott to see if they wanted to come up and stay
overnight both Friday and Saturday nights.  We had reserved it for Saturday
night as Jeff, Gail and the children were planning to come up after work on
Friday night and stay in our tent in our camp site with us. Ken and I planned
to leave Saturday night, so we could be home to go to church on Sunday.  Scott
&amp; Mishelle had wanted to come up and bring their trailer before, but there
were no campsites left, so they were excited to come up since they moved this
summer and were so busy getting settled in and working on the yard that they
hadn’t been able to go camping.  Jeff decided if we were coming home, they
wouldn’t go to Payson Lake, they would come to the funeral also.  Ken and I
were excited that all of our children except Shellie came to <b>Sherrie’s
funeral</b>, mainly to support Bob.  They all went to the cemetery afterwards
where Ken dedicated the grave and they came back to the church and ate the
luncheon that the Relief Society had prepared for all the family.  We visited
and enjoyed being together, even though it was a sad time, especially for
Sherrie’s husband, Eric, and her son, Cole, and of course, Bob. (This picture
is of Bob and his children at Carroll’s funeral.  Sherry died a few months
later.  She was a heavy drinker and Bob didn’t even know it until the doctor
told him at the hospital when she passed away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>We were able to go to Zion’s
National Park.  Jeff and Gail wanted to go to Zion’s Canyon again </b><img
width=289 height=217 src="Chapter_62_-_Year_2013_files/image006.jpg"
align=left hspace=12 alt=P1190862><b>this year in October,</b> so I called all
the family to see if any of the rest of them could go with us and Scott and
Sandi wanted to go.  It turns out that Scott didn’t get his reservation made
and now he doesn’t have the vacation time to go anyway.  David said he would be
graduating from Medical School and getting a job, so didn’t know if they would
be able to get away at that time and thought they probably would not be able
to.  Shellie said they couldn’t come as it is a lot of hiking and Roy can’t do
that with his bad hip.  Sandi &amp; Nick were planning to go for a week, but
Shellie invited her and Nick to go with them to San Diego in September for a
week as Shellie &amp; Roy were able to get a condo with two rooms and, so they
went.  Now Sandi doesn’t have enough vacation for the entire week at Zion’s,
but they are coming for the Wednesday through Saturday.  Mike &amp; his family
were coming too as it is their fall break, however, theirs was the week before
Davis School District, so Ken and I decided Ken would take the time off, so we
could make reservations to be with them on the 10<sup>th</sup> &amp; 11<sup>th</sup>
and then the others would come for Friday &amp; Saturday and then Mike &amp;
family would go home and the others would be with us for the next week.  Mike,
however, found out later that he had to be to a conference in Chicago, so they
wouldn’t be able to come to Zion’s.  That makes it bad because Ken had already
scheduled to take off work and he wouldn’t have had to and we would have just gone
up on Monday with Jeff &amp; Gail, rather than the previous Thursday.  Oh well,
we have to be flexible with family and not get upset when things don’t turn out
as planned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This all worked out, but we were afraid it
wouldn’t as the government had shut down and they closed down all the national
parks.  We were hoping they would open the parks, but they didn’t, so finally
our Utah governor told the president that Utah would pay to open the Utah
National Parks as the state was losing so much money from tourists not being
able to come.  There are so many businesses that were losing money and might
even lose their business as the national parks brought them in so many tourists
who spend money in their shops, restaurants, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and I had decided we would at least
go to Salt Lake, stay in a motel or hotel and eat out, go on the trolley, go to
the temple, etc., since we had the vacation time.  On Thursday we invited <b>Grinn
&amp; Kathleen Clark</b> and <b>Ken and</b> <b>Vivian Shaw </b>to go to the
Bountiful Temple and then out to eat with us.  The Clarks served in the
Philippines with us and we love them, and the Shaw’s served in our California
mission with us.  Both couples live in Bountiful.  We love them too.  After
eating, Ken and I went to our hotel to spend the night.  David called the next
morning, on our cell phones, and told us that the Utah National Parks were
opening today.  We were excited and called to make sure our reservations were
still open.  We didn’t hear back until we were almost there.  We left the hotel
and drove back to pack up and leave for Zion’s.  We were thrilled that we got
to go for at least most of our vacation.</p>

alt="All of us in river after hiking the river walk">             We again went
in October for the school’s fall break as Ben and Rachel were both in school.  
Jeff, Gail &amp; family &amp; family came down on Monday and stayed the week. 
Their friends, Stewart and Nisha came down for the last couple of days too and
they had reserved places for them and Jeff &amp; Gail to go repelling.  Ken and
I tended Jeff &amp; Gail’s children while they went.  Sandi and her family went
on the shuttle bus and trails that day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> Jeff had told Nolan that he should
come down with Stewart and Nisha.  Nolan and his family were coming to St.
George and staying at a condo for that weekend, so at the last minute, he did
come.  He told me that when Jeff said that I would love to have him there, he
wanted to come.  Nolan is a cute nephew and we have always had a close
relationship.  I took Jeff’s children over to the sand area to play and Nolan
came with us.  He was cute with the children.  Ben brought his insect net and
container and wanted to catch lizards.  He and his dad had caught some the day
before, but his dad had him let them go that night.  I promised him we would
catch some, so Nolan played with Rachel &amp; Matt in the sand while I took Ben
to catch lizards.  We did catch some, but he wanted to catch more so later
Nolan went with him.  Nolan’s leg is really bad, so it was hard for him to walk
very far.  We sat &amp; visited some.  He slept in the camper with us on
Thursday night.   Stewart and Nisha slept in our tent as Jeff &amp; Gail
brought Gail’s mother’s big tent for them to sleep in.  They didn’t bring food,
only snacks so ate meals with us.  We were a little surprised that they didn’t
offer to pay anything on the food, nor did they really thank us.  Oh well,
they’re nice people and good friends of Jeff &amp; Gail’s.  We brought Sandi’s
table over and made a big family table with the two tables, so everyone could
eat together and that was fun.  We brought our big shad tent and put it up over
the tables so in case it rained.  It was colder than we expected this year.  We
also all crowded into our tiny table area in our camper and played games.  Ken
wasn’t feeling good the one night so went to bed.  There was Sandi, Chelci,
Nathan (who watched), Jeff, Gail, Stewart, Nisha, Nolan and I playing.  It was
crazy, but we had fun.  </p>

would have them at my parent’s home in Clearfield and then for several years we
had them at Georgia &amp; Rick’s home in Fruit Heights as they have a large
home.  All our extended family came.  We always had a dinner with all of us
bringing food and then we would have a program.  A nativity with the younger
children playing the parts was always a mandatory part of the program and then
other family members would share their talents.  Rick would have all those who
had gone on foreign missions and learned a foreign language stand with him and
sing “Silent Night” in their own language.  That was fun.  Mom always loved the
Christmas parties.  After she passed away in 1999, we still had them at Georgia
&amp; Rick’s home until finally she told us that our families were getting so
large, that it was hard having them at her home and she felt we should separate
and each have our own family Christmas parties.  Some of the younger

responsibility and if they don’t want to hold them in their home they rent a
conference room at a motel or reserve a church for it. </u></p>

alt="Christmas 2011 091">This is an example of one of our Christmas parties.  <b>We
went to David &amp; Shauna’s</b> for our family Christmas party.  Every couple
had an assignment this time.  David &amp; Shauna hosted the gathering at their
home.  Becky planned the dinner menu and assigned it out.  Mishelle &amp; Scott
were over the program and since Chelci is on total bed rest, she couldn’t sing
for us and our grandson, David, couldn’t get off work, so he couldn’t play for
us, but Kylan brought his electric piano and played a fantastic piece for us,
he doesn’t read music, but listens to it and learns it.  He is very talented,
it was a hard piece, but he didn’t make any mistakes.  Kylan had taught Kaden a
small piece and it was cute to watch him play it.  Emily played a couple of
pieces for us on her violin and it was beautiful.  She is talented also.  Sandi
was over the games and we had a “game” exchange activity and we also played the
“Right &amp; Left” game with candy bars.  Jeff was over getting &amp; wrapping
the Santa gifts for the children.   We put them in our Santa bag and pretended
that Santa left it on the doorstep.  Grandma &amp; Grandpa Browning gave the
gifts out.  It was a very enjoyable evening and all seemed to have a good
time.  it was late when we got home and I was tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Another time Jeff &amp; Gail hosted the Family Christmas
party at their home in Layton</b>.  Everyone brought food and we had a
delicious Christmas dinner.  We had a program with Kylan playing the piano,
Chelci singing, Emily playing her violin and younger children singing and giving
poems.  We played “Mini-to-Winit” games in their family room and Grandma led
the children in the game “Mr. Wright and Mrs. Wright” with candy bars passing
to the right or to the left as Grandma reads the story.  Santa also came and
left his Christmas bag on the porch, so Grandpa &amp; Grandma distributed them
to the children.  Sandi lead the adults in a fun Christmas gift exchange game. 
We all had a wonderful time.  We have a close family and love to be together.  </p>
