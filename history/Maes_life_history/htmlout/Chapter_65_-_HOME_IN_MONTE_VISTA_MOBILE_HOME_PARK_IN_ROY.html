<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>HOME IN MONTE VISTA MOBILE
HOME PARK IN ROY, UTAH.  NOVEMBER 2014</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=269 height=201

align=left hspace=12 alt="Family, Reunion &amp; Vacation 2015 040"><b>We have
moved again, we hope this will be our last one.  We have bought a double wide
mobile home in the Monte Vista Mobile Home Park in Roy, Utah</b>, so not so far
away.  Our address is 3800 S 1900 W #283 in Roy.  Ken’s brother, Bob, who lived
upstairs in the Clinton home, has gone to an assisted living center in Layton
and since they had their home on a reverse mortgage, that meant we needed to
move also.  We feel the Lord has blessed us to find this nice home in a nice
community.  We loved our home in Clinton, our wonderful neighbors and our great
ward, but since we are getting older, the big yard and garden was hard to keep
up with, so I think this is a good move.  We have a small, but beautiful yard
here with trees, shrubs and flowers.  We have a large covered deck, which I
will enjoy relaxing on in good weather.  We are still getting settled, but
every day is an improvement.  Wow! We had to much “stuff” and with downsizing,
it has been a challenge to decide what we need to keep and what we need to get
rid of.  Ken is working on our shed to insulate it and put the shelves back in
plus more shelves, so I will be glad what that is done and we can get the stuff
on the back deck put in it.  I’m sure our neighbors will be glad too.  We have
great neighbors and a wonderful ward and community.  Monte Vista Mobile Home
Park is one ward, so it is interesting – no primary, young women’s, young men’s
or Elder’s Quorum.  It is just high priests and relief society because most are
retired or older single people and there are lots of widows.  They are
wonderful people.  We went to church here on Sunday for the first time and the
lady I sat by in Relief Society invited me to come to the Daughters of the Utah
Pioneer’s Christmas Party, which was the next day.  I went and met more friends
and had a wonderful time.  I’m sure we will love it here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>For an update on our family</b>,
<b>our granddaughter, Chelci, Sandi’s daughter, gave birth to identical twin
sons on Ken’s birthday – February 27<sup>th</sup></b><u>.</u>  They are
crawling now and so cute.  Chelci &amp; Steve invited us to their beautiful
home in Grantsville on Thanksgiving and we surely enjoyed being there with
Sandi and this cute family.  Jacob &amp; Luke joined Nathan and Addie as
siblings.  The dinner was delicious, but I got out of doing dishes as Nathan
&amp; Addie wanted me to play “Hide &amp; Seek” with them, and that was fun. 
Sandi has a beautiful home in Tooele and works at Grantsville High.  JaNae
&amp; Brad live in Stockton and have 3 special children.  JaNae teaches
clogging and is really talented.  It was fun to watch her teach her oldest
daughter, along with the rest of the class, when we went out to visit them last
month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Our grandson, David, (Mike &amp; Becky’s son)
married a cute girl, Sierra, in August</b>.  They are living in Logan where
David is going to Utah State University, and Sierra hopes to go in the spring,
but we will see as they are expecting their first child.  Mike and Becky are
excited to be grandparents.  That will make 9 great grandchildren for Ken and
I.  Mike and Becky’s daughter, Paige and husband, Garrett, also live in Logan
where Paige is in her junior year of the “Interior Design” program.  She is a
talented young woman.  Maddi is a teenager now and a cute out-going girl. 
Jessie is 12 and in her last year of Elementary School.  We are going to her
choir concert on Friday.  Mike is the principal at Orem High and Becky works at
the elementary school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Shellie &amp; Roy also just moved</b>.  They
moved from Queen Creek, AZ to Chandler, Arizona, so not so far away either. 
They are in a mess too as they are remodeling this home.  They take a breather
to relax in their backyard as they live on a small lake.  There are several
lakes in their community.  Their oldest son, Garrett, is in a dental program,
so with school, work, church and his cute wife and little daughter, he keeps
really busy.  Shellie &amp; Roy love being grandparents, and Quint, Kevis &amp;
Jase love their little niece too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>David &amp; Shauna invited the family to
their beautiful home in Enterprise (near Morgan, Utah</b>) on Saturday, after
Thanksgiving, where we ate, played games and visited.  David is enjoying
working as a PA in Dermatology.  He and Dr. Harris keep really busy.  Shauna is
in the medical field too where she works part-time, from home, for McKay/Dee
Hospital.  Tyler plays basketball for Morgan High and loves it.  Connor plays
basketball too, but likes soccer and baseball better.  Emily is really talented
on the violin, and we love to hear her play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Scott and Mishelle moved to a
beautiful home in West Layton last year</b>.  Mishelle is very talented in many
things and one of them is landscaping, so now they have a beautiful yard.  She
was  big help to Ken &amp; I in getting our new yard here in Roy cleaned up and
ready for winter.  Scott is a computer programmer and works for a company that
does custom programming for Hill Air Force Base.  Kylan is really talented both
on the piano and with airplanes.  He flies RC planes with adults at the flying
field, not far from his home.  Ashley loves creating things on “Mind Craft” and
other sites on the computer and loves being with her cousins, Mike &amp;
Becky’s daughters, Maddi &amp; Jessie.  The twins, Kaden &amp; Kaitlyn, keep
Mishelle really busy, but she gets a breather when they are in kindergarten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Jeff &amp; Gail have a beautiful home in
Layton, close to Hyw 89</b>.  Jeff loves the mountains so he loves to sit on
his back deck and look at the, or take his oldest son, Ben, hiking up them. 
Jeff is a controller (in the accounting field) for three plants with his
company.  Gail keeps busy with their three children – Ben, Rachel and Matt, and
keeping the household going smoothly.  We enjoyed our annual vacation to Zion’s
National Park with them this summer.  Also, Sandi, Chelci and family joined us
there.  We all had a great time, even though we had lots of rain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were able to put our home together enough and
the Christmas tree up, to have our annual older Grandchildren’s Christmas party
last Saturday.  One of the highlights of the party was doing service by going
to an assisted living center in Clinton and putting on a program.  We have some
talented grandchildren, so that was fun to see them perform, plus we all sand
Christmas carols.  We will have the younger grandchildren’s Christmas party on
the 27<sup>th</sup>.  We are also looking forward to our annual Family
Christmas Party, which will be on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.  Scott and Mishelle are
hosting it this year.  Ken and I love being together with our special family,
which total 46 at the present time.</p>
