hspace=12 alt="DSC03899 (2)"><b>1964 -</b> <b>Larry &amp; Tammy Braithwaite</b>
moved into our ward, the Mt Fort Ward in Ogden.  They were about our age and
Bishop Moulton asked Ken &amp; I to fellowship them as they had been inactive. 
They had just lost a little daughter in an accident.  Larry and his father were
contractors.  They had a large building framed up and Tammy brought her two
girls, Cindy and Lori over to see their dad.  A storm came up and one of the
big beams fell on Cindy, killing her.  Larry &amp; Tammy were devastated. 
Bishop Moulton had helped them and he wanted us to take over.  We did and
became best friends.  We invited them over for Sunday dinners and they invited
us to their home.  We took turns eating Sunday dinners at each other's homes
and were together a lot other times as well.  Sandi &amp; Lori had fun playing
together.  </p>

hspace=12 alt="Young Marrieds &amp; older party in Mt">Larry &amp; Tammy lived
in a nice Trailer in a trailer court in our ward.  At that time Ken &amp; I
were Young Marrieds leaders.  We asked Larry &amp; Tammy to help us.  They did
a great job and we had fun working together<b>.  Tammy &amp; I had fun as we
made up corny verses to put in invitations for Young Married parties, firesides
and other activities.</b>  We had good turnouts at our activities and
firesides.  We didn't limit them to just young marrieds, but all the couples of
the ward.  <b>We became good friends with Bob &amp; Pauline Hein and John &amp;
Linda Willerton also</b>.  The four couples of us were always at the firesides
and activities whether many others came or not - usually there was a good
crowd, in fact, most of the couples in the ward.  We had &quot;Come As You
Are&quot; parties, &quot;Backwards&quot; parties, Progressive dinners, square
dances, etc.  We went deer hunting with Larry &amp; Tammy.  It snowed and was
really cold.  We pitched a tent for the four of us, but that night I dressed
really warm (really funny, but warm) I put on long johns, my flannel nightgown,
a sweater, wool scarf, mittens - I guess that's all.  Anyway, I looked really
funny, but I was warm and that was what mattered.  Then Tammy laughed and said
to me &quot;you're caught, you have to come dressed this way to our Come As You
Are party&quot;.  Her and I were going around the ward catching people in funny
attire to come dressed that way to this party.  I had not &quot;caught&quot;
her and she had not &quot;caught&quot; me - until then     </p>

hspace=12 alt=DSC02727>Us four couples became good friends and went camping, to
the temple, out to eat, played games at each other's homes, etc.  After Larry
&amp; Tammy moved to Liberty, they invited us up for New Year's Eve and to
sleep over and spend the next day riding horses.  We went to a New Year's Eve
dance together, then went up to Larry &amp; Tammy's.  We all had baby sitters
for our children.  I think Larry's sister was tending their children at her
home as they were not at their house.  We ate, played games and then tried to
sleep a little, but every time we would quiet down and start to go to sleep,
Bob would come and squirt water on our faces.  We finally all piled on him and
tied him up.  We've laughed about that many times since.  We had a good time
riding horses, visiting, eating, etc., most of New Year's Day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ken had gotten a job with Commercial Security Bank in their
data processing department in Ogden, and he was happy to leave HAFB.  He worked
here for about four years and then he went into partnership with our friend,
Larry Braithwaite, in his construction company.  The four of us had become
great friends.  We seemed to have a lot in common and their other child was
Lori and she was the same age as Sandi<b>, </b>so they had fun together.  Then
they had Holly and I had Shellie soon after.  They had Lonnie and then Jody. 
We had Mike, David, Scott &amp; Jeff.  Holly &amp; Shellie played together when
they were little, Lonnie played with Mike &amp; David.  I was pregnant with
David and Tammy was pregnant with Jody.  I was due a month earlier than Tammy
was, but she said “You go two weeks late and I will come two weeks early and we
can be in the hospital together.”  I told her that it was great for her to come
two weeks early, but I didn’t want to come two weeks late.  Well, that’s
exactly what happened.  I went two weeks over and the doctor was going to start
me on Saturday.  Tammy called me Friday night and said “Mae, I’m on my way to
the hospital and I will tell Linda (a nurse who lived in our ward) to save a
bed for you next to mine.  In those days we didn’t have private rooms, there
were four beds in each room, and we stayed for three days in the hospital after
having our babies.  We had fun together.  Tammy had thought she would have a
boy and I thought I would have a girl, so we were both surprised.  In those
days, we didn’t have ultra sound machines, so we didn’t know the sex of the
baby until it was born.  My doctor, Byron Naisbitt would ask me what I wanted
and if I said I wanted a girl, he would say it was a boy.  If it was a girl,
then I was happy and it didn’t matter what he had said, but if it was a boy,
then he was right.  Tammy and I became best friends and we were always doing
things together and going places together. Tammy &amp; I have always been
close, even when our husbands were having problems, we didn't.  We always felt
we were as close as sisters.  The good part was that we didn't fight as some
sisters do.  We even dressed alike sometimes and people thought we were
sisters.  Many times, while our husbands were working, her and I would get
together and make crafts, work on scrapbooks or picture albums, make Christmas
candy together, etc., etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> As families we would eat at each
other’s homes, go to the parks together and have picnics, go camping and
fishing together, etc.  <br>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jennie’s Lake in Wyoming</b> – When the children were
young, in fact we only had Sandi and maybe Shellie at that time, and Larry
&amp; Tammy lived in our ward, we would go with them to Jennie’s Lake in
Wyoming to camp and fish.  It was a great place to go and we loved being with
our good friends. We went there several times.  One time we invited the
families from our “Ward’sYoung Married Group” and that was fun too.  Sometimes
we would get a babysitter for our daughters and the four of us would climb in
the cab of their truck and go four wheeling up in the mountains.  It was always
fun.</p>

hspace=12 alt=DSC02730>The first summer, when Ken &amp; Larry were working
together, the four of us took our girls, Sandi &amp; Lori, who were the same
age and became good friends, <b>and went to Yellowstone Park together.</b>  The
year was 1966.  Larry &amp; Tammy had bought a camp trailer.  There had been an
earthquake in Montana, close to Yellowstone Park so we went there too.  It had
devastated that area.  We walked onto the roof of a home which had been flooded
and carried away.  We loved Yellowstone Park and enjoyed being together.  We went
to a ghost town too and other places.  We fixed most of our meals in the camper
and we played “Rook” at night after the girls went to bed.  That was the time
when we stopped wanting to play Rook with them as Larry began outbidding
everyone even though he knew he had a bad hand as he thought the odds of
winning were good and he always wanted to control the bid.  Many times he went
under, but he didn’t care, he would still keep outbidding us, so that was no
fun for the rest of us any longer.  I think that’s the last time we played Rook
with him.  The girls had fun together.  We stopped on the way home at the Idaho
Falls Temple and took pictures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Ken didn’t like working for Perk Petersen
because he couldn’t trust him.  He would say one thing and do another.  We had
a hard time getting our pay check and when we did, it usually bounced.  Perk
didn’t keep track of his money, and would write out checks and didn’t know
there wasn’t money to clear them.  This happened time after time until Ken
finally quit and went to work for Modular Construction Company at Free Port
there in Clearfield. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At this time Larry and Tammy had purchased some
land in Liberty (up above the dam at Ogden Canyon) to build their home on and
have some animals.  We figured we would trade our equity on our home in Ogden
for some land in Eden (close to Liberty).  Ken and Larry figured to help each
other build their homes.  We talked with the man about the land and had papers
drawn up. We moved out to Clearfield to Uncle Dale and Aunt Esther’s old home
to rent until we figured we could move into our new home in Eden.  After we
were moved this man figured he had us over a barrow with us out of our home so
he backed out of the agreement - didn’t want to give us what we had asked out
of our home on the land.  He also wanted us to pay closing costs, etc.  We
couldn’t afford to do this.  Like dumb bells, we didn’t have him sign a
contract.  We talked to a lawyer and he advised us to just let it drop and sell
our home to someone else.  We tried to, but were having difficulty so decided
to rent it for awhile.  That was a big mistake as the couple who rented it just
they just had a couple of children and no pets.  Well, soon after they moved
in, other family members moved in with them and they had several pets.  They
didn’t take care of the house or yard and, in fact, wrecked the place.  It
wasn’t long until the neighbors called complaining about these people.  They
didn’t pay the rent either, so we tried to evict them, but it wasn’t that easy
as they had small children.  We took them to court, but they didn’t show up, so
the judge awarded the case to us.  Ken asked him what that meant and he said we
had the right to collect it from them.  Wow! That wasn’t helpful.  Finally, the
gas company called us to tell us that the gas bill hadn’t been paid and they
were going to shut off the gas.  The power company said the same, and we told
them both to go ahead and shut off the utilities.  It wasn’t long until those
people moved out.  But, we sure had a mess to clean up and replace carpet,
screen door, repaint, redo the lawns, etc.  We even found a partially dead cat
in a sack in the garbage. We heard it moving around and thought it might be a
rat.  When Ken took it outside and shook it out, he was mad.  They had kicked
the cat, broke it’s back and put it in the sack to die.  Wish we could have
reported them to the humane society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ken &amp; I have been emotional a lot lately as we have
experienced several hard things in our life over the past few weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- The hardest was to learn of our best friends<b>, Larry
&amp; Tammy Braithwaite's apostasy from the church</b> and their
excommunication.  It has really been hard dealing with that.  Just about
everything we hear, read or see that has anything to do with the church, family
or even life makes us think of them and what they have given up and what they
are doing.  We love them.  They have been a big part of our life.  We have many
fond memories of them.  Our last move to Arizona ended in bad feelings from Ken
towards Larry and that was hard because Tammy was my best friend and I felt so
close to her and I loved Larry also.  I didn't agree with all he said or did
either, but was willing to forgive him - but Ken wasn't.  He has now, thank
goodness.  They got involved in anti-Mormon literature, they had let down their
guard.  We don't think they were reading the scriptures, etc., they began to
criticize the leaders and find fault - and went downhill from there.  We are so
sad.  We have sent letters and articles, etc., to try to get them to reconsider,
and have born our testimonies to them, but it didn't do any good.  Finally
Larry sent a long letter telling us not to send any more testimonies - that he
would never come back in the church.  He also sent anti-Mormon literature and a
copy of the letter he sent his kids.  I threw them away as I didn't want to
read them.  He said he does love us and wants to stay friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I haven't heard from Tammy.  Larry
has always been the one to talk to us on the phone or write the letters.  I
wish I knew how she felt.  I had called two weeks before we got the terrible
letter and had a good visit on the phone with both of them.  They never
mentioned anything about their leaving the church.  I had invited them to come
up where we would be camping - up Cedar Canyon with our family on the 8th of
August and to invite their family to come also.  We hadn't been together with
our families since we moved from Arizona the last time.  They talked like they
would love to come, but when we got the letter they explained that they would
love to come and be with us, but maybe we had better do it another time.  When
we talked with Larry after getting the letter, we asked about his children.  He
said some are OK with it and had doubts too, that Lonnie &amp; his wife were
upset at first, but now had confessed that they have doubts too, but since her
family are strong active members that they won't leave the church as it would
be too hard on her parents.  He said Jody is having the hardest time - that she
said &quot;Dad, why have you spent all my life teaching me the gospel and
telling me it was true and now you tell me it isn't&quot;.  Ken &amp; I really
feel bad for their children.  I'm sure it is tearing them apart.  Ken &amp; I
feel so bad and they are always in our thoughts and prayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2017 – update on Tammy &amp; Larry</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had heard from Shellie that
Larry &amp; Tammy’s son, Lonnie and his wife &amp; children live in their stake
in Queen Creek, Arizona.  She saw him &amp; his wife at the temple and they
were excited to see each other and catch up on our families.  Lonnie told
Shellie that he and his family can’t have contact with his parents as Larry is
so anti Mormon that he tried to get Lonnie to leave the church.  Lonnie
wouldn’t do it and so Larry wouldn’t let him talk to his mom.  He told Shellie
that his mom is a wonderful grandmother, but she can’t be a grandmother to his
kids because every time he would go to their house, his dad would keep telling
him anti Mormon stuff and so they haven’t been able to go there.  Lonnie was in
the High Council, in the Bishopric and works in the temple.  Lonnie’s wife has
always been strong in the church and they are raising their children in the
gospel.  As far as we know Jody is still active too, however, she divorced her
husband.  He is a good man and they have had leadership positions also, but
Tammy told us lately that they just were not compatible.  She is dating a guy
she dated in high school, who is also divorced.  Lori and her husband are
messed up, and Lonnie said Holly is Holly.  She was always scatter brained. 
She has been married and divorced two or three times and her husband was
unfaithful to her, so she was unfaithful to him.</p>

alt="Mae &amp; Tammy - close friends reunited after Larry's death in March 2017">Our
son, David, had Lonnie’s married son, who lives in this area, come to him as a
patient and David found out that he was Larry’s grandson.  This grandson
recently called David to let him know that Larry had passed away.  On our way
to Shellie &amp; Roy’s home in March, we stopped at Maggie &amp; Bill Klass’s
home to visit and spend the night with them.  They were good friend from when
we had our home in Layton and they recently moved to St. George.  We had <b>Tammy’</b>s
home address, so we decided to go see if she was home to visit her for a few
minutes, the next morning before we went on our way to Shellie and Roy’s home. 
She was home and when she opened the door and saw us, she was so surprised and
then gave me a big hug and we cried as we hugged.  She hugged Ken also and then
invited us in.  We visited for a while and she told us about the “Celebration
of Life” they had for Larry and how she was so thrilled that over 80 people
came.  She said lots of neighbors and friends loved Larry.  We loved him also
as he was a good and generous man – just wish he hadn’t listened to Satan and
left the church.  Anyway, she showed us the beautiful sunroom he made for them
and a couple of beautiful chests he made and she painted.  They were
beautiful.  Larry was a special craftsman, he was really talented.  Larry died
of Rumatoid Arthritis.  He came down with it soon after we met them and it kept
progressing.  He really suffered with it, but he didn’t let it stop him, until
it finally got him in the end.  Tammy said the last year or so he showed her
all the things she needed to know to take care of their home and yard – so that
was great.  I have always loved Tammy like a sister and it was so good to see
her again.  I don’t know if we will ever be close again like we were, but I was
thankful to see her again</p>
