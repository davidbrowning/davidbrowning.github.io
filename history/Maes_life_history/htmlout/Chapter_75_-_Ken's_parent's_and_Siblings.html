hspace=12 alt="Ken with parents &amp; siblings"><b>Ken’s mom remarried after
Charles (Ken’s father) died in March of 67.  She married Leo Jensen in June of
1970.</b>  He is a wonderful man and we love him.  He was a temple worker and
now she is.  They serve in the Idaho Falls Temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a family picture taken at a family reunion with
Marge’s children – Rich (Dad Browning’s youngest son by his first wife),
Margaret (Marge’s daughter by her first husband, Less), Roy (Ken’s older
brother – he, Ken &amp; Irven are children of Marge and Charles Browning),
Irven is standing at the left of Leo Jensen.  Ken is on the front with his
older brother, Bob (Floyd Robert), but he was called Bob.  Bob was also a son
born to Marge and her first husband, Less).  Leo and Marge live at the time at
90 Boise Ave. in Idaho Falls.  They are happy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Leo was about 15 years older than Ken’s mom. 
She, Marge, waned to be closer to her family and Marge didn’t like living in
the home his first wife and he had built together, so they bought a home in
Layton.  They had several happy years together and then he passed away.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have written about Ken’s mom in other
chapters.</p>

hspace=12 alt="DSC03292 (2).JPG">            Rich &amp; Lois live in Pocatello,
Idaho.  They have raised a wonderful family who are all active in the church
and are raising good families.  Rich &amp; Lois are such good people and good
examples.  They have always supported their siblings and families in all we
do.  If there is a reunion, wedding, funeral, birthday party for Ken’s mom,
etc., they are there, and they bring part of their family with them.  We love
and admire them, and we love being with them.  We are always welcome at their
home and they love us to stay overnight, and they feed us and we always play
Mormon Bridge at night and have ice cream.  Rich loves that game and loves ice
cream. I have written in another chapter about the wonderful times we have had
with them at their condo at Island Park.  They had snowmobiles and the four of
us would trailer the snowmobiles into West Yellowstone and then I would get
behind Ken on one, and Lois would get behind Rich on the other and we would go
all through Yellowstone Park.  It was so beautiful with lots of snow.  We would
see lots of Buffalos and other animals.  There was “warming huts” when you
could go in and they had fires going in the stoves and you could buy hot
chocolate, etc.  We also went up other hills and mountains as the forest
service would groom many trails.  We always loved being with Rich and Lois.  At
the condo we would come in from snowmobiling, eat and then go to the club house
where there was a warm indoor pool, ping pong tables, etc.  We would go back to
the condo and play “Mormon Bridge and eat ice cream.  Whenever we stayed with
Rich at Lois at their home or condo, we would always end the night by reading
the scriptures together and having a prayer together.  They are such righteous,
faithful, wonderful people.  We sure love them, and their special family.  This
is a picture of Lois and their children after Rich had passed away.  They are:

hspace=12 alt="P1180578 (2).JPG"><b>Bob, Carroll and family</b> have retired from
the Air Force and are now living in Sunset, Utah.  They had 5 children, but the
one daughter died soon after child birth, so they raised four children – <b>Kathy,
Grant, Robert, &amp; Sherry.</b>  Kathy &amp; Sherry left the church.  Kathy
lives in Texas, Robert, Patty and children live in Honeyville Utah, Grant &amp;
Stacy live in Layton Utah, and Sherry, Eric and Cole live in Syracuse Utah.  When
we came back from our mission to the Philippines, we again lived in Bob &amp;
Carrol’s basement apartment, that Ken had built for their mother.  We had lived
there for a few months, taking care of their mother as she had Alzheimer’s
disease. As we had sold our home in Layton to Scott &amp; Mishelle and had
planned to build on our lot in Star Valley, Wyoming.  (I have written all about
this in other chapters.)  Anyway, it worked out well living there with Bob
&amp; Carroll.  We shared all the expenses – utilities, property taxes and home
insurance, repairs on the home, replacing the furnace, etc., etc.  Bob mainly
cooked even though Carroll was a good cook, because Bob would complain at times
about her cooking and she didn’t like to cook, so told him, he would do it. 
They would invite us up for meals sometimes, especially on Sundays when we
weren’t having our family over for dinner or going to their homes.  Carroll
loved to play Canasta and that was about the only game she wanted to play.  We
all enjoyed playing it.  Bob would pop, pop corn and we had enjoyable evenings.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=297 height=198
src="Chapter_75_-_Ken's_parent's_and_Siblings_files/image006.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt=P1070146.JPG>Carroll got dementia and was imagining all kinds of
things that were not true, and was so upset because no one would believe her. 
She thought the neighbors were stealing their electricity, she knew they were
up in their attic stealing things, etc., etc.  She called the Bishop to come
check it out, she called the police several times until they quit coming.  That
was a hard time for all of us.  Carroll was always good to me.  She had health
problems and her legs and feet would swell so big.  I felt sorry for her.  Sometimes
I would go up and clean her bathroom and kitchen and she always appreciated
it.  She didn’t like Ken’s mother cleaning her house for her, but now that her
health was bad, she appreciated me doing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=341 height=256
src="Chapter_75_-_Ken's_parent's_and_Siblings_files/image007.jpg" align=left
hspace=12 alt="P1180609 (2).JPG">Carroll had a severe stroke and passed away in
the hospital a week later.  Sherrie had a child, Cole, out of wedlock.  Carroll
would take care of him while Sherry worked.  As he went to school, Carroll
would go down at 6 am and stay with Cole and get him off to school as Sherry had
to go to work early.  What a wonderful grandmother Carroll was to Cole.  When
Carroll passed away, Cole was heartbroken as he loved his grandma so much.  Sherrie
married Eric, they bought a home in Syracuse.  They both drank heavily.  Sherry
ended up dying from Alcohol consumption a year after her mother passed away.  <b>Cole
</b>has turned out to be a great young man.  He got straight A’s in school and
wanted to go to college, so he is living with his grandparents (His real dad’s
parents) and going to Weber University.  Bob &amp; Carroll never knew that
Sherrie drank.  She was talented with food services, like her dad, and had good
jobs for awhile, but kept getting fired because of her drinking.  Bob was
devastated when Sherrie was in the hospital and he was upset with the doctors
that they couldn’t heal Sherrie.  They told Sherrie that either she told her
father, or they would.  This was hard on Bob.  After Carroll passed away, Bob
wanted to remarry so he asked me to look for him ladies to date on the “Mormon
Singles Date Site” on the computer.  I found a couple and he dated them once
each.  He realized that they all were older, like him, so had health problems
and they all had baggage, so after a time, he gave it up.  Bob was a great
baker, as he had done that in the Air Force, so he made delicious pies and
brownies.  He would rap on the door, or up by the stairs and when I came to the
door, he would say “Mae, I made a coconut cream pie.  I know Ken can’t eat it
because of the sugar, but you can, so come and have a piece with me.”  I loved
them.  At Thanksgiving, he would make all kinds of pies – apple, pumpkin,
cherry, banana cream, coconut cream, lemon, etc.  Carroll made a soda cracker
pie that was delicious too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> The main thing that was annoying
about them was that when they wanted Ken to do something or fix something for
them, they wanted it done right now.  Ken had other things that he needed to do,
but he would finally give up and do it for them.  Bob kept doing that after
Carroll passed away.  If we didn’t get to the door right away, he had a hammer
and would pound it and make a real racket.  We told him to have patience, that
it took a minute or two for us to get to the door if we were back in the
bedroom or bathroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Bob’s health kept failing, so his
kids felt he should be in an assisted living center.  Stacey (Grant’s wife)
found a nice one in Layton and they moved him there.  Grant &amp; Stacey did a
lot for Bob and made sure that he had everything that he needed.  Robert &amp;
Patti would come down on Friday afternoons and take him out to eat.  Ken and I
had to move also, since Bob &amp; Carroll had put their home on a reverse
mortgage.  We bought a mobile home in the Monte Vista Mobile Home Park – a very
nice senior living park in Roy and we are happy here.  We have a small lot, but
it is beautiful with trees, bushes and flower gardens.  We also have a garden
box in back.  It is nice not to have such a large garden and yard to take care
of as Bob &amp; Carroll had an acre lot and it was mainly Ken &amp; I to take
care of it.  Bob, would mow the lawns with his riding lawn mower before his
health got worse.  We visited Bob in the Assisted Living Center quite frequently
and so did Irven &amp; Sandy.  <b>Of course his children did too</b>, and
Cheryl, Margaret’s daughter.  We would sometimes go and pick him up, bring him
to our home for Sunday dinner and then take him back.  When we visited him in
the center, he would want us to watch a movie with him.  Bob loved the TV, he
loved watching all kinds of sports, western movies and about anything.  It was
hard to visit with him because his hearing was so bad, he couldn’t understand
us, so we had to write on a whiteboard.  So, TV movies and DVDs worked for all
of us.  He always had cookies in his cupboard that he would offer to me and he
would get popcorn, from the kitchen to give to Ken.  He was cute that way.  I
really liked Bob as he was usually happy and positive, even when he didn’t feel
good.</p>

hspace=12 alt=DSC02822.JPG><b>Margaret</b> and family are living in Salt Lake. 
Margaret has had a hard life due to her making bad choices by drinking,
marrying guys she meets in the bars.  She flirts with the other guys at the
bars and then her husband (She has married 8 times) takes her home and beats
her.  After she divorced her last husband, she stayed with us for a couple of
months and I saw a better side to Margaret and was thankful for that time with
her.  She died at age 55 from alcohol and other complications.  At the autopsy,
they reported that her insides looked like scrambled eggs from the beatings she
had taken – so sad.  Her second daughter, Linda, was a sweet girl, but died in
her 20’s with a hole in her heart that should have taken her at birth.  She was
able to marry and they adopted a child.  Margaret’s oldest daughter, <b>Cheryl
is a gem.</b>  She is such a wonderful person.  Her mom forced her into
marrying the brother of her current husband.  He drank, smoked and wasn’t a
great guy, but Cheryl stuck with him as she didn’t want the life her mom had. 
Cheryl got active in the church later on, and Bob eventually joined the church
also.  He has really poor health now.  They lost a daughter to phenomena, and
Cheryl practically raised them as the daughter’s husband stayed with them, but
couldn’t handle all this responsibility, so Cheryl took over.  The picture
above shows Cheryl (the oldest), then Linda and our daughter, Sandi, was with
them.</p>

Linda and two children</b>, Steven and Barbara, are moving to Fresno, California
the first part of September.  They don’t like the snow and Roy was able to get
a transfer to Fresno with IRS.  Linda was able to have children, so they
adopted Steve &amp; Barbie.  Linda got pregnant with Julianna when she was 40
years old.  Steve got into drugs when he was a teenager, but got off them, went
on a mission to Hawaii, came home and married a beautiful girl in the temple. 
She died about a year later from a disease she had.  Steve had a terrible time
and finally married another beautiful girl, and had two children.  He treated
Heather badly and she finally divorced him.  He went back to drugs, but moved to
Texas where she was living with her parents, so he could be near his children. 
They found him dead in a bar – so sad.  Barbara married a great guy in the
temple and they had four children.  They are doing good<u>. </u></p>

alt="Roy &amp; Linda took Ken &amp; I out to eat at Sizzler while staying with us in Oct 2015.JPG">When
Ken and I were on our service mission to the South Valley Farms in Wasco California,
from March 2010 to March 2011, it was only an hour’s drive to Fresno, so we
would go over to visit Roy &amp; Linda several times on weekends.  They loved
having us come and we were glad we could.  Sometimes we would go to the Fresno
Temple with them, stay overnight and go to church with them, and then come
home.  We went on several trips with them.  One trip to Yosemite National Park,
one to San Francisco, and one to Hollywood and other places in Las Angeles.  We
went on a tour bus, which was great!  They came to our home sometimes on the
weekends and stayed overnight with us.  They invited Ken and I to come for
Christmas Eve and stay over for Christmas day.  We did and had a wonderful
time.  On Christmas Eve, they drove us to a special area where all the homes
were decorated and lit up so great.  We walked up the one side of the street
and then down the other side, it really made you have the Christmas spirit. 
The weather wasn’t cold like it is in Utah, but we did wear jackets.  On
Christmas morning, Ken and I woke, but Roy &amp; Linda wee still sleeping, so
we got on our swimming suits, picked some oranges from their tree, got in their
hot tub, ate the oranges and enjoyed being in their hot tub.  They finally woke
and came looking for us.  They laughed when they saw us.  We all opened our
gifts and then to Phil and Julianna’s for Christmas dinner.  It was delicious
and we enjoyed seeing their home and being with them.  They were living in
Fresno at the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> I love Linda, but she mainly loves
to visit and she does most of the talking.  With her bad health, she has
Fibromyalgia, so she just mainly lies in her recliner and watches TV or reads. 
Roy has to do most of the cooking and the house doesn’t get kept up.  When we
would go visit, I would need to clean the kitchen before I could help Roy
prepare the food.  I would see caroches scurry here and there and I hated
that.  The last time we stayed with them, Ken’s back was red with bites and we
think it was bed bugs.  With their health, Roy has sugar diabetes and dementia,
and her health, the house doesn’t get cleaned.  Their living room was usually
okay.  Linda gets upset easily, so Roy and her children try not to upset her.</p>

lives in Fresno, about 3 hours away, but they come down about every week to
check on him and help him.  Julianna &amp; Phil live in the state of
Washington.  She wasn’t able to have children, so they do foster care and they adopted
a little boy. </p>

hspace=12 alt="Irven, Sandy &amp; family"><b>Irven</b> is dating a real nice
girl in Salt Lake,  and is working as a milk man.  Irven married that wonderful
girl, Sandy, in the Salt Lake Temple.  They were both 28 when they married. 
They wanted to have a large family, so their children are close together –
Andrea, Doug, Jennifer, Christine and Mark.  They all married in the temple,
except Andrea, who is a beautiful, sweet and talented young woman, but she
didn’t find the right guy – at least not yet and she is 44 now (2018).  I
wrote  in another chapter, move to Taylorsville, how they liked our home and
area, so they bought a home about a block away from us.  However, we were both
only there for about 9 months.  We moved to Erda, where Ken ran the three stake
farm, and Irven, Sandy and family moved to Pocatello, Idaho and then to a town
(Can’t remember the name) by Firth, Idaho where we came and lived for two
years.  I’m sure I have also wrote about when they came to live with us for
nine months after they had moved to Mesa Arizona, but financially it was a bad
move and they needed to move back and get back on their feet.  We had lived
with Ken’s mom, when we moved back from Arizona the 3<sup>rd</sup> time and
were having a tough time financially, so we agreed to let them live with us for
awhile.  It worked out great for Sandy and I.  We took turns cooking and we
cleaned house together.  We had fun visiting and laughing and enjoyed each
other.  Ken finally didn’t like the arrangement and wanted them to move.  They
did and I don’t think they had hard feelings.  They found a home in Clearfield
where they lived for several years.</p>

was working for NFIB.  He was driving and a storm came up, he was hit by a semi
and it should have killed him, but he survived.  He has had some operations and
has a limp, can’t drive, so had to retire early.  When they lived in
Clearfield, we got together to play games and visit quite often..  They usually
invited Bryce &amp; Deanna (who were their good friends as Irven and Bryce
became good friends in high school) and Ken and I for New Year’s Eve and we
would eat and play games.  They have now moved to Smithfield, by Logan and have
a nice home.  Their children – Jennifer, Christine and Mark all live in the
Logan area and talked them into moving up closer to them.  We visit them
occasionally, stay overnight and mainly play games.</p>
