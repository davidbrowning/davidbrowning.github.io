<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>I feel very fortunate to have lived close
to my grandparents as I was growing up.  They were a great source of support,
example and love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandpa was a big man both in height and
stature.  He had a beautiful tenor voice and was in the Clearfield male chorus
lead by a Mr. Christensen who was also my Jr. High chorus teacher.  Grandpa was
asked to sing at funerals and weddings a lot.  Especially down in Millard
 County where he was from.  Grandmas health wasn't too good, and she felt she
had too many home responsibilities - so many times grandpa would take one of us
grandchildren with him.  I loved to go.  We'd visit along the way and he would
always stop at a drive in and buy us a hamburger and malt.  I always looked
forward to that and to being with grandpa on a trip.  Grandpa sang at my
wedding reception.  Grandpa had a sweet tooth, so he always had candy and other
sweets and pastries in his home, and carried white mints in his pocket.  He was
always sharing them with us.  Grandpa sat up a tradition for us children. 
Every Sunday morning as long as I can remember after they moved next door, he'd
come over and give us a Sunday nickel for each of us grandchildren.  When we
got older, it was a dime.  I thought that was special.  Our family didn't have
much extra money and I hated to ask Mom or Dad for money - so I looked forward
to this Sunday nickel or dime, so I could buy me a treat at the corner gas
station during the week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandpa had a temper, so we tried to steer clear
of him if we'd misbehaved or if he was in a mad mood.  I can remember riding
with him and grandma in their car and grandpa would get out of patience with
the other drivers and say to grandma &quot;Get their license number, I'm going
to turn them in.&quot;  Little grandma would say &quot;Now dad&quot;. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Grandpa also had a heart of gold and he loved
visiting the sick and going to rest homes to cheer up the aged and afflicted. 
He did this a lot in the evenings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Thanksgiving at Grandpa &amp;
Grandmas.  Uncle June and Aunt Marilyn and sometimes Uncle Van, Aunt Allison
&amp; family and sometimes some of their other children and family and always
our family would be there.  Mom would always go over the night before and help
grandma made the stuffing and stuff the turkey.  Grandma had the best stuffing
recipe.  Ken loves it, so he helps me make it every year for our family and
others.  Then Mom &amp; grandma would fix a delicious dinner with all the trimmings
Thanksgiving morning and the others would bring food if they came.  Grandpa
would always make delicious lime punch.  That was one of the highlights of the
meal for me.  We didn't have punch a lot as Mom &amp; Dad were very health
conscious and didn't feel punch was good for us.  We mainly drank milk and
water.  Even now when I make punch, I think of Grandpa's lime punch.  Mine
never tastes as good as grandpa's did.  After dinner and the dishes were done,
Mom and her brothers and wives (sometimes Grandma &amp; Grandpa, but hardly
ever my dad as he didn't like to play card games except &quot;Authors&quot; and
he was really good at that.  So, dad would usually go over home and read) us
children would usually sit around and watch them play.  Mom loves to play games
and she'd laugh and have such a good time.  I can remember Uncle June with all
his swear words.  He was a truck driver and had gotten into a bad habit of
swearing, but he had such a sense of humor that we all overlooked (or tried to)
his language even though it shocked us many times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Soon after Ken &amp; I were married and living
in the Duplex apartment, we liked to sleep in on Saturday mornings as we both
worked during the week, but often Grandpa would pound on our door at 7 am, and
when we sleepily went to the door, Grandpa would say “Aren’t you up?  It’s time
you were up as its 7 am and I need your help”.  We were not so happy about
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I remember one time after Ken &amp;
I were married that our family and Grandpa &amp; Grandma were going up to
Logan.  Mom asked Ken &amp; me to ride with Grandpa &amp; Grandma since their
car was full with them and my younger brothers &amp; sister.  We did, but
grandpa kept getting mad and complaining about the other drivers until it
really upset Ken and me.  While we were at Logan, we asked Mom if some of the
other children could ride home with Grandpa &amp; Grandma as we had had our
fill of Grandpa and his complaining.  The other children didn't want to, so we
had to return home by way of Grandpa's car.  I think Grandpa realized how upset
it had made us, or maybe Grandma got after him - anyway he was much better
going home.  In fact, he stopped and bought us a malt.  (I think to make up for
his bad behavior)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My dad and grandpa Bushnell had such a good
relationship.  When grandpa had his second heart attack and Dad was driving him
to the hospital, he told dad he wouldn't make it this time, that he would die. 
Dad was really sad.  And after grandpa died and his casket was in the church
down in Meadow (as that was where he wanted to be buried) dad said he was alone
with grandpa and he suddenly felt grandpa's presence and felt grandpa was about
to speak to him when someone walked in and interrupted it.  He felt bad as he
felt grandpa had something to say to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Grandpa Bushnell died December
29th, 1962.  Mom had invited Ken and I, and Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell out
for my birthday supper.  Grandpa had said the blessing on the food.  After
supper Ken and I went home, and Mom, Dad, Grandpa and Grandma went to see a
show &quot;The Big Country&quot;.  After the show and Mom and Dad were in bed;
Grandma called Mom and told her that Grandpa was in a lot of pain and she was
afraid he was having a heart attack.  Mom and Dad went over and finally Dad
took Grandpa to the hospital.  Dad said he knew he wouldn't bring Grandpa back home. 
Grandpa died a few minutes after he arrived in the hospital.  Grandpa's funeral
was beautiful.  The choirs which Grandpa sang in with Brother Christensen
conducting sang two numbers.  Dad talked, Bishop Nicholas talked, etc.  Our
young Marrieds Group here in the ward sent a bouquet of flowers out.  Blaine
and Launa Barrows were the leaders.  Dick &amp; Barbara Brower and Kent and
Deon Horton came out to the mortuary which I thought was very sweet and
thoughtful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>From Grandpa's obituary: Sunset -
George Labrum Bushnell 1741 N. Main died this morning in the Dee Hospital in
Ogden of a heart attack.  Mr. Bushnell was born June
 12, 1892, in Meadow, Utah a son of Howard B. and Mary Elizabeth Labrum
Bushnell.  He was educated in Meadow and Fillmore.  He was retired from Hill
Air Force Base as a warehouseman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            He was married to Iva Bell Swallow on Sept
 29, 1915, in the Manti Temple.  He was a high priest in the Sunset Second
Ward.  He served a mission in the Western States and four stake missions.  He
had been a member of the Clearfield-Sunset Priesthood Chorus, was past Sunday

<p class=MsoNormal><b>GRANDPA BUSHNELL'S PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE</b> - written 11
Oct. 1958 while convalescent after a heart attack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I AM NOT AFRAID&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>I'm not afraid to die.  This is not
boasting.  I am not brave, I fear a lot of things.  I often cringe before the
threats of life.  In the face of great calamity, I might play the coward, but I
am not afraid of death.  I fear it only for the ones I love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When they die the sun will set at noon
for me and I shall limp about in darkness.  And when I die I fear for them. 
For no man has lived so worthless but someone adored him over much and mourned
him when he was no more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            But for myself alone I am not afraid of death. 
Why should I be?  It's just as natural as birth.  I do not know for sure what
life may be after death.  But I am sure I shall try to live the best I can, so
I may receive the reward I am deserving of.  I do not know for sure what it was
before birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            If life is everlasting which I am sur.  I lived
many years ago before my spirit entered this earthly body.  My spirit mingled
and associated with many numbers of spirits, many who have had the privilege of
coming to earth and entering earthly bodies as I have done.  Then after this
spirit of mine leaves this earthly body it shall go back to mingle again with
those spirits who have lived true honorable lives while here upon the earth. 
There they shall be given Celestial bodies and shall live for time and
eternity, even endless days.  For eternal life must be without beginning of
years as well as without endless days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Nothing proves that I see not beyond the ground
walls of the grave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This I know as far as human mind may know that I
shall live always.  This is my faith.  It presents no tangible evidence for
human courts of inquiry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have what Prophets name as inner witness to
eternal life.  But this is not easily geared down by chains of logic to solid
traction wheels of demonstrable truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also have a most convincing record &quot;The
Bible&quot; which tells of one who conquered death and was resurrected proving
that we will live again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was not there to prove it myself, nor have I ever
met a man returned from out the boundless deep who has been resurrected who
verifies my faith.  I only feel through inspiration within myself that it is
true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            That satisfaction, that knowledge, that faith,
nothing can destroy.  This life is on the duller side of death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            And even though this faith were vain, I am not
afraid.  If death was all the nothingness could do nothing to me.  But this I
know this life is but the beginning and can do everything to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I'm so afraid of so many things, life's problems
frighten me.  I hide from quite imaginary foes.  But I am not afraid of death. 
I know that my Redeemer lives, and if I conduct my life as our Savior has set
the example and plan I shall be able to mingle with him and my loved ones who
have gone before.  For they are not lost, but gone to a better place to live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I want to live honorably among my fellow man. 
My desire is to make others happy.  THIS TO ME IS TRUE HAPPINESS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            And I can say with all truthfulness as Job said
&quot;I know that my Redeemer lives and that he shall stand at the later day
upon the earth, and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold
and not another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I want to live that when death does come that I
will e able to meet my Mother and Father, put my arms around them and thank
them for teaching unto me the true plan of salvation, and for instilling unto
my soul a testimony of the Gospel.  That I with my lovely wife who has been
true and a real Latter-day Saint Companion, and also our family may be exalted
in the kingdom of our eternal father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I do know it shall be if I and they live the
commandments and teachings given through our Savior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            THIS IS MY SOUL DESIRE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>GRANDMA IVA BUSHNELL</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grandma was such a sweet tiny little lady.  Her back was
humped over.  I'm sure she had scoliosis like my mother and I have inherited. 
She probably also had osteoporosis like my mother has.  Grandma didn't go to
chiropractors (not sure if they had them at that time) so her back hurt most of
the time.   She was a hard worker.  She enjoyed working in her garden and
flower garden.  She raised seven children.  She didn't have the modern
conveniences we have today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma worried a lot, so I think her nerves
caused a lot of her health problems.  She also had numb spells where her arms
and other parts of her body would go numb at times.  The doctors couldn't find
out what caused them.  Since I go to Chiropractors, I wonder if she had pinched
nerves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We always figured grandma would die first
because of her bad health. Because Grandma had a lot of health problems, she
had to take tea as one of her medications.  She argued with the doctor about
taking it - as she said it would make her break the Word of Wisdom.  Grandma was
very active and faithful in the church and she had always kept the Word of
Wisdom.  The doctor told her she could take pills instead, but they wouldn't do
her near as much good, and they would have the same nutrients in that tea did -
that tea was a medication.  She did finally consent to take it, but she
wouldn't put any sugar or milk in it.  She told us that if it had to be a
medication, it would have to taste like it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Grandma moved from Meadow to Sunset, she
had long hair and she wore it in a braid which she wrapped around the back of
her head.  She let me brush her hair and even braid it as I got older.  She
finally got it cut off and she looked really nice with her short haircut and
perm.  I had a talent of fixing hair so many times when I was a teenager and
young married and lived close by, I would wash and set her hair and comb it out
for her.  Many times, she would ask me to straighten it so it would still look
nice when she was going someplace or having company.  I did the same for Mom, however,
Mom had a hairdresser and had it washed and set every two weeks, so she would
have me straighten it during that time.  If Marie couldn’t take her or she was
ill and had to cancel, she would have me do it.  Later when we moved back to Utah
and were living in Sunset or Layton, I would cut dad’s hair.  He would say
afterwards “Do I look 10 years younger?”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma loved her family and enjoyed her
grandchildren.  We loved going to her house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma Bushnell had a very hard time after
Grandpa died.  She had so many things wrong with her health and she worried so
much that she went downhill very rapidly.  In October of 1964 she passed away. 
The doctors had thought she had pernisha Anemia.  Her blood was very low and
due to this she would faint easily, was very weak, and felt lousy.  Finally,
they put her in the hospital.  They took tests &amp; X-rays and found she had
cancer.  They hadn't found it before as the shadow of her heart covered the
tumor.  At that time Bryce was down at B.Y.U. for his three months schooling in
the Spanish language prior to leaving for his mission to Uruguay.  He phoned Mom and told her that since his plane would be leaving at 6:00 a.m. on
Tuesday morning they had received permission (all the missionaries leaving for
Uruguay) to have their parents and families come down to the Y on Monday
afternoon and visit with them.  When Grandma heard this, she started to get
better for she loved Bryce so very much (he was her favorite) He loved grandma
and had always teased her and gotten extra close to her.  She wanted to go down
with us to see Bryce before he left.  She did get better, at least enough to be
able to go with us.  Julie, Bryce's girlfriend, went down also with us.  We had
a wonderful time being with Bryce and seeing him off the next morning.  <b>One
thing I regret</b> was that Grandma had asked me if, when we were at the park
before Bryce came, would I straighten her hair as it didn’t look very good with
being in the hospital.  I told her I would, but I forgot.  She mentioned to Mom
after we had gone home, that she wished I would have fixed her hair so that she
could have looked nice.  The next day Grandma was back in the hospital and she
continually got worse.  Mom, Aunt Joy, and myself took turns staying with
Grandma.  <b>Another regret</b> was the morning that Grandma passed away, I had
stayed with her from 6:00 in the morning until 10:00.
Grandma was very sick and had pneumonia.  She was in an oxygen tent.  She could
hardly breathe and was so miserable.  At one time, she asked me if I would ask
the nurse if she could have some more pain medication.  I found the nurse and
asked her, and she was rude and said “Oh, these old people, they just think
they can be waited on all the time and have whatever they want.  No, she can’t
have any more pain medication at this time.”  I felt bad, but didn’t stand up
to her like I wish I had.  When I told Grandma, she just sighed and looked sad
and miserable.  I don’t know why they couldn’t have given her more to make her
more comfortable as she was dying.  I get angry at that nurse whenever I think
of the last days with Grandma.  Sister Blaine, a friend and neighbor, came to
relieve me. I went home never to see grandma again in this life.  I had just
gotten home when the nurse called and said Grandma was worse and for me to come
up.  By the time I got there she had died.  I thought they had called Mom, but
they hadn't so I had to call her and break the news.  When Grandma's body was
in the casket, Mom &amp; I didn't like the way they had fixed her hair - it didn't
look like her, so Mom asked me to straighten it, which I did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved her very much and I have surely missed
her.  We have all missed her, especially Mom.  They lived next door, so Mom
&amp; Grandma did a lot together.  They were very good friends.  Georgia
had been spending the nights (sleeping there with her) so Grandma wouldn't be
alone at night as Grandma was frightened of the dark, so Georgia
was surely saddened.  Bryce, when he found out, was very sad.  He said he had
surely hoped that she would still be alive when he returned home and that had
been Grandma's wish that she could be alive to see Bryce when he returned from
his mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            From Grandma's obituary: Sunset - Mrs. Iva Bell
Swallow Bushnell, 70 of 1741 N. Main, died Thursday in the Dee Hospital in
Ogden of natural causes.  Mrs. Bushnell was born Aug.
 6, 1894, in Meadow, Ut, a daughter of Charles &amp; Isabell Deardon Swallow. 
She was married to George L. Bushnell on Sept.
 29, 1915, in the Manti Temple.  He died Dec.
 29, 1962.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            She came to Sunset 23 years ago from Meadow.  A
member of the LDS Church, she worked in the Primary and had been a Relief
Society visiting teacher.  She was active in Daughters of Utah Pioneers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Surviving are four sons, Howard Elmo Bushnell,
Henrieville, Utah, Dean Charles Bushnell, El Cajon, Calif.; George Junior
Bushnell, Bountiful, Van Ladd Bushnell, Cedar City, two daughters, Mrs. Glendon
(Mildred Hope) Porter, Sunset, Mrs. John C. (Elaine)(goes by Joy to family)
Ashman, Fillmore, 24 grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, 4 brothers &amp; 5
sisters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I REMEMBER -</b> grandma praising me for the
way I have frosted and decorated cakes after Ken &amp; I were married.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma asked me to wash down her kitchen walls
and ceiling and she paid me $5.00.  She had wallpaper on the front room walls
so when I cleaned them I would use a cake of cleaner to do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma was a good cook and a good housekeeper. 
She gave us grandchildren pie, cake or cookies many times when we would go over
to her house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Several times when Mom &amp; I were planning to
go shopping in Ogden for clothes, etc., Mom would ask Grandma if she felt like
going with us and she would say &quot;Oh, you and Mae just need to be by
yourselves, you don't need me tagging along&quot;.  I told her that if she felt
like it, we wanted her along - that it made it more special, which it did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I would invite Mom, Dad &amp; family over
for Sunday dinner or Family Night, etc., I'd also invite Grandma as Grandpa had
passed away and she'd say &quot;Oh, you don't have to feel that you need to
invite me every time.&quot;  But we enjoyed having Grandma.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember listening to Grandma &amp; Grandpa's
old records on their old record player.  I enjoyed that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Christmas morning was also special as we'd go
over to Grandpa and Grandma's and they would always have something for us.  Not
a lot as they didn't have much money, but that didn't matter.  We always
appreciated what they gave us and the love that went with it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma &amp; Grandpa loved going to parades -
so our family always went to the 24th of July Parade in Ogden every year.  We
would park the car and walk carrying our lawn chairs and blankets.  I looked
forward to that and being together.  Ken doesn't like parades - so our family
hasn't gone to many.  I remember taking Jeff to one in Layton when he was
young.  And last year (1997) Ken &amp; I took our grandchildren, David &amp;
Tayler, to the Layton parade.  Ken was sweet and knew I would like to go - so suggested
we take them.  I was delighted and really enjoyed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have some regrets of those last few days with
Grandma.  One was when we went down to see Bryce, she had asked if I would comb
her hair to make it look nice to see Bryce.  I fixed Grandma's hair much of the
time for her.  I guess that is one of my talents as I have always been able to
fix my hair the way I like and set and comb out, and recomb both Grandma
Bushnell's hair and my mothers.  I have been happy to be able to do this
service for them.  Anyway, at this particular time, I forgot to comb her hair
for her.  She had asked me when she got into the car to go down to Provo. 
I intended to comb it as soon as we got there, but I was excited to see Bryce
and we all got to talking, then went to a park and had lunch, etc.  Grandma
told Mom later that she felt bad I hadn't combed it as she sure didn't look
very pretty with lying in a hospital bed and she wanted to look nice for Bryce
and everyone.  I wish she had reminded me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The other regret was just a few days before she
passed away, Grandma had phenomena as well as cancer, which at that time they
thought she had Pernisha Anemia and were treating her for that. She was having
such a hard time breathing that they had her in an oxygen tent.  She was so
miserable and in so much pain that she asked me if I would ask the nurse if she
could have some more pain medication.  I went to find the nurse, but this nurse
was annoyed and said that she didn't need it, that old people like her just
complain and want lots of attention.  I should have known better because
Grandma was such a sweet little woman and she didn't complain.  She was really
bad before she would ever say anything.  Many times, when she was really sick
or in pain and we would ask her how she was, she would say &quot;oh, pretty
good&quot;.  Anyway, I told grandma that the nurse said she didn't need any. 
That hurt Grandma that the nurse felt that way, and that I didn't do anything
more to try to get help &amp; relief for her.  I remember thinking that maybe
the nurse was right.  I've felt like kicking myself many times since then -
that I felt that way and that I didn't do more when she needed me.  I know now
that she really was terribly sick and in so much pain.  She was dying so it
sure wouldn’t have hurt to give her more pain medication, even if it wasn’t
time.  They came to weigh her a little later and I hated to see them have to
pick her up and put her on the scales, she was too miserable and so thin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Grandpa &amp; Grandma Bushnell</b> lived in Meadow until after
we built on the upstairs of our home in Sunset.  Then they sold out and my
parents talked them into moving up and purchasing the lot next to our home. 
While their home was being built, they rented an apartment about a block away
on the highway which a Mr. Randall owned, and then they moved into our basement
for awhile.  It was great having my grandparents so close.</p>

hspace=12 alt="Byron Porter 2">I remember Grandpa as being a short, quiet, gray
haired man with a mustache.  I have heard, and his own autobiography states
that he believes his growth was stunted because of too much really hard work.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved going to Grandpa &amp; Grandmas as they
had a farm up in Richfield (southwest of Morgan) Grandpa would let us ride Old
Doll or Old Dan, his work horses.  They were really big.  One 4th of July when
my cousin, Joanne, and I were riding one of these horses, Hal lit a firecracker
and threw it under the horse.  Of course, it started running and bucking and we
were thrown off, but not seriously hurt, thank goodness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Grandpa coming in the house at night
after his days work on the farm, and all of us sitting down at the table to eat
supper which usually consisted of bread and milk, fruit, jam and honey, etc. 
We children preferred crumbs and milk, partly because it was fun grinding the
hard bread into crumbs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandpa was a scriptorium.  He loved the
scriptures.  He read and pondered them a lot.  Dad said that Grandpa wasn't a
very good farmer and partly because his mind wasn't on it.  Instead of thinking
what he could do to improve the farm, while he worked, he would be thinking and
pondering the scriptures.  He wrote lots of poetry and one was &quot;Morning
Glory of the Soul&quot; which he thought of while he was weeding the Morning
Glory weed out of his farm.  Dad said that people came from all around to talk
to Grandpa about the scriptures - as he knew them so well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Grandpa and Grandma Porter going on
some trips or just for a ride with us sometimes, and we loved having them with
us.  It made it more special to have them along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

the blue Byron Porter Descendants book, which I was blessed to compile)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Grandma for her love of reading, her
ability to memorize and give talks, readings, poetry, scriptures, etc. 
Whenever we played church games such as &quot;Seek&quot; or &quot;Zion&quot; with her, she always won because she knew the scriptures so well.  She loved to
have her family around her.  I enjoyed visiting with grandma, and she would get
out her scrap books and photo albums and enjoy showing them to me and
explaining each picture, card, newspaper clipping, etc.  I'm sure most of the
family members remember times of reminiscing with grandma with her books and
albums.  Perhaps I got my love of scrapbooks &amp; photo albums from her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Sandi was little, we'd go to visit
grandma.  She lived in one of my parent's duplex apartments at the time and
she'd always have a cookie or piece of candy for Sandi.  She wanted lots of
grandchildren and great grandchildren.  When I was just a young girl, I
remember grandma saying she would be glad when I got married and had some great
grandchildren for her.  I remember being mortified at even the thought of
marriage.  I didn't even like boys at that time of my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also remember how grandma hated to waste
anything.  While growing up, when grandma would help Mom and I clear up the
dishes after a meal, I was surprised at how she would clean out the dishes and
bowls so not a crumb was left.  These leftovers would be put in the
refrigerator to be sued at a later meal.  I'm sure she learned this because of
the scarcity of food and money to buy food while she was raising her family. 
She taught me how important it is not to waste and I'm trying to teach this to
my family.  I've heard someone say that some women throw out more with a
teaspoon than their husbands can bring home with a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grandma Porter passed away June
 4, 1965.  She has been very healthy all of her life.  These last few years her
eyesight and hearing were bad, but other than that and gas pains which kept her
from sleeping good at night, she felt fine.  This last Christmas she had a
slight stroke and then in April she had a bad stroke and was more or less in a
coma until she passed away in June.  She was put in the hospital at first, then
they put her in a nice nursing home, but Aunt Maurine wanted to have her there
in the apartment with her, so she could take care of her and be near her.  The
other members of the family were reluctant, but finally they consented, and
Grandma was with Aunt Maurene for about a month.  Aunt Maurine had studied to
become a nurse, years earlier, so she knew what to do for her.</p>
