<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chapter 56 – Year 2006</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2006 has been a good year for Ken and I. It has gone by
quickly</b>.  I had hoped to be more involved in Family History work, but so
far about all I have done in that area is take a class at the Family History
Center and have gone to a Family History Conference.  We have attended several
family reunions this year and we go to the temple as often as possible.   Ken
keeps busy doing repairs and remodeling jobs for family and friends, and when
it is out-of-town, he likes me to go with him.  I enjoy being with him and
enjoy being with those family members, so I have gone whenever I could.  Ken
really enjoys fishing, and I enjoy it too, so we have done some of that also.  <b>We
purchased a fishing boat this year</b>.   We mainly use it for trolling on
lakes such as Strawberry or East Canyon Reservoir.   Sometimes some of our
children and their families have gone with us and that has been fun.  We have
taken a couple of vacations and the money Ken has made, from the work he has
done, has helped with these. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Vacation at Lake Powell with Shellie, Roy &amp; Family.</b> 
We spent a week at Lake Powell the <b>summer of 2006</b> with our daughter,
Shellie, her husband Roy and their four sons – Garrett, Quint, Kevis &amp;
Jase.  We were on a house boat, we had our fishing boat and they had their ski
boat.  It was lots of fun.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Cruise with Mike &amp; Becky in November of 2006  </b><u><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Our first cruise.</span></u>  Our oldest son, Mike and
his wife, Becky, invited us to go with them on a Carnival cruise. It was out of
Long Beach, California and stopped at the ports of Catalina and Ensenada.  It
was fun and we had an enjoyable time being with Mike and Becky.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Zion Canyon – with Jeff, Gail &amp; little Benjamin in
October of 2006.  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>**For more on these vacations, see Chapter 55 – Vacations
&amp; Reunions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have a close family and spend as
much time together as we can.  It is great to be retired and able to enjoy
being with them more.  We love to be with them for birthdays, piano recitals,
ball games, choir and band concerts, Sunday dinners, camping trips, holidays,
family reunions, barbecues, etc., etc.  This was the main reason we sold our land
in Star Valley, Wyoming this summer, rather than build a home there.   It was
too far away from them.  All of our children, except Shellie who lives in
Chandler, Arizona, live within an hour radius from us.  Sandi, Nick and their
families live in Grantsville and the surrounding areas.  Mike, Becky &amp;
their four children live in American Fork.  David, Shauna &amp; their three
children live in the Morgan area.  Scott, Mishelle &amp; their two children
live in Layton and Jeff, Gail and little Benjamin live in South Weber.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Special Family events that occurred this year are: 
Our granddaughter, Chelci’s marriage to Steve Holste in the Salt Lake Temple in
March.  Jeff and Gail’s first child, Benjamin, was born the 19<sup>th</sup> of
June, on our 47th wedding anniversary.  Sandi was married to Nick Drake in
July.  Tyler, David &amp; Shauna’s son, was baptized and confirmed a member of
the Church by his father in November.  We now have 16 grandchildren &amp; 2
great-grandchildren.  From Sandi’s family, we also have 3 step grandchildren
and 5 step great grandchildren. (Terry’s son’s and grandchildren) We feel so
blessed and enjoy each member of our family</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Ken and I enjoy living in our cute basement apartment
in Bob &amp; Carroll’s home.  We enjoy Bob, Carroll and Mark.  Bob loves to cook
and bake and is often inviting us up to eat with them.  We had a wonderful
garden this year, thanks mainly to the efforts of Mark.  Ken and I enjoy
playing Canasta with Bob &amp; Carroll.  It’s usually the men against the
ladies and it’s about a 50/50 tossup on who wins.  We love our ward and enjoy
the positions we hold and the people we serve.  Ken is in the High Priest Group
Leadership and I serve in the Relief Society on the R.S. committee and host the
book group.  Several sisters come each month to my home and we have fun reading
and discussing the books we read.  We have read some good books by John
Bytheway, Sherrie Dew and other good LDS authors.  Both Ken and I are also called
and set apart substitute teachers for any of the organizations.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      We love each other, our family, the Lord and his
gospel and our many friends.  </p>
