BUSHNELL PORTER:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=136 height=218

alt="0099 Mildred (2)">            My mom was a good mother.  She loved her
husband and children very much.  Mom was a good cook and always fixed good,
nutritious meals. I loved the roast beef dinners on Sundays and the cakes with
fluffy icing.  I remember coming home from school to the smell of homemade
bread and was able to eat one or more slices of that good, hot bread.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved hearing mom whistle as she worked.  I
loved going to Samuel's sales with her where she always splurged and bought me
so many nice things.  (Samuel's was an expensive woman's clothes store in Ogden)
Many times she sacrificed for me, spending the money on me instead of her.  Mom
didn't learn to drive for several years and so I remember waiting across the
street at the bus stop and ridding the bus to Ogden to go shopping with Mom and
later Mom &amp; Grandma Bushnell.  That was great fun.  I remember as a child
thinking my mother walked so fast.  I could hardly keep up with her when we
would walk the sidewalks in downtown Ogden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom was a secretary and historian in the primary
organization, both in the ward and stake for several years while I was growing
up.  She loved the Primary organization.  She also taught the Beehive girls in
MIA.  I'm sure she had other positions too, but I can't remember.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom never was a very good housekeeper.  She said
she never learned how - that since she was the oldest child, her mother had her
tend her younger brothers and sister while her mother cleaned the house and
performed the other household chores.  Grandma Bushnell was a very good
housekeeper.  Mom liked a clean house, but couldn’t seem it keep it that way
herself.  She didn’t put things away.  She would fix a meal and then leave many
of the items and dishes out that didn’t need to be put away in the
refrigerator.   When she would do the dishes, she would just wipe off the
cupboard around the items and other things.   I liked a clean house and
couldn’t stand the clutter.   I also think it was born into Georgia and I, like
it was Grandma Bushnell, to like a clean home and be able to keep it that
way.   Many times, when Mom went somewhere for a couple of hours or more, I
would hurry and clean the house to surprise her.  When she came home, she would
walk in, look around and say, &quot;I must be in the wrong house, this doesn't
look like my house, it's too clean&quot;.  I would smile, and she would
compliment and praise me for cleaning it so good.  That was reward enough for
me (Good physiology on Mom's part) However, I didn't think it was fair, when I
was growing up, that I had to do so much homework and the boys didn't.  They
would get things out and not put them away either, so I would get frustrated that
the house wouldn't stay clean.  Mom and I would clean thoroughly every
Saturday, but during the week it would go right back to lots of clutter.  Mom
would usually have me clean the kitchen as well as help clean the rest of the
house. We would change the furniture around many times on Saturdays and I liked
that.  In the summer, I usually went outside, picked a bouquet of flowers and
put them in a vase in the front room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember many times when we saw a car pull up
in the drive-way or in front of the house, we would all hurry (at least mom
&amp; I) and gather up things in the front room and put them in other rooms,
etc., so the front room wouldn't be such a mess when they came to the door.  I
remember throwing things behind the couch, etc., as we didn't have much time. 
Maybe that's why I became such a &quot;fast&quot; house cleaner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was hard on me growing up to have our house
such a mess most of the time.  It didn't matter how much I tried to keep the
house clean, I couldn't stay on top of it as the boys didn't care and left
their toys, books, papers, food dishes &amp; wrappers, etc., etc., all over
everywhere.  I was embarrassed to bring my friends home from school.  Georgia says it was hard for her with this problem - growing up also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I had dates, I cleaned and told the boys
they were not to mess up the front room until after I left with my date.  One
night Mom went with me to a mother and daughter party for the MIA.  My brothers
were home and supposed to tend Georgia &amp; Kim.  Kim was in diapers.  When I
got home they told me that some of my friends (boys) had come to see me.  When
I saw the mess and the dirty diaper on the front room floor, I was horrified
and embarrassed and really upset with Hal and Bryce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One night when a &quot;special&quot; date was
coming, I cleaned and then kept picking up after the boys.  Mom finally became
upset with me, took me by the shoulders, sat me on the couch and told me to
stay there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken said he thought my Mom was a good
housekeeper until after we were married because the house was always clean when
he came to see me or take me on a date.  His mother was an immaculate
housekeeper - too immaculate - so he said he probably wouldn't have kept dating
me if he had seen the house messy and dirty because he knew the saying -
&quot;Like Mother, Like Daughter&quot;.  I hope I am like my mother in many
other ways, however, as she has many virtues and not many faults and
weaknesses.  None of us are perfect; I know I'm certainly not.  Dad realized
this later in life too.  He always loved Mom very much, but it did bother him
about her housekeeping and &quot;hording&quot;.  Mom said that since she lived
through the depression, she can't stand to throw anything out because the day
will come when her children and grandchildren may need the clothes to make them
over for the children, they will need the bedding, the food, etc., etc., and
that may be, but it is a phobia with her.  Ken's mom lived through the
depression too, and really had a hard time - maybe more so than my mother, but
she is so different - she throws too much away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Mom was gone to get her hair done, etc.,
and I would stop by, Dad was sometimes frustrated and upset and would show me
all the closets and rooms that were full to the brim because she keeps buying
things and won't throw anything out or give to the Deseret Industries.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad finally said years later &quot;She is such a
wonderful woman and I can't expect her to be perfect.  She loves me and is a
wonderful wife and mother - so I will just have to overlook her
housekeeping&quot;.  I was proud of dad for this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Even though Mom wasn't a good housekeeper, she
was a hard worker.  I think now that Mom probably didn’t have the energy as she
had Rheumatic Fever when she was a young girl and that damaged her heart.  During
the spring we usually planted a garden.  We kids helped her weed it.  She had
raspberries, strawberries and currents that we made jam out of.  I didn't like
picking the currents as it took so long to get very many since they were so
small.  We also had fruit trees.  So, we were busy in the spring, summer and
fall, gardening, harvesting and canning the fruit and vegetables.  Mom put
bushels and bushels of fruit &amp; vegetables up each year.  I disliked doing
it as it took so long and made such a mess of the kitchen, but I'm glad I
learned how to do it and the value of doing it.  I have proceeded to do these
things throughout my life also, and Ken &amp; I have taught our children as we
had them help us as they were growing up.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I enjoy gardening and working in the yard.  I
love to see things grow - I love nature.  Not many young people do gardening
and canning these days because it is so easy to buy it at the store.  I do
worry that the time will come when they will need to know these skills and be
able to do them to feed their families.  Our married children are gardening and
canning, and I am thankful they are. (At least the ones who can) I was talking
with Shellie recently (May 1998) and she said she likes to go out each day and
look at her tomato plants to see how much they have grown and also her orange
&amp; grapefruit trees.  She said she will be glad to get the rest of her
garden in, so she can watch it also.  Sandi showed me her garden while we were
out there last weekend and it looks so good.  She has had a garden practically
since she was first married.  Mike &amp; Becky also have a garden.  David &amp;
Shauna are just buying a home and David said he will be glad when he can have
an orchard &amp; garden.  Looks like it paid off to have our children help with
gardening, canning, etc., while they were growing up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Back to Mom</b> - she mended clothes and
socks, and always kept herself busy.  She liked to read also - so at night her
and dad usually read when they were not at meetings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mom took me to Samuels sales (Samuels was a nice, but
expensive store, but when they had sales, you saved a lot of money on clothe.)
and bought me beautiful clothes, when I was a teenager.  I knew she was
sacrificing other things for me, and I loved her for it and I loved the
beautiful clothes she bought me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(For more information on Mom, refer to the Blue &quot;Byron
Porter Family Descendants&quot; book or information in the &quot;Parents&quot;
section of this history)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I feel very fortunate to have been raised by
wonderful parents who loved their children and taught the gospel to us and set
a wonderful example for us by living it.  I also feel fortunate to have lived
close to my <b>grandparents</b> as I was growing up.  They were also wonderful
people who loved and lived the gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grandpa Bushnell would come over each Sunday morning and
give us kids a “Sunday nickel”.  We thought that was great because we didn’t
get an allowance, but this was some money to buy a treat.  In those days you
could buy two pieces of candy for a penny, a nickel would buy a candy bar, a
Popsicle, ice cream on a stick or two nickels would buy a pop.  We had a little
store/gas station across the street from the church on the north corner.  It wasn’t
very far since we lived right next to the church.  Grandpa would take us, on
another day, to spend our nickel many times. Grandpa had a beautiful tenor
voice.  He and Grandma grew up in Meadow and so even though he had moved to
Sunset, people kept asking him to come and sing at their important events,
weddings, funerals, etc., in Meadow, Fillmore and the surrounding areas. 
Because of Grandma’s health and I think because she was shy, and she said she
had too much to do to go (Cleaning, laundry, ironing, etc.), she didn’t go with
him, so he took one of us children with him.  He always stopped in Nephi and
bought us hamburgers and shakes.  Sometimes just a shake, but that was good
enough and I loved traveling too.  My mother couldn’t understand grandma not
going with Grandpa and, so she made up her mind that whenever my dad wanted her
to go someplace with him, she would drop everything and go.  She left a dirty
house, etc.  She said she loved dad and wanted to be with him, which is great,
but I wanted a happy medium.  I didn’t like leaving if my dishes weren’t done
and the house wasn’t clean as I didn’t want to come home to a dirty home, etc. 
Grandpa sang at Kens and my wedding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>LETTER I WROTE MOM ON MAY 22, 1987</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dear Mom,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for being such a wonderful mother.  I
know you’ve always worried about your weight (mainly your stomach) but you
didn’t need to, as you have always been beautiful – and such a great example to
follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I know I’ve told you before, but thanks for the
many things you’ve done for me and my family throughout my life, to show you
care.  The statements you’d make like “Oh, this house is too clean, I must be
in the wrong house” after I’d clean the house while you were away, or “You’ll
never know how I appreciate you until you have a daughter of your own.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for always supporting me – going to my
“Dear to my Heart” nights, etc., while I was in M.I.A., encouraging me to get
my “Golden Gleaner” award, coming to our children’s blessings, baptisms, talks,
etc., encouraging the boys to get their “Eagle” awards, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember, as a young girl, riding the bus with
you to go shopping in Ogden, running to keep up with you, as you could walk so
fast, getting cute clothes at Samuel’s sales &amp; other sales, etc. That was
great!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved to hear you whistle or sing as you
worked around the house.  I loved coming home from school to the smell of fresh
homemade bread.  I loved hearing you and Dad sing as we’d come home from Morgan
or other places.  My children say the same thing to us, as Ken and I used to
sing those same songs that we learned from you, as we’d travel with our
children.  And Shellie was saying, not long ago, when I was rocking Chelci and
singing “This Little Piggy Went to Market” that she remembered me rocking and
singing those songs to her.  Of course, I did the other children too.  I
learned them when you sang them to me when I had earaches as a young child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for pampering me and being so sweet
whenever I’ve been ill.  It meant a lot.  Thanks for caring enough to call just
about each morning (when it wasn’t long distance) to see how we were, for
always calling me and my family on their birthdays. We look forward to that
call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for all the ice cream cones and goodies
as we’d go places together.  I’ve enjoyed being with you and I’m happy that you
want me with you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks, especially, this past year for all the
encouragement, support, both financial and otherwise, help fixing meals, making
bread, helping the children with their homework, etc., letting us use your car,
(I know you loved to drive that car, so it was really a sacrifice for you and I
love you so much for it).  I’m not sure I’d have made it through that difficult
time if it hadn’t been for you and Dad and the Lord.  Thanks so much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for all the Sunday dinners, and other
meals as well as the many snacks.  You’ve always been such an example of loving
and caring for your family and others.  I hope I’m worthy of your love.  You’re
so “special”, Mom, and I love you so very much.          Mae</p>
