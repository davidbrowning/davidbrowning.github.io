<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 56 – Vacations and
reunions</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Family vacation at Shellie &amp; Roys in July of 2005 –
We celebrated the 4<sup>th</sup> of July there.  </b>All our family, except
Scott &amp; his family went to Shellie &amp; Roy’s in July of 2005.  Shellie
had wonderful things planned and we all got along so well and helped one
another and it was a grand time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We all were assigned a couple of
meals to fix.  We gave Shellie our menu and she bought all the groceries and
snacks, but each family fixed the meal they were assigned and cleaned up
after.  We were there for the 4<sup>th</sup> of July, so Shellie had bought
cloth bags, toys, candy, cups, handkerchiefs, etc. for each child.  The parents
paid her back.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie had decorations so when the
children woke up and saw their bags, it was almost like Christmas.  They loved
it.  We tie-dyed shirts, went swimming in their pool, even watched movies in
their pool at night while lying on air mattresses.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We went to the lake and went water
skiing a couple of times.  We went out to eat twice – once to the Organ
Grinder’s Pizza place.  That was fun for everyone.  We did lots of things and
Shellie &amp; Roy were wonderful hosts.  We all had a great time.  In fact,
when David asked his children where they wanted to go for their family vacation
the next year – Disneyland, to a beach, etc., they wanted to go back to Aunt
Shellie’s. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             When Ken and I were driving home, we stopped at
<b>Cove Fort, </b>as we hadn’t been there before.  The church owns it and they
have senior full-time missionaries who are dressed up in the pioneer costumes
and take you through a tour of the fort and tell you all about it - why it was
built, what the pioneers did there, etc.  It was very interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Anchorage Alaska to Terry &amp; Angela’s in July</b><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> 2005</span> – </b>I had never been up to Terry &amp;
Angela’s even though Ken and all my siblings had.  Terry told us that and asked
when we could come.  It happened that we could go that year, so Ken said we
better go.  We got back from our mission in February 2005 and left for
Anchorage in July.  It was so beautiful and green.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Terry was so cute, he picked us up
at the airport with Jaben and took us places on the way to his home.  Angela
had hurt her back and was in a lot of pain, so felt bad that she couldn’t go. 
Because of this, she couldn’t go the first few days as Terry took us to see the
sights.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken wanted to go fishing, so David,
Terry’s son, took him one day, but they didn’t catch anything which was
unusual.  They did see several bears in and around the river.  He went another
day with Jared, but again they didn’t catch anything.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken &amp; I went on a day cruise,
which was wonderful.  We saw whales, sea lions and practically all ocean
wildlife.  The captain told us all about everything.  We saw beautiful
glaciers, had wonderful meals – everything was great.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken went with a friend, who we saw
at church and who was visiting relatives, on a Halibut and Salmon boat and
caught both.  He had them quick frozen, packaged and sent home to us.  It was
quite expensive, but worth it – at least this once.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Terry, Angela and their family took
us to the ocean and park for a picnic, to their stake camp where we went
canoeing on the lake, had a picnic, etc.  Terry, Angela, Ken &amp; I went on a
session at the Anchorage Temple.  Terry is a temple worker there and loves it. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I went with Angela and her two
daughters-in-laws to a flea market where we had fun shopping.  We played games
at night, their son’s and families came over several times and we ate, visited
and played games.  We loved being with them and their special family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jaben was cute.  He is “Down
Syndrome”, can’t talk, so just make sounds, but holds out his hand to do a
“high five”, shake hands or hold your hand.  He is cute and affectionate.  He
was about 19 at this time.  He is short and stocky, and a challenge for Terry,
Angela and their family, but they all love him very much.  Terry &amp; Angela
were great hosts and we had a fabulous two weeks with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>In October, 2005, Shellie and
the boys came up in 2005 to visit and spend time with us and the rest of our
family.</b>  Roy couldn’t come as he needed to work.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie wanted to take the boys and
go to <b>“Martin’s Cove”</b> where Roy’s parents, Veldon &amp; Patsy, were
serving a six-month (summer) mission there.  Shellie wondered if Ken and I
could go with them, and we were excited to go.  We stayed the night with Patsy
&amp; Veldon’s neighbor and Shellie and the boys stayed with Patsy &amp; Veldon
in their RV. They have to have RV’s to stay in with these service missions.  We
had a great time, although it was cold and windy.  The visitors center was
wonderful and <b>we saw my great grandfather, Lyman Wight’s name on the list of
those who went to rescue the handcart saints, who were stranded here in Wyoming
in the terrible cold, snow and wind of winter</b>.  How any of them survived is
a miracle.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>They had handcarts there that we
could pull each other in.  Veldon took us in his outdoor vehicle to the spot
that they call “Martin’s Cove” where the saints were trying to get by the hills
to get out of the terrible cold.  We saw many other sights there and enjoyed
the time with Shellie and our grandsons.  Also, with Patsy &amp; Veldon, as
they are good friends. </p>

Shellie, Roy &amp; Family.</b>  We spent a week at Lake Powell the <b>summer of
2006</b> with our daughter, Shellie, her husband Roy and their four sons –
Garrett, Quint, Kevis &amp; Jase.  We were on a house boat, we had our fishing
boat and they had their ski boat.  It was lots of fun.   </a>We took turns
fixing the meals.  It was hot so we were in the water a lot.  I helped the boys
make sand castles and rivers and motes around the castles, on the beach where
we were docked.  The older grandsons walked over to the other side of the cove
and jumped off the rocks and cliffs into the water.  They had a fun time, but I
was glad when they were finished and came back safely.  I’m sure Shellie was
also.  We played games whenever we were not in the boats, fixing meals or
eating.  Ken and I had a great time fishing, one day, as the special kind of
fish there, Silverfish?? were on the hook the minute it hit the water.  We
caught lots of fish and they were large.  Many times, both of us would catch
one at the same time.  Our kids went in together and had bought Ken a beautiful
new fishing pole &amp; reel for his birthday that year.  Ken laid it down to
take a picture of me with my fish.  When he went to pick up his pole, it was
gone.  A fish had bit at his hook and took off with his pole.  He was sick
about that.  We tried to find it by using my pole, but couldn’t.  The owner of
the boat drove the house boat, and he was fun to be with too.  He kept to
himself a lot of the time so he wouldn’t intrude on our privacy</p>

his wife, Becky, invited us to go with them on a Carnival cruise. It was out of
Long Beach, California and stopped at the ports of Catalina and Ensenada.  It
was fun and we had an enjoyable time being with Mike and Becky.   We drove down
together and stayed at a motel in Los Angeles, and then a shuttle took us to
the ship the next morning and came to get us when our ship landed and the cruse
was over.  Ken &amp; I went on a Glass Bottom Boat tour in Catalina where you
could see and feed beautiful fish.  We also went on a city bus tour and stopped
at interesting spots along the way.  Mike &amp; Becky went snorkeling.  At
Ensenada, we went to the Blow Hole where the ocean water blows up at various
times.  We walked through lots of sidewalk shops along the way.  On the ship we
swam in the pool and sunbathed, played games, ate lots of wonderful food,
watched good entertainment at night, one was a magician. All in all, we had a grand,
relaxing time.</p>

Canyon in October of<b> 2006</b> and they asked if we would go with them.  We
had our tent trailer and it would easily fit all of us.  We pulled the tent
trailer with our truck so we were able to take their sleeping bags, portable
crib &amp; stroller for Ben.  We had a great time and Benji was so cute and enjoyed
being in the stroller as we went on the shuttle bus and walked the trails.  We
took lots of pictures and have done each time we went.  This is Jeff’s favorite
place and he has come with his brothers and cousins to explore canyons by
climbing and repelling.  They had great times here too.  We ate together,
played games at night after getting Ben to sleep and Ken and I tended Ben while
Jeff &amp; Gail climbed Angels’ Landing.  It was beautiful there and we loved
it.  We camped one year at the RV Park in Springdale because it had showers and
we had a pretty site looking at the red mountains.  The other years we camped
at Watchman campground at Zion’s.  It has electric hookups, but no water or
sewer hookups so we had to fill our water tank in our tent trailer as we
entered the campground.  It was fun each time we went and soon we had little
Rachel and so they had a double stroller, then Ben was old enough to walk and
Matt was born and he was in the stroller with Rachel.  The last time in 2013,
all the three children were able to walk and probably out hiked their
grandmother and grandfather.  We would tend the children while Jeff &amp; Gail
took the hike to Eagle’s Landing.  I didn’t dare go there, but Ken went a
couple of times, and really enjoyed it.  One time he had been sick and I didn’t
think he should go, but he wanted to and did just fine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Cedar Breaks – coming home from
Zion’s in October of 2006 – </b>Ken and I decided to take a detour when we were
coming home from camping with Jeff, Gail &amp; little Ben for a week at Zion’s
Canyon. We wanted to go through Cedar Breaks as we hadn’t been there for
several years and it is so beautiful.  We stopped at the different lookouts and
enjoyed the beauty and took pictures.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><a name="_Hlk522481033">This
reminded me of several years ago when <b>dad</b> <b>wanted to go on a trip down
to Southern Utah and see Zion’s Canyon, and other places for the last time</b>. 
His health had been declining as he had an inherited disease “Anti Tripson
Deficiency” which is a lung disease.  Mom had told me that he really hoped
someone would take them there.  I went into his office /bedroom where he was
and told him that I was sure that Ken would agree that we could take he and mom
on that trip.  He got all excited and said they would pay for the gas.  The
next thing I knew was Mom calling me at home and saying: “Did you tell your dad
that we were going this coming weekend?”  I said “no” and she said well, he
thinks you did and he’s getting packed to go.  Ken and I didn’t want to
disappoint him so we did make arrangements to take them.  </a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had a wonderful time.  When we
were at Zion’s, dad didn’t have the energy to walk on any of the trails, but
they said for Ken and I to go and they would just wait there at the camp.  As
we were about to head for home, we asked if they would like to go see Cedar
Breaks too and they said they would.  Well, that was a mistake as it is too
high and the altitude was too hard on dad.  He couldn’t breathe well and so we
quickly went on home.  He kept declining until he had to be on oxygen 24/7.  We
felt bad that we had taken him up there.</p>

went on a tour to </b></a><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Israel </span>with
our daughter, Shellie, her husband, Roy, and 3 of their 4 sons.</b> <b>Roy’s
parents went also.</b>   Shellie had gone to Israel on the Travel Abroad
Program with BYU when she was in college 20 years ago.  It had always been her
dream to return with her husband and children.  This was the year.  Shellie
&amp; Roy’s oldest son, Garrett, will be 19 and go on a mission next year, so
they wanted to go now.  They took Quint &amp; Kevis too, but Jase was too young
to go.  They invited Ken &amp; I and Roy’s parents also.   It cost us $7,000. 
This was a hard decision to make as that is a lot of money and we are not
wealthy by any means, but Shellie kept telling us that it was an experience
that we would always remember and that we would be with them and probably never
have the opportunity again if we didn’t go now.  Most of the children were
supportive, but David was not.  He knew we didn’t have much money and thought
it was foolish for us to spend that kind of money on a vacation.  He even got
angry and it was very upsetting to me, but we went, and he apologized later and
we are glad we went.  It was a glorious 14 days on a wonderful tour where
everything was taken care of and we walked where the Savior walked and went
inside the Dome of the Rock, Garden of Gethsemane – all the wonderful places in
Jerusalem plus all over Israel – the Dead Sea, the River Jordan where Jesus was
baptized by John the Baptist, the Sea of Galilee, the place where David slew
Goliath, where Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried and King David, the walls
of Jericho, the place where Sampson and Delilah were, etc.  We ate foods we
have never heard of before, we had great hotels we stayed in.  Our tour guide
was excellent and we enjoyed every minute of it.  There were 34 on our
tour.&nbsp; There were 3 former mission presidents with their wives, Brother
Robert Whetton, who was recently released from the Seventy,&nbsp;and his wife,
and other former bishops and stake presidents and their wives - so we were with
a great group.&nbsp; Our guide, Brother Richard Barrett, had just retired from
40 years of teaching institute.&nbsp; He had taken 26 tours over to the Holy
Land and he had taught 3 years and been in the Administration of the Jerusalem
Center - so he was so knowledgeable and we learned so much from him<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was great being with our special, beautiful daughter, her
handsome husband and handsome sons and Roy’s parents, Veldon &amp; Patsy.  This
was in March of 2007.  Upon our return, Shellie took hers and our pictures and
put them together and made a scrapbook for us for Christmas.  We love it. </p>

summery of trip to Israel with Shellie, Roy &amp; sons in 2007</b>. (2<sup>nd</sup>
writing of this wonderful trip, so wanted to include it also.)   Ken and I
returned from Israel late on the 29th, so we still had jet lag.&nbsp; We sure
had a marvelous time in Israel.&nbsp; It was incredible.&nbsp; It's more
beautiful than we had imagined, and is such an interesting place.&nbsp; Our
guide was great, so we learned a lot.&nbsp; It was wonderful to walk where Jesus
walked, to be at the place when David slew Goliath, to be at Mt. Carmel where
Elisha challenged the priests of Baal to see which God would burn their
sacrifice, to be in Jericho and hear those stories we have heard since a youth,
but they meant so much more since we were there.&nbsp; I was able to ride a
camel, which was a fun experience.  We rode a gondola up to Masada and our
guide showed us around and told us all that went on there - much more than we
had heard before.&nbsp; We swam in the Sea of Galilee and rode in a boat (like
the boat Jesus and his disciples would have been in) over to Capernaum.&nbsp;
We watched people being baptized in the Jordan River where John the Baptist had
baptized people.&nbsp; We floated in the Dead Sea, and saw the caves where they
found the Dead Sea Scrolls.&nbsp; We saw King David's tomb.&nbsp; We were at
the place where Abraham rescued Lot from the kings.&nbsp; We were in Hebron and
at the sites where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried with their wives,
except Rachel who was buried in Bethlehem.&nbsp; We were in Nazareth
&amp;&nbsp;Bethlehem.&nbsp; We were in&nbsp;Bethany where Mary, Martha and<span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> </span>Lazareth lived and visited the
tomb&nbsp;where Lazareth was raised from the dead.&nbsp; We spent a week in
Jerusalem and that was fantastic.&nbsp; Besides visiting all the places where
Jesus walked and going to the Jerusalem Center for church and a tour, we bought
lots of souvenirs in the old city as well as other places.&nbsp; It was amazing
to see all the ruins and to realize that </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>several civilizations had built their cities on top of
others which&nbsp;had been&nbsp;destroyed.&nbsp; I could go on and go.&nbsp; We
are so glad we went.&nbsp; Before going on to Israel, we had a layover in <b>Frankford,
Germany</b> for an entire day, so the Barrett’s, our tour guides, had hired a
German lady tour guide to show us around.  One of the highlights was to see and
walk around the beautiful Frankford Temple. We also ate good food.  We were
glad that we had this opportunity to be in Germany also.  The picture above
shows some of the architectural and scenic beauty.</p>

hspace=12 alt="2008 Snowmobiling trip with Sandi &amp; Nick">Ken wanted to
celebrate his birthday at Lava and soak in the mineral tubs.&nbsp; He also
wanted to go snowmobiling so he checked around and found the best place to do
that was at Soda Springs in Idaho which is just 25 miles from Lava.&nbsp; Sandi
and Nick went with us and we had a great time.&nbsp; We spent one night&nbsp;at
Lava and one night at Soda Springs.&nbsp; The lodge was so fun there at Soda
Springs.&nbsp; It is a bed and breakfast.&nbsp; We were the only ones there at
that time, so it was really fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner&nbsp;gave us a&nbsp;super
deal since we were renting a double snowmobile for $120.00 and since we weren't
there on a weekend.&nbsp; He gave us 2 rooms for $40.00 ($20.00 for each
couple) and that included a wonderful breakfast of sausage, eggs, hash browns,
toast&nbsp;and orange juice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lodge&nbsp;had a large screen TV
with a DVD player, hot tub, fireplace, tables to play games, etc. plus 25 miles
of groomed snow mobile trails with lots of hills and valleys to play around
on.&nbsp; The four of us plan to go again next year, and we'd like to invite
any of the rest of you to go with us.&nbsp; We will stay the two nights at the
Lodge in Soda Springs rather than stay one night in Lava.&nbsp; They have
several snowmobiles to rent.&nbsp; If you rent a snowmobile, they furnish the
snowmobile outfits free.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had all of that for Wednesday
afternoon, Wednesday night and most of the day on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
only cost us&nbsp;$76.00 a couple, (we shared the cost of the snowmobile and
the rooms).&nbsp; &nbsp;Sandi said it was the most fun she has ever had
snowmobiling.&nbsp; This was the first time Nick has been snowmobiling and I
asked him if he liked it and he said he loved it.&nbsp; We all did.</p>

alt="Ken &amp; I with Jeff's family for Zion's vacation in 2014 with Sandi's family too"><b>Ken
and I went to Payson Lake to camp for a few days before going on down to Zion
Canyon where we would meet up with Jeff, Gail and family the last of September.</b> 
We were not at Payson Lake very long before the camp host came over and said
they got a report that a bad snow storm on was its way and that they were to
close the camp and get down off the mountain.  They said since we had already
paid, we could stay if we wanted to, but we might be stranded up there for a
while.  We didn’t dare chance it, so we left and it started snowing as we went
down the canyon so we were glad we had gone.  It snowed or rained most of the
way to Fillmore so we decided to stay in a motel there rather than in a KOA. 
We had a wonderful time with Jeff, Gail, Benjamin &amp; baby Rachel at Zion’s. 
In our tent trailer, there was room for all of us.  They put Rachel in their
little folding bed. They have a double stroller, so away we would go during the
day to enjoy the beautiful Zion’s National Park.  We were able to fold up the
stroller and with the help of all of us; we could get the stroller and children
into the shuttle bus and get off at the different sights or hikes.  We would
put the children to bed at night and play games.  The four of us love playing
games and coming to Zion’s. </p>

bacon &amp; eggs, in our back yard.  It had been a tradition to have Ken make
biscuits &amp; gravy for our family.  Everyone loves them.  We also go to <b>Lagoon</b>
for one day and sometimes get the “bounce back” ticket and go back the next
day.  I have gone with them most years and love being with this special family
and having fun with them on the rides, and enjoying the beauty of the flower
gardens and trees that are there.  Ken doesn’t love Lagoon, but sometimes would
come in the evening to have the picnic dinner with us and then walk around
pioneer village, have an ice cream cone and then go watch the good
entertainment that was there at that time.  Ken and I love having Shellie &amp;

hspace=12 alt=P1030643> <b><u>For several years I have purchased a
Grandmother’s yearly pass to Dinosaur Park in Ogden and enjoy taking the
grandchildren there throughout the year.</u>  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I started doing this when David and Taylor Paige
were young.  They were about 7 and 9 years old, I think.  I took all the
grandkids there usually at least once or twice a year.  I usually just took one
family’s children at a time, but as they got older, sometimes I would take
cousins.  In our Buicks, I could take 5 grandkids, but now in our Chev Impala,
I can only take four.  Most of these grandchildren love to go there, even when
they are teenagers. I mentioned that to Shauna, one day, and she said it was mainly
because they wanted to spend time with Grandma.  Her comment made my day.  I
love to be with our children too.  Ken went a couple of times with us, but he
was usually working or doing projects for us or other family or friends. 
Dinosaur Park is a fun place, especially for younger children.  They have a
great museum where all kinds of Dinosaur skeletons are displays on the main
floor and upstairs they have displays of all different kinds of rocks made into
jewelry or other items.  They also have an area upstairs where they have robot
dinosaurs that growl and move somewhat.  The children love this area.  Outside
is lots of paths which take you to different full-size manmade dinosaurs, they
growl too.  They also have a playground made up of manmade dinosaurs, etc. 
They have an area where you can dig for bones – actually use brushes to uncover
dinosaur bones and eggs.  Another area is where you overlook the pond and can
buy food to feed the large fish, ducks &amp; geese.  They have other hidden
paths, etc., etc.  It is a fun place.  I don’t know how many times I have been
there, but it is still fun, especially to watch the grandchildren having such a
good time.  We usually take our lunch and treats as there are picnic areas all
around.  They also have a gift shop and snack bar.  The gifts are too
expensive, but I usually buy the grandchildren a ice cream treat, just before
leaving to go home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We always have a <b>family Christmas party</b>, but last
year we also had our first <b>“Grandchildren’s Christmas party</b>”.  I got the
idea from Sister Hinckley’s book about her life (can’t remember the name of the
book).  I liked this idea so decided to try it.  The first year I also invited
our great grandchildren (Dawson, Kennedy, Emma, Jaden and Nathan)  This was
almost too many for me to handle, but I had Paige help me</p>

Nauvoo, Illinois and Kirkland, Ohio in July of 2008.  </b>Jeff had transferred
with his job to Greenville, Ohio when he and Gail separated.  Ken and I wanted
to go visit him there and he wanted us to come so we went in July of 2009.  We
have always wanted to go to the church history sites back there – Nauvoo,
Illinois and Kirkland, Ohio so we talked to Jeff about it and he said we could
use his car and he would just ride his bike back and forth to work.  We flew
into Cincinnati and Jeff met us at the airport and took us to his home that he
was renting.  It was an old home, but cute as it had a wrap-around porch with a
swing.  He had the upstairs apartment which consisted of a living room,
kitchen, two bedroom, bath and a screened in porch.  We enjoyed being there and
spending time with Jeff.  On the weekends, he would take us sightseeing.  It is
beautiful there with beautiful trees everywhere.  It is so lush and green.  They
don’t irrigate as they get plenty of rainfall.  He took us to beautiful parks,
one in particular I loved as you would walk down paths to a lake with trees,
shrubs and flowers everywhere.  It was more a wilderness park.  He took us to
the Annie Oakley Park where they tell all about her and have statues, etc.  He 
took us out to eat at one of his favorite restaurants which was in a great area
with trees, etc., all around.  Ken and I went to Sacrament Meeting at the
branch there both Sundays.  I fixed our meals and it was fun to cook in his
cute kitchen.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We arrived on Friday and on Monday Ken and I
left for Nauvoo.  Jeff let us use his car.  We had made <img width=257

align=left hspace=12 alt="2009-06-30 175">reservations at a cute motel in a
nearby town as it was much cheaper than staying in Nauvoo.  We loved Nauvoo. 
It was beautiful and there was so much to see and do.  Nothing cost money
there, except for your meals.  We went on a buggy ride all around the city
where a tour guide told us all about everything in the city.  It was great!  We
went on a covered wagon ride pulled by oxen and were told about the pioneers
and the oxen.  We walked down Parley Street or later it was called “The Street
of Tears” as that is where the Saints went as they were driven out of their
beautiful city in the dead of winter and had to cross the frozen river.  They
had to leave their beautiful homes and farms and their beautiful temple which
they had sacrificed so greatly to build and worked on it even knowing they
would be leaving it to mobs.  Many did get their endowments there before they
left as Brigham Young &amp; other members of the twelve stayed night and day to
give these ordinances to the members.  Ken and I went in museums and all the
homes where there were couple missionaries there to take us on tours of the
homes and in some they would demonstrate how they made rope, wax candles, spoon
cotton into yarn, silk worms, etc.  The mansion house was one of the homes we
toured, plus we toured the shops, and other businesses.  We also went to the
Nauvoo temple one day.  You had to get reservations way ahead to do this and so
we had done that before we left home.  We ate in fun restaurants and cafes. The
night programs were excellent – talent shows and plays.  The couple
missionaries and young missionaries put these on and they were wonderful, so
talented.  We missed the pageant by a couple of weeks, but most people want to
come at that time, so it wasn’t so crowded and that was great!  We enjoyed our
motel and going back and forth across the Missouri River and one day we watched
the huge gates come up and open so boats and ships could pass through.  That
was interesting.  Anyway, Ken and I had a wonderful five days in <img

hspace=12 alt="2009-06-30 222">            The following Monday, we left for
Kirtland to see the church history sites there.  We had already made
reservations at a nice hotel there.  We had phoned Maryon and Jim Frazier, our
good friends from when we lived in Arizona and who had moved to Springville,
Ohio, which isn’t far from Greenville.  They were planning to go to Kirtland
with us, but things came up and they weren’t able to, so we went to visit them
at their home.  They have a beautiful farm on top of a hill.  There are lots of
trees until you get to the top.  They have an old home, but it was still nice. 
Ken and I didn’t recognize Jim &amp; Maryon.  They were sitting outside on
their chairs waiting for us, but when we saw them, we thought we must be at the
wrong place so Ken went to ask them where the Fraziers lived.  As he approached
them, he finally recognized them as they called his name and walked out to
greet us.  Maryon has put on a lot of weight and of course, has gray hair now
and Jim has put on weight and is bald.  Their daughter, Malinda, and her four
children are living with them because Malinda’s husband is in prison for
sexually abusing their children.  She has divorced him, of course. They are
practically raising their adopted daughter’s daughter also as Pamela and her
husband work and they have Jim and Maryon tend their daughter and just don’t
come to get her after work.  Sometimes it is several days or weeks before they
come to see her or get her.  Wow! I don’t get why Jim &amp; Maryon are doing
this.  Anyway, we enjoyed being with them for most of a day and they took us to
different points of interest in Springfield.  Ken and I toured some of the
church history homes and sites in and around Kirtland, including the Kirtland
Temple.  I was excited to see it and walk through it.  It is owned by the
Reorganized Church, but was great to see it.  One day we went to see Lake Erie
and it was beautiful, it is so huge that it looked like the ocean.  It had
large waves come in onto the beach.  This was a wonderful vacation and we loved
being with our son as we have surely missed him.     </p>

one bathroom.  We can’t hold more than one family, during the winter, when we
have family dinners, but that’s okay as we get more time with that family. 
Once in a while, we invite two families but then we are crowded.  We love our
family and love to be together as often as we can.  Here is a picture of Mike

poles, so Ken put the fittings in the ground so we could just slip the poles
into them when our family would come for <b>family backyard parties and
barbecues.</b>  We had several each summer.  Our children and grandchildren
love to play volleyball so we played that at each family party.  I love to
watch them play.  Each family would bring their own meat and a side dish.  I
usually asked Becky if she could bring her delicious broccoli and bacon salad
as I love that and everyone else does also.  Mishelle makes wonderful rolls, so
she would bring rolls at times.  All our daughters and daughters-in-laws make
delicious food.  I usually made a potato salad and an Acini de pepe salad.  We
bought two “Lifetime” picnic tables, from a neighbor who worked at “Lifetime”
in Layton, and we have surely used them a lot and enjoyed them.  We also bought
two smaller picnic tables so our young grandchildren could sit at them.  Our
apartment wasn’t large enough to have all our family inside at one time, but in
the summer, it worked great.  In the winter, we would invite one or maybe two
families at a time for Sunday dinner or for special occasions.   </p>

plastic Easter eggs and put candy in some and money in some.  I would color
lots of boiled eggs also.  Sometimes some of our younger grandchildren would
come and help me color the eggs.  Ken and I would hide the younger
grandchildren’s eggs in the back yard and the older grandchildren’s eggs in the
far back of the property where we had our chicken coop, shed, rabbit pens and
large garden area.  I bought Easter baskets for them at the Dollar Store and
gave them a list of how many money eggs, candy eggs and boiled eggs each of
them could find and keep.  On the signal they would all run around to find
their eggs, it was so fun watching them and seeing the excitement on their
faces.  We would usually start the Easter Egg Hunt about 10 am and then we
would have a barbecue afterward, play volleyball and visit.  Good memories!</p>

suggested we go there together as he loves to fish like Ken does.  It turned
out that Chelci had her baby early (Nathan) and so Sandi needed to be with
Chelci and help her and the baby, but Nick went with us anyway and we got to
know him better this way.  He pulled our tent trailer and we pulled our boat. 
He helped us with everything and we had a great time fishing and caught lots of
fish, he likes to play games too so we played games at night.  We were glad he

October of 2009, we still have room for all of us in our tent trailer as Ben
&amp; Rachel could sleep on the bed when the table usually goes and we put up
the portable crib for Matt.  We loved it again this year and the children were
great!  Jeff &amp; Gail took a double stroller and Rachel and Matt rode in it
and Ben was old enough to walk on his own.  With the four adults, we could
manage the stroller and children on the shuttle buses and the trails.  The four

there, while living in Arizona. </p>

hspace=12 alt=P1040251>            The next day we left Veldon &amp; Patsy and
drove on to Jackson Wyoming and spent the night there in a great motel.  We all
ate dinner at a cute café and then Ken and the boys went back to the motel and
went swimming and in the hot tub.  Ken’s feet were hurting so he didn’t feel like
walking longer, but Shellie, Roy, Sandi and I walked down town and into the
shops.  Sandi, Shellie &amp; I bought a T shirt and we had fun being together. 
The next morning, we ate at a nice café and had a good breakfast, then went on
our way to<b> Flaming Gorge</b>.  We set up camp and then let everyone take our
boat and go boating while Ken and I fixed a Dutch Oven Dinner for all of us. 
They didn’t stay very long as it started to rain.  We enjoyed visiting and
singing around the campfire that night.</p>

them left us to go on their way to Durango Colorado where they spent another
couple of days.  Then they separated, and Sandi and Dawson left them and came
back home and Shellie, Roy and boys went on to their home in Arizona.  Ken and
I wanted to stay longer at Flaming Gorge, so we enjoyed camping there for a
couple more days.   Ken caught fish in the stream by where we camped, and we
took the boat and went fishing in the Gorge.  We had a great time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Another vacation was going to
Zion’s National Park again this year (2011) with Jeff, Gail &amp; kids,</b> we
went in September instead of October and it was way hot.  We had to go on the
trails during the morning hours and then play in the river in the afternoons. 
We were glad we had the river close by.   One of the things I remember about
this trip was when all of us hiked up the mountain trail on the other side of
the tunnel, we met three oriental men.  Don’t know if they were from Japan or
china.  They had expensive cameras and were taking pictures of all the
landscape.  When we arrived on top, they asked if they could take a picture of
us.  We agreed, but they wanted more and more pictures.  This made us a little
nervous.  We finally said we had to head back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We didn’t go to Zion’s in 2012 as Jeff started a new job and

<p class=MsoNormal><b>HAWAIIAN CRUSE WITH SANDI, SHELLIE &amp; ROY – December 1
– 17, 2012</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We got up at 3AM and got Sandi’s
luggage packed into the car.  When we finished the car was really loaded.  We
had six suite cases, each weighing about 50 pounds, plus the three of us.  We
left Tooele at 4:30AM with some winds.  We stopped at St. George for rather to
eat.  There were some winds but no storm.  Before getting into California we
saw snow on the high mountains, but the roads were good.  With the G.P.S. we
were able to travel right on to our motel in Long Beach.  At the motel, we went
out to soak in the hot tub and a swim in the pool, Roy and Shellie were late
leaving home and when they got to the California Border they were held up for 1
½ hours getting through the Border inspection.  It was 10PM when they got to
the motel.  We visited with them for a little while before we all went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We went in for breakfast, at the motel as breakfast came
with it.  It  was very good.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We got to the pier at 1PM but the
ship had been two hours late getting to the port, so they were late starting
the check in.  It was after 7PM when the ship left the dock.  We toured some of
the boat and then went to dinner.  Dinner was very good, and they sure are
trying to take care of us with Ken and my diet needs.  After dinner we went
exploring the ship.  It is quite a boat.  After leaving Roy and Shellie, Sandi,
Ken and I started for our room.  On the way we passed a dance hall, so <b>Ken
and I danced for a few minutes.</b>  <img width=186 height=247

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken woke shortly after 4AM and
mainly watched the ocean waves.  After the sky started to lighten he saw tuna
surfacing.  Sandi and I came to the port window and watched them with him.  The
waves are quite large and the ocean very rough.  It is interesting to walk
around with the ship swaying.  After a good breakfast, we attended a ballroom
dance class and really enjoyed that.  Sandi and I did some research of shore
activities.  When we came back, we went to the dance lessons.  We then had some
Suchi which was my first time.  We came back and got ready for dinner.  We met
Roy and Shellie at the Monarch room and played Mexican Train Dominos until
dinner time.  We stayed for a show <img width=346 height=259

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We didn’t have a lot of activity
except meals.  We watched the movie “The Man Called Peter” using our computer
and projector.  It makes it a little crowded with 5 of us in our room.  This
afternoon we attended a dance class.  We then came back and dressed in our best
for the dinner this evening.  We then went for pictures to be taken.  They had
many photographer’s taking many poses so that everyone had lots of chooses.  We
did have some time to dance in some of the Ball Rooms before going to dinner. 
This was the captain’s evening in the dining room.  He spoke for a minute, but we
really weren’t very impressed.  After dinner we attended Show Time and the Big
Band.  We were tired but when we went past the Club Cool room we couldn’t
resist going in and dancing until mid-night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and I went walking around the
ship as the weather was much warmer today.  It was fun walking all over the
upper decks.  The sun broke through the clouds and everyone was out sun
bathing.    We were able to use the swimming pool and they we quite warm.  
Sandi came and said that they wanted to play miniature golf, but I was tired,
so I went, and Ken took a nap.  An hour and a half later I came back and woke him. 
We went to a dance lesson but didn’t stay very long as it was basic Fox Trout
steps.  We looked at the pictures that were taken last night and picked some of
what we liked.    We came back to our cabin and watched the movie “The Ultimate
Gift” and we all enjoyed it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>(This is taken from Ken’s journal –
so he is writing this now).  This morning when I woke my pain level was up.  I
will have to be stricter with my diet.  After breakfast the five of us played
the game “Trans America” and quite enjoyed it.  Sandi and I attended the dance
class.  While we did that Mae went to our cabin and lay down for a while.  We
then went up to Roy and Shellie’s cabin and played “Mormon Bridge”.  After
getting started in the card game we attended the Magician show.  Following
dinner, we finished the card game we started earlier.  It was late when we were
ready to go to bed.</p>

hspace=12 alt="15 Ken &amp; Mae sunbathing on beach">We came into port about
10AM.  It was neat to see us come into the island.  Sandi, Mae and I took a bus
tour to the Hawaii Volcano National Park.  Roy and Shellie took a helicopter
tour of the Island.  On the way we stopped at the Mauna Loa Macadamias plant
and saw how they processed the Macadamia nuts.  We also bought some packages of
the nuts for gifts and to eat.  After returning we went to a show on board the
ship and then to dinner.  After dinner we came back to our room and the five of
us watched “Heaven Can Wait” which was a cute show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We arrived at Maui at 8AM and
disembarked shortly after in order to be on our tour by 10AM.   Sandi, Mae and
I rode the tour bus to the Sheraton Hotel where we walked through their
facilities to the beach.  It was a beautiful sandy beach where we enjoyed the
warm sun shine.  We also enjoyed snorkeling and seeing the many fish.  Back at
the ship, we then went to eat and then attended a Hawaiian dance show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This morning we were at the Island
of Oahu.  I woke with the pain level very high.  We went for breakfast and then
left for the tours.  Mae, Sandi and I went on a bus tour of Diamond Head.  Most
of the stops, I stayed on the bus because my feet and legs hurt too much to
walk very far.  The tour guide was very good and we did enjoy the trip.  I have
really watched what I have eaten today but tonight I’m still in a lot of pain. 
When we came back to the ship I got me some chicken to eat and went to the
cabin.  Mae and Sandi went shopping.  I took a nap.  Mae and Sandi had a lot of
fun shopping this afternoon.  This evening I watched a show on TV.  Mae and I
went to bed early.</p>

hspace=12 alt="31 Shellie, Mae &amp; Sandi in Hawaiian outfits 2">            This
morning we were on the Island of Kauai.  We set the alarm and was up at 6AM in
order to be ready for our shore excursion at Kauai.  Mae didn’t sleep very well
last night because she was worried about me.  I do feel much better today,
although my feet are still tender.  Roy and Shellie went four wheeling in the
mud.  Sandi, Mae and I went on the Waimea canyon &amp; Wailua river boat tour
to the Fern Grotto.  It was a very beautiful ride up the river and then when we
got up the canyon we docked and had a short walk up through beautiful jungle
trees and plants to a cave.  They only let us go to a view area because the
hurricane had damaged the cave and loosened the rocks above making it dangerous
to go further.  When we got there the tour was to show and teach some Hula but
it started to rain very hard.  Finally, when it broke they had everyone return
to the boat where they gave us the show.  It was good that they did because it
rained more.  This area has more rain than anywhere on the earth receiving over
400 inches annually.  It was a very worth wile experience.  When we returned
Mae and Sandi again went shopping.  I came back to the cabin and took a nap. 
This evening Roy, Shellie, Sandi, Mae and I went to the evening show, which was
a Juggler Entertainment.  We stopped for more photo shouts and went to dinner
and then quit for the night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Today we are on the Island of Hawaii, city of
Kona.  We had to get up early in order to be on time for our tour.  The weather
was very pleasant.   Sandi, Shellie and Roy went on a tour where they were able
to swim with wild dolphins.  They also saw a hump back whale.  Mae and I went
on a walking tour in the city.  My pain level is high, and my feet and legs
hurt.   For breakfasts I have been having scrambled eggs but as I finished
eating this morning it dawned on me that they probably are using powered eggs
mixed with water and milk.  That was kind of dumb on my part.  The tour was
very good but by the time it was over my pain level was high.  Mae and I set on
a bench and ate a boiled egg.  We were going to go through a museum when Sandi
called and said that they were back from their tour.  We waited for her to join
us.  I decided to return to the ship and let Mae and Sandi continue in town.  I
carried several items back with me so that they wouldn’t have to carry them
around town.  When I got back to the pier I met Roy and Shellie.  I also took
their snorkeling equipment back to the boat with me, so they wouldn’t have to
pack it with them.  After dropping the extra items off at our cabin, I then up
to the dining area and got something to eat.  I then came back to the cabin and
I fell asleep until Mae and Sandi came.  We departed Hawaii about 4PM.  As soon
as we got out to sea the seas seem to become quite rough.   We put on the DVD
movie “Golden Plates”.  It wasn’t finished when Shellie called just before
7PM.  She reminded us of this evening’s entertainment.  We paused the movie and
went up to the theater.  We were able to find Roy and Shellie there.  The show
was a musical and dance production that was very good.  After dinner we ended
up getting more pictures taken.  My pain level was high so I found a place to
just sit.  When Mae came we went downstairs to our cabin.  Sandi wasn’t much
longer coming to the cabin.  We watched the rest of the movie and really
enjoyed it.  Roy and Shellie came down to get their scuba gear and while they
were here I had Roy give me a Priesthood blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are back on the ship.   We slept in this
morning.  I slept fairly well although the pain level in my feet, legs and hips
is quite high.  I didn’t get up for breakfast, but Mae brought some breakfast
down to me.  Mae isn’t feeling very good this morning.  She seems to have some
congestion and a sore throat.  The sea is quite rough this morning.  The waves
are very interesting to me and I think of the earlier mariners, especially the
early Saints and also the scriptural accounts.  Our cabin boy “Katut” came in
to clean our room.  This afternoon we played some card games.  Mae is feeling
worse, but she did go to dinner.  My pain level is decreasing as the day goes
on.  We came back to our cabin after dinner and soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am feeling much better, but Mae is feeling
quite bad.  I went up and brought back breakfast for the two of us.  Sandi and
Shellie went running and later some sun broke through, so they went sun
tanning.  Mae and I watched a movie on DVD titled A Walk in the Clouds” that
was very good even though it was rated PG13.  Both Mae and I took a nap.  This
afternoon we watched another movie “The Blind Side” and that was very good. 
Roy, Shellie and Sandi came down and we played some games.  At dinner time Mae
still isn’t feeling well.  Sandi checked with the dining room and she was told
that they couldn’t take food out.  So, I went up to the 9<sup>th</sup> floor
and got us something.  We had just finished eating when our waiter from the
Dining Room brought our dinner to us.  They have treated us so good there.  I
put most of the food in the refrigerator for tomorrow.  Mae went to sleep after
eating but before she did I gave her a Priesthood Blessing.  I watched an old
John Wayne movie and finished this entry before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae was quite sick during the night with a high
fever.  This morning when she woke she felt some better.  I woke for a while,
but it was still dark.  I went back to bed and may have dosed a little.  When
we got up we decided to go up for breakfast and then go to the hot tub.  Sandi
and Shellie also came up for breakfast at the same time.  They had gone walking
at 6AM.  Roy decided to sleep in.  After eating, Mae and I went up to the
indoor spa and enjoyed it for a few minutes.  We came down to our cabin and lay
down.  Mae laid took a nap while I worked on the computer.  When Mae woke, we
watched the movie “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas”.  It was good but also
depressing.  I took a walk around the boat.  The sea is quite rough, and the
winds outside are strong.  This evening the five of us got together and played
games for a little while before getting ready for dinner.  Mae and I were
served a fish with tomato sauce on.  I was concerned about the sauce, so I
asked our waiter and he assured me that it had been made especially for us
without any sugar.  It was very good and probably the best tasting food we had
been served.  Mae wasn’t as happy with it as I because of the spices.  After
dinner we went to a dance where I danced with Sandi once and Mae once before we
went to the Pharoses Palace for this evening’s entertainment.  It was good as
far as performance, but for Mae and I it was too loud, lights to bright, and
costumes too revealing.  After the program ended Mae and I came to our cabin
and got ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are now in California’s time.  I woke at 4:30
and not being sleepy I took the camera and went up to the 9<sup>th</sup>
floor.  I fixed me a cup of hot herbal tea.  We found that using our protein
powder as a creamer with the tea makes a very pleasant drink.  I wanted to go
up on the top deck, but it is still closed off due to winds, so I walked around
the ship for a while.  I went out on the side deck on the 3<sup>rd</sup> level
but it was dark, windy and then it started to rain, so I went back to our cabin
about 6AM.  I went back to bed and after a while fell asleep.  When I woke
again Sandi had left and the skies had cleared, and the sun was shining.  Mae
and I went up for breakfast about 10AM.  Mae still isn’t feeling good so we
tried to find somewhere outside to lay in the sun but the wind is still cold,
and we didn’t want Mae to get cold so we came back to our cabin.  Our cabin had
been cleaned while we were gone.  That has been one of the fun things about
this cruse is to have the cleaning and cooking all taken care of for us.  Mae
went back to bed and I read a couple of chapters in the Book of Mormon before
working on my journals.  Roy, Shellie, Sandi and I started to play miniature
golf, but the winds were so strong that we quit.  Sandi, Shellie, Mae and I
played a short game of Hearts before we went for our dinner. This evening for
dinner Mae and I had pork steak that was very good.  We attended the evening
program, but I wasn’t very impressed with it.  Mae and I came back to our cabin
and soon got ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 6AM and soon went up to the 9<sup>th</sup>
deck where I could see the sun rise.  I took several pictures and just marveled
at the beautiful sun rise.  I couldn’t help but think of the scriptural
reference as to “Why does God consider my worth when He has such creations.”  I
hadn’t taken a coat with me and it was very cold so when I got back to the
cabin I got back in bed to warm up.  We went up to breakfast about 9:30AM and
then at 11AM we attended the debarkation meeting.  From there we went to the
dance class.  We spent the rest of the morning packing.  Sandi and Shellie
participated in a one-mile walk St. Jude Children Fund.  After lunch we
continued the packing.   The ship got into Ensenada about 4PM.  After it docked
Shellie called us and said that they could see seals from their cabin deck.  We
went up but as the men tied the boat it scared the seals into the water.  After
we watched them in the water for a few minutes, Roy, Shellie and Sandi left to
go into Ensenada shopping.  Mae and I continued to watch the seals return after
the men finished securing the ship and left.  We stayed until one large seal
climbed up the rocky bank and lay on the shore.  More would have followed but a
man kept walking on the dock to see the seals, so the seals would not get out
of the water.  We finally went back to our cabin.   Mae became very worried
about the kid’s safety and, so we had a prayer asking for their safety.   Mae
and I then went up to the 9<sup>th</sup> deck and got us some bean soup.  While
we were eating Mae over heard a lady and she was very upset.  The lady’s
husband was in a wheelchair and she had evidently had a run in with some of the
passengers while she was trying to get both her and her husband’s dinner.  She
was about in tears, so Mae went over to her and visited with her for a few
minutes.  That is one of the neat characteristics of my special wife.  She is
so concerned about others.  After eating we went to the game room and played a
game of Rummy in which Mae won.  She does that quite often.  By the time we
finished the game Mae was getting quite worried about the kids.  We just
started to go looking for them when Sandi came.  Mae was very relieved.  They
had found a tour bus at the dock that took them around the city and then to a
store, so they could get some vanilla.  All of us went dancing this evening and
had a lot of fun.  It was mid-night when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up at 5:30AM but Mae and Sandi slept a
little longer.  We went up for breakfast at 7AM and then came back to the cabin
and finished getting the suitcases ready to go.  I took a short nap.  It took
us quite a while to debark but the customs came onto the boat so when we got
through them we went right off.  Sandi’s arms started hurting her, so I pulled
both her luggage and mine.  Mae did pretty good with hers.  Roy and Shellie
weren’t far behind us.  Shellie’s bag had trouble with its wheels so that was a
little difficult for her.  We left L.A. about 12:30PM and traveled straight
through with only a stop for Subways sandwiches.  We got to Sandi’s at 12:30AM,
so with losing an hour time with time-zone, we made it in just about 11 hours. 
We were very tired and sure glad to be staying at Sandi’s.</p>

with us.  I can’t remember if Scott, Mishelle and their family came.  Sandi
came and I think she brought Dawson, but not sure if she did.  It rained part
of the time and cooled off at night.  Sandi had brought her shade tent so we
put it over the table and we played games under it even though it was raining.

Zion’s Canyon, in October for the school’s fall break as Ben and Rachel are
both in school now.   Jeff, Gail &amp; family came down on Monday and stayed
the week.  Their friends, Stewart and Nisha came down for the last couple of
days too and they had reserved places for them and Jeff &amp; Gail to go
repelling.  Ken and I tended Jeff &amp; Gail’s children while they went.  Sandi
and her family went on the shuttle bus and trails that day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> Jeff had told Nolan that he should
come down with Stewart and Nisha.  Nolan and his family were coming to St.
George and staying at a condo for that weekend, so at the last minute, he did
come.  He told me that when Jeff said that I would love to have him there, he
wanted to come.  Nolan is a cute nephew and we have always had a close
relationship.  I took Jeff’s children over to the sand area to play and Nolan
came with us.  He was cute with the children.  Ben brought his insect net and
container and wanted to catch lizards.  He and his dad had caught some the day
before, but his dad had him let them go that night.  I promised him we would
catch some, so Nolan played with Rachel &amp; Matt in the sand while I took Ben
to catch lizards.  We did catch some, but he wanted to catch more so later
Nolan went with him.  Nolan’s leg is really bad, so it was hard for him to walk
very far.  We sat &amp; visited some.  He slept in the camper with us on
Thursday night.   Stewart and Nisha slept in our tent as Jeff &amp; Gail
brought Gail’s mother’s big tent for them to sleep in.  They didn’t bring food,
only snacks so ate meals with us.  We were a little surprised that they didn’t
offer to pay anything on the food, nor did they really thank us.  Oh well,
they’re nice people and good friends of Jeff &amp; Gail’s.  We brought Sandi’s
table over and made a big family table with the two tables, so everyone could
eat together and that was fun.  We brought our big shad tent and put it up over
the tables so in case it rained.  It was colder than we expected this year.  We
also all crowded into our tiny table area in our camper and played games.  Ken
wasn’t feeling good the one night so went to bed.  There was Sandi, Chelci,
Nathan (who watched), Jeff, Gail, Stewart, Nisha, Nolan and I playing.  It was
crazy, but we had fun.  </p>

playing games when Gail started telling us that her and her mom were taking the
children and going to Disneyland in May.  She said that Jeff was going to take
off a couple of days to fly down and meet them and be with them for a day and
fly back. She said he didn’t have much vacation time, but she wanted him to be
with her and the kids for part of the time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In talking with them, it turns out
that Jeff really didn’t want to go.  He’s like Ken, he doesn’t like amusement
parks and he didn’t have time to take off.  He said: “Mom, you would like to go
in my place, wouldn’t you?”  He caught me off guard and I told him I would love
to be with Gail, her mom and the kids, but that I needed to be home with Ken to
keep him on our strict diet.  He asked Ken if he wouldn’t be alright for a week
as he thought it would be great to have two grandmas’ and their mom.  That way
each child could have someone to be with and go on rides with.  Anyway, it
turned out that he talked me and Ken into it, and Gail too, however, she was
disappointed that Jeff couldn’t go.  Jeff told me that since I would be going
in his place and doing a favor for him, he would pay for me to go.  I ended up
going and having a wonderful time.  Ken and I missed each other, but it was
good spending more time with Gail and the children.  Marcy was great about it
too and I enjoyed being with her also.  </p>

hspace=12 alt=P1100217><b>Marcy</b> took her vehicle and she packed all of us
into it and all our luggage.  She drove most of the time with Gail trading her
off for a break now and then.  I was willing to drive, but relieved that I
didn’t have to as I was nervous driving her vehicle with all the precious
cargo.  We stayed with Gail’s sisters and their families.  We stayed at Lisa
&amp; Ralph’s in St. George on the way down and back and we stayed with Debbie
and her husband and children the five days we were there.  We spent three full
days at Disneyland and we had two down days where we could rest and relax at
Debbie’s house and the children could have naps since we stayed late each time
we were at Disneyland.  Debbie and 2 of her children came one evening as they
have a season pass.  We took lunches with us and we bought the evening meals
there.  Gail took two strollers so Rachel and Matt didn’t have to walk all the
time.  That worked good, so we could put our lunches, etc. in them too.  It was
so fun watching the expressions and excitement as the children rode the rides
with us or got their books signed by the princesses or cartoon characters –
Mickey Mouse, Miney Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, Goofy, etc and also got pictures
with them and with the Cars – Lightning McQueen, Mateur, etc. I enjoyed most of
the rides, but there were a couple I wouldn’t go on again as they were too hard
on my back &amp; neck and they were too frightening for me, for the children
too.  The children were really good most of the time and it was a lot of fun. 
Gail had bought me a Disney T shirt for Mother’s Day as she wanted us all to
match when we wore them there one day.  That was fun too.  Marcy is a wonderful
person and Gail is a special daughter-in-law and great to be with.  She is
usually always happy and bubbly and excited about life, which makes it great
for all of us.  I was worried about staying with Gail’s sister’s and families
as I am not one of the family, but they were all good to me and said they were
glad to have me. </p>

hspace=12 alt="Family &amp; reunion 014"><b>Camping and fishing trips with my
honey, with our boat and camper the summer of 2013- </b>Since Ken and I didn’t
get to use our boat and camper much last year because of working on
preparations for the large Bushnell Reunion which was held in Tropic at Keela’s
property in August, I decided we needed to use them more this summer and, so we
had to plan way ahead to get reservations at the places we wanted to go.  I
went over the calendar, selecting times we could be away and then I showed Ken
and talked it over with him.  I then made reservations at <b>Hyrum Reservoir
for five days</b>, Monday through Friday in June.  I made reservations at Fish
Lake for a week in July and I made reservations for a <b>Monday through
Saturday at Payson Lake for August</b>.  I also talked to Ken about us going to
<b>BYU Education Week</b> the 19<sup>th</sup> through the 23<sup>rd</sup> of
August as we have wanted to do that for a couple of years, but never got around
to registering for it.  He said to go ahead and make the reservations<b>. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We invited any of our family to join us at <b>Hyrum
Reservoir</b> and David, Shauna, Emily &amp; Connor came up on Monday and
stayed overnight and the next day.  Tyler was at basketball camp in St George. 
We had a great time fishing, relaxing at our campsite, playing games, eating,
etc.  We were glad they could come.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We also invited Bryce &amp; Deanna
and they came up for a fish breakfast with us one morning and stayed most of
the day.  We enjoyed being with them and had a good visit.  Deanna and I don’t
get a change to visit together often, so it was great!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We thought that Sandi &amp; Nick could go with us to <b>Fish
Lake</b> as they always have.  This year, <img width=288 height=216

hspace=12 alt="2008-06-14 078 - cleaning fish">however, the government was
furloughing the government employees and he works for the government as a guard
at Dugway Proving Grounds, so he wasn’t able to go and Sandi had already booked
a vacation with one of her friends to Glazier National Park and Canada for two
weeks, so she couldn’t go either.  None of the others could go, so Ken and I
still had a great time fishing and camping together.  There was a good family
camped by us which we got to know and enjoyed visiting with them.  They were
kind to us by taking us in their truck down to our boat.  Ken and I love to be
alone together anyway.  We have fun whatever we are doing, especially
vacationing.  We have gone fishing at Strawberry Reservoir together also and
staying overnight in the cabin there.  That was fun too.  Ken and Nick have
gone together fishing both at Strawberry Reservoir and East Canyon Reservoir.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>In August of 2013</b>, Ken and I
reserved a campsite for a <b>week at Payson Lake</b>.  it ended up that only
Jeff, Gail and the children were going to be with us for Friday night and
Saturday and they were going to use our tent and share our campground, but
Sherrie, Bob’s daughter had passed away from a liver disease caused by drinking
alcohol, so we needed to leave on Friday as the funeral was early Saturday
morning.  When Jeff found out about it, they decided they wanted to go to the
funeral so wouldn’t be coming up.  We asked Scott if Kylan could come with us
as he loves to camp and fish.  Kylan was excited, so we had fun playing games
together in the evenings and he and Grandpa went fishing several times. 
Sometimes they caught some fish and sometimes they didn’t.  Sometimes I would
stay and read in the camper and other times I would take my camp chair and book
and watch them.  Kylan loved the meals and snacks we had.  He’s a cute boy and
we enjoyed having him with us.  Mike couldn’t come up, but Becky brought Maddi
&amp; Jessie and Jessie’s friend and spent part of one day with us and had
supper with us. </p>

hspace=12 alt="IMG_0133">I haven’t been home much in the last 4 weeks as I went
to Shellie &amp; Roy’s home for Garrett’s graduation from ASU and Kevis’s high
school graduation.  I had a wonderful two weeks with them.  We did lots of fun
things.  They have a beautiful boat so we went to the lake one day and Garrett,
Nora &amp; Little Maggie went with us.  Both Garrett and his mom are fantastic
on the water.  Roy is recuperating from his hip replacement operation so he
didn’t do much, but he did get out on the wakeboard one time.  Jase, Nora &amp;
I got on the knee board (at different times).  My broken elbow was still
healing so I didn’t dare do much either, so they just pulled me around as I laid
on the knee board.  Nora got up on her knees.  She was really nervous at first
to even get out on it, but she had fun.  Shellie &amp; I played lots of games
at their home.  Nora played with us when she was with us.  Neither Roy, nor any
of their sons like to play board and card games.  We watched several movies in
their theater room and Shellie and I did lots of visiting as we went shopping,
doing laundry or just sitting and talking.  We went to the Mesa Temple and took
pictures on the grounds, after the session.  Shellie is a beautiful and special
daughter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken really missed me, I missed him too and wish
he could have gone, but they needed him to take his school bus route,
especially at the end of the year as they have lots of field trips and sports
events.  Ken picked me up at the airport at 6 pm on Memorial Day and we were
happy to be together again.  We went out to dinner and enjoyed the evening
together.  </p>

SHAUNA &amp; FAMILY TO CALIFORNIA IN JUNE 2014</span></b>I was busy doing
laundry and repacking to leave on vacation on Friday morning with David, Shauna
and their family.  Her parents went also.  Shauna is great in planning
vacations and making all the arrangements, so we had a great time.  We stayed
in a home on the beach at Half Moon Bay.  It was beautiful and so was the
ocean.  It was a little chilly as it didn’t get over 62 degrees, but it was so
pretty.  We were down at the ocean several times, then going on the paths in
the park across from this home where the path overlooked the ocean and we saw
lots of seals resting on the rocks or on the beach (depending on when the tide
was in or out.).  In the mornings they have “tide pools” where you can see all
kinds of animal life.  We saw star fish, squid, snails, crabs, sea urchins,
etc.  We drove down to the pier one afternoon and went fishing for large crab. 
That was a fun experience too.  We stayed two nights there and then drove to
Yosemite where Shana had rented a cute ranch house for us on this large ranch
about 40 minutes from Yosemite National Park.  We had all the comforts of home
there too, plus it has beautiful surroundings.  Tyler, Conner, David and Ken
played horse shoes and several of us got in the hot tub.  We also hiked a mile
to their fun pond where they had paddle boats and a canoe.  That was lots of
fun.  The next day we went to Yosemite and spent the day.  It was so beautiful
and the weather was just perfect.  We all enjoyed it so much.  The only thing
that was hard was finding parking spots for all three cars as we drove from
place to place.  There were so many tourists there.  The following morning, we
drove 11 hours to St. George.  The children took turns riding with their
parents and both sets of grandparents.  Shauna’s parents have bought a condo in
St. George so we all stayed there for two nights.  We swam in the pool, played
games, visited and Shauna, Vickie (Shauna’s Mom) and I went shopping<b>.  Emily
plays the violin very well now and is in a small strings orchestra and they
performed prior to the play “The Wizard of Oz” at tuacon</b>.  We also had
tickets for dinner there and it was very good.  I was afraid it would be really
hot as it had been 108, but the sun had gone behind those beautiful red
mountains so it wasn’t so bad, in fact it was quite nice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>            Ken and I drove home
the next day and stopped at Mike and Becky’s to visit them.  They had us stay
for dinner and while it was cooking we played Rook.  David, Shauna and family
stayed at St. George an extra day, but I needed to get home to teach my primary
class as the other teacher had taught 3 weeks in a row for me.  We experienced
cool weather at the ocean, beautiful warm weather in the mountains at the ranch
house and Yosemite, and then hot weather in St. George.  Quite a vacation.  We are
still tired from all the traveling (we traveled about 2,500 miles on this trip,
but it was sure fun</p>

had two-time shares at Lake Tahoe, so she invited Chelci, Steve &amp; their

came with them.  Sandi &amp; Nick and Chelci, Steve &amp; children stayed in
the one in downtown Lake Tahoe and Shellie, Roy, Jase, Garrett, Nora &amp;
Maggie and Ken &amp; I stayed in the one up in the mountains.  Both places were
great and so different.  We took turns fixing the meals and when we were with
Sandi’s group, we had delicious meals that Sandi &amp; Chelci prepared and
afterwards we would go swimming in the pool or play ping pong and other games. 
Ken &amp; Nick played Chess with big chess pieces by the pool.  We also went
shopping and to the art festival downtown.  When Shellie, Nora and I fixed
meals, the others came up to our place. There wasn’t as much to do where we
were, but the view and scenery were spectacular.  The accommodations were great
at both places.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We went on outings to the beach at
the lake one day, another day we went sightseeing and hiked some.  We saw
beautiful waterfalls; we walked down to a mansion and went through it.  We did
lots of fun things and had a great time.  However, Nick &amp; Sandi were having
problems and while walking with Sandi, she told me that she hoped I wouldn’t
hate her, but that she was going to divorce Nick as she couldn’t take it any
longer.  She said he didn’t want to do anything fun, all he wanted to do was
watch sports.  He didn’t help her with the yard or housework, he didn’t show
her affection and she said she had about 20 more good years and she wanted to
have fun and do things.  I told her that I certainly wouldn’t hate her, that
she was my daughter and I loved her very much and I wanted her to be happy.</p>

mowed the lawns.  Time went very fast today.  Scott and Jeff came over after work

the canopy all the way up, but will finish it tomorrow.  Shellie and Jase

later she called to tell me that she had just blown a tire on the trailer.  She
was on the Legacy Highway by Bountiful.   A young man stopped and helped her. 
I had Shellie and Mae drive to help her but the young man drove her to
Bountiful where she bought new tires for the trailer.  Mae and Shellie got the
stove and Dutch and brought it back to me.  I had all the chicken browned with
part of it in the kitchen oven as I only the two ovens Dutch ovens.  They got
back just as I was starting to load the vegetables in with the chicken.  I was
sure busy without having Mae or anyone else to help me.  As it was they got
back just in time and I was able to get the three ovens going.  It turned out
to be a very good meal.  Mike and Becky didn’t come but Becky brought Maddi and
Jessie and met Jeff in Salt Lake and he brought them on.  Mike is still sick
but hopes to join us tomorrow.  It was interesting getting everyone’s campers
set up, as well as cleaning up the Dutch ovens and help set up a screen and

worked out ok but it was after mid-night before we got to bed very tired.</p>

enjoyed visiting, playing games of all kinds from table games to volleyball. 
Gail and Shellie bought sandwiches from Wall Mart.  Mae had thought that
everyone would enjoy going water skiing at one of the lakes or going to a water
park but they all wanted to continue visit and playing games.  The little ones
played constantly in the pool plus we had water balloons and water guns so they
were having fun all day.  Scott and Mishelle provided the evening meal of
spaghetti with homemade rolls.  Having the portable toilet was a help plus we
went through lots of water and cups but it was a great day.  David and Sierra
came for a while this afternoon and both seemed to enjoy the activities.  Some

active.  We only attended Sacrament meeting but it was sure special.  There
were a lot of visitors today as the Searl boy is leaving on a mission on
Tuesday and Jake Steadman just returned last Tuesday.  Both of them gave very
good talks.  Mike and Becky haven’t been here as Mike has been sick.  We are
glad that Mattie and Jessie have been able to be with us.  We played a lot of
table games again this afternoon.  Scott and Michelle prepared South West
Chicken for lunch and that was sure good.  This evening we just had left over’s
and hot dogs for some of the children.  Mike and Becky did come this afternoon
although Mike is some better he still isn’t up to par.  It has again been a
very enjoyable today.  We have had all our children, and many of our
grandchildren, plus with Chelci coming Friday afternoon with her children, that

then head for home.  Mae and I laid down and took a nap, although Bob knocked

<p class=MsoNormal><b>VACATION TO FISH LAKE AUGUST 16, 2015</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ken and I left for Fish Lake after we left the Bushnell
Reunion.  It took us until 5pm before we checked in at the Fish lake RV
Campground.  It took us a while to get set up and was soon ready for bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Monday, August 17,</b> we slept in the next morning, and
after getting up, Ken started looking for the sewer hookup.  When he couldn't
find one and all the other pads had one, he went to the front desk and asked
them about it.  The girl there said that they had had a bad rain storm and
haven't found the hook up on that pad since.  She gave him a new spot #26 and
we moved.  Most of the day was spent relocating.  We went out fishing about
five and did catch four fish before dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tuesday, August 18,</b> we got up at five am and were on
the lake shortly after 7 am.  It was a beautiful morning.  I caught the first
fish.  By 9:15 am, we had each caught our limits.  I hooked another one while
reeling in, that we released.  It was another great morning.  We stopped at the
lodge to see if they carried any groceries, but not much.  Ken cleaned the fish
while there as they have a better cleaning station than the one at Bowery
Haven.  We then went to the dock on the south west end of the lake, but they
had the same selection of groceries as the other two.  Ken filleted and packaged
the fish while I got some lunch.  We ate and then took a nap.  I got dinner
ready for the evening, while Ken wrote in a note book for his journal.  We went
out fishing about 4:30 pm and though there was a lot of wind, we both caught
our limits, in fact, as I was bringing in my last fish, as Ken reeled in, he
caught another fish.  It was a lip catch so we released it and it swam away.  I
read President Uchtorf's talk on the Savior's Atonement.  It is sure a great
talk. Ken cleaned our fish while I went on to our camper and started dinner. 
After dinner, Ken filleted the fish and I packaged them.  We are getting quite
a few fish.  We are tired so we are soon going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Wednesday, August 19</b>. We got up early so we could
have the crockpot on before we went out fishing.  It was windy when we woke,
plus Ken wasn't feeling the best, so we went back to bed. After getting up, we
realized that the furnace wasn't coming on and it was cold inside the camper. 
Ken went to check the thermostat and realized that the crockpot was setting
right under the thermostat.  We moved the crockpot and the heat soon came on. 
About 8 am we went out fishing.  It was a beautiful morning.  By 10:45 am we
were back in with our limits.  Ken tried fishing for Mackinaws, but didn't get
a strike there.  We kept the lure out but he also fished with a 2<sup>nd</sup>
pole.  I caught five fish and Ken three.  We had a good time.  After lunch, we
cleaned and filleted the fish.  We took showers and a nap.  I made a southwest
chicken dinner for this evening.  We went to the store for some ice, but they
didn't have any.  Then we went for a walk.  After getting back, we played Rummy
Cube in which Ken won two of three games.  We got to bed before 9:30 p.m.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thursday, August 20, 2015.  </b>We both slept well last night
and were up at 5 am.  We enjoyed a nice breakfast of hot cakes and eggs.  We
enjoyed the warmth and conveniences our camper gives us.  We were on the lake
about 7 am.  Ken tried fishing deep with the down rigger and it worked pretty
well.  We both fished with our standard pop-gear with me catching my limit
before Ken did.  Ken still had one to have his limit and he hadn't had anything
go for the down rigger lures.  As he was letting his line out to try to catch
his last fish, I asked if I could hold his pole while he took a picture of me
fishing.  He no sooner clicked the picture when the pole doubled over.  Ken
kidded me that I just wanted to catch his last fish.  We were back in the boat
dock about noon.  I went up to start lunch while Ken cleaned the fish.  After
eating lunch, Ken and I filleted and packaged our fish.  We then took a nap.  I
didn't get very much of a nap as a neighbor's dog started barking.  We went out
again this afternoon and Ken again spent his time trying to catch a lake trout. 
We had quite a wind on the lake this afternoon so I fished for regular trout
and Ken spent my his time trying for the Mackinaws, and keeping the boat under
control with the strong winds.  I caught my limit but Ken didn't have any
luck.  I read some talks from the conference Ensign.  They were very good. 
When we were about back to the dock, the wind let up.  Ken tried to just catch
a fish before we finished.  he had a good strike and for the 2<sup>nd</sup>
time today, the line broke and he lost a 2<sup>nd</sup> set of good pop-gear. 
We decided that the line must be getting old.  Those pop gear sets cost about
$20 each, so that hurts.  We had a nice dinner, took care of the fish and went
to bed about 10:30 p.m.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Friday, August 21.  </b>We planned on getting up early,
but we decided we were too tired so went back to sleep.  We got up about 6:30
am.  We were on the lake shortly after 8.  By 10:15, we had our limits and then
just road around on the lake, just enjoying the morning.   There was a fair
wind, but it was still a beautiful day.  We came in about noon.  I helped Ken
clean the fish and then he stayed and filleted them.  We figure that we have
caught over 48 fish this week and used 39 worms.  When Ken cleaned the bait
box, there was 2 ½ worms left.  After lunch, Ken had me lay down, as I wasn't
feeling very well, and he packaged the fish.  he then took a nap outside as he
didn't want to wake me, but was woke up with a wind that took the canopy almost
down.  It woke both of us, so we finished taking the canopy down and put it
away.  Ken and I played games this afternoon.  This evening, after dinner, we
went for a walk.  We went north east on the lake shore trail, although it
didn't go close to the lake.  While walking, we saw a 3 point white tail buck,
still in its velvet.  A short way further, we saw a doe.  Neither deer seemed
very worried about us, but just kept their eyes on us.  It was a beautiful
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Saturday, August 22.  </b>We slept in, not worrying about
fishing today.  After breakfast we started packing.  We were glad that we had
the canopy already packed as it still took us until 11 am before we got away. 
I was amazed at how Ken was able to back up the boat with the camper on, down
that short, but steep dock.  Then he ran around, got in the boat and drove it
over and onto the trailer.  It wasn't quite on, so he had to get out on the
boat trailer and jump over to the cement edge of the dock. He walked to the
front of the trailer and again jumped from the cement onto the top of the
trailer to pull the boat the rest of the way upon the trailer.  The boat wasn't
on right, so he again jumped to the boat from the cement pavement and rocked
the boat and threw me the rope to pull it up.  Other men were standing around
marveling at how Ken, as old as he is, could do what he was doing.  One man
said, I couldn't do that; I would fall in the lake.  Ken is amazing, and I am
proud of him for all he can do.  I am not much help to him, so glad he can do
it.    Our neighbors to our right had come up last night and while we were
packing, he helped Ken carry the canopy and put it in the boat.  Ken had been
worried about that as he didn't want me to help carry it.  We stopped a couple
of hours to visit with Mike and Becky.  Mike did an excellent job with the
remodeling of the girl's bathroom.  It was 5 pm before we got home and it took
us another 3 hours unpacking.  We had stopped in Layton and got some Maddox
chicken for dinner.  We did watch a movie on Netflix before showering and going
to bed.</p>

VACATION</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On March 9<sup>th</sup>, we left for our vacation to
Shellie, Roy &amp; family’s home in Arizona.  Ken got home at 12:15PM and we
got away at 12:30PM.  Ken drove until we got past Provo and then switched and
let me drive while Ken took a nap.  He slept for over an hour then we switched
again.  We called the Class’s before getting to St. George and they met us at
the Golden Corral where we enjoyed eating dinner and visiting.  We then
followed them to their home.  We enjoyed our visit with Maggie and Bill, and
then Maggie put a cartoon DVD on the TV.  Ken was dozing off so Maggie offered
him a blanket and within seconds he was out.  When the show ended we soon went
to bed.</p>

alt="Shellie &amp; Mae in costumes Shellie made for us for Renassance Festival 3-2017">            Billie
cooked us a wonderful breakfast.  We pack the car and left at 9AM<b>.  With the
use of the GPS we found Tammy Braithwaite’s home.</b>  We were just a little
concerned as to what reception we might get, but when Tammy opened the door,
she just starred for a few seconds and then throw her arms around me and we
both just cried.  We had a wonderful visit with Tammy leaving there just before
noon.  Before getting on the freeway we fueled up the car and got us a Hot Dog
for lunch.  From St. George we drove straight through to Chandler with just a
stop to switch driver, so Ken could take a nap.  We arrived there at 6:30PM in
time for dinner.  We visited, and Roy and Ken argued some and I was worried
about how this vacation would turn out and I wondered if we should have come. 
We soon went to bed. I prayed it and it went okay the rest of the time between
them.  I talked to Ken and Shellie must have talked to Roy.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We slept well getting up about 7AM.  <b>After breakfast
Shellie &amp; I dressed in cute medieval dresses that Shellie had made for us.
Wow, both she and Sandi are so talented in about everything.  They surely amaze
me. Shellie had told me by phone to come a day earlier so she could take Maggie
and I to the Renaissance Festival</b>.  She paid for our $20 tickets.  Shellie
and I got on our way and stopped to pick up Maggie at Garrett &amp; Nora’s cute
home.  Nora fixed Shellie’s hair and I looked around their cute home and played
with Maggie &amp; Damon. We then went to the Renaissance up by Apache
Junction.  It was great, and we had such a good time.  The only problem was it
was “hot”. It was in the high 90’s and it is supposed to be in the “70’s” in March
in Arizona. It was still fun, and I sure enjoyed being with Shellie &amp;
Maggie.  Maggie was so cute and so good.  Shellie spoiled her by buying her
fairy wings to go with the cute costume she had bought for Maggie to wear.  She
also bought her a cute ceramic fairy and other things.  There were all kinds of
things to see, food to buy and things to do there depicting the Renaissance
period of time.  They had a lot of entertainment including Jousting performed
by a theater group.  It really looked authentic.  Ken later told me that he
didn’t have a great day, that he had gone with Roy &amp; Quint to the park
where Roy and Quint flew Roy’s drone.  He said that Roy didn’t even offer to
let him fly the drone.  Shortly after returning home Roy and Quint went bike
riding.  He felt uncomfortable around Roy, so glad they left.  He watched a
John Wayne movie, and after getting himself some lunch, he took Jase with him
to get frozen yogurts.  When they returned home, Roy and Quint were playing
video games on the TV and Jase went to doing his thing on his computer.   He
said he got himself some more leftover Lasagna and waited for Shellie &amp; I
to return.  He wasn’t very happy when I got there as he didn’t expect us to be
so long.  It was about 8:30 pm after taking Maggie to her home and then getting
back here.</p>

hspace=12 alt="Attach25_20170317_120106">            After a good breakfast
that Shellie made, Ken, Shellie and I attended Block Meeting this morning but
no one else attended.  This is sure a heart ache for us..  Mike is the only one
of our children that is active in the church now although Shellie is trying but
does not have her spouses support.  This evening Quint and Roy got quite
involved in a discussion of the future of the earth and the destiny of man. 
Ken said he wanted to yell at them “Where is your faith in the Gospel?” but he
just remained silent and went into the other room.  Garrett, Nora, Maggie and
Demon came over this evening and had dinner with us.  It was sure good to be
with them, but there again Nora is trying to stay active, but Garrett is
doubting his faith.  He still goes to church with Nora and the kids and has a
calling, thank goodness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were late getting up but what a beautiful
morning.   Shellie, Ken and I played Rummy Cube for a while.  It has been a
very relaxing day.  After dinner this evening we watched a show on DVD titled
“The Express” a show taken from a true event.  An African American, Ernie Davis
in the early 1920’s chose to become a Foot Ball Player and succeeded to be a
Huysmans Trophy winner.  Though he succeeded in football the sad thing is that
at age 23 he dies of Leukemia.  It was a good show although occasionally
profanity came out and especially the Lords name was used in vain.  We were
late going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in late and had a late breakfast. 
After getting up, Ken and I enjoyed breakfast on the patio.  Shellie had gone
for a bike ride before we got up.  This afternoon Ken, Shellie and I took our
car to a car wash and then we went groceries shopping.  After returning home
the three of played Three Handed Rook at which I won.  This evening we all
watched “Man from Snowy River” before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I got up about 8AM and went for a walk. 
The citrus is out in blossom and they sure smell good!  It looks like there are
so many trees that the fruit is just being left to spoil and fall off.  Anyway,
we had a enjoyable walk to start the day.  Ken has worked on “Indexing church
records” some while we have been here.  Shellie, Ken and I went shopping at
Wal-Mart, then to Home Depot so that Shellie could give me some ideas about
painting the exterior of our home.  We then went over to a Frozen Yogurt store
and enjoyed eating a treat there.  Most meals are enjoyed eating on the back
patio and in the evenings, we usually watch a movie before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After breakfast and straightening the house,
Shellie, Ken and I played some table games.  I have been getting calls from the
Hilton’s nurse, Fran, Harold’s daughter, Rae and others. Evelyn &amp; Harold
Hilton don’t seem to be doing very well but at this time Fran, Millie at
Woodcrest Rehab and Rae are working on getting them a State Appointed Guardian,
get them on Medicaid and into an assisted living facility.  That will be good. 
This afternoon we watched the movie “How to Steal a Million” and then before
going to bed we watched the movie “Book Thief”.  Both movies were very good. 
Jase cooked dinner this evening of Hamburgers.  He seems to quite enjoy doing
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As normal it is a beautiful morning in Arizona
and the weather is very nice.  Ken called to see how Roy is doing.  He told him
that Tita flew back to the Philippines yesterday so that she can be home when
she dies.  It is sad but as he said, “There is not anything you can do, but
accept it.  Roy, Shellie, Ken and I played Sequence this evening before
watching the movie “The Martian”, which we quite enjoyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up early so that Shellie and I could go to
the Swap Meet in Apache Junction. We met Shellie &amp; Georgia’s friend “Roche”
and her mom there.  There were 4 large warehouses with tables set up on each
side of the walkway with all different things to buy.  Nora called and asked if
she and the kids could join us, and they did.  We had a good time and were
there from 8 until noon.  We then met Garrett at Crown Burger and Shellie paid
for our lunch.  Ken asked Jase if he wanted to go fishing, but Jase didn’t want
to.  We thought he would be excited to go fishing on the lake with Grandpa
again this year, but since he has “Asperger Syndrome”, he isn’t very social and
mainly wants to do “Mindcraft” and “Blenders” on the computer when he isn’t
doing his school work.  Garrett, Nora &amp; the kids followed us to Shellie
&amp; Roy’s home.  Nora loves to play games to so we decided to play “Hand
&amp; Foot”.  We asked Roy, Quint &amp; Garrett if they wanted to play with
us.  They really didn’t want to, but wanted to make us happy so they played one
hand of it and then quit to play video games on the TV. So the rest of us
played it.  Nora put the Maggie &amp; Damon down to sleep as Shellie has
pajamas for them and tooth brushes, so they usually do this so they can stay
later.  They stayed until late, but after they left Roy and Quint made some
popcorn and Shellie put the animated show “Moana” on to watch.   Ken and I had
seen it at Maggie &amp; Billie Klass”s home so we ate some popcorn and watched
part of it, then went to bed as it was late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were up about 7:30AM and started getting
ready for meetings.  After a wonderful breakfast, we got ready and Shellie,
Jase, Ken and I attended church.  Following Sacrament meeting Shellie took Jase
home.  Following meetings, the three of us set in the car and visited for a
while.  Shellie is so concerned at to what she should be doing.  Her family is
falling away from church activity and Roy is resenting any encouragement from
Shellie.  He won’t participate in prayer, attendance of meetings or any church
activity.  He won’t encourage any of his boys in their church participation. 
He leaves total responsibility for helping Jase with church or school activity
and most of his activities up to Shellie.  We have to be careful with advice as
it has backfired in the past.  We sure do sympathize with her, however, and
wish things could be better.  She does feel that she was supposed to marry Roy
as she had fasted &amp; prayed about it and had a good feeling.  So, she says
she will just love him and her boys and make the best of it.  We sure hope she
can.  This evening Shellie prepared a wonderful dinner.  She invited Roy’s
parents over to join us for dinner.  We enjoyed the evening visiting and we
played a game of “Mormon Bridge” in which on the last hand, Ken won.  After
Roy’s parents left, we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I didn’t sleep very well last night, but that’s
par for the course some nights.  Garrett, Nora and their children came over for
a couple of hours.  They sure have a cute family, but we sure feel badly that
Garrett has become discouraged and weakening in his testimony.  It is sure
discouraging as we watch so many of our family who are losing their testimonies
of the Gospel.  Nora, Shellie, Ken and I played some table games, while Roy,
Garrett &amp; Quint played video games and visited. At night we watched another
movie before Garrett, Nora and children went home.  It is great to be with all
this family which we don’t get to be with often.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After breakfast, Shellie, Ken and I played a
couple of games of Rummikub and Ken won.  Usually it is Shellie that is so
quick to recognize a play and most of the time she wins.   Shellie &amp; I went
shopping.  Ken had a headache so took some Tylenol and took a nap.  This
afternoon Ken and I helped Shellie with preparations for dinner in which she
had invited a Rockel and her parents over.  The dinner was wonderful, and we
enjoyed the evening getting to know them.  Lyle, the father, especially enjoyed
the tricks that Shellie has taught Tasha, Shellie’s dog, to do.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After breakfast, we played a couple of games
again and then went shopping at Smart &amp; Final for groceries and to Home
Depot for light bulbs.  We went for lunch at Schlotzsky’s where they serve
great sandwiches on special buns.  This afternoon the three of us again played
table games.  This evening Jase grilled hamburgers for dinner.  He seems to
really enjoy grilling.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I got up and got ready to go to the
Gilbert Temple this morning.  However, I hadn’t put his temple socks in his
suitcase nor his white tie.  Knowing that the Gilbert Temple doesn’t have
clothing to rent we called to see if they had just those two items.  They
didn’t but told us that there was a Distribution store in the Deseret Book
store that we could purchase those items.  However, as we thought about that we
realized that the store wouldn’t open until at least 10AM.  We wanted to be
back to Roy and Shellie’s before 1PM as Roy and Shellie have a salesman coming
at 1PM to show them a program about changing their windows in the home.  Ken
wanted to be there to see what was being offered.  We, therefore, went to the
Mesa Temple and rented those items there.  We enjoyed the session and then we
had time to eat lunch in the Temple cafeteria, something else the Gilbert
Temple does not have.  When we looked at the menu Ken noticed that they had
Frozen Yogurt and ordered some. We had a nice dinner.  The salesman came
shortly after we got back.  Their windows were impressive, but Roy and Shellie
decided against doing it right now.  This afternoon we watched the show
“Australia” which was pretty good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This morning Ken, Shellie and I went to the Swap
Meet where we bought more than we had planned.  On the way home we stopped at
the Frozen Yogurt shop for a treat, which we especially enjoy.  After getting
home, Roy’s sister, Cindy her husband Dug and some of their daughter came
over.  We visited with them and ended up getting the paddle boat and kayak
boats out for them to use.  After Cindy’s family left, Ken and I took the
paddle boat out for a few minutes.  Roy soon got home, and Roy took us out to
eat.  Garrett, Nora, Maggie and Damon also met us at Home Town Buffet, and we
sure enjoyed being with them also.  Roy had stopped by a window dealer to look
at their window replacements.  They gave him a sample and after getting home
from dinner we looked at what might be done to install them.  Ken and I went to
bed about 11PM.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             When we woke, Ken asked me what I thought about
the idea of him telling Roy that if he decided to install the windows rather
than have them installed; he (Ken, &amp; I) would be willing to stay another
week and cut the old windows out.  We then went down to a neighbor that had had
the windows installed.  After a little more figuring and discussing it with
Shellie &amp; Roy, they decided to have the windows installed for them.  They
were impressed that Ken would offer to do this for them and thanked him, but
said that they didn’t want him to have to do that for them.  We spent most of
the day playing games with Shellie.  Ken did help Roy with the installation of
a light and made suggestions on three other lights that he will still install
later.  This evening we watched a show on DVD before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended meetings this morning and Roy &amp;
Jase went with us as their friend’s son was speaking as he had just returned
from his mission. After coming home and having lunch, Roy, Shellie, Ken and I
took the boats out on the lake for a little while.  Afterwards we played a
couple of table games. This afternoon Garrett and his family came over for
dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, March 27, 2017</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up about 7AM and started packing to go
home.  Quint and Jase also helped us carry our bags out to the car.  Shellie
prepared breakfast for us, and we enjoyed eating on the patio for the last
time.  We have sure enjoyed that privilege and the beauty of their backyard. 
We got away about 10AM, stopping for gas.  We drove to Flagstaff where we
filled up with gas.  I drove from there and let Ken take a nap.  At the Gap we
traded places.  We stayed at the Motel 6 in Page as Judy called us a couple of
days ago and said that she was quite sick.  We went down to Wal Mart where we
bought some chicken and a couple of other items for our dinner.  These we ate
while we watched a show on TV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left this morning before 10AM and ate left
over from last night as we drove, Ken and I traded back and drove as we
traveled to American Fork.  We visited with Mike, Becky &amp; the girls for a
while, and then Mike and Becky prepared a very nice dinner of grilled steak
with the trimmings. Paige came, but Garrett didn’t as he wasn’t feeling the
best.  It is Jessie’s birthday. After dinner, we said our good-byes and drove
on home getting there after 9:30PM.  We did some unpacking, reset the clocks
for Daylight Savings time and went to bed, tired.</p>
