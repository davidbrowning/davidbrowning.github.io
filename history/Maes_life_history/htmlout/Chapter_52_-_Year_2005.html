<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 53 – Year 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While we were on our mission, two more grandchildren were
born.  <b>Mike and Becky had a daughter, which they named Jessica, and David
&amp; Shauna had a son, which they named Connor</b>.  We were excited to see
them, as well as all our other grandchildren and their parents, when we arrived
home.  I’m sure that most of you already know that <b>we also had a death in
our family while we were gone.  Sandi’s husband, Terry, was killed in a vehicle
accident in November 2003.  That was surely sad news for us, and it was hard
for us not to leave our mission and come home to be with Sandi during this hard
time</b>.  Our mission president said it was his wish that we would stay and
then have Sandi come to the Philippines a little later and spend some
one-on-one time with us.  She brought her sister, Shellie, and came for 10 days
the following February, and we were able to show them some of the beautiful
places in the Philippines as well as meet many of our wonderful Filipino
friends.  We had a special time together.  We arrived home, from our mission,
the 17<sup>th</sup> of February and since that time we have had many wonderful
family get-to-gathers as well as visiting our good friends again.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            A <b>little great-granddaughter, Kennedy Grace,
was born soon after we arrived home to our granddaughter, JaNae, and her
husband, Brad.</b>  Sandi is her grandmother.  That makes 15 grandchildren and
3 great grandchildren for us.  <b>Sandi’s younger daughter, Chelci, just called
yesterday with good news that she is getting married in the Salt
 Lake Temple on the 11<sup>th</sup> of March</b>.  We are very excited for her
and her fiancée.  <b>Scott graduated from Weber University while we were gone</b>
and <b>Jeff graduated from the University of Utah this past April</b>.  They
were both happy to be finished with college studies and have more time for
their families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Family vacation at Shellie &amp;
Roys in July of 2005 – We celebrated the 4<sup>th</sup> of July there.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Anchorage Alaska to Terry &amp; Angela’s in
July</b><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> </span>2005 – for more on these
vacations, see Chapter 55 – Vacations and Reunions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We have postponed the building of our home in Star
  Valley, Wyoming due to the costs in building materials tripling since we have
been gone.  We had sold our home in Layton to our son, Scott and his wife,
Mishelle.  We are living in the cute basement apartment, which Ken built for
his mother a few years ago in his brother’s home.  Mom Jensen passed away prior
to our going on our mission.  Bob &amp; Carroll are wonderful to us and we
enjoy the Clinton 20<sup>th</sup> ward, so for the present, we are happy to be
here.  We live close to most of our children as well as most of our brothers
and their families and my sister and her family, which makes it nice also.  We
are very thankful for the many blessings the Lord has blessed us with,
especially the gospel, our family and friends, and to live here in America.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><a name="_Hlk522479708"><b>In
October, 2005, Shellie and the boys came up in 2005 to visit and spend time
with us and the rest of our family.</b>  Roy couldn’t come as he needed to
work.  Shellie wanted to take the boys and go to <b>“Martin’s Cove”</b> where
Roy’s parents, Veldon &amp; Patsy, were serving a six-month (summer) mission
there.  Shellie wondered if Ken and I could go with them, and we were excited
to go.  We stayed the night with Patsy &amp; Veldon’s neighbor and Shellie and
the boys stayed with Patsy &amp; Veldon in their RV. They have to have RV’s to
stay in with these service missions.  We had a great time, although it was cold
and windy.  The visitors center was wonderful and we saw my great grandfather,
Lyman Wight’s name on the list of those who went to rescue the handcart saints,
who were stranded here in Wyoming in the terrible cold, snow and wind of
winter.  How any of them survived is a miracle.  They had handcarts there that
we could pull each other in.  Veldon took us in his outdoor vehicle to the spot
that they call “Martin’s Cove” where the saints were trying to get by the hills
to get out of the terrible cold.  We saw many other sights there and enjoyed
the time with Shellie and our grandsons.  Also, with Patsy &amp; Veldon, as
they are good friends. </a></p>
