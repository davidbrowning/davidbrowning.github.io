# Chapter 70 -CHERISHED TRADITIONS, FAVORITES, ETC.:

# Surprise Time:
I used to like to surprise the children with a small gift or treat.  I would hide it behind my back and go into the room where the children were and say "Surprise Time" They would close their eyes and hold out their hands and I would put the gift or treat in their hands and then they could open their eyes.  They were always happy when they saw the treat and were appreciative.  I've always liked to do special things for my special children.

# Put up your dukes:
When the children would argue, quarrel or fight, sometimes I would go to them and say "Put up your dukes" and I would dance around them with my hands quenched and being in a boxing position.  They would usually start laughing and this would end the quarrel.
I tried all different methods to have peace in our home.  I liked this one the best.  Sometimes I would send them to their rooms, sometimes I had them sit on the couch or a chair, sometimes I would have them apologize to each other, sometimes I would lecture them.  I tried all different ways.  Sometimes, I lost my temper and I didn't like myself when I did that, and I would try to go back to them afterwards and apologize and explain the problem we had and how we should have handled it.

# Tucking the children in at bedtime:
I always liked to tuck the children in at bedtime, give them a hug & kiss, tell them I loved them and to sleep well.  When I was growing up I always wanted my mother to do this for me, but I don't remember her doing so.  I would usually go to her and give her a hug and go off to bed alone.  That isn't such a terrible thing, and I knew Mom loved me, but I always wanted to be tucked in.  When we were living in  and Mike was a Junior in High School and David a Sophomore, they still liked me to tuck them in.  Ken's mom was visiting us at one time, and David yelled up "Aren’t you coming to tuck us in, Mom?"  I called back "I'll be right down".  Ken's mom said "Oh, those boys are too big to be tucked in, you shouldn't have to go down those steps and tuck them in at night."  I said to her "Mom, as long as they want me to tuck them in, I will be glad to do it.  That's the time when I get to talk to them and express my love for them."

# 12 days of Christmas;
The** **second** **Christmas** **when** **we** **lived** **in** **Firth,  was** **one** **of** **the** **hardest (financially) for** **us.  Ken** **had** **been** **very** **successful** **as** **a** **building** **contractor.  With** **just** **word** **of** **mouth, he** **was** **kept** **very** **busy** **with** **building** **new** **homes, & remodeling** **others.  He** **had** **work** **scheduled** **for** **several** **months** **ahead** **and** **had** **to** **turn** **work** **down.  We** **were** **very** **blessed, but** **when** **November** **came** **and** **the** **farmers** **found** **out** **that** **the** **potatoes** **in** **their** **cellars** **were** **spoiling** **because** **of** **frost** **when** **they** **were** **harvested, and** **they** **would** **have** **to** **throw** **all** **of** **them** **out, many** **went** **bankrupt, and** **others** **were** **holding** **on** **just** **by** **a** **thread** **as** **this** **was** **the** **3rd** **year** **in** **a** **row** **that** **they** **had** **crop** **failure.  All** **of** **a** **sudden, Ken** **was** **without** **work.  The** **people** **could** **no** **longer** **afford** **to** **build** **new** **homes** **or** **remodel** **old** **ones.  Ken** **called** **other** **contractors** **to** **see** **if** **they** **had** **work** **and** **they** **did** **not, many** **were** **leaving** **the** **state.  I** **could** **see** **as** **Christmas** **drew** **near** **that** **we** **were** **not** **going** **to** **have** **a** **very** **big** **Christmas.  I** **had** **purchased** **a** **few** **gifts** **earlier** **on** **sale** **as** **I** **usually** **do** **each** **year, but** **it** **still** **wasn't** **very** **much.  I** **wondered** **what** **to** **do, and** **finally** **decided** **to** **purchase** **small** **gifts** **or** **treats** **for** **each** **of** **the** **children** **and** **do** **the** **12** **days** **of** **Christmas** **for** **them - to** **make** **this** **Christmas** **special** **even** **though** **they** **would** **not** **receive** **much** **on** **Christmas** **Day.  Each** **day** **just** **before** **they** **came** **home** **from** **school, I** **would** **put** **a** **small** **gift** **or** **treat** **on** **their** **pillow** **with** **a** **note.  It** **was** **fun** **to** **watch** **them.  The** **first** **day, one** **of** **the** **children** **went** **to** **their** **room** **and** **happened** **to** **find** **the** **treat, was** **excited** **and** **came** **out** **eating** **it.  When** **the** **others** **saw** **it, they** **asked** **where** **he** **got** **it.  When** **he** **told** **them, they** **ran** **to** **their** **rooms** **and** **were** **excited** **to** **find** **the** **treat.  From** **that** **day** **on, each** **day** **they** **were** **excited** **to** **go** **to** **their** **rooms** **when** **they** **got** **home** **from** **school** **to** **see** **what** **was** **there.  It** **brought** **fun, and** **happiness** **into** **our** **home** **and** **joy** **to** **me** **to** **see** **my** **children** **happy.  I** **feel** **the** **Lord** **inspired** **me** **to** **do** **this** **as** **I** **had** **prayed** **to** **him** **about** **Christmas.

# Waking up the Children in the Mornings:
Many mornings to wake the children up, I would go into their room singing "Good Morning, Good Morning, How are you this Morning.  Good Morning, Good Morning to you."  or "Good Morning to you, Good morning to you.  We're all in our places with Sunshiny faces, oh this is the way to start a new day."
Some of the children were easier to wake up than others.  Some I would have to call several times and others, especially, Scott, woke up usually on their own.  If Scott didn't wake on his own, I would only have to call him once.  I know, from experience, that they liked me to wake them gently and show love.  Sandi, for example, asked that I not have Larina wake her in the mornings as she was unkind to her.  Jeff, on occasion asked that I sing as I woke him.  I wasn't a good singer, in fact, it was usually funny, but most of them liked it anyway.

# Children’s Days:
I was at Relief Society one day when we lived in Ogden and a friend was sharing how she had “Children’s Days” and she explained that she would spend at least one hour and longer if she could, with each of her children on a different day.  The older children would tend the younger children while she spend a one-on-one time with each of her children doing what they wanted to do.  I wanted to incorporate that into my children’s lives.  I was just starting our family at that time so we had Sandy and Shellie.  As we had more children, I kept trying to do this.  They would each have their day of the week (not the weekends when Ken was home) and I would spend at least one hour with that child.  Sometimes the boys wanted to go exploring, play marbles or other games, go bike riding, go get an ice cream cone, or go for a walk.  With the girls, they wanted to ride bikes, play barbies or other games, go for walks, get ice cream, make cookies, etc.  I enjoyed this time as much as they did, and I felt it was important as we could have good talks sometimes while having their day and I could find out if they were concerned about friends, school or other things and they could also share the things that made them happy.

# MAE'S FAVORITES

FAVORITE SONG:  "LOVE AT HOME"

FAVORITE COLOR:  PINK

FAVORITE SCRIPTURE:  1 NEPHI 3:7  "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."

FAVORITE  OF THE WEEK:  Sunday
I look forward to Sunday to rest from the daily cares of the world and focus on the Lord and the blessings he has given me.  I enjoy going to church, feasting on the good word of the Lord, & taking the Sacrament.  I enjoy relaxing & being with our family on this special day.  My mother taught me to wear a dress or skirt & blouse on this day - which shows more respect to the Lord.  I am thankful for her example and I do dress up some instead of being in my casual clothes
Some have said Keeping the Sabbath Day Holy is one of the most important commandments to observe.  I sometimes worry that I have not fully taught our children the importance of strictly obeying this commandment.  They observe this day as the Lord's, some of them more than others, but I wish all of them would realize the important of studying the scriptures and pondering them on this day, and of doing all that the Lord would want us to do on his day.  I would hope that they all would realize that there are 6 other days to clean, do laundry, press clothes, go to the store, go to places of recreation, watch TV, etc.  I need to practice what I preach and I don’t always observe the Sabbath as strictly as I should and I need to do better. I am trying harder.

# OLD SONGS I USED TO SING & LIKE TO SING:

# “YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE”

# “LET THE SUNSHINE IN”
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans sang it

So let the sunshine in, say it with a grim, smilers never lose and frowners never win.
So let the sunshine in, say it with a grim, so open up your heart and let the sunshine in.

If you forget to say your prayers, the Devil jumps with glee, but he feels so awful, awful when he sees you on your knees.  So when you are unhappy and you never seem to win, just open up your heart and let the sunshine in.

When you are unhappy, the Devil wears a grim, but oh he starts to runnin when the light comes pourin in, I know he won’t be happy cuz I’ll never wear a frown, maybe if we keep on smiling, he’ll get tired of hangin round.

If you don’t go to Sunday School, you’ll grow up to be bad. Never know just what you missed, but some day wish you had.  If you want to someday see the Lord, you’d better start today and climb up on the     , a long the upward trail.

DIFFERENT SONG – ’T KNOW TITLE – Roy Rogers and Dale Evans sang it.
So go to the highway, tell them at the byway, tell them that you’re their friend.  Tell them the Church is open, they’re welcome to come in.  Sing just a little bit, talk just a little bit, throw in a smile or two.  Go heavy on the howdy do, for the Lord is counting on you, on you.  The Lord is counting on you.

Song Scott & I made up when he was about four years old.  We sang it for Family Home Evening that night.

“Put a smile on your face and be happy,
Put a smile on your face and be glad
For tomorrow will be
A new day you’ll see
Put a smile on your face and be glad.”






# My favorite scriptures are:

# 1st Nephi 3:7 – “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the things which he commandeth them.”

# 2nd Nephi 9:41 – “O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the Lord, the Holy One, Remember that his paths are righteous.  Behold the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.”
