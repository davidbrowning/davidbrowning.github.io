# Chapter 44 – MY FEELINGS as recorded 10/4/97 and thereafter

I have really been blessed by being born into a home where there is love of family and love of the Lord.  I am so thankful for my wonderful parents who set such a good example for their family.  I am thankful for wonderful brothers & a sister who I love and respect and am thankful for their love.  They have married wonderful spouses and have special families and we all enjoy each other and love to be together.  I am so thankful to be blessed with such a wonderful husband who honors his priesthood, loves the Lord, loves me and our children.  He is a hard worker, honest in all he does, enjoys helping others, enjoys being with his family.

I feel Ken & I have one of the best marriages that there are.  We aren’t perfect - we still get unhappy with each other once in a while, but not very often.   When we do, we talk and work it out, or just get over it.  We want to be together forever so we strive to keep our temple covenants and do what’s right.  We make mistakes as everyone does, but we hope we learn from our mistakes and keep trying to do better.

Ken & I have a lot in common - we both love to dance.  Our first date was to the Stake Sweetheart Ball and we have danced ever since.  We were in the “All Church Dance Festival” the year before we were married.  That was a marvelous experience.  We were ward dance directors while we were living in Sunset in our apartment.  Ken was working nights a lot of the time so it was mainly me teaching the youth.  Ken & I were in a Regional Dance Festival while we were living in Grantsville.  That was GREAT too.  We squared danced for a couple of years.  The name was the "Double J Rustlers".  We really had a lot of fun.  We met at an elementary school in .  We met a lot of nice people, I made several square dance dresses and Ken some shirts or we bought his.  Square dancing is something you can do which is such good exercise and such great fun.  You forget all about any problems you have at home or elsewhere, just concentrate on what the caller is saying and have fun.  We have missed it, but felt at the time that since we were dancing at least once a week, we couldn’t leave the children to do other things that we wanted to do also - go to the temple, visit family & friends, and other activities - so we quit.  We are thinking of starting up again.  In fact, Aunt Wilma brought all her square dance dresses down for me at the family reunion we held at Bob’s in June.  I thought she was giving them to me, but I ended up paying her $10 a dress for 18 dresses and $10 a full slip for 4 slips so $220.00 - so I better start square dancing as I can’t afford to lose that money.

Ken & I go dancing every chance we get - ward & stake dances (there aren’t very many anymore), Red Flame Restaurant in .  They have a dance floor and live bands on Friday & Saturday nights.  And we belong to a dance club (Varianne) which meets once a month in the ballroom at .  They have live bands & orchestras too plus door prizes, decorations and refreshments.  Georgia & Rick are members also and Irven & Sandy have come with us a few times.  Scott & Michelle are planning to come with us and perhaps join.

Ken loves to fish & hunt, but there isn’t very good fishing & hunting in  - so he has about given it up.  He has gone to  a few times with our boys or his brothers.  He & I used to go some and I would read while he fished.  Jeff went with us a few times.

When we got home from our mission to the Philippines, we bought a nice fishing boat.  We had gone fishing with my cousin, Randy and his wife, Judy, in their boat.  We had such a good time, that after we got home, I told Ken that maybe we should buy a fishing boat.  That’s all it took.  I think it was the next day that we went looking for a nice fishing boat.  This boat is not too small and not too large, it’s just right for us.  We can take seven people with us and the motor can troll while we fish or go fast to pull toys behind.

# We have had lots of fishing trips.  Ken and I usually go to East Canyon Reservoir as the fishing is great there.  We have taken grandchildren there and some of our children have brought their families and we camp and fish or just picnic and fish.  We have gone there with my cousin, Randy and his wife, Judy.  They have an RV so they take it and we pull the boat.  We have gone to Strawberry reservoir with them too.  They have a cabin up in the Unitas and Randy has paid Ken to do work on it.  One Summer when our grandson, David, was fifteen and a strong young man, Ken took him, Taylor and myself and we stayed for several days while Ken and David reshingled their steep roof.  That was really a scary and hard job, but they did it.  Taylor and I had fun going for walks, riding Randy’s 4-wheeler, making meals, playing games and visiting.  Randy & Judy invited us to stay with them a couple of times up there too and it was fun.  Since Randy was almost blind at the time, he had large playing cards and if he sat just right so the light could help him, he could play cards with us.  Ken has taken Randy fishing many times.  They sometimes go to East Canyon and sometimes at Strawberry Reservoir.  We have gone with Sandi and Nick to Fish Lake in Southern Utah.  It is my favorite place to go fishing.  It is so beautiful there with pine trees right next to the lake and all around it and up the mountains.  The camping areas are so pretty too.  The first time we went, Chelci had Nathan early so Sandi wasn’t able to go, but Nick wanted to go anyway.  They hadn’t been married very long so we really didn’t know Nick very well, but this was a great way to get to know him.  We all stayed in our tent trailer.  Nick pulled it, while we pulled the boat.  Nick is a great guy and helped with everything and we all had fun together and caught lots of fish.  Sandi and Nick have gone with us two or three times, plus once at Flaming Gorge.  Nick had the idea of having our kids and spouses go in on a paid fishing tour guide who could almost guarantee a large (LARGE) fish.  Nick paid for one too so he and Ken could go together.  They ended up taking Sandi & I and we stayed in camp the day they went out with the guide.  Ken didn’t catch one, but Nick did.  We had a family vacation at Bear Lake and we took our boat and Big Mable (our water toy) and David & Shauna brought their boat, so we all had a great time, fishing, water skiing or playing on Big Mable & other water toys.  We rented a large home there with several bedrooms and hideabeds.  It was a fun place.  We took turns fixing the meals and we played games and visited there also.

We love to camp.  That has been mainly what we have done for family vacations and we continue to do that with our married children and their families.  This year we all went to Ti-ah campground up Cedar Canyon.  We camped there for three days then went to the big extended Bushnell Reunion at the College Lodge up Cedar Canyon.  Ken & I bought a tent trailer from my brother, Bryce, several years ago for $400.00.  Boy, have we ever gotten our money’s worth.  I wouldn’t sell the tent trailer for anything.  (Well, unless we had the money to buy a trailer or RV - but I wouldn’t unless we had the money for gas also as they take a lot more fuel) The tent trailer sleeps six people and it is roomy and open.  We have really enjoyed it.  Mom & Dad bought a membership in Camperworld several years ago - so Ken & I have enjoyed going to the various campsites where they have pools, hot tubs, tennis courts, clubhouses, playgrounds, nice bathroom & showers, etc.

**Ken likes me to read good books to him while we travel**.  I also enjoy doing that and we have read lots of good books that way.  One of the books we read was Pres. Hinckley's book (His Biography).  Pres. Hinckley is such a great prophet.  He is so amazing.  He didn't want this book written on him, but too many others pressured him to let it be written - to help the saints.  It is surely a help - he is such an inspiration and great example.  Ken & I can hardly put the book down.  Sister Sherri Dew, the 2nd counselor of the General Relief Society Presidency, was the person who wrote the book.  She also did the life story of one of the other prophets.  We also read the Ensigns and scriptures.  We take a book, Ensign or the scriptures with us even if we are just going to the store or to visit our Moms or anywhere.  It is surprising how much it accumulates when we just read 10 or 15 minutes here and there, and when we go to  or on trips we really get a lot read. We used to sing as we traveled, but then started reading - so our voices aren’t as good anymore - we mainly only sing at church.  My parents always sang as they traveled and I grew up learning my parent’s good old songs.  I have them on this history.

We want our family forever also.  We may be prejudiced, but we feel we have the best children, their spouses and grandchildren that there are.  We are so thankful for them.  They are good, talented and wonderful children and have been blessed with wonderful spouses.  We couldn't have picked out better ones.  We are so thankful for each of them.  Ken & I love our grandchildren and enjoy being with them.  We hope we set a good example for them and we hope they will always know of our love for each of them and want to come to visit Grandpa & Grandma.

# Ken and I have not been as wise as we should have with regard to financial decisions, although, we have tried to be frugal.  We don't feel we waste money, or are extravagant.  We take care of our furniture and belongings; we have usually had a garden and canned, frozen, & dried fruits and vegetables.  We have involved the children in this.  Both Ken & I have made homemade bread - partly to save money and partly because we liked it better.  I have cut Ken's hair and our boy's hair since they were little and when they married, most of their wives took over (at least if our sons were wise in how they handled it the first time.)  When we would go over ways to save money, we found we were already doing most, if not all, the things that were suggested.  We haven't bought expensive furniture, clothes, jewelry, make-up, taken many vacations, etc.
We have tried to always have at least partial food storage.  But we haven't saved like we should have and we have moved many times.  Someone has said that three moves are like a burnout (a fire destroying all your assets).  I know it is really expensive.  I blame myself partially for this.  My dad worked at the Arsenal (which became part of Hill Air Force Base) for 28 years.  He hated it.  He worked with men who had foil language, smoked, drank, etc. and he didn't like his work either.  He wanted to quit several times, but Mom wouldn't let him as she reminded him that they needed the benefits, retirements, etc. that he was building up.
I remember one-time dad wanting to quit and sell Beneficial Life Insurance full time.  He had been selling part-time and was doing better than most full-time salesmen.  Again, Mom, said "no".  I couldn't understand that**.  I felt he should be able to do what he wanted since he was the breadwinner, and I determined that when I married, my husband would be able to do whatever he wanted with his occupation.  Consequently, Ken did change jobs frequently, and for the most part I supported him.  Ken is a perfectionist, is very talented and a logical thinker - so whatever he did, he did well** - whether he was a computer operator, programmer, data processing manager, carpenter, contractor, farmer, etc.  He did go into sales a few times - insurance, cabinets, etc., but he didn't enjoy being a salesman.
One of the problems Ken had was that he expected a lot of himself and he produced excellent results - and he also expected a lot of others, and they didn't always come through.  We are all different and for one reason or another (personality, not as talented, not caring, dishonesty, feeling their way was right and not wanting to change, etc) they wouldn't perform like Ken expected them to so he would get upset with them, criticize them and many times end up quitting his job.  Thus, we moved around a lot.  Ken has gained a lot of experience, but he feels a failure in not having built up any retirement or savings for the future. Another reason Ken hasn’t made much money in his occupation of building - was that he was too good to the people.  He wanted to be fair and not cheat them, so he cheated himself.  I am proud of him and would surely rather be poor and have a good, honest, charitable husband than be rich and have a dishonest, greedy and selfish man for a husband.  We haven’t been poor - we have struggled most of the time, but we’ve had plenty to eat, wear and had nice homes to live in.  I’ve had a wonderful life and have been very blessed.
One of the hardest things for Ken was having me go to work.  He never wanted his wife to have to work.  I didn't work from the time Sandi was born until we had major financial problems in  the last time we were there.

# Hale’s Theatre – We had season tickets one year to their plays, plus we have gone other times.  For several years to celebrate Ken & Irven’s birthdays (which are only 3 days apart), us two couples would go to dinner and then to a play at Hale’s Theatre

I would like to record my feelings about the last few weeks**.  **Today is .  August has been a busy month, as most of the months are**.  **Our immediate family planned a vacation prior to our large Bushnell Reunion at the college lodge in .  We reserved campsites at Ta-Hi campgrounds near **Navajo Lake**.  **Navajo Lake** is close to** Cedar Canyon**.  Prior to going to the Bushnell Reunion at the Lodge in** Cedar Canyon**, we went to **Navajo Lake** with our family and had a great time, fishing, boating, sharing food and eating together, playing games, etc**.  **We always love to be with our children**.  **One thing I remember about that trip was that one day when I was fishing, the reel wasn’t working right (or I wasn’t doing it correctly), anyway I caught a fish, but I was reeling out instead of in and someone noticed it**.  **It was a wonder the fish didn’t get off the hook, but I was able to bring it in**.  **We then all went to the reunion and had a great time there as well.

1997 - Several months ago, **Ken's brother, Roy, called us to tell us about his son, Steve**.   was angry and very upset.  Steve had been wild in his teenage years, gotten in with the wrong crowd and got on drugs.  He straightened out mainly when Roy & Linda had Julianna.  They had adopted Steve & Barbie, but Linda was promised in her patriarchal blessing that she would have children of her own.  Since it had been 20 years, they had given up and felt the blessing meant in the millennium or something.  Well, she did conceive and had Julianna.  The people in their ward called Linda "Sarah".  This did a lot for Steve as he loved Julianna and would stay home to be with her rather than go with his friends.  This gave Roy & Linda a chance to talk & reason with him.  He went on a mission to  and was assistant to the president of the mission who was Elder Kakuchi.  He loved this time with him.  He came home & went to Rich's college where he met a special girl and they were married.  A short time afterward on a Saturday morning, he had gone to a business meeting, and when he returned he found her dead in the bathtub.  She was taking a bath when she had an epileptic seizure and drowned.  He was so devastated.   called Elder Kakuchi and he came to speak at the funeral.  He gave Steve a blessing and had a good talk with him.  He moved to  and went to BYU where he met another darling girl and married her.  They had two little girls, but the problem was he compared the second wife to the first wife - who he said was much prettier and better.  He finally told the second wife that she was a good roommate, but he didn't have romantic interests in her.  I can't imagine how this would have hurt her.  She went to visit her parents in  and when she returned, Steve had moved out to live with his druggie friend from high school who was living in .  She went back to live with her parents.  Steve thought he could live a wonderful life.  He had been making big money, bought a BMW, had a hair transplant (since he was becoming bald), worked out at a gym and really thought he was a lady's man.  He started going out with his so-called "society friends", but found them to be shallow.  He realized "too late" that he really did love his wife and what a wonderful woman she was, and he missed his darling children - so called her to see if she would take him back.  She said "no way, I'm happier now than I have ever been since I married you.  I don't want to go through anymore of that".  He begged her and promised that he would change, but it did no good.  He has really gone through "Hell" - trying to repent.  He moved down to  so he could be good to his children and help with them.  I sure hope it works out for him.  He said Satan just gradually lead him down to Hell and he didn't even realize how it happened.  He let down his guard and probably quit studying the scriptures and praying like he should.  I will pray continually that I, Ken or none of our children, their spouses and our grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc, will let down our guard.
I pray that we will be faithful all the days of our lives - that we may be together forever.  My parents, grandparents, great-grandparent have been wonderful faithful people and have set us the proper example.  I pray this will continue.

# Oct. 12, 1997
# This weekend we tended David & Taylor while Mike & Becky went to Park City for the weekend for their 7th anniversary.  We went down to their home yesterday morning to pick up the children.  Becky's mom had been tending the children as Mike & Becky left on Friday morning.  We had planned to take them to Camperworld since Ken & I haven't been able to get up there this summer, but the weather turned off cold and rained down here, but snowed in the mountains - so we changed our plans.  I was glad Ken went with me to be with the children as I don't like driving in the rain and Ken doesn't mind it - plus I love being with Ken. We had lots of fun with them as they are such good and cute grandchildren.  David was five years old and Taylor was three.  I took them for rides around the block in their wagon, and sometimes David would ride his tricycle, while I pulled Taylor in the wagon.  We played with Lego blocks and other games, and enjoyed these little ones

# 1997 Christmas letter
Another year has swiftly passed by bringing us some good experiences and some not so good.  This life is full of ups and downs, but we have to make the most of it and enjoy life.  I've learned over the years that attitude really makes a difference.  Some people are very happy even though they have many problems in this life, and other people are miserable when it seems they have everything that should make them happy.

Our oldest child, Sandi, has been married for over 16 years and recently divorced her husband.  She hasn't been happy, so we hope the future will be brighter.  We continue to pray for her and her daughters JaNae & Chelci and also Dave.  Divorce is never easy.  Sandi and Dave have joint custody of the girls, but Chelci is living with her mom and JaNae with her dad.  JaNae is a cheerleader at Grantsville High.  Sandi is the head cook at Harris Elementary in Tooele and has an apartment right next door.

**Shellie** & Roy have two little boys, Garrett age 6 and Quint age 2.  **Shellie** is expecting their third son in April.  **Shellie**, like Becky, doesn't work outside the home, but is kept busy with her family and being in the Young Women's presidency.  I flew down to visit a couple of weeks ago and surely enjoyed my week there.  It was so relaxing and fun to just read stories to the boys and play games with them.  There are several man-made lakes in the area where they live, and it's so beautiful and the weather so wonderful that we went on several walks and to the parks, etc.  **Shellie** and Roy couldn't have been better to me, it was a great week.  The only thing which could have made it better was for Ken to have been there also.  He had too much work at the mall and had used his vacation time building an apartment for his Mom in his brother, Bob's basement.

**Mike**, Becky and their two little ones, David age 4 and Taylor age 1 live in .  **Mike** teaches special education in both the elementary and high schools there.  He also does some coaching in athletics, especially football.  Becky doesn't work outside the home and it's a good thing because she is the Relief Society President in their ward so between that and the two children, she keeps pretty busy.  They really enjoy the small-town atmosphere.  They were down this summer, for most of the summer, and we got to enjoy them quite often on the weekends.

David & Shauna live in .  **David **is going to school full time at Weber and will graduate this summer.  He is in the medicine field, so even though he will have his four-year degree, he still has lots of schooling ahead.  He gets good grades so is fortunate to have scholarships to pay his tuition.  He also works part-time at the FHP lab in .  Shauna is a nurse and has been working at the  in , however, she just accepted a position at the  so will start there right away.  David & Shauna are both secretaries.  **David **in the Young Men's presidency and Shauna in the young women's.

**Scott** returned from his mission to  in May.  We were excited to have him home again, and so was his girlfriend, Mishelle, who waited for him.  They are engaged at the present and would like to marry, but they had some sad news shortly after his return.  She had had a cough for several months and finally the doctor took a chest x-ray and found cancer in her lungs.  She is undergoing chemotherapy at the present.  These treatments will last until at least March.  Even though it is tough, she has a lot of faith and a good attitude and is determined to beat it.
Jeff, our youngest, is a senior at Layton High.  He works part-time at the 5 Points Mall in Bountiful where his dad is the maintenance director.  That works out pretty well since with Jeff being so involved in music and drama at the high school, Ken works with him to have time off when he needs it.  He is especially busy this time of year with performances just about every evening and weekends.  They just finished a play a couple of weeks ago and now their singing groups are performing.

I changed jobs this summer.  I left Lincoln Elementary to be the secretary of Staff Development at the district office.  Claudia Seeley is the Director of Staff Development and my boss.  She's great to work for, plus my first principal, Sandy Petersen, is the liaison between the  and the district and one of my boss's also.  It's great to be working with her again - she's wonderful.  I like what I do, but it's a very busy department, so to keep up, I work long hours which I would prefer to be at home with my family.  Hopefully, I can get it better organized so I won't be working long hours.  I'm still in the Stake Relief Society Presidency so I appreciate Ken & the boys helping me with the house work & meals.  Ken is still in the High Council and enjoys it except for the speaking assignments.  I think he does a good job at this, but he would prefer letting others do the speaking.  I feel that way about my position also, but guess we learn from doing.
