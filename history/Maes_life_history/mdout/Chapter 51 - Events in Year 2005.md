Chapter 51 – Events in year 2005

We arrived home, from our mission, the 17th of February and since that time we have had many wonderful family get-to-gathers as well as visiting our good friends again.  While we were on our mission, two more grandchildren were born.  **Mike and Becky had a ****daughter, which they named Jessica, and David & Shauna had a son, which they named Connor**.  We were excited to see them, as well as all our other grandchildren and their parents, when we arrived home
A little great-granddaughter, Kennedy Grace, was born soon after we arrived home to our granddaughter, JaNae, and her husband, Brad.  Sandi was excited to have another grandchild.  That makes 15 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren for us.  Sandi’s younger daughter, Chelci, just called yesterday with good news that she is getting married in the  on the 11th** of March**.  We are very excited for her and her fiancée.  Scott graduated from  while we were gone and Jeff graduated from the  this past April.  They were both happy to be finished with college studies and have more time for their families.

# We had our family vacation at Shellie & Roys in July of 2005 – We celebrated the 4th of July there.
**We** **also** **went** **to** **Anchorage** **Alaska** **to** **Terry & Angela’s** **in** **July** 2005 – for** **more** **on** **these** **vacations, see** **Chapter** **55 – Vacations** **and** **Reunions

We have postponed the building of our home in  due to the costs in building materials tripling since we have been gone.  We had sold our home in Layton to Scott and Mishelle.  We are now living in the cute basement apartment, which Ken built for his mother a few years ago in Bob & Carroll’s home.  Mom Jensen passed away prior to our going on our mission.  Bob & Carroll told us that we should live in the apartment, as our furniture was there, and they said we could share all the expenses.  I was excited to do that as I loved that cute apartment.  Bob & Carroll are wonderful to us and we enjoy the Clinton 20th ward, so for the present, we are happy to be here.  We live close to most of our children as well as most of our brothers and their families and my sister and her family, which makes it nice also.  We are very thankful for the many blessings the Lord has blessed us with, especially the gospel, our family and friends, and to live here in America.

# In October, 2005, Shellie and the boys came up in 2005 to visit and spend time with us and the rest of our family.  Roy couldn’t come as he needed to work.  Shellie wanted to take the boys and go to “Martin’s Cove” where Roy’s parents, Veldon & Patsy, were serving a six-month (summer) mission there.  Shellie wondered if Ken and I could go with them, and we were excited to go.  (More on chapter 53 – Vacations & Reunions)
