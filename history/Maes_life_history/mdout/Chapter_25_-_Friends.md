# Chapter 23 – FRIENDS (I need to update this)

We have had many friends while living in our three wards.  Some are very special.  **Bishop and June Moulton** will always hold a place in our hearts.  They are very spiritual, humble people.  They were like our second parents.
Our dearest truest friends are **Larry and Tammy Braithwaite**.  Tammy is just like a sister to me, except as she has often said, we never fight like sisters do.  We were together a lot, either just the two of us with our children or with our husbands or families.  We ate at each other’s homes, played games, went on trips together, went camping together a lot, we had so much fun together.  Either she or I would call and say “What are you doing today?”  And then we would say:“Let’s take the children and go to the park, or get a sitter and go shopping, or let’s bake together today.”  We had so much in common that we could talk about anything.  Pat & I were always best friends, but I think Tammy & I were even closer, we really enjoyed being together.
We were good friends with **Pete and Grace Mooney**.  Pete was so much fun.  He was really a character.  We enjoyed getting together with them.  Sometime after we moved, Pete was put in the Bishopric.  We went over to the ward as they were having something special - missionary farewell or something (can’t remember for sure), anyway, we were five or so minutes late and when we walked in we saw a row in the middle isle partway up in the chapel and as we walked up there, Pete was conducting and he said “Well, if it isn’t our good friends Ken & Mae Browning and their family.  Wow, you’ve got a big family now, don’t you?  You take up an entire row.”  Everyone chuckled.  We were a little embarrassed, but that was just Pete.
Our other goodfriends are Bob & **Pauline Hein, and John and Linda Willerton**.  When we were in the Mount Fort Ward, we got together in the Young Marrieds Program and had a lot of fun together.  Since we enjoyed each other’s company, we started going to the temple together, getting together for family home evenings and eating at each other’s homes.  John & Linda moved into a home in .  Bob & Pauline bought a home in  , we moved to  and Larry & Tammy to .  We still get together once or twice a month at each other’s homes for family night and Sunday dinners.  Now Larry & Tammy & Ken & I have moved to , but we write to the others and hope to get together with them occasionally.  We have been fortunate to have wonderful friends.  I am also thankful for my wonderful brothers and sister, and my wonderful sisters-in-law.  Jean and I have been very close and I miss not being able to get together like we used to, but we write and get together whenever Ken and I get up.

**Bishop** **and** **Shirley** **Murdock** will** **always** **be** **good** **friends.  Ken** **loved** **being** **Kent’s** **counselor.  I** **write** **to **Ione** & **Carolyn**, who** **were** **my** **counselors** **when** **I** **was** **Primary** **President** **in** **Clearfield** **and** **we** **go** **out** **for** **lunch** **when** **we** **are** **living** **close** **by.   **RaNae**** **and** **I** **call** **or** **get** **together** **when** **we** **can** **also.  I** **think** **a** **lot** **of** **them, they** **are** **great** **friends. **RaNae**** & **Richard** **are** **the** **second** **couple** **from** **the** **left – next** **to** **Bishop** & **Shirley.
