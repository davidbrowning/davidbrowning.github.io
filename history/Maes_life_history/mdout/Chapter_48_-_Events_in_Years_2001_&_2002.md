# Chapter 48 - EVENTS IN 2001 & 2002

**FUN DAY**: Ken and I had been taking turns with Irven & Sandy staying with Mom Jensen as she had to have round-the-clock care.  This one Saturday, Ken was staying with her while I stayed at home to clean, do laundry, trim the lawns, go grocery shopping, etc.  Ken had mowed the lawns early before he went over to be with his mom.  I decided to trim before it got too hot.  When I came in to get a drink of water, the phone rang **and Scott asked if I had remembered that it was Kylan’s birthday and that they had invited me to go swimming with them**.  I remembered his birthday, but forgot about going swimming.  I asked them when they were going and they said “in about 15 minutes”.  I told them I’d meet them at the  pool.  I hurried and changed and drove over.  We had a wonderful time and stayed for about 3 hours.  Scott & Mishelle had bought a float tube for Kylan and he loved it and had a great time.  We took turns playing with him and swimming.  Scott did some great dives off the high diving board and the lower one - flips, backwards, etc.  Scott was on the  diving team and went to state.  I love to watch him.  He’s modest so doesn’t want to do it if there are too many people.  Mishelle and I even went off the lower diving board.  She dove, but I just jumped off.  I used to dive when I was younger, but I’m too nervous now.  I really had a great time being with Scott, Mishelle and little Kylan and I love to swim - so it was great.
I gave them my gift and Kylan opened it and I left for home, changed back into my grubbies and was heading out to finish trimming the lawns when **Jeff came up the stairs and asked if I would like to go see the movie “Pearl Harbor” with him**.  He said he had been calling his friends, but either they weren’t home or couldn’t go.  I said “Oh Jeff, I’ve been playing for 3 hours and I’ve got so much to do”.  He said “Oh Mom, you need to watch the Disney video “Jungle Book” more and be like Baloo - he just enjoyed life and doesn’t take it so seriously.”  Jeff told me he would do the vacuuming when we got home.  I said “Ok” and went up to change my clothes again.  It was fun being with Jeff and visiting.  He’s a special son and it was great “bonding” together (as he put it).  The show was good, it was amazing to see what actually went on when  was bombed by the Japanese.  It only had a little “dog poop” (bad language and a love scene). I had been told by many good people that the show is incredible and doesn’t have anything “bad” in it, but there was.  Boy, it’s getting harder and harder to go to movies anymore because of the language, sex and violence.  Ken and I just mainly rent old movies on video instead of going to the movies.
Anyway, I still enjoyed it and enjoyed being with Jeff.  I changed into my grubbies for the 3rd time and was on my way to at least finish trimming before it was too dark and the phone rang.  **It was Scott asking if I wanted to come over and watch Kylan open his presents and have cake and ice cream**.  I said to myself “what the heck”, that’s more important than house cleaning so I asked them to give me a few minutes to finish trimming and I would be over.  I quickly finished trimming, changed clothes again and drove over to their home.  Kylan was tired as he hadn’t had a nap, but he was cute most of the time anyway.  Mishelle made him a cupcake and put a big candle in and lit it.  She helped him blow it out and took the candle out and let him have to it.  He didn’t grab it, instead he took little pieces off the edges of the cupcake with his thumb and index finger and ate it.  Mishelle scared him accidently and he started crying so they got him down to open his presents.  I got some cute pictures.  It was fun being with them and I was glad they had invited me over.  Ken was staying the night at his mom’s, but when I got home, he called.  He had called earlier and was worried since no one was home, wondering where I was.  He prayed and had a good feeling that I was alright and the thought came to him that I might be at Scott’s.  I’m sure thankful for prayer as I have prayed about him and the children different times when I have been worried about them and I get that comforting, peaceful feeling too and can relax.  Well, I had a fun day - didn’t accomplish much on the list of things I had planned to do, but it was a wonderful day.  Jeff did vacuum for me and I stayed up late getting a few things done.

**Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001**, on the way to work, I was listening to the radio when the news came on of the terrible tragedies which happened to the **Twin Trade Towers in New York and the ****Pentagon** in Washington D.C.   Two planes were hijacked and flew right into the Twin Trade Towers in New York City.  The Hijackers were illegal aliens from the  - terrorists.   I was devastated and could not believe what I had just heard.  Then a third plane hit the **Pentagon**.  We found out several days later that over 6,000 people were killed.  That news has greatly affected not only the citizens of the , but the people throughout the world.  We have been praying all week for the people who mourn the loss of their loved ones who were killed, for the firemen and rescuers, for those who were injured and for the President of the United States and the other leaders of our country.  We have realized later that these twin towers could not have come down this way.  A science professor at BYU told about that and the church had to tell him that he could not tell the public this as he was representing the Church.  He wouldn’t stop, so he was fired.  Of course, the media did not tell his information, now that he was fired.  They would have made it a real story if they could have criticized the church. Satan has control of the media, he has great power in the world today.  There are many who feel this destruction of the Twin Towers was done deliberately as since then our government have made such strict regulations and have more control over us.  We had a good president in Ronald Regan, but since then it has gone downhill.  But, we are told that in the last days there would be much wickedness, evil, corruption and confusion and it surely is.
Since then we have had a drug which is a powder sent in letters throughout the country and some have died from that drug.  They feel these are from terrorist also.

**This last week, Oct 20 - 23, 2001**, there were so many terrible things reported in the news that it made me depressed and upset and I didn’t want to listen to the news anymore and I haven’t for a few days.  The news told of a man & his wife who had separated.  He took his two small children up in the mountains by Stockton (South of Tooele), shot and killed the baby boy in his car seat and when the little girl started running, he shot and killed her, and then he turned the gun on him and took his life.  Another incident happened in Tooele - a little boy found his dad’s loaded rifle and shot and killed his little brother.  In a daycare center a baby was killed.  A couple of little boys (ages 3 & 4) killed the baby girl.  The daycare lady had gone outside to check on the other children I understand.  Another report told of two men who shot and killed two deer hunters -just to get their truck.  They led the police on a chase and escaped for a couple of days, but were found and are in custody now.  The deer hunters were young men in their 20's.  The one was married and had 3 small children.  This world is getting so wicked; it scares me for my children and grandchildren.  I hope and pray they will be strong and can overcome the powers of Satan and stay strong in the gospel and stand for the right.

**Sandi & Terry’s cabin in Star Valley, Wyoming** – Sandi & Terry had gone in with another couple (friends from Grantsville) to buy a beautiful cabin among the pines in Star Valley, Wyoming.  There were other cabins there and they had a golf course, swimming pool, etc.  It was a beautiful area and Sandi and her friend decorated it so beautifully (Sandi mainly as she is very talented at furnishing and decorating).  Sandi and Terry invited Ken and I to go up to their cabin with them several times.  Ken, Terry & Sandi would go fishing on the stream which was close by, just west of the main road in Island Park.  I would go with them and take pictures and read my book.  It was so beautiful there in their cabin and on their property.  We played games, helped each other fix meals, visited, rode their 4 wheelers in the summer and snowmobiles in the winter.  We also went to the cheese factory and bought ice cream and cheese curd.
Sandi and Terry invited all our family to their cabin during the Christmas holidays in 2001.   Shellie, Roy & boys came up too.  It was after.  We stayed for several days and we all had a ball.  Our family is great together and all work together for meals, cleanup, etc.  We had lots of fun playing games, visiting, and riding their 4 wheelers and snowmobiles.  Sandi & Terry also had sleds, so we all dressed up in our warm clothes, boots, hats and gloves and went sleigh riding down the road that led just above their home to the end and then others would be on the snowmobiles and pull the ones on the sleds back up the hill.  We all had a great time doing that and we had snowball fights, etc.
That is the time we found out about the property we bought.  Ken had been out on one of their 4 wheelers and had passed by a sign that said property for sale by owner $10,000.  Mike told us and we couldn’t believe someone was selling it for only $10,000.  The phone number was on the sign.  It was filled with quaking aspen trees and was a large corner lot.  We called on it and to make a long story short, we were able to purchase it with the goal of building our home on it at a future date.

**December 2001**: (Another writeup of it, so I’ve included both)
Sandi & Terry invited our family to come to their cabin the day after Christmas and spend the rest of that week there with them.  I think most, if not all, of our family were there.  We had such a great time and Sandi & Terry were a great host and hostess.  We played games, visited, went sleigh riding down the road by their house with their snowmobiles pulling us back up, ate great meals and just enjoyed relaxing and being together.  We have a close family and we are so thankful for that.  Everyone enjoys being together.
While there, Mike was riding Sandi and Terry’s four-wheeler and road past a building lot that was for sale for $10,000.  He was amazed at that price and told Ken and I about it.  He took us back and we looked at the beautiful corner lot with lots of quaking aspen trees.  We got the phone number to call.  We thought that would be a great investment even if we didn’t build on it, but the thought crossed our minds that we might want to build on it.  We prayed about it and both of us had a good feeling about it.  Ken has always wanted to build our own home and this might be the right opportunity.  We called and were able to purchase it.


# 2002 – Vacations

Saturday, May 25, 2002.  What a busy life.  Ken called me at work yesterday to say he had gotten off work early and was planning to clean the carpet in our bedroom, but noticed, after moving out the furniture, that the walls really needed to be painted so wondered if he should go buy a paint sprayer and start painting it.  We decided to do that since that bedroom had not been painted when we painted the house when Scott came home from his mission.  The sprayer cost $700.00, but we wouldn’t have to pay for it until the first of the year.  Ken rationalized that he would need the sprayer when we build our home in .  When I came home, I helped Ken finish moving the furniture, vacuumed the carpet and started washing the walls and trim.  We then taped it and Ken sprayed it.  It was after mid-night when we went to bed.  I was surprised that it took so long to get it ready to paint.  We slept in the North bedroom.
Ken got up early the next morning and started cleaning the carpet.  We then left for  as we wanted to look at some other property to make sure our lot was where we wanted to build.  The other property we looked at wouldn’t work out for us and when we looked at our property again, we loved it and really want to build there.  We sure hope it works out that we can.  We did meet a wonderful LDS couple who have a beautiful home with a gorgeous view and had a good visit with them.  They are retired, have gone on a mission and used to live in .  They, like us, wanted to get away from the city and the traffic and have a slower, more peaceful life.  Ken and I loved the drive up and back and loved being in that beautiful valley.  We visited with Uncle June and his family.  He hasn’t been well.  We were tired when we arrived back home that night, but we still had to put our bedroom back in place as the next day was Sunday.

Lake Mead/Los Vegas – Ken and I were invited to go with Mike and David’s families in **June of 2002**.  They rented a nice home with a swimming pool for a week and we went boating and water skiing on Lake Mead.  The home had a pool table and we took other games, so we had a great time together.  We also went into Las Vegas one day and I was impressed by the beautiful water fountains and how they dance to lights and music.  We had a wonderful vacation.

**Motorcycle trip with Ken in fall of 2002** – Quint had sent us a paper cutout of himself (a flat Stanley) and we were to do something fun and take the cutout with us and then send it back to Quint with pictures and a report of what we did.  It was for a school project.  We decided to borrow Jeff’s motorcycle and go on a trip to see the fall leaves.  We first went to Denny’s to eat breakfast, then rode up Weber Canyon and on to Coleville, then on to Heber City where we stopped for lunch and also eat a frozen yogurt at Ken’s favorite yogurt place** – **Caroline’s.  We drove down one of the canyon’s** – **Emigration, it seems like.  We had a great time.  We took pictures all along the way and then sent them to Quint with his cutout and a report of what we did.  It was a fun and beautiful trip.  I loved it, and loved being with Ken.  I felt safe riding in back of him.
