# I Am The Flag of the United States of America
I was born on June 14, 1777 in Philadelphia and I am as old as my nation. There the Continental Congress adopted my stars and stripes as the national flag.  My thirteen stripes alternating red and white, with a union of thirteen white stars in a field of blue, represented a new constellation, a new nation dedicated to the personal and religious liberty of mankind.  Today fifty stars signal from my union, one for each of the fifty sovereign states in the greatest constitutional republic the world has ever known.  My colors symbolize the patriotic ideals and spiritual qualities of the citizens of my country.  My red stripes proclaim the fearless courage and integrity of American men and boys and the self-sacrifice and devotion of American mothers and daughters.
My white stripes stand for liberty and equality for all.  My blue is the blue of heaven, loyalty, and faith.  I represent these eternal principles: liberty, justice, and humanity.  I embody American freedom: freedom of speech, religion, assembly, the press, and the sanctity of the home.  I typify that indomitable spirit of determination brought to my land by Christopher Columbus and by all my forefathers – the Pilgrims, Puritans, settlers at James Town and Plymouth.
I am a living symbol of my nation's law: The Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights.  I voice Abraham Lincoln's philosophy: “A government of the people, by the people, for the people.”  I stand guard over my nation's schools, the seedbed of good citizenship and true patriotism.  I am displayed in every school room throughout my nation; every school yard has a flag pole for my display.  Daily, thousands upon thousands of boys and girls pledge their allegiance to me and my country.  I have my own law-Public Law 829, “The Flag Code” - which definitely states my correct use and display for all occasions and situations.
I have my special day, Flag Day.  June 14 is set aside to honor my birth.  Americans, I am the sacred emblem of your country.  I symbolize your birthright, your heritage of liberty purchased with blood and sorrow.  I am your title deed of freedom, which is yours to enjoy and hold in trust for posterity.
If you fail to keep this sacred trust inviolate, if I am nullified and destroyed, you and your children will become slaves to dictators and despots.  Eternal vigilance is your price of freedom.  As you see me silhouetted against the peaceful skies of my country, remind yourself that I am the flag of your country, that I stand for what you are -no more, no less.  Guard me well, lest your freedom perish from the earth.  Dedicate your lives to those principles for which I stand: “One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”
I was created in freedom.  I made my first appearance in a battle for human liberty.  God grant that I may spend eternity in my “land of the free and the home of the brave” and that I shall ever be known as “Old Glory,” the flag of the United States of America.

# Theodore Roosevelt's ideas on Immigrants and being an AMERICAN in 1907

"In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an Outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birth place, or origin. But this is predicated upon the person's becoming in every Facet an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.
(I sure agree with this, and there are many coming into our country now (2016 & before) who are not doing this.)

The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.  
**Thomas Jefferson**

This is so true, and so many people in the United States are on Welfare.  Some should be on welfare because their health is so bad that they cannot work, but there are many who can and should work to provide for themselves and their families.  Many people are brought up this way, and so they just expect the government to take care of them.  That is sad for them and for all of us who pay taxes which pays for these people

# President Obama was not a good United States President.  (2008 – 2016) He was not a good person, at least that’s how I feel and know, from what I have seen, read and heard. He enacted some bad laws and Executive Orders.
# ObamaCare!! (not good)

# President Donald Trump might not be the best president, but he is much better than Obama and he is trying to keep his presidential promises.  He is loud and says or “tweets” things he shouldn’t, but he is a “Christian, which Obama was not” and he is trying to stand by the constitution, thank goodness. (2017 –

# They say when a good ruler is in, he puts in good people to help him and rules in fairness, and the people are happy, but when a bad ruler is in, he put in bad people to help him and the people mourn.

# I don’t feel that we have had a good president since Ronald Regan.  He lived by the constitution and so is President Trump, but most have tried to change it to fit their standards.  Our founding fathers were inspired by God to write the Constitution.  I took a class from Cleon Skouson on the constitution and everyone should study it and know what it says.
