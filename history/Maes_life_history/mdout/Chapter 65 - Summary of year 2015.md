# Chapter 65 – Year 2015

This past year has gone by so quickly, but it seems like they all do.  When we look at our grandchildren and great grandchildren and see how they have grown, we wonder how this could happen so fast.  It seems not that long ago that we were holding our children in our arms, and then we were holding our grandchildren and now we are holding our great grandchildren, but it’s great and we have had a wonderful life.  Ken and I still have relatively good health, so we can enjoy being with our family and friends.  With living here in the Monte Vista Mobile Home Park, and seeing many with health problems due to age, disease and disabilities, we feel very blessed to be able to help ourselves, our family and many of our neighbors and friends.  We also have several couples our age, who we have become friends with and enjoy being with them.  We have a great ward here with a special bishop, who is truly a “Shepherd”.  We are thankful that we live fairly close to most of our children and we sure enjoy being with them.  We love going to the grandchildren’s ball games, recitals, and choir & band concerts.
This past year has brought us two more great grandchildren.  Mike & Becky’s son, David, and his wife, Sierra, had a baby boy, which they named Henry David, born on the 15th** of May**.   Shellie & Roy’s son, Garrett & and his wife, Nora, had a baby boy, which they named Damon Bryce, born on the 5th of September.  That gives us 10 great grandchildren.

# Jeff & Gail needed to leave their beautiful home in Layton and move to Kimberly, Idaho a few months ago because of work.  Kimberly is close to Twin Falls, Idaho.  They have a lovely home there too on an acre of land.  We won’t see them as often as we did, but when we go there, we will stay longer.  Jeff is a Controller over finances in his company.  He works for Chobani in Twin Falls.  Gail is a “stay at home mom” and loves being home with her cute family, but keeps busy as all moms do.  Ben is 9, Rachel is 7 & Matt is 6
# Scott & Mishelle love their nice home & area in West Layton.  They have done a lot of work in their yard and it is beautiful.  Mishelle knows a lot about plants and flowers and has helped me with our flower gardens here too.  Scott works for a company who does custom programming for Hill Air Force Base and he works a couple of nights a week at the DATC tutoring and helping in their data processing classes.  Mishelle is a “stay at home” mom, but works hard there to keep her home & family going smoothly.  Kylan goes to Layton High, Ashley to Legacy Jr. High, and the twins, who turned 7 in October, enjoy their elementary school.
# David & Shauna have a beautiful home in Enterprise, which is close to Morgan.  David is a PA in Dermatology and works in South Ogden.  He is very good at what he does and loves helping his patients.  Shauna works part time from home and she is amazing at how she juggles work, home & family.  Tyler, who is 17 and Emily, who is 15, go to Morgan High, and Connor, who is 11 goes to their Middle School.  They are all straight A students, most of our grandchildren are.  We are proud of all of them.
**Mike & Becky** have a lovely home in American Fork.  Mike is the principle of Orem High and Becky has been working at the elementary school so they both keep really busy with school, home & family.  Their two oldest, David & Paige, are both married to wonderful spouses and live in Logan where they go to the University and work.  We were invited to spend a Saturday with the two couples and had a wonderful time eating, visiting and playing games.  Little Henry wasn’t feeling the best, but we held & enjoyed him anyway.  **Mike & Becky**’s two younger girls, Maddi, who is 14 & Jessie, who is 12 enjoy school, and being in Young Women’s with all the great activities & classes.
# Shellie & Roy moved from Queen Creek back to Chandler, AZ and have a lovely home on a manmade lake.  Roy & Shellie did a lot of remodeling on it and it is amazing what they can do.  Ken & I went down in May and had a wonderful time.  Jase (their youngest, who is 14) was excited for Grandpa to teach him how to fish.  They fished from the shore and in the paddle boat and caught a few fish.  We also enjoyed being with their older sons, Quint & Kevis, and their oldest son, Garrett & His wife, Nora and their little daughter, Maggie.  Damon wasn’t born at that time.  Roy is a good provider so Shellie hasn’t had to work outside the home, but she has always kept really busy.
**Sandi** divorced Nick this year, and she is happier now.  She still lives in her beautiful home in Tooele and works at Grantsville High as their Registrar.   She is planning to retire in about 4 years.  She has a cute dog named, Pipper, and they go running most nights.  She is a leader in the classified association for Tooele District, so keeps really busy.  JaNae & Her family and Chelci and her family both live in Grantsville.  JaNae has 3 children and Chelci has 4 and they are sure growing up fast.

**Chelci sings with a Country Western Band, named “EXIT NINETY NINE**”, and we enjoy going out to listen to them on various occasions. They are very good

# August 2015     I want to record another tender mercy from the Lord.  Irven & Sandy called yesterday to see if Ken & I could go to Orem with them to hear Rand Paul speak.  Rand Paul is campaigning for the Republican presidential nominee.  Rand is a good man and is a senator.  He has worked hard to sponsor & co-sponsor bills to lower our taxes, take power from the federal government and give back to the states, help us keep our religious freedom, etc.  His father, Ron Paul, ran four years ago and we were so impressed with him too.  Ken can't go as he is doing some work for our friends, Ron & Diane Graf in Clinton, but I told them I would like to go.  He was to speak at 10 am.  We decided we needed to leave at least by 8:30 am so we could get a good seat.  I was over to their home by 8:10, but they were not ready so it was 8:30 by the time we left.  Sandy drove their car and I was glad.  When we arrived, we had to register and then we were ushered upstairs.  There were no chairs anywhere, so we all had to stand.  We were there 35 minutes early.  It is hard for me to stand very long.  I wouldn't have come had I known I would have to stand.  I didn't even wear my good shoes that David had told me about, which the kids gave me money for Mother's Day, to buy them.  They do help, but I hadn't worn them.  There were two big TV screens with the previous debate showing.  We couldn't hear as it was so noisy in there.  We were all excited when Rand Paul came.   I had to strain to see him.  I had my I-pad with me and it has a camera on it so I tried to take a picture of him.  I couldn't get a good enough picture and the man behind me could see that, so asked if I would like him to take it for me.  I did and he got a good one.  By the time it was over, my back & legs were hurting so bad that I could hardly stand the pain.  As we went down stairs, I saw a very comfortable white sofa chair there in the foyer.  I got there in time before anyone else sat in it.  Wow, did it ever feel good.  They had announced that Rand would be in the adjoining room where they would be selling his books and he would autograph them and you could also get a picture taken with him.  Sandy wanted to do that, but I didn't have the money to buy a book and I sure didn't feel like standing in a long line to get one and have it signed.  Irven didn't either and there was a comfortable stool for him to sit on also.  We sat there until Sandy came back and then we went home.  **I felt that was a tender mercy from the Lord that that comfortable large chair was there and no one was sitting in it.  There were a few other chairs, but they were just regular chairs and people were sitting on them.  I know Heavenly Father loves us and wants to help us and he answers our prayers.


Other than spending time with our family, extended family & friends, fishing is our favorite pastime in the summer.  We love to be out in nature and on these beautiful lakes and reservoirs.  We love to fish and we love eating them too.  We take grandsons and other family members and friends with us some of the time, and that is great too.
We are so thankful for our Savior, whose birth we celebrate on this holiday.  We have been studying “Jesus The Christ” in our Family Home Evening group each week, and have gained a greater love and appreciation for our Savior.
