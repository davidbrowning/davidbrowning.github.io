# SIBLING & SPOUSE GET TOGETHER – JUNE 17, 2017
It was our turn to host my siblings/spouse get together which we have every three months.  Kim & Jeanenne are on their mission to South Africa, so of course, they were not here, but the rest of us were – Bryce & Deanna, Terry & Angela, Georgia & Rick and Ken & I.  I made twice cooked potatoes, mixed vegetables, fruit salad, tossed salad, my delicious cake/Danish desert/strawberry desert, and I bought & warmed up the rolls. Ken grilled big trout, chicken breasts and steaks.  We enjoyed visiting as we ate, and we sat at the table quite a while and kept visiting, then us ladies went into the living room where we continued to visit and the guys went out on our patio and played games on the patio table & chairs as it was cooler out there.  Then we all got together and played Mormon Bridge and Catch Phase.  It was an enjoyable day.
