Chapter** **24 – UPDATE** **ON** **MAE’S & KEN’S** **PARENTS & SIBLINGS - 1971














**Family dinner at our home in Ogden**	 **Thanksgiving** dinner on our patio in    **Arizona**.  My parents & siblings & Ken’s parents came down.

**Mom & Dad** moved from their little home in Sunset to a nice new home in Clearfield in Feb. 1970.  They are enjoying it there.  Mom was very reluctant to move as she loved her little home in Sunset, being near the church, highway, her friends, etc.  They had lived there for 28 years.  Mom was a “Horter”, so when we were helping them move, Hal took a truck full of stuff to the dumps.  Mom found out and was so angry at Hal.  Ken & Hal also took a load of old magazines, papers, etc., to their new home.  Ken finished the basement for them and he put those magazines in the rafters before he put the ceiling tile up.  Mom asked him where her magazines were and he told her that he brought them there, so they must be there somewhere.   Mom soon adjusted and made good friends.  One of the reasons dad bought mom this home was hoping she would be a better housekeeper now that she had a new home, but that didn’t happen.  I remember going to their home and Mom was away getting her hair done or with friends.  Dad and I would visit and he would say “Mae, let me show you these closets”.  They were bulging full.  He said, “Your mom can’t throw anything away and we have way too much stuff.” After Georgia married, he told mom he was going to have her room as his room to study and rest in.  He had a desk, filing cabinet and Georgia’s bed.  He told Mom that she couldn’t put anything in it as it was his room, but eventually she put stuff in their too, so he showed me that too.  I didn’t blame dad, he liked a clean, uncluttered home.  Later in life, he told me “Well, I can’t change your mom, but she has so many other wonderful qualities that I just have to overlook this one.”

**Hal: **Hal met Jean Duke as her parents were friends of our neighbors, the Thompsons, who bought Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell’s home after they passed away.  Jean and her parents came to visit the Thompsons and Hal and Jean met.  Hal had been going with a cute girl, Kathy, who I really liked.  She was sweet and kind and pretty.  She loved Hal and he liked her, but she was Catholic, so I think our parents were not as excited that he might get serious and marry her.

Hal & Jean had a daughter, Cindi, who Hal adored.  Hal took her to amusement parks, other parks and played with her a lot.  She loved him too.  Hal took our kids on rides in his little Volkswagen.  He would take them on roads down in Hooper and go fast as the road went up and down hills, they loved that.  He also took them to Lagoon with Cindy, and would play the games there and would win them all a stuffed animal.  They thought he was the greatest!

Hal & Jean, Bryce & Deana and Ken & I would do things together also.

Hal was addicted to sleeping pills as when he was in the military, they got him on them.  He had not slept well as a child, but no one knew this.  Hal just figured that everyone just mainly rested at night.  I don’t know how he was able to function at school and get good grades, but he did.  He used to tease me by saying: “Why do you spend so much time studying for school?” and I would tell him that I wasn’t smart like he was and had to study to get good grades.  Anyway, Hal would overdose on sleeping pills at times and Jean would have to call an ambulance to take him to the hospital, and then she would call Mom and say “Well, your son did it again.”  Mom said how hard this was on her, that her heart would seem like it went up into her throat, when she heard these words.  One time I was just getting out of the hospital after having David, and Mom & Dad were getting in the elevator as Ken, our baby and I were getting out.  At first, I thought they were coming to see me, but after looking at their faces, I could tell something was wrong – they were coming to see Hal as he had overdosed again.  When Bryce & Deanna were having their reception, Hal did it again and put a damper on their reception, especially for Mom & Dad.  Hal would call Bryce sometimes and ask him to go hiking with him, so he could wear off the drugs, and Bryce would but Bryce would become upset, when at the top of the mountain, Hal would pop in more pills.

# HAL, HIS ADDICTION AND HIS DEATH

**Hal would overdose ****on** sleeping pills at times and Jean would have to call an ambulance to take him to the hospital, and then she would call Mom and say “Well, your son did it again.”  Mom said how hard this was **on** her, that her heart would seem like it went up into her throat, when she heard these words.  One time I was just getting out of the hospital after having David, and Mom & Dad were getting in the elevator as Ken, our baby and I were getting out.  At first, I thought they were coming to see me, but after looking at their faces, I could tell something was wrong – they were coming to see Hal as he had overdosed again.  When Bryce & Deanna were having their Bryce & Deanna were having their reception, he did it again and put a damper **on** their reception, especially for Mom & Dad.  Hal would call Bryce sometimes and ask him to go hiking with him, so he could wear off the drugs, and Bryce would but Bryce would become upset, when at the top of the mountain, Hal would pop in more pills.
I would visit Hal at the hospital and we had some good talks.  I loved that brother.  **He and Jean were having problems because of his overdosing, so he would call me, and we would have long talks**.  Ken and I had moved to Arizona, but moved back to Utah at this time, and I believe it was because Hal needed me, and I was so glad I was here for him.  He told me that Jean didn’t love him.  I talked with her about this and she said she didn’t know how to love, as her parents hadn’t shown her love as she was growing up.  That is so sad.  Jean eventually decided to take Cindy and separate from Hal for a time as she felt by doing this, he would miss them so much that he would get help and get off the sleeping pills, but this backfired.  **He took his life**.  He had told me that he would only marry once as he had seen the grief his buddies had had when they got divorces, and how hard it was that they had to pay child support and alimony.  I think that Hal loved Jean and Cindy and thought he was losing them and it was too much for him.  Mom & Dad’s Bishop was a social worker and he said that when a person has been on sleeping pills for over 7 years that if something traumatic happens in their lives, they can’t take it.
I well remember the day that Mom got the word that this had happened.  We were living in the home I grew up in, in Sunset.  Mom would call me every morning to see how we were doing and just to talk.  This morning she didn’t call, and I felt something was wrong.  **I called her, and she was hysterical.  I finally got it out of her that the police had just come to tell her Hal had taken his life**.  When he hadn’t reported to work for a couple of days and hadn’t called in, his boss called the police and the police found him in his home.  I jumped in the car and drove down to Mom & Dad’s, but I know the Lord blessed me that I didn’t get in an accident as** I was crying so hard, I could hardly see where I was going**.
Jean felt bad and felt that we blamed her for his death, but we tried to reassure her that we were not blaming her and that we still loved her and Cindy and wanted them to still be a part of our family and our lives.  Mom & Dad were great to invite them to all our family activities and they came, and they were in our family pictures too.  We felt bad that Jean didn’t let Cindy come to her father’s funeral or see him in his casket, so that there no closure for Cindy.  I think Cindy suffered the rest of her life partly because of this.

**Bryce married Deanna** on the 5th of September 1970.  Their son, Nolan was born the following October.  He is a year younger than our son, David, and they have been close cousins. They would stay at each other’s homes at times and had such fun together.  We are thankful for Deanna, she is a great wife, mother, grandmother, and sister-in-law.  We love her.

**Terry** is 22 years old, living with the folks and going to Weber College, majoring in journalism.  **Terry** is very smart and got A’s in college.  When Hal was going to college on his military GI Bill, **Terry** was going to Weber College at the same time.  In the classes they took together, they competed for the high of the class.
Terry went on a mission to Germany.
Terry is a social person so had several friends and dated cute girls. Terry graduated from Weber College in Journalism.  Terry had a list of the qualities he wanted in a wife.  After I looked at his list, I said: “Terry, you are a great guy, but you are not perfect, so how do you expect to find this “perfect” wife?”  Well, he did find a girl who met all his qualifications, but he had to go to Anchorage, Alaska to find her.  He went to Anchorage the summer after he graduated from college to work in the Wonderbread bakery with a friend.  There he met Angela.  Her dad had been in the military, was retiring and they were moving to Colorado.  Angela was working at a JC Penny store in Anchorage.  Her parents tried to persuade her to move there with them, and told her that she could get a job with a JC Penny store there, but she told them that she had a strong impression that she was to stay in Anchorage.  She met Terry and found out why she was given the impression by the Lord to stay there.  After courting a while, they flew down and were married in the Salt Lake Temple.  We all thought they would stay and live here in Utah by us, but Terry loved it in Alaska, so they went back.

**Georgia**: One summer when she was in high school or college (can’t remember which), we invited her to come down to Arizona, where we were living at the time, and stay a week with us.  She rode the bus down and we had a great time.
Georgia is almost 20 (September 7th) She’s living with the folks, going to Weber college, has a part-time job, dates a lot, but is waiting for Max Blair who is on a mission. Georgia is beautiful.  She has worn glasses since she was about 3 as her eyes were crossed.  Well, she now has contacts and has grown out her hair and is a beautiful young woman, no wonder she is dating so much now.

**Kim** is almost 15.   He is a real nice kid.  Enjoys his Priesthood activities, was on an Olympic Seminary Bowl and did very well.  Our children enjoy Uncle **Kim** as he takes them to buy ice cream and takes them other places.  He is a good uncle.

My parents are expecting their mission call today, June 30, 1979.  I've written most of my life story as I've lived it, but now I'm typing it up.

Dad & Mom went to the Boston, Massachusetts Mission.  They loved it there in many ways, but because of the roads, turnabouts & traffic, it was easy for dad to get lost, so they went with the young Elders some of the time.  Mom & Dad did convert at least two families and they stayed friends with them.
They also became great friends of a lady whose husband had passed away and she had a terrible phobia that she couldn’t leave her Highrise apartment.  She had too much anxiety, so mom & dad would get her groceries, pay her bills, get her medicine, etc.  This lady loved my parents, especially mom.  Everyone loved mom, and dad too as they are great people and love the Lord and his children.  This lady wanted to join the church and be sealed to her husband, so she asked Mom if she would have hers and her husband’s work done after she passed away.  They didn’t have any children.
Mom and this lady would call each other frequently and when this lady passed away, Mom kept her promise and got the work ready and Ken and I went to the temple for mom to act as proxies for this good sister and her husband.
Mom had problems, while on her mission, and had to have a hysterectomy and other surgery.  They felt this was a blessing from the Lord as the Mayo Clinic is in Boston, so Mom had good care.  While mom was recuperating, she could make phone calls and set up appointments for dad and the young Elders.  Mom & Dad set a great example for their family.
