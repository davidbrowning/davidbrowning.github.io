# Chapter 39– UPDATE ON CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES
# 1996:

As this year has swiftly passed by, it has brought some good experiences and some not so good.   This life is full of ups and downs, but it is for our experience and we are to learn from the hard times and enjoy the good.  Over the years, I’ve come to realize that our attitude plays a big part on our happiness.  Some people have very little financially, but they are happy.  Some have major health or other problems and yet they are happy and make others happy.  And there are others who are miserable, and it seems they have everything that should make them happy.

****Sandi****  has** **two** **daughters, JaNae, age** **16** **and** **Chelci, age** **12.  JaNae** **has** **been** **a** **cheerleader** **both** **her** **sophomore** **and** **now** **her** **junior** **years** **at** **Grantsville** **High.  Chelci, goes** **to** **the** **Middle** **School** **in** **Grantsville.  She** **excels** **in** **softball** **and** **has** **a** **pretty** **voice** **so** **enjoys** **singing.  ****Sandi****** **is** **the** **head** **cook** **at** **Harris** **Elementary.  She** **taught** **clogging** **dance** **lessons** **for** **a** **few** **years, mainly** **for** **the** **benefit** **of** **her** **girls.  She** **enjoys** **oil** **pointing** **in** **her** **spare** **time** **and** **is** **secretary** **of** **the** **Young** **Women.  ****Sandi****** **divorced** **her** **husband, Dave, a** **few** **months** **ago.  She** **hasn’t** **been** **happy** **in** **her** **marriage.  We** **hope** **the** **future** **will** **be** **brighter** **for** **her.  They** **have** **joint** **custody** **of** **their** **daughters, JaNae** **and** **Chelci, but** **JaNae** **lives** **with** **her** **dad** **and** **Chelci** **with** **her** **mom.  We** **pray** **for** **them** **also** **as** **divorce** **is** **never** **easy.
# Old Folk’s Sociable – each March in Grantsville.  Sandi & girls usually performed in the programs – dancing (clogging) & Chelci singing.  They have great programs, dinners, dances & great decorations throughout the high school.  Sandi usually had her art work displayed.  They also had car shows.  We love to go to these, especially to watch our daughter and granddaughters perform.

# Shellie and Roy live in Chandler, Arizona.  They have three sons - Garrett, age 7, Quint, age 4 and Kevis age 5 months.   did an apprenticeship, training as an Integrated Circuit Mask Designer.  He works at Motorola designing computer chips.  We wish they lived closer, but he likes his work, makes good money, and there is not a Motorola plant to transfer to here in , so guess we’ll spend our winter vacations in sunny .   is in the Sunday School Presidency and Shellie has served mainly in the Young Women’s organization, but is now in Relief Society.  Shellie, like Sandi, is also gifted in art, and is taking oil painting lessons.   enjoys water skiing and camping, in fact, their entire family does.
A couple of weeks ago, I flew down to Arizona to visit Shellie and her family.  With changing jobs this summer, I left Lincoln Elementary to be the secretary for Staff Development at the district office.  Anyway, with learning a new job, I didn’t take my vacation at that time so I took part of my vacation enjoying Shellie’s two little boys, and of course, Shellie & Roy.  With them living in Arizona, we don’t get to see them as often as we’d like.  I had a wonderful time; the only thing that could have made it better was if Ken could have been there.  He spent his vacation building an apartment for his mother in his brother, Bob’s basement.  With overworking on this apartment and long hours at his job, he is having health problems again – so back on his strict diet.  Not fun especially during the holidays.

**Mike, Becky and their two little ones, David & Taylor**, are doing great in Inverness, Montana.  Mike is teaching special education and doing some coaching so they were able to spend last summer in Utah.  We enjoyed being with them for most of the weekends.

**David & Shauna are living in Clearfield**.  We are thankful they live close to us.  David will graduate with his four-year degree this summer, but with him being in the medical field, he still has lots of schooling ahead.  Shauna just changed jobs recently.  She is a nurse and changed from Davis South Hospital in Bountiful to McKay Dee in Ogden.  David still works at the FHP lab part-time.

**Scott** came home from his mission to Venezuela in May.  We were excited to have him return and so was his girlfriend, Mishelle Dillingham, who is now his fiancé.  They received some sad news soon after his return.  She had been coughing for several months, the doctor finally took an x-ray and found cancer.  She is undergoing chemotherapy treatments at the present.  They hope to be able to marry soon after the treatments are over.  She is in our prayers constantly.

# Jeff is a senior at Layton High.  He is enjoying his high school years, and is really involved in music and drama and is on the seminary council, so we don’t see much of him especially at this season of the year, but we are glad he is developing his talents and sharing with others.  Ken & I enjoy going to his plays, Lyrics performances, etc.
Jeff has lots of friends and they double date or come to our home and have Video parties in our family room.  They are all great kids so we welcome them here.  For their Junior Prom one of the friend’s father had a moving van and he let them put couches and chairs in the back and he drove them to where they ate before the dance, and to the dance and then came and got them to take them home.  They had a blast and that was sure different transportation.
Another of Jeff’s good friends is “**Ben**”.  For some reason, **Ben** and his dad had problems and Jeff asked if **Ben** could come live with us for a while.  **Ben** was great and we enjoyed having him in our home.  He and Jeff had a great time together.  Now in 2012, **Ben** is married, has a family and is living back East.   Jeff was able to go visit them when he was on a business trip.
Two of the girls Jeff hung out with were Jenny and Meresha.  They were cute girls too and I think both had a crush on Jeff.  They were always here for video parties and games.  I remember one time when Jeff & Ben and Jenny & Meresha were going to a costume party.  Jeff was dressed like the 1920s.  He even had shiny black & white pat-n-leather shoes, silver gray tux and great hat.  He looked great!  Jeff would come home from a date, Lyrics performance or a play, etc., and he and I would stay up late talking.  We enjoyed those late-night visits.
There are Daddy-Daughter dates, but I had a Mother-Son date.  I think it was for my birthday that Jeff took me to Abravanel Hall to a symphony.  This was the first time I had been to Abravanel Hall and I think the first time to a symphony.  I really enjoyed the symphony and really enjoyed being with Jeff. He is a great son and we enjoy him very much.

Ken & I are thankful for each of our wonderful children and feel we have been greatly blessed.






# UPDATE FOR KENNETH BROWNING FAMILY 1994 (For Bushnell )

Ken is working as the Maintenance Director of the 5 Points Mall in Bountiful.  He keeps really busy but enjoys it.  He also does remodeling, and sells part-time for Beneficial Insurance Company.  He is a High Counselor in our Holmes Creek Stake.  When Ken has any free time, he enjoys being with his family.

Mae is the secretary at Lincoln Elementary in  where she keeps busy with a faculty and staff of over 70 and almost 1,000 students.  Thank goodness for 3 great assistants; it’s a good place to work.  She’d rather be home enjoying her family and grandkids, but the money helps support their missionary sons.  She was just released as the Relief Society President and is now a counselor in the Stake Relief Society.

Ken and Mae have 6 wonderful children – Sandi, Shellie, Mike, David, Scott, and Jeff.  The four oldest are married.  Sandi and Dave have 2 girls – JaNae and Chelci.  Shellie and Roy have 2 boys, Garrett and Quint.  Mike and Becky have a son, David, and a daughter to be born the latter part of August.  David and Shauna were just married in the  on June 24th.  Scott is on a mission to  and enjoys it although he says it’s a never-ending summer.  He has a darling girlfriend, Mishelle, waiting for him.  Jeff, our youngest, is 16 – dating, driving, working part-time, plays the piano, and gets involved in extra-curricular activities at Layton High.
Hopefully the 3 oldest children will fill this sheet out telling about them and their families. Since David just got married, I’ll tell a little about him and Shauna.  She just graduated as an R.N. in nursing and is now working full time in .  David met her at  about two years ago soon after he returned from his mission to  & .  David is going into medicine and is planning to be a Physician’s Assistant.  He still has several years ahead of him.  He has been at the top of his class so his scholarships help.  He works at the FHP clinic in .

Shellie & Roy - Dear Bushnell Family:  We’ve been planning on and looking forward to this reunion for the last several years but as things turn out, we won’t be able to make it.  We’re really disappointed to be missing reuniting with you and all the fun.  Anyway, we’ll give you an update on our life.  We’re still living in Arizona and although it’s getting hot, we’re really enjoying it.  After years of renting, we’ve finally bought a new home in  where for a little while anyway we still have fields around us and can smell the cows at night.  We love our home, neighbors and ward.  Two years ago,  quit the construction field forever and now does I.C. Design layout (designs computer chips).  He’s been working for Clark I.C. Design and contracting to Motorola which is exciting to us because of their great benefits package.   Motorola is sending us to  for 3-4 months.  We’re ecstatic!  We’ve rented movies about  from the library and even Garrett (4) is really excited.  Our one real concern is Quint who’s one and can be quite a handful.  ’s parents are thinking about going over with us for a month or so to help out.  I’m sure we’ll love it.  Hope your families are doing great.  Miss ya, The Seymores – Roy, Shellie, Garrett, and Quint.

Mike and Becky Browning – Mike and I are expecting our second child August 22 (99% sure it’s a girl).  Mike will be graduating from BYU with a degree in Psychology and Special Education on August 12th.  We have found a job in  and will be moving up there the 22nd of August.  Mike for sure, me if the baby is born early.  We are really excited to move and get away from the stress of school and enter the stress of reality.  We are also excited because I have been working full time for the past year and now I will be able to be home to raise our children.  Mike is doing his student teaching right now and enjoys being able to teach!  That’s about it for us.
