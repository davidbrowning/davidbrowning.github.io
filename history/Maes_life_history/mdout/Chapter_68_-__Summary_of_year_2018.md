# Chapter 68 - Summary of Year 2018
Another year has come and about gone, and it seems the time goes by faster each year.  We are well and happy.  We can tell we are getting older as it is harder to get up and down, we have aches and pains, and we are slowing down. Ken will turn 80 in February and we will have our 60th wedding anniversary in June.  Next spring, we plan to sell our boat, camper and possibly truck as it is getting too hard to do these things anymore.  We realized it this summer and decided we have had lots of fun with these entertainment toys, but it is time to give them up and use this time to do other things like reading more, working on family history and visiting neighbors who are lonely and pretty much homebound.  We will miss these fun vacations, camping and fishing trips with our family and friends, but hopefully we will find other ways to enjoy being with them.  Of course, we will visit and spend time with our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and extended family; as family is a priority.
We think it’s sad that they are taking Christ out of Christmas.  For several years I have gone to the on-line photo shop at Costco’s to do my photo Christmas card.  Last year I had to look hard to find one that said, “Merry Christmas”, and this year, I went through every card and they all said “Happy Holidays” or something similar.  The closest I could find was “Peace on Earth”, so I selected this one.  I guess I will make my own next year, so it will say “Merry Christmas”.  The world has forgotten the reason we celebrate Christmas – Christ is the reason.  We went to a dinner & play, the other night, which Roy High puts on for senior citizens each year.  The principal welcomed us out, but they didn’t have an opening prayer and blessing on the food.  The couple we went with, said that was the first time they haven’t had a prayer.  That’s sad too.
We’ve had a wonderful year.  In April Ken and I visited Shellie, Roy and their family in Arizona.  They live on a manmade beautiful lake in Chandler.  We loved to sit out and feed the ducks and geese or go kayaking or paddle boating on this lake, playing games, visiting, eating delicious meals, and just enjoying being with this special family.  We enjoyed visiting with Shellie and Roy’s oldest son, Garrett, his wife, Nora and their three beautiful children: Maggie, Damon & little Aubrey Liesl, who was born this past July.  Garrett graduated from ASU and then signed up with the Army and got his dental schooling through the military.  He is now a licensed Dentist.  They are now living in Colorado.  Garrett will serve as a dentist for the army for four years before setting up his own practice.  Quint, Shellie and Roy’s second son, is living in Chandler and working.  He has many talents and is such a delight to be around.  We enjoyed it when he came over also.  Their third son, Kevis, is a Marine and stationed in Okinawa.  He has studied the Japanese language, so was hoping to go there.  Jase, the youngest is 17 and enjoying high school.
Shellie has started working as a receptionist for a dental office.  She decided that since her son & daughter with her grandchildren moved away and her youngest, Jase, is doing well in high school, she would go to work as she now has time to do that.

On Saturday, June 16th, we rode with Sandi & Gary and met Chelci, Steve & their family, and we all drove to Idaho Falls where JaNae & Brad’s youngest daughter, Emma, was baptized & confirmed by her great grandfather Browning.  We all went to lunch before the baptism and had a wonderful day together.  JaNae, Brad & children: Dawson age 15, Kennedy age 13 & Emma love Idaho Falls and the children have made good friends and enjoy their new schools.  Dawson is our oldest great grandchild.

Our family was together at Pinnacle Peak for our family vacation the last of June.  It was a beautiful area which Sandi and Gary were able to reserve for our family.  We played in the river, played volleyball, rode Gary and Sandi’s golf cart all around and their side by side up the mountain or hiked up some trails.  We visited, played games, ate wonderful meals and had a great time.  On the afternoon, of the morning we left, a fire broke out in the Million Dollar area and because of the fire and floods which came afterwards, that area doesn’t look the same, as mud covered it and it will be a long time before families and groups will be able to camp there again.  We were able to be there for the past two years and were thankful we could.
In** **July, Ken** **and** **I** **went** **to** **Jackson** **Lake** **with** **our** **son, Scott, his** **wife, Mishelle** **and** **their** **four** **children, Kylan** **age** **18, Ashley** **age** **16, and** **the** **twins, Kaden** **and** **Kaitlyn** **age** **10.

Our** **grandchildren** **played** **in** **the** **shallow** **part** **of** **the** **lake** **and** **had** **fun** **catching** **minnows.  We** **relaxed, played** **games, ate** **good** **meals** **and** **enjoyed** **being** **together.  One** **day** **Scott** **suggested** **we** **drive** **over** **the** **Teton** **Pass** **to** **see** **Victor, Idaho** **where** **Ken** **grew** **up.

She** **has** **a** **pretty** **voice.  The** **twins** **are** **fun** **to** **be** **with.

Ken and I went to the Bushnell Reunion in Tropic Utah in August.  Sandi and Gary, and Shellie met us there.  They were the only ones, from our family, who were able to go.  Shellie’s husband and sons weren’t able to come either.  The three-day reunion with extended family was great.  Most of my siblings and spouses and some of their family were able to attend.  It was great visiting with my cousins, and my Mom’s only living sibling, Uncle Van and his wife, Allison.  We had a family store, a talent show, great meals, activities and sports.  Some of us, including Sandi, Gary, Shellie and Ken and I went on the horse or mule trip down into Bryce canyon.  That was awesome.  The five of us left, from the reunion, to go to Fish Lake.  We had brought our boat and camper and Sandi and Gary brought their Toy Hauler.  Shellie stayed in the Toy Hauler with them.  We caught lots of fish, visited, played games and had a great time, although Shellie got sick, so it wasn’t so great for her.  Chelci, Steve and their children met with us on Wednesday afternoon and we enjoyed being with them.  Chelci is Sandi’s second daughter.  When we left for home on Thursday, they stayed and camped with Chelci’s dad & Suzanne, who were camping at Fish Lake also.  Chelci & Steve have four children: Nathan, Addison Mae “Addie”, and cute twin sons, Jacob and Luke.

Besides little Aubrey, who was born in July, another little great granddaughter, Charlotte Mae “Charlie” was born in May to David and Sierra.  Their son, Henry, age 3 loves his little sister and will be excited when she can play with him.  David is Mike and Becky’s son.  David graduated from Utah State University last May and has a great job in computer software.  Whenever we have problems with our computer, we call David.  I try not to bother him too much, but he is always so sweet and kind to us whenever I call or text.  They live in Logan where Sierra is going to Utah State and will graduate this coming May (if my memory is correct).

Mike was the principal at Orem High for seven years, but now is at the district office.  He misses the students, but loves having more time to be with his family.  Becky is also happy about that.  She said Orem High owned Mike, and she is glad to have a husband again.  Becky has always been a great support to Mike, and is a great wife, mother & grandmother.

We have been up at Kimberly, Idaho (near Twin Falls, ID) visiting Jeff, Gail and their children: Ben age 12, Rachel age 10, and Matt age 9.  They had a leak from their dish washer which caused lots of problems.  Their insurance adjustor had people come out and found there was black mold, so the flooring, cupboards, etc., had to come out.  After the black mold was taken care of, they decided to remodel some, since their kitchen was torn up.  They couldn’t get a contractor to come until December, so Jeff decided to do it himself with a retired contractor neighbor and his dad helping with the electrical.  We are proud of Jeff for being able to do what he has with the help of his 12-year-old son, Ben. They have been in a mess since May, and hopefully it will be completed by January.  They will be happy to have a kitchen again. They have been cooking with a crockpot, electric frypan, toaster oven & microwave, and eating from paper plates, cups & plastic utensils.  It has been challenging for them, but they have done well, probably better than I would have.  We always love being with this special family also. Ben is quite the hiker and mountain climber.  His dad has a hard time keeping up with him as they climb mountain peaks.  We get texts from Matt saying: “I love you Grandma & Grandpa, from Matt” We love these texts.  While we were there, Rachel made a mailbox and had family members write us a sweet note and put in our mailbox.  She put them in also.  That was sweet of her.  Gail has done some substitute teaching in the past, but this year she is kept too busy with all she has to do.

Most of our family is getting together for Thanksgiving, actually the day after Thanksgiving, and we are looking forward to being with them, and also next month for our family Christmas party.  From our wedding in June of 1959, we now have a total of 51 members of our wonderful family, who we love very much.
