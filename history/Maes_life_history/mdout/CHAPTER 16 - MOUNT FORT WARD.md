# CHAPTER 16 – MOUNT FORT WARD
11-21-1961
When  was three months old, I was asked to teach the Mia Maid class in M.I.A.  Sister Lois Braithwaite and I taught it together for a month or so, and then she was released and I taught the girls for about two months.  Sister Hill, the president asked to be released, and Sister Joice Eggleston was put in as the new president.  She asked me to be her Activity Counselor and Lynada Parsons to be her Age Group Counselor.  This was done the first of June just before camp and the roadshows so boy was I busy.  I went to  with the Mia Maid and Laurel girls.  Norma Devries was the Stake Activity Counselor and she was a terrific leader.   is an ideal stake camp.  There is a river running just in back of the campfire site.  They have a large tennis court, nice kitchen, care takers cabin, and other facilities.  Norma had put a lot of work and planning in for camp that year, and everyone had a wonderful time.
Joice, Lynada, Ralph Lee, Blaine Barrows, and myself worked on the roadshow.  Diane Barrott wrote the script.  Blaine and myself were in the roadshow and the other executives directed it.  Blaine and Ken made most of the scenery and props, and Lynada made the costumes.  The script was about some Marsions invading Earth and interrupting a campfire program.  They wore some really clever fluorescent costumes, and they have a rocket ship which is really effective due to dry ice, and the noise coming from Ralph's tape recorder.  We were quite discouraged because we had a hard time getting the cast together, and when we did some would back out, and we were continually replacing them.  The dress rehearsal was a failure, but the actual presentations were very successful, and we ended up winning first place,  rating.

The ward was divided in August, and since Joice lived in the boundaries of the 2nd ward; they asked me to be the new president.  I accepted and chose Lynada Parsons to be my Activity Counselor and Deon Mayberry to be my Age Group Counselor.  Lynada was pregnant at the time so when her baby was born, she asked to be released.  I chose Darlene Penrod for my new Activity Counselor.  We had a hard struggle due to the fact that our ward had a large trailer court and some motels so the people were very transit.  We would get good women in the various positions and then they would move out.  We would get very discouraged, especially me.  I worked quite hard trying to make a success out of it, but different problems kept arising.  One of the hardest involved Darlene.  We had been good friends, but it didn't work out having her as my counselor.  She was too laid back (or lazy) and didn't want to follow the manual.  At the last minute she would just say we were having a dance and just bring records, or she would say I've decided it would be fun to have a basketball game between the boys and girls.  At that time, the church had half of the time for class and the other half for an activity.  There were people called as speech directors, drama directors, sports directors and dance directors.  Our manuals outlined what activity we were supposed to do each week and it rotated the 4 directors.  We had pretty good directors, but Darlene didn't use them.  Even when she would say we were going to have a dance, she didn't contact the dance director.  Or when she would say we were going to play basketball, she wouldn't contact the sports director.  These people got discouraged because Darlene wasn't letting them do their job.  I tried talking to her several times about it and that they were called to be sports, dance, drama or speech directors and that the church wanted us to use them and wanted us to have these activities for the youth.  It didn't help.  I became more and more upset about it and finally fasted and prayed and called her to see if I could meet with her.  She told me to come over.  I told her that since I was the president, I felt the responsibility to follow the program like the church had it outlined and that she would need to follow it.  I tried to say it in a tactful way, but she became really upset and said she would just quit and I could get someone else who would follow the program if that was so important.  I tried to explain how I felt and tell her that I would like her to stay in, but we did need to follow the program.  She wouldn't listen to me and finally I left.  She called the Bishop and told him to release her.  He did, and from that time on, Darlene didn't want anything to do with me.  She would never speak to me and gave me dirty looks.  She would speak to Ken, but not to me.  It finally got to me and I went to the Bishop and asked what I should do.  I asked if I should apologize to her even thought I didn't think I had done anything wrong.  He told me that it might help, so I tried to, but she wouldn't accept my apology.  She never would speak to me until years later when we met accidentally in a restaurant.  I guess she had gotten over it and we enjoyed visiting together and catching up on our families.
I asked for Lynada to be put back in the presidency with me as she was a wonderful counselor and hard worker.  Deon also was a terrific counselor and friend and I enjoyed working with her very much.
With all the problems we had, it finally got me down.  My nerves got the best of me.  I had terrible headaches, nervous stomach and finally trench mouth.  My doctors advised me to get released, so towards the end of that year (August) I was released.  Ken had actually gone to the Bishop and explained how this position was affecting my health and he felt I should be released.  Deon also wanted to be released so Lynada was asked to be the president.  Ralph Lee had been the superintendent while I was the president.  He was terrific at first - so enthusiastic and effective, but he got so discouraged that he moved out of the ward.  Glen Kinlock was put in.  He had worked in the Stake M.I.A. Superintendency over in , and he was really organized and efficient also at first, but after I was released he got a second job in  and was hardly ever at M.I.A. after that, so finally they released him.  I enjoyed M.I.A. so I stayed in as secretary treasurer.  Lynada was president for about six months.  She, too, got discouraged.  It wasn’t long until they moved.  They asked Cora Thinnes to be the third president.  She asked for me to be her Age Group Counselor and Jean Buckanan to be her Activity Counselor.  I accepted, but this time it didn't work out either.  Cora's attitude was - if it gets done, fine.  If it doesn't get done, that’s fine too.  And she didn't want to put in much effort or time into the program.  Finally she began to find any little excuse to stay home from mutual or her stake meetings.  Jean moved and Myrna Moulton replaced her.  Since Cora wasn't doing anything, this left everything up to Myrna and myself.  Myrna hadn't been replaced as organist so she had to play every week so either Neldon Braithwaite or myself had to conduct.  I got more discouraged as the time went on, and finally Cora was released.  They wanted to put me back in as president, but I knew for sure that I didn't want to try to tackle it again so I told them that I would like to just stay in as secretary treasurer since I had never been replaced.
During the year and a half since I was first put in as secretary treasurer, we had five or six attendant secretaries.  That's how transit our ward is.  In October of 1964, they asked me to teach the Firelight class in Primary.  I accepted as I figured I could teach a class and also be secretary in the M.I.A.  I enjoyed my class very much.  I only had four girls, age 10.  They were all active.  I took  to Primary with me and she enjoyed her class also.  I believe it was in January that we had our Daddy-Daughter Party.  It was a wonderful evening.  I was in charge of the decorations so we decorated with a winter theme.  We hung paper snowflakes from the ceiling of the banquet room, and put some on the walls with some cute paper snowmen and other decorations.  We hung balloons in clusters from the lights and above the doors.  We decorated the doorway with an arch of crate paper.  We played games, the girls danced with their fathers, we had a nice program and served banana splits and cookies.
After I was released from president of the M.I.A. in **1963, I got pregnant that October.  **Ken and I were very happy, but I started having trouble.  I started going to Dr. Naisbitt as Mom talked me into going to him instead of Dr. Jorgenson.  I was doing pretty well until just before Christmas, in fact, Christmas Eve.  We had invited all Ken's family over here for a Family Christmas Party.  I cooked a ham, cleaned the house, and decorated the tree practically by myself (which was a real job in those days - hanging individual icicles over the entire tree). I wasn't used to decorating a tree like this because as I grew up, us kids got to help mom decorate the Christmas tree.  Dad didn't like the commercialized side of Christmas, just the Spiritual, and he didn't help us decorate the tree, put up any decorations, etc.  Mom loved Christmas, but wasn't particular and let us kids, from the time we were young, help put up the decorations and trim the tree.  So, as you can imagine it wasn't a really fancy Christmas tree, but we loved it.  Ken's mom had always decorated their tree herself on Christmas Eve.  She sent the children to a movie, then put a blanket up across the door and they were not allowed in the living room until Christmas morning.  She would stay up most of the night trimming the tree until it was very beautiful.  She was very particular.  I loved her tree and since their family was coming here, I wanted ours to be beautiful.  I shouldn't have done it because after we had eaten and the family was visiting, I started spotting.  I was worried and I had reason to be - at three months along, I had another miscarriage.  It didn't happen until after the holidays, but the doctor had me stay in bed and I finally lost it anyway.  I was heartbroken, but life goes on.
Ken and I have surely been happy since our marriage.  We like the same things, are both active in the church, and love each other so much.  We're each other's best friend.
Ken was put in as secretary of the Aaronic Priesthood shortly after we moved here in the ward.  I think it was November or December of 1964 that Ken was put in as Elder's President.  He has been a good president, but due to his work shifts at the bank, and his counselors, Blaine Rice, and Charles Aravy, not being too dependable; he has had a rough time.
I was asked to be the ward MIA secretary, I was only in that position for a short while, and then I was asked to teach the Mia Maids again.  I really enjoyed this calling, especially the class **Deanna Green** was in.  Deanna is now my sister-in-law.  She married Bryce.  I loved Deanna and her friends in that class.  We had slumber parties at our home, and I really grew to love these girls.  I remember for Christmas, they brought me over a present.  The class had chipped in and bought it together and all of them came over to bring it to me.  Deanna really kept me on my toes as she was always asking me questions during the lessons.  I really had to be prepared.
When Bryce came back from the service, he asked me to line him up with the cutest, best girl I knew.  I lined him up with Deanna.  She had graduated by then and was in college or working, I can’t remember which, or probably both.  They went together and ended up getting married.  I was excited and have surely enjoyed her as a special sister-in-law.  Deanna's Mom was a special friend of mine too.  She was a special friend to everyone.  She was so cute and fun to be around and she was sure talented on the piano and organ.  She got cancer and the doctor only gave her 3 months to live.  She had heard of Dr. Sundance, an old Indian Chief, who worked with herbs and had helped cure people of Cancer.  She found him and went on the herbs.  She was very sick, and it was really hard on her, but she wanted to live to raise her family.  She did live and is still alive today (1998) She would pass the cancers and when she did, she would pickle them in baby jars.  I remember going to her home one day and she asked if I had seen her cancer specimens.  I told her "no" and she proceeded to get them out of the cupboard to show me.  They were so gross - they looked like terrible giant spiders - only worse than that.  They had big feelers, etc.  All of a sudden, I felt like I would pass out.  Marge noticed that and had me lie down on the floor.  She made me some peppermint tea and I soon revived, but I never wanted to see her specimens again.

Ken was called to be the Elder's Quorum President, but his two counselors didn't work out.  With Ken's work schedule at Commercial Security Bank, he wasn't able to oversee everything, and his counselors didn't do anything without him.  Finally, one moved, and the other said maybe he should be released also.  Ken took him up on it and called Larry Braithwaite & Bob Hein to be his new counselors.  The Elder's Quorum went straight uphill after that.  Ken, Larry & Bob worked great together.
Our good friends (the ones I grew up with) were married and two of their husbands went to college after they got married.   Joan & Ralph were going to college at BYU.   They had two children.  Margie & Gary had decided that Gary needed to go to college.  They already had three children.  It was tough for them, but they did it anyway.  We thought we needed to do that also so we put our house up for sale, so Ken could go to college.  We had several people look at our house, and acted like they wanted to buy it, but nothing came of it.  **Ken was called into the stake president's office and asked to be ****first** counselor to Bishop Delmar Moulton in the Mt Fort Ward.  We decided the Lord wanted Ken to serve in the Bishopric, so we took the "For Sale" sign off the lawn.  Both Ralph and Gary became engineers.  Pat's husband didn't go to college, but he became a machinist and was very good at it.  Dennis became a computer operator - like Ken, but for a company in , then a computer programmer
