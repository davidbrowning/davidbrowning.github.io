# Chapter 15 – MY CHIROPRACTORS

**I have scoliosis and so have had a bad back all my life**.  I've gone to **chiropractors** since before Ken & I were married.  I've gone to lots of different **chiropractors**.  I'll tell about a couple of them.  One was an older gentleman who lived in Ogden, **Dr. Moffitt**.  Dad had been going to him and suggested we go to him.  We were living in , I think, at the time.  **Dr. Moffitt** had his office in his home.  He used electricity probes as part of the treatment.  He would put the probes on your legs and your feet and toes would curl right up.  When he put them on your arms, your hands and fingers curled up.  I remember I didn't like that very well - so we only went to him for a few treatments.
Also, while living in , I started going to Dr. Wimmer, who was our Stake President.  I was in the stake YWMIA presidency at the time.  I thought Dr. Wimmer was a wonderful man and wonderful stake president.  I loved his wife also.  He took x-rays and had me coming in every other day for several weeks, then twice a week, then once a week, etc.  The patients undressed in little dressing rooms and put on a paper gown (like you do when you go to the doctor's office for an exam).  The first few treatments were fine, but after a while he started getting a little too familiar.  He would hug me when I came into the room.  At first, I didn't think too much of it because I had him on a pedestal of being a great stake president.  I felt he was just giving me a fatherly hug.  Well, he used a vibrator and his hands in massaging you before he gave the treatment - to help you relax.  I started getting tense as he massaged me, and didn't feel this was right.  I remember one time feeling him staring at me, so I glanced up at him.  I quickly tried to make some conversation and so I said "Isn't it a beautiful day today", he said "you sure are beautiful".  I didn't like that comment at all.  I went home and told Ken I didn't want to go to Dr. Wimmer again and tried to explain how uncomfortable I was in his presence.  He could hardly believe that anything wrong could be going on, but said he would come with me that next time and go into the treatment room with me.  He did come, but Dr. Wimmer wouldn't let him come into the room with us.  He had him sit in the waiting room.  When we went home I told Ken I wasn't ever coming back again - and I didn't.  As I would go to my stake meetings and PPI's with the stake presidency, Pres. Wimmer would stop me and ask me how I was feeling and why I wasn't coming in for treatments.  I told a lie and told him I was doing much better and didn't feel I needed further treatments.  He tried to convince me that I did, but I just brushed it off.  I found another chiropractor to go to.  Sometime later, after we had moved from Ogden, we heard that Pres. Wimmer was excommunicated from the Church for having an affair.  I guess when the church came out with specific questions before getting temple recommends, a woman confessed that she had had an affair with Pres. Wimmer.  That she had been a patient of his and one thing had led to another.  I guess it broke his wife's heart, but she stayed with him.  He did repent and finally was given his priesthood blessings back.  His father was the patriarch of our stake when we lived there, and it hurt and humiliated him so much, that people said he never left his home again, he died a short time later.

Another chiropractor I went to was in Roy. Vern Kilbourn.  He was good and didn't have you come in for set appointments.  He told us just to call when we felt we needed a treatment.  One day we called and they said he was in the hospital.  He had been hang gliding and he went into the mountain and was paralyzed from the neck down.  That ended his practice.


**Dr. Opie** was one we went to in  when we first moved down there.  We took the entire family to him.  The children didn't like him as he was pretty rough.  To tell the truth I didn't either.  He was a counselor in our ward bishopric.

From there we found out about DR.  SWANSTROM** in Scottsdale** and started going to this wonderful little man.  He wasn't exactly a chiropractor, he was a homoeopathic doctor.  He had studied to be a medical doctor, but then felt that treatments and nutrition, vitamins, etc., were very necessary so became a homoeopathic doctor.  In fact, he started his own college in .  He was the best we have ever gone to and I grew to love this little elderly white-haired man.  He loved the Lord and wanted to help people.  He helped us more than any other we have ever gone to and I will forever be grateful to him and the Lord for how David's life was spared more than once, and how he help Ken and I and all our family.  When I would thank him, he would say “Girlie, don’t thank me, thank the Lord”.  Ken was doing construction work and a fellow above him slipped and dropped the board he was holding and it fell on Ken’s back and he was in terrible pain.  He went to Dr. Opie for several treatments, but they didn’t help.  I suggested he go to Dr. Swanstrom, which he did.  Ken told me that Dr. Swanstrom had him lie face down on his massage table and he went down Ken’s back with his fingers and all of a sudden Ken’s body just jerked and the pain was gone.  He asked Dr. Swanstrom what he did and he said “I just released the vertebra.”  Ken was amazed and he felt great after that.

I have only mentioned a few of the chiropractors I have gone to, and the one I go to now (1998) is Dr. Dr. Dale Bennett.  He isn't a Dr. Swanstrom, but he is helping me more than any other chiropractor other than Dr. Swanstrom.  I am thankful the Lord has blessed me to find the help I need.  Dr. Bennett said awhile back that if he were to take my x-rays to the  of chiropractic, they would be amazed that I can live a normal life with my back the way it is.  He said he has shown my x-rays to the other doctors he works with and they are amazed also.  I have had a lot of problems especially with my neck and lower back.  I get terrible headaches and my eyes burn when my neck goes out, but when I get a treatment from him, I feel much better.  Also, my sackarillack (I used to think that was just a funny term) gives me a lot of problems.  I come by it rightfully thought as both Dad & Mom have had terrible backs.  Mom has scoliosis too, but also osteoporosis.  I don't have that and hopefully I never will.  Dr. Dale Bennett says that since I have always gone to chiropractors and I exercise (walk) and I have taken estrace (hormones) since I had my hysterectomy, that I should be fine.  Dr. Johnson had me have a test taken which would determine if I did have osteoporosis and it showed I didn't, thank goodness.
How I met Dr. Bennett was after we moved back to Utah the last time from Arizona and moved in with Ken’s mother, I developed **Tendonitis** in my right arm.  I think part of it was from nerves from the problems we had had in Arizona with Larry & Tammy, with the IRS taking our money from the bank which caused me the stress of me having to go to work for NFIB and working long hours and traveling lots of miles, and having to have the children do most of the housework, Meals, laundry, etc. as when I came home I would have to work on my records and cards for the next day.  Also, the stress of Ken being so depressed and the stress for having to sell our beautiful home, the stress of having to make the decision to move in with Ken’s mother when I had never wanted to do that, but Ken asked if I would pray about it.  I finally did and I felt good about it so felt the Lord wanted us to do that.  Also, the work of packing and then unpacking at Ken’s mother’s home, etc.  Anyway, it kept getting worse and worse until I couldn’t sleep at night because I would try to get my arm in a comfortable position and I would just get to sleep when the pain would get so bad it would wake me up again.  Also, whenever I would move it very much, I would have a terrible pain come that felt like a knife stabbing me.  Soon the tendonitis came into my left arm also and then I was really a basket case.  I couldn’t lift my arms to comb or wash my hair, put on makeup, etc.  Ken or his mother had to do it for me.  I was grateful for Ken’s mother at that time as she had to make the meals and clean the house mainly by herself, as I couldn’t help her.  Ken and the children helped too.  The pain grew worse and worse and I didn’t know what I would do.  I wondered if I would have to live like this for the rest of my life, and if so, I hoped I wouldn’t live very long.  My parents tried to help me in every way they knew.  They took me to Crystal Springs close to Brigham City where they felt the mineral water would help me.  I enjoyed those times with them, but the mineral water didn’t seem to help much.  Mom was going to a little German lady, Phollie or Follie.  I don’t remember her last name.  She helped Mom so Mom had hoped she could help me.  Follie caused me a lot of pain as she tried to pull my arms different ways and massage them.  I didn’t feel I could go through the pain to go to her again. One day someone (don’t remember who) told me about a chiropractor, Dr. Bennett, who had helped them and a lot of others so maybe I should try him.  I did and after 3 treatments, the tendonitis was gone.  Wow! What a blessing that was.  Now I could resume my functions as a wife, mother, daughter-in-law, church member, etc., and I was very happy to be able to do that.
It is now 2018.  I haven’t been to Dr. Bennett for some time, but one morning I woke up with awful pain in my back and neck.  It wouldn’t go away, so after a few days I called, but there wasn’t a message when the phone wasn’t answered.  I went over to his office, but it was closed.  It had the usual hours, and I was there when it said they were in, so I wondered what was going on.  I got a permanent from my hairdresser, Dawn, whose office is next to Dr. Bennett’s and I asked her about the office being closed.  She said that he and his wife were at a concert when a drunken man in front of them fell back on Dr. Bennett, who fell back on his wife causing her to fall to the ground.  It broke her back and she died a few days later.  Dawn said that he is taking it so hard and blaming himself for falling on her, that he hasn’t been able to go back to work.  He is in his late 60’s, so guess he will have to retire.  That is so sad.

**NANCY LITCHFIELD** – is a nutritionist, and we were certainly grateful for her help.  We were living with Ken’s mom in Layton.  Ken had been to several doctors about the terrible pain he was in, but each doctor took tests and could find nothing wrong.  One finally said it was a form of arthritis and he would keep Ken on Penicillin the rest of his life, plus pain medicine and eventually Cortisone and eventually he would die in a wheelchair.  Ken came home from that office visit to find my dad in the driveway.  Dad told him he was taking him to their nutritionist, Nancy Litchfield in Ogden.  Ken hadn’t wanted to go to her, but he went.  When he came home, I asked him what she said and he said she talked so fast that he didn’t know what she said, but that it had something to do with the yeast in his body and she had him buy several nutritional supplements from her and she put him on a really strict diet.  He could mainly only eat vegetables and a little fish and chicken and could only drink water.  She wanted him to go to our doctor and get a prescription of Nystatin, which he did. Nystatin killed the yeast.  The next day after following Nancy’s instructions, the pain was half gone, the following day, it was almost all gone and we were all so grateful and relieved.  I know the Lord sent dad over just at that day and time, to take Ken to Nancy.  We have gone to Nancy several times and she continued to help both of us, but especially Ken.  Ken has pretty much had to stay on that diet ever since.  We were down visiting Shellie & Roy soon after the birth of little Garrett.  He was in so much pain at that time that Shellie didn’t think Garrett would get a chance to get to know his Grandpa.  Garrett was born the 19th of August 1989 so Ken has had this problem ever since, but thankfully to the Lord and Nancy, he is able to manage it and now at age 78, he can out work most younger men.  I am amazed at all he can do, and does do.

**Randy**, my cousin on the Porter side (Uncle Dale’s oldest son) became blind from a inherited eye disease, but he had a seeing eye dog and took the bus to Salt Lake where he was trained as a massage therapist and learned “Trigger”, which is deep massage and really can help people.  He became licensed and had a building built at the end of their property and was able to give treatments to people.  I was one who gained from that.  He helped me a lot.  His joints got bad from such hard work, that he had operations to replace some of his joints – thumbs, etc.  After some of the last treatments I got from him, he showed me a “Flex Tube”, Ken and I call it the “log”, but you roll on it and it really helps when your back, neck, etc., are hurting.

**JENNY PORTER** - Jenny Porter (Robin’s wife).  is a homeopathic practitioner and is licensed.  She keeps researching and knows her stuff.  We have gone to her for several years.  She does a “scan” on us and then tells us what health problems we have and what we need to take to keep healthy.  We have been grateful for her and the help she has given us.  One of the last times I went (Feb. 2017) she said “You must be really tired and don’t have much energy”. I told her “Yes” and she said my Thyroid was functioning as it should.  She said you probably are not sleeping very well either and I agreed that I wasn’t and she gave me homeopathic drops to take and some other nutritional pills and they really helped me.  I am sleeping much better and have more energy now.

**DEANNA** **DAVIS** was another person sent to me by the Lord.  She met Jenny and gave her massages.  They helped Jennie so much that she talked Deanna into joining her team of “Wellness” people.  Jenny was working out of her home in Mountain Green, but her husband, Robin, talked her into taking her office to his manufacturing plant, where he had lots of room for her.  She has several offices and several certified people who help with different aspects of our health. It is a “Wellness Clinic”.  This was about in 2012.  Jenny had a nutritional class that I attended and she introduced Deanna and you could get a free massage.  I did that and Wow, she was great.  I have scoliosis really bad, I have had it all my life, but thanks to my parents taking me to chiropractors when I was young and I continued to find good ones after I married.  My back and neck do hurt me a lot as my scoliosis is in a S curve and when my neck goes out, so does my lower back and vice versa.  Dr. Bennett helped me so much with my tendinitis, so I kept going to him until I met Deanna and she helped me so much that I hardly ever have to go to Dr. Bennett.  I went to Deanna twice a week at her home where she had better equipment to help me and then it graduated to once a week and then once or twice a month.  I loved going to her, even though it hurt many times, because she was such a spiritual and positive person.  I loved talking to her and could feel that she had the spirit of the Lord with her.  Deanna told me that if I had waited 10 more years, that she wouldn’t be able to help me as my spine was going to the right and she said I would have been in so much pain.  I saw a man whose spine went that way when I was at Camperworld with Georgia.  He was a friend of hers, and wow he was in bad shape.  Deanna taught me some exercises to do each morning and said if I would do them, I could keep my back from hurting so much and my spine from going to the right.  I do them consistently and they have certainly helped me.  Not long after, Deanna found she had cancer and passed away.  We were all so sad, but thankfully she helped me and many others.
