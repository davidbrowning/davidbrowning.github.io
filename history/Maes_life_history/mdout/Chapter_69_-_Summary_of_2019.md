Chapter 69 - Update for 2019 (January including July)

Ken keeps a good journal, so I just thought I would copy and paste his thoughts for his 80th birthday and our 60th anniversary in here.  Other than these two highlights of this year, we have planted a nice garden and are eating our lettuce from it and some cherry tomatoes now.  The larger tomatoes and cucumbers are coming on now also.  It is great to just go outside and pick these fresh vegetables.
Ken decided he needed to work on the north side of our property.  It has three large trees on the north side of our long driveway with beautiful ground cover all around the trees, but the grass has died out and it didn’t look good.  The owner of the park is quite strict about having all our yards looking great, but Ken wants that anyway.  Ken dug a trench next to the driveway and pounded rounded bricks down in the ground.  It was quite a job digging the trench as there are so many roots from those big trees.  He also had to put in a new sprinkling system there before he put in the bricks.  He then borrowed Scott’s truck and brought in a load of top soil, then bought more ground cover plants, the same kind as we already had, planted them and now that area looks great.  Ken is quite a guy; he can do about anything.
We decided last year that we are done with camping and fishing, it was so much work and getting too hard for us.  Ken is 80 now and I am 78 and with my back and sleep problems, it wasn’t fun anymore even though we love being with our family and we are thankful for the times we could go camping with them in the past.  We put our boat up for sale and sold it right away.  The man was excited and said our boat was just what he wanted.  He didn’t hesitate to pay us what we had asked for, which was $3,900.  We had also listed our camper and truck on KSL.  A man from Salt Lake called on it, was excited to buy it and even gave us $500 more than we were asking, which was $3,500 since the blue book said that was the top price, but he gave us $4,000.  It has been a great truck, so it was hard parting with it, but since we won’t have the boat and camper, we don’t need it and it will save us money with not paying more vehicle insurance, taxes and registration, plus repairs when needed.  A man from Colorado saw our ad and came, with his older son, all the way with his truck to buy it.  He gave us $2,500.  He said he looked on the blue book and it was only worth $1,600.  We told him we knew we could get more than that, so we agreed on $2,500.
We are going camping with our family to our annual family reunion in Idaho the 8th, 9th 10th and come home on the morning of the 11th.  Jeff and Gail found this place.  It has a cabin and cottage, so Ken and I will be in one and Mike & Becky in the other.  Sandi & Gary, Scott & Mishelle and David & Shauna all have trailers or toy haulers so they will be in the RV parking.  Jeff, Gail & family will be in a tent, as will JaNae, Brad & kids and maybe David Michael, Sierra and children and Paige, Garrett & little Wreg.  We hope they can all come.  Chelci will be in Alaska at that time, so their family won’t be there and we will miss them.  Shellie, Roy & family can’t come either.  This place is by a river so the family can kayak down it, plus it has swimming pools, etc., so it will be fun.  Ken and I are glad that the children find places for our reunions now and they also take turns putting on the family Christmas party.  Ken and I host the annual Thanksgiving dinner at our stake center the Friday after Thanksgiving.
Ken and I keep busy, but I’m glad we are active and can attend grandchildren’s activities, go visit our special families, have family barbecues, dinners with individual families, go out to eat, movies, and play games with friends, go to church activities and meetings, etc.
I bought another Grandmother’s pass to Dinosaur Park this year as these younger grandchildren still love to go there.  I took Rachel, Matt, Kaden and Kaitlyn on Monday, the 8th of July.  We made a day of it.  We spent over three hours there, then we ate at McDonald’s and then fed the ducks and geese at Layton Park and the kids played on the playground.  They loved being together and didn’t want the day to end.  It was fun being with them.  I love our grandchildren and great grandchildren.
On Saturday, July 13th, we had a family barbecue at David & Shauna’s.  Sandi & Gary couldn’t come, Jeff & Gail, but the rest of us were there, well actually Mishelle couldn’t come with her family as she still needed to pack for their camping trip to Yellowstone as they are leaving the next day.  Mike & Becky’s daughter’s, Maddy and Jessie drove up to Idaho to a cousin’s homecoming talk from returning from her mission.  David grilled our meat (we all brought our own meat and a side dish.)  We had lots of good food, visited and had a great time.  The weather was a little crazy with rain at times, so we couldn’t eat outside, but still have a fun time.  Several of us stood at the top level of their yard and watched the storm roll over the mountains into this valley.  It was quite a sight.  David & Shauna are always such good hosts.
We have my siblings/spouse get togethers every three months.  We were at Kim and Jeanenne’s in January where they had a wonderful meal for us, we visited and reminisced about experiences we had growing up, it was fun.  In June, we went to Terry and Angela’s where she had a wonderful meal, we visited and played games.  They invited us to stay over, so Ken and I and Georgia and Rick did, but Bryce & Deanna and Kim & Jeanenne had to go back home.  The six of us had fun visiting and playing games.  The next morning, we had breakfast, then Ken and I left to go visit JaNae, Brad and their children who live in Idaho Falls.
JaNae & Brad recently moved into a new older home, so when we got there, JaNae & girls took me on a tour of it and showed me their wonderful back yard.  It is private, has a garden spot and beautiful big trees.  Kennedy climbed up one while we were out there.  It was so pretty and shady.  I thought how nice it would be to just sit in a reclining lawn chair with a good book and cold water in the shade of one of those trees.  It just seemed so relaxing.  Brad looks so good now.  He had had a bad infection in his leg that was killing him.  He was operated on and he started getting better.  He now can work part time and helps a friend flip homes.  That is how JaNae & Brad got their home.  It is just a couple of blocks away from where they were renting a home, so the kids are in the same schools and they thought they would be in the same ward, but it divides on their road and their side of the road is in the other ward.  This ward doesn’t have as many youth, so they feel bad about that as the kids had such good friends in their old ward and a great bishop and ward members.  They also showed us lots of great furniture in their family room and garage.  She said that Brad’s friend told him that his parents had passed away and they were having an estate sale, but he had marked several pieces of furniture that he wanted.  He asked Brad if he could help him load them into his trailer and take them home.  Brad, of course, said he would.  After the trailer was loaded, the friend drove to Brad’s home, backed the trailer into Brad’s driveway and said “After Dawson helps you unload this furniture into your home tomorrow, you can bring my trailer back.”  Brad said “What?  This was your furniture.”  The friend told him that he and his wife didn’t need it, but knew Brad and JaNae did, so wanted to give it to them.  Wow! What a great friend.  Brad grilled some chicken for all of us, Kennedy helped her mom make a nice tossed salad and we had a great lunch.  Afterwards we just sat and visited for quite a while.  I was impressed with Kennedy as she got up, gathered up the food and dishes from the tables, put the food away and did the dishes.  Her mom hadn’t asked to do it, she did it on her own.  She is a cute girl, and so is Emma.  Emma has always been so sweet and she still is and Dawson is also sweet and a cute boy.  He is fifteen now, our oldest great grandchild.  We played a fun game with them and then we had to leave to get home, but it was so good to be with this family again.
We have lots of lonely widows and widowers here in our ward and park and many with health problems, so we like to visit and help them.  Ken keeps busy with helping others, doing projects on our home and yard (I think he’s about done with that; I hope).  He is also typing up the many stories he has in his memory and I’m happy about that.  Ken and I enjoy being together and we help each other in many ways.  We have a great marriage.  Our health is pretty good.  I deal with insomnia, restless legs, back problems and arthritis, but for my age, I am in much better health than most.  Ken still has to watch his diet to keep out of pain, and he has some arthritis also.  He gets tired easier, but so do I.  We are thankful for all we can do.
Saturday, March 2, 2019 (From Ken’s journal)
My children were planning an 80th birthday dinner at our stake center for me.  We didn’t think Shellie would be able to come since she had started working and her boss didn’t want her to take time off, but she insisted and surprised us by calling a couple of days before and asking if we could pick her up at the Ogden Airport.  Wow! We were so excited.  We picked her up on Friday and spent the day visiting, playing games and enjoying having this special daughter with us.  The next morning, after finishing breakfast, Shellie, Mae and I started making chicken salad sandwiches, for the party today.  Working together, it didn’t take very long to have them all ready.  Mae had made the salad on Thursday, as it is better if it is made a day or two earlier.  I cut the rolls with the electric knife and Mae & Shellie put the salad inside.  The rolls were long rolls, so I cut them in half, and they arranged them on large trays.  Mae and Shellie went over to our Stake Center, where they met Sandi and Gary, to start setting up for the party.  I was invited to stay home.  At 1:30pm, Mae came home, and I went back with her.  We went directly into the Relief Society room where a long dining table was set for me and all my children and their spouses were there.  A wonderful meal was catered by Café Rio.  Mike had assembled a video of pictures depicting many events of my life.   The room was decorated with 80th Birthday decorations and all my family and companions, except for Roy (Shellie’s Husband) was there.  After eating, visiting and taking pictures, we went into the recreation hall.  Most of our grandchildren and great grandchildren were there.  The room was well decorated with balloons, posters, large posters of couples dancing, 80’s signs, etc.  The tables were set up around the outside of the cultural hall and pictures of me, or me with Mae or Mae & I with our children were on the tables, as well as big bowls of popcorn with scoops and popcorn bags, as Sandi knows that popcorn is her dad’s favorite.  She had two large birthday cakes to serve everyone, along with the chicken sandwiches, and potato salad which Mae had also made.   Gary’s youngest brother, who is a professional Disk Jockey, had all the music set up for Dancing.  Most of the music was music which Mae and I had enjoyed dancing to throughout our life.  Throughout the next several hours, extended family members kept coming.  What a wonderful evening and celebration, it was perfect.  Sandi, with a lot of help from Gary, just did a beautiful job of putting together this Birthday Party.  Her brothers, Sister, and Mother were all involved with the party, but Sandi was the director and organizer, and did a lot of the work.  She is amazing.  I loved this special celebration and felt lots of love for my family and extended family.
My birthday is February 27th and that was a special day also.  Mae made it special and my children and some grandchildren either called, texted or sent cards to me.  Mae & I went out to dinner that evening.
# Wednesday, June 19, 2019    60th Wedding Anniversary
This morning we went to the Salt Lake Temple.  The Parking under the Conference Building was full and so we had to park behind the Church History building.  That was quite a walk for us to the temple entrance.  We arrived just in time to be on the 11AM Endowment Session.  Following the session, we just sat and enjoyed being in the Celestial Room for several minutes.  As we left, I mentioned to one of the workers, that we were celebrating our 60th Wedding Anniversary and he asked if we would like to go to the sealing room where we had our marriage performed.  We said we would.  When we told him that it was performed in a basement sealing room, down some circular stairs, he told us that an elevator shaft now occupied that area and so no one can go there.  He did take us to where we could see the stairwell.  He also pointed out the area where the Holy of Holies is located.  Also, we were shown, from the inside, the East doors where almost everyone that is married in the temple, has wedding pictures taken.  It was really a special experience and the brother was so kind.  After leaving the temple, we drove up to Chuck-A-Rama on 700 East and 4th South.  There we enjoyed a nice “all you can eat lunch”.  They also had frozen yogurt for dessert.  When we got in our car, I suggested that we move the car into the shade and then take a short nap.  Mae agreed.  After waking, we went back to temple square and browsed around in the Joseph Smith Building, the Church Office Building and a visitor’s center. Then we went to Deseret Book where we bought the book “Insights” by President Nelson and a picture of the First Presidency.  Gail had given Mae a gift card for Deseret Book for her birthday, so we used that.  By then we were tired and came home.  We were tired when we got home.
Gail had told me that we need to come to their home to help celebrate our 60th anniversary and we should invite the rest of our family.  She said they had lots of room for sleeping and we could all have a great time on Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday morning.  It was also David & Shauna’s 25th wedding anniversary so they were going on a trip to celebrate.  It turned out that Sandi & Gary were the only ones who could come, but we had a great time together.  The following is what Ken wrote.

Mae didn’t sleep very well last night.  I woke at 5:20AM and Mae got up before 8AM.   Sandi and Gary came about 9AM and we rode with them to Jeff and Gail’s.  Getting there, we visited and played some games.  Gail prepared stir-fry for dinner.  Because I suggested that we go to the “Orange Leaf” for frozen yogurt, we drove to Twin Falls.  On the way over, Jeff stopped at The Shoshone Falls, as Sandi and Gary hadn’t seen them, before.  The falls were flowing quite heavy this evening and it was a beautiful sight.  On the way back home, Jeff drove to the Twin Falls.  By the time we got there, the water flow had been reduced quite a bit, but they were still worth seeing.  After getting back home, we played games until bedtime.
Saturday, June 22, 2019
We were later getting up this morning.  Most of the day was spent playing games and visiting, as it was uncomfortably cool, to be outside.  Jeff took the family, as well as Sandi, Gary, Mae and I out to breakfast at a restaurant in Twin Falls.  There was a large crowd there, being it was Saturday morning, but the wait was worth it.  We then stopped at a “Farmer’s Market” in Twin Falls, which I thought was a waste of time.  They had very little and was quite expensive.  Sandi made a delicious breakfast casserole for dinner.  This evening Sandi and Gary, Jeff and Gail, and Mae and I played a game of “Hand & Foot”, which Sandi and Gary won.
Sunday, June 23, 2019
Sandi, Gary, Mae and I left for home shortly after 8AM.  It was 11AM when we got to our place.  Gary and Sandi let us off and then they went on home. It’s been a great trip.  We enjoyed visiting with Sandi and Gary as we rode to and from with them.  We are so happy that they have each other, as they sure love each other and have fun together.  Gary is opposite from what Nick was.  Gary is a doer and a goer and he is a perfectionist.  Nick was lazy and didn’t want to help Sandi or do anything with her, other than go out to eat once a week or to a movie.  I was glad he at least did that.  Nick just wanted to watch sports when he got home from work. and didn’t show much love or affection to Sandi, where Gary is always telling her he loves her, brings flowers to her as often as the old ones die out, and he shows lots of affection to her.  He is so good to Sandi and we are thankful for him.
