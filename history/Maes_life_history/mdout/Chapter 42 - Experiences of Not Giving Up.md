# Chapter 42 â€“ EXPERIENCES OF NOT GIVING UP:

"Don't quit or give up".  That has been my feelings since I was young.  I hope I will always be strong in this especially with regards to the church.  I will relate a few incidents in hopes that when my family reads this, they will realize the importance of "not giving up".

The first was when we moved to  in 1968, I was asked to teach the **Trekker boys in Primary** - 10 year olds.  They had had a wonderful teacher whom they loved, but she was asked to be the chorister in MIA.  She was sad because she loved the boys and wanted to stay with them, but hated to turn the Bishopric down so she accepted.  The boys were really upset and when I came to be their teacher, they wouldn't accept me.  I tried to sit next to them in opening exercises and they would scoot away from me and give me terrible looks and say "leave me alone".  When we went to the classroom, I really had problems.  They were running all over the room, yelling, and causing all sorts of disturbance.  The Primary President had to come in a couple of times and talk to them.  I went home crying more than once.  But, I wasn't going to let them get to me.  I kept trying, praying and fasting.  Finally two or three months later, the lesson was on knot tying.  I had been stake activity counselor in the Farr West stake in  and been over camp for the young women, and also camp director 2 or 3 years later for three years - so was good at tying knots.  When the boys saw that I could tie knots, they decided I wasn't all bad - and it went uphill from then on.  I had one boy, Lane Adams, who was my biggest challenge.  I really worked to get him to accept me, and we became close.  It seems the ones you work hardest with become the closest to you.  His mother became my first counselor in the primary presidency a few months later when they asked me to be the Primary President.  Carolyn Cue was my second counselor.  We had a wonderful presidency - thanks to inspiration and the spirituality of Kent Murdock who was the counselor in the Bishopric over the primary.  He later became Bishop and Ken was his first counselor.  (That's another story)

Another** **challenge** **of** **teaching** **a** **class** **was** **when** **we** **moved** **down **to**  the** **first** **time - in** **the** **Lehi** **ward.  I** **was** **asked **to** teach** **the** **Laurels.  I** **was** **really** **excited** **because** **I** **had** **taught** **the** **Mia** **Maids** **in** **the** **Mount** **Fort** **Ward** **in  and** **loved** **them.  Deanna** **Green (now** **my** **sister-in-law, Bryce's** **wife, was** **one** **of** **the** **girls** **in** **my** **class) and** **I** **had** **been** **ward** **MIA** **counselor, president** **and** **stake** **activity** **counselor (now** **YWMIA) since** **Ken & I** **were** **married.  I** **had** **loved** **working** **in** **the** **MIA.  When** **we** **moved** **from  **to** , I** **had** **been** **in** **the** **primary** **and** **in** **Relief** **Society.  I** **loved** **the** **children, but** **I** **missed** **the** **young** **women.  I** **felt** **the** **Laurels** **would** **be** **the** **best** **age **to** teach** **as** **they** **were** **past** **the** **giggling** **stage** **and** **were** **more** **mature.  The** **Laurels** **in** **the** **other** **two** **wards** **were** **great** **examples **to** the** **younger** **girls.  But, I** **was** **in** **for** **a** **rude** **awakening** **with** **these** **girls - they** **were** **not** **a** **good** **example **to** the** **younger** **girls, in** **fact, they** **were** **awful.  The** **first** **week (this** **was** **before** **the** **block** **schedule** **and** **we** **met** **each** **Tuesday** **night** **for** **lessons** **and** **activities) I** **sat** **in** **opening** **exercises** **with** **them** **and** **was** **horrified** **as** **one** **of** **the** **Laurels** **made** **fun** **of** **one** **of** **the** **Mia** **Maid** **girls.  The** **Mia** **Maid** **was** **one** **of** **14** **children** **of** **the** **lst** **counselor** **in** **the** **Bishopric.  I'm** **not** **sure** **if** **this  felt** **this** **family** **wasn't** **as** **good** **as** **hers** **or** **what - but** **she** **was** **saying **to** her "mice, mice** **are** **running** **up** **and** **down** **you".  She** **kept** **it** **up** **and** **the** **other** **Laurels** **were** **snickering.  I** **finally** **took** **all** **I** **could** **and** **told** **her **to** stop.  During** **class** **they** **were** **doing** **everything** **except** **trying **to** listen **to** the** **lesson.  I** **felt** **I** **was** **well** **prepared** **and** **I** **have** **always** **tried **to** put** **a** **lot** **into** **my** **lessons** **so** **they** **would** **not** **be** **boring.  They** **were** **visiting** **among** **themselves, doing** **their** **nails, two** **were** **combing** **each** **other's** **hair, etc.  I** **was** **really** **disgusted.  I** **went** **home** **crying.  Ken** **asked** **me** **after** **several** **classes** **such** **as** **this, why** **I** **didn't** **quit** **and** **I** **said** **because** **I** **don't "quit".  The** **Lord** **will** **help** **me** **again.  I** **remember** **one** **terrible** **joint** **activity** **where** **the** **boys** **were** **supposed **to** teach** **the** **girls** **how **to** change** **tires, etc., and** **the** **girls** **were** **going **to** teach** **the** **boys** **how **to** bake** **cookies, iron** **their** **shirts, etc.  It** **turned** **out** **terrible.  Even** **in** **the** **planning, the** **girls** **just** **wanted **to** go** **out** **and "neck" with** **the** **boys - that** **was** **their** **idea** **of** **an** **fun** **activity.  One** **girl, during** **the** **time** **we** **were** **in** **the** **kitchen** **teaching** **the** **boys** **how **to** bake,  found** **some** **matches** **in** **the** **cupboard** **and** **started** **lighting** **them** **and** **acting** **like** **she** **was** **going **to** start** **a** **fire.  Another** **dance** **activity, one** **girl** **brought** **her** **boyfriend** **and** **then** **wanted **to** go** **off** **with** **him.  We** **had** **set** **some** **strict** **rules** **because** **of** **the** **way** **these** **boys & girls** **were - so** **we** **ended** **up** **calling** **her** **father, who** **came** **and** **got** **her.  I** **really** **had** **problems** **with** **her** **for** **awhile** **after** **that.  I** **fasted** **and** **prayed** **and** **about** **half-way** **through** **the** **year, they** **came** **around.  I** **think** **they** **finally** **realized** **that** **I** **cared** **about** **them** **as** **I** **had** **done** **extra** **things** **for** **them, but** **one** **night** **they** **were** **at** **my** **home** **baking** **cookies **to** send **to** the** **missionaries** **from** **our** **ward.  We** **had** **a** **good** **time** **and** **from** **then** **on, it** **got** **better** **and** **better.  They** **invited** **me **to** their** **temple** **marriages** **and** **the** **one** **girl** **who** **had** **made** **fun** **of** **the** **Mia** **Maid** **my** **first** **night** **there (Sharla) later** **became** **my** **counselor** **in** **the** **Primary** **presidency** **when** **we** **moved** **back **to**  in** **the** **40th** **ward** **in  about** **six** **years** **later.

Still another example was when I was asked to teach the **10 year old boys in Primary soon after we moved to Grantsville in 1980**.  After I was sustained in that position, I had people coming up to me and offering me condolences as they said that was the hardest class in primary - that they had run several teachers out.  It was a hard class.  My son, David, was in the class, but he was wonderful, especially compared to the other 10 boys.  Each boy was unique in his misbehavior, but all of them misbehaved.  One made noises like he was an airplane (Greg Burgess), one tried to make the others laugh by making funny antics, etc. (Judd ), one was a smart allec, one couldn't sit still, etc., etc.  That class was really a challenge, but I determined they were not going to run me out.  I fasted and prayed and tried different approaches, etc.  But they finally came around when they realized I really cared about them.  I had heard the quote several years earlier "I don't care how much you know, until I know how much you care".  I baked and decorated birthday cakes, and took to them on their birthdays.  I had them come to my house and worked with them so they would be prepared to go into the Blazer class when they turned 11 years old, we had parties, I bore my testimony to them, etc.  I really did care about them.  I really grew to love each of them and was sad when they did turn 11 and went to the next class.
