# THINGS KEN DOES FOR ME TO MAKE ME HAPPY

He has always been very courteous by opening doors for me, helping me on with my coat, pulling out the chair for me at meal time and at restaurants, etc.

When we go shopping together, he always insists on carrying in the groceries or whatever we have.  If there is too much for him to carry in one trip he might let me carry a little, but not much.  When we go camping I pack the food, clothes, etc., from the house and he gets the camping gear, fishing gear, etc., ready and then he packs it in the car or truck and when we return home, he carries it all into the house (at least what goes in the house) and I unpack it.  We work together as a team.  We do this in most things.

When he calls me on the phone he always greets me by saying “Hi doll”, or “Hi good looking” or “Hi beautiful”, Kitten, Love, Sweetheart, Hon, etc.  And when I call him, he greets me the same way.  He always acts excited to talk to me.

When he has to get up early in the morning to take a bus route, do handyman work at someone’s house, etc if I haven’t slept well that night, he has me sleep in and he gets his own breakfast.  Always if he is leaving early to go fishing, I fix his lunch the night before and he has me sleep in and he gets his own breakfast.

Whenever he does leave early in the mornings and I haven’t gotten up, there’s a cute note for me where he tells me to have a good day and expresses his love for me.  I love those notes and have kept many of them.

He loves to show me affection by hugging, kissing and holding hands.  I love that too.

When he has time, which he has never had a lot of time on his hands, he helps me with the dishes or does them himself

He lifts heavy things for me, feeds the animals each morning unless for some reason he can’t and then I do it.  He helps me in many ways

Elder LaGrange Richards, an apostle at that time and my dad’s second cousin, gave us good advice when he performed our marriage ceremony for us in the Salt Lake Temple, which we have tried to follow.  He told us we should have a Friday night date each week even if it was just to go for a walk or go get an ice cream cone.  He said we should get away by ourselves, without the children, at least once or twice a year, and at least for a night or two.  He said by doing these things we would keep our love alive and grow closer together.  We are thankful for this advice as it has done this for us.

He compliments me on the way I look.  He is always saying “You’re beautiful!” even when I don’t think so.  He praises me for the things I do.

When I have callings or presentations to give, many times he helps me or gives me good ideas.  He did this for me when I worked at the school district office also.

Sometimes he surprises me with flowers, or other small gifts.  He always brought me flowers when each of our children were born, and many times for our anniversaries, etc.

He likes to take me shopping on my birthday or anniversary or Christmas sales and if he sees more than one dress, pants, blouse or outfit that both of us like, he wants to buy them all for me.  We can’t afford that, but sometimes he has bought me at least 3 articles of clothing
