**Chapter **73** - ****CHALLENGES AND TRIALS I HAVE FACED DURING MY LIFETIME**

**My older** brother Hal.  Mom said he was jealous of me practically from the time I was born.  She said he tried to tip over my bassinet many times.  He was always teasing me and making me cry.  Maybe I cried too easily, but as I remember it, he hurt me a lot – both emotionally and physically.  I have written more about this in my life history.  I have also written about how when we started dating, we finally became close and enjoyed each other.  If we came home around the same time from our dates, I would fix us something to eat and as we ate we would tell each other about the dates we had been on.  We also taught each other new dance steps.  I got married first and Hal and Jean were married by our father, who was a Bishop at the time, and they were married in our home in .  They had a nice reception at Mom & Dad’s church the next night.  Hal and I had many talks over the years until his death.  He would call me when he and Jean were having problems and we would talk for long periods of time.  I always went to visit him when he was in the hospital from overdosing on sleeping pills.  He was a trial, but I loved him.  We had lived in Arizona for 3 years and I felt that one of the main reasons for moving back to Utah was to be here for Hal for a couple of years before he took his life.  I was glad I was here for Mom and dad at that time too.  It was such a hard time, but our family pulled together and we put our trust in the Lord.

Growing up as a girl in my family – girls worked while the boys played.  It wasn’t fair, but life is not fair, and I am thankful for the skills I learned and the work habits I developed and the service I gave (even though most of the time I didn’t enjoy it then.)  I changed that when I had our family – both girls and boys shared in the responsibilities of the home, yard, land, etc.  I wrote more about this challenge also in my life history.

Being on the “move” since marrying Ken.  When the children were young, it was kind of exciting to move and have a different home, surroundings, have new experiences, make new friends, etc., but as the children grew older it became harder as I hated to uproot them from their friends, school, environment, etc. and it became harder for me to leave my nice homes where Ken had finished the basements, landscaped the yard, etc.  I hated to leave our good wards, friends, neighbors, etc.

Five miscarriages – all were hard, but especially Amy who had water on her brain and her heart stopped beating when I was 7 months along with her.  The doctor wanted the baby to just sluff off, so he had me come into his office every other day to check my blood, finally after a couple of weeks, he decided to start the labor and take the baby.  The doctor didn’t give me anything for pain as he thought it would have shriveled up and would not cause me any discomfort.  The baby came breach and the head was huge so I was in terrible pain and went into shock.  I was so upset that he hadn’t given me anything for pain.  When I came in for my 6 weeks checkup, the doctor told me that I was in really good health for a woman of my age (40) and that I should try again for a baby.  We did and I lost it at 3 months and I went into a terrible depression.  When I went back for my 6 weeks checkup, he again told me that I should try again.  That made me mad and I told him that if I got pregnant again and lost it, he would probably lose me too so I told him that I would not try again, that I would raise the 6 children I had
.
Sandi having colic so bad for the first 3 months of her life that she could only sleep for a maximum of 20 minutes at a time and she was screaming most of the time.  Ken was working 2 jobs and we had just moved in to a new home and neighborhood so when Ken would come home at midnight I would be walking the floor with Sandi screaming and me crying.

David’s health problems as a baby and child – tonsillitis, ear infections, croup, penicillin shot at age 16 months which caused great pain and paralysis with his left leg.  It eventually caused a club foot.  We took him to all kinds of doctors and finally the best orthopedic doctor in the western , Dr. Coleman at the .  Our doctor was able to make the appointment.  He did two operations which straightened his foot.  He was about 7 at this time.  David almost died at age 4 with coughing spasms.  We took him to Dr. Swanstrom, a homeopathic doctor in  who had helped our bishop’s wife so much and he, with the help of the Lord, we feel saved David’s life.  My mom said when they left to go back to  from visiting us “I never expected to see David alive again.”

Sandi’s older teenage years and marriage to David Nix.  She suffered for 16 years in that bad marriage.  She even tried suicide when she felt there was no other way out.  We are so grateful that she finally did get out of that marriage.  We are thankful for her two beautiful daughters, however.

Moving in with Ken’s widowed mother in her home for almost 4 years.  It wasn’t all bad, I enjoyed the ward and made many friends and grew to appreciate Ken’s mom in some ways, but it was also hard. I did go to work at SOS Temporary Service for 3 years and then got a job as head secretary at Lincoln Elementary.  While there both Mike and David went on their missions and Shellie got married.  That is why we lived there that long – we kept having big expenses, but it was also a blessing financially.  This move was really hard on Jeff.  Grandma Jensen was mean to Jeff.  I hope someday he will forgive his grandmother.

Scott’s older teenage years & his hard rock music which he acquired a love of since listening to it while working at Golden Coral.  We’re thankful for Mishelle who came along at the right time and while dating him said she would only marry a returned missionary.  He wondered if other “good” girls felt the same way and decided he had better change and prepare to go on a mission.

Financial reverses – We did good while we were living in Sunset, after our marriage, and then in Ogden, where we bought our first home and Ken was working for Commercial Security Bank as a Supervisor over Data Processing and as a computer programmer.  We struggled financially every time Ken went into the contracting business with Larry.  Larry always painted such a beautiful picture of how much money he was making and how good the business was.  I guess it was when he was telling us that, but soon after we had gotten into the business, it would change and we would be in a recession.  The building industry is up and down.  We always got into it when it was at the peak and then it came sliding down.  Ken went into this business with Larry four different times.

Ken’s health – immune system damaged when he had strep infection throughout his body and the doctors gave him large doses of antibiotics.  Pain started in his feet and went throughout body.  Went to many doctors who took many tests.  They couldn’t find out what was wrong so finally said he had a rare case of arthritis and they would keep him on pain pills and antibiotics until they would finally have to give him cortisone and he would die in a wheelchair.  My dad took him to Nancy Litchford, who was a nutritionist, who helped them.  She talks 90 miles an hour, but is very knowledgeable.  She put him on a strict diet and he bought several bottles of nutrients.  He had a overgrowth of yeast.  When the Nystatin killed the yeast and he was on the strict diet for only a day or two, most of the pain had gone away and soon all of it was gone.  He had to stay on the diet for 3 months.  He has been on this diet several times over the past 20 years.  It is now 2008.  He can’t eat sugar, although he had been eating frozen yogurt for the past few years and it didn’t seem to bother him.  We began drinking a special drink Uncle Wayne drinks which he claims has kept him very healthy all his life – not even a cold.  We took it for 10 months and we did not get sick either, but all of a sudden in late July 2008, he came down with terrible pain – the yeast problem was back, and we found out it was because of the drink we had been taking – 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar with mother, 1 tsp of honey and 3 shakes of cayenne pepper in a glass of water.  The vinegar and honey had mounted up in his body and caused the yeast to explode.  We went again to , got on the strict diet and lots of nutrients, but it took 4 weeks for the pain to leave this time.  I am also on the diet and also have the yeast problem.  I don’t have the pain, but maybe had attributed to Ken’s problem as we passed the yeast back and forth.  We have been on this diet 2 months and it is not fun, but always his pain has left, and we have both lost weight and are feeling pretty good.  Although, I got sick with a virus caused by stress when Jeff attempted suicide on Sept 16, 2008.  **It is 2013** now and both Ken and I have been diagnosed with being allergic to gluten and dairy and both of us are not supposed to eat sugar, although I’m not as good about that as Ken is.  It brings him immediate pain, so he can’t even have frozen yogurt anymore.  I don’t sleep as well usually if I have eaten much sugar and I know it’s not good for me, but it sure tastes good and sometimes I just say, “It might be worth it.”  It was hard at first to eat this gluten & dairy free diet and hard for our families and others to fix meals for us, but as the years have passed, it has gotten easier and we usually take some food with us when we got stay with our children and their families. We don’t have the variety that others do, but we eat healthy and, so we are healthy and that is such a blessing that it is worth mainly eating green salads, brown rice, Quinoa, fish, chicken and most vegetables and some fruit.

Taking care of our aged parents – Mainly our mothers.  My mother had good mental health, but her physical health was bad.  Ken’s mother’s physical health was great, but her mental health was bad, and she got Alzheimer’s disease.  I have written more of these challenges in my life history.

Jeff and David losing their testimonies, & also Scott now struggling with his – SO HARD

Jeff’s mental health problem, attempted suicide and Gail & Jeff separating.  So thankful they worked it out and are now back together and happy.  They love each other and their 3 children – Ben, Rachel & Matt.

# Health problems I’ve had or still have:

**Scoliosis** - My back hurts most of the time and sometimes it hurts pretty severe, especially my lower back and neck as I have an S curve and when my neck goes out, my lower back does and vice versa.  I’ve gone to chiropractors most of my life and that has really helped along with exercise.  **Dr Dale Bennett** helped me a lot and when he took my x-rays to the Palmer College of Chiroprictic for a conference and showed them to his colleges, they asked how I even got around.  He told them I did great! And I do.  **Deanna Davis** helped me the most.  I met her in about 2012.  I went to Jenny Porter for a class and she had Deanna tell about her massage treatments.  I went to her and she “saved me” from what would have been severe pain with my scoliosis causing my body to pull to the right.  It was starting to do that and had I not found her, in ten years she said I couldn’t have gotten help and I would be bowed to the right and in so much pain & misery.  I know the Lord blessed me to find her.  She took so many classes and had a gift.  Hers was not the “feel good” massage, but the deep massage, like Randy does, but she was much better than he was.  I loved talking to her as she was such a good person and had such knowledge, skill and perception. I have a friend in the Monte Vista Ward (we moved here in November 2014), who had this same problem.  She is about 10 years younger than me and when I met her, she was severely bowed to the right and it was so painful for her and she kept falling and having problems.  The doctor finally told her that she needed to have the rods put down her spine.  She did, and she has had problems ever since with terrible health conditions.  She is on lots of medications so that her mind doesn’t work clearly most of the time.  She is in the hospital or rehab most of the time now and I wouldn’t be surprised if she doesn’t pass away within a short time. We home taught her (Evelyn Hilton) and her husband, Harold from the time we moved here.

I had **High blood pressure** and was on blood pressure medication for several years.  It started when I was working as the secretary for Staff Development at Davis School District, at least that is when my blood pressure would always be high when I went in for my checkups with Dr. Johnson.  He had me go get it checked at different days and different times and it was always high, so he put me on the medication to bring it down – and it did, but in 2010 our nutritionist, Nancy Litchford did a scan on both Ken and I and said we were allergic to Gluten and Dairy and we shouldn’t eat sugar.  Ken was already on a strict diet with his yeast overgrowth problem, he wasn’t able to eat sugar and mainly vegetables, chicken, fish & some fruit, so we took away gluten & dairy too.  I lost so much weight that I called up Nancy and told her that I only weighed 108 now and I was too thin.  I asked her what I could eat to put on some weight and not keep losing and she said to eat avocados.  I didn’t like them at the time, but I have learned to like them, and it worked.  We went down to visit Shellie, Roy & family in Arizona soon after and I took my blood pressure machine with me.  I didn’t have much energy and didn’t feel the best, so I took my blood pressure and it was pretty low, instead of high.  I checked it different times and it was always low, so I quit taking my blood pressure medication.  I went to Dr. Lee soon after we got back and told him about it.  He checked it and said “Good, don’t take the medication, I guess your diet has brought it down.”

**Fibromyalgia** **and restless legs** –  I had lots of pain in my body and my legs and feet were driving me crazy.  I got an appointment with Nancy Litchford and after talking to her, she asked me different questions and I answered them in the affirmative.  She said I’m sure you have **Fibromyalgia** and restless leg syndrome.  She had me take some nutrients, but I still suffered with it.  I remember sitting on the couch visiting with people and my legs were so jumpy and nervous that I had to keep moving my feet and legs and I thought I would go nuts.  I couldn’t sleep well at night because I would lie on one side and my hips would hurt so bad, I would have to change to the other side.  I finally found that sleeping on my back was the best even though that was not the way I had slept all my life.   After Ken and I had been on the gluten free, dairy free and sugar free diet for a few months, I noticed that I didn’t have the pain in my body and the nervousness in my feet and legs, like I did before.  The diet had helped so much.  I wish I could eat the way I used to, but it is worth it to get rid of these health problems.

I have hay **fever & allergies**, so I go through lots of Kleenex.  I am sneezing and wiping my nose so much of the time. I take some medication and it helps.

I have** dry skin with cracking fingers & knuckles**, especially in the winter.  We found a good cream titled “Working Hands & Feet” which help a lot.

**Poor circulation with bad veins in my legs**. I have never been able to stand for any period of time, so it’s good that I loved being a secretary, instead of a resale clerk, a beautician, and work in other places where I would need to be on my feet.  Our son, David, became a PA in Dermatology and suggested I buy some Dansko shoes, which he and many doctors and nurses wear.  I wanted some, so I picked out a nice black pair and our children gave me money to pay for them for my Mother’s Day gift in 2015.  I still wear them almost every day and love them.  They really help my feet and legs.  David has the same problem and was told about these shoes when he was in school.

Infection in eyes at times**.  **Prior to going on our mission to the Philippines, **I** had several bouts of infection in my eyes and they would really burn.  **I** went to the eye doctor and he gave me a prescription for some antibiotic drops to put in my eyes**.  **They helped, and **I** took them with me on our mission**.  **After we were home and **I** had run out of them and still had burning in my eyes at times (it might have been allergies now) **I** sprayed my eyes with colloidal silver and that helped a lot.

**Bad teeth** which resulted in spending tons of time and money in the dentist chairs.  I was glad when I finally prayed about getting dentures and felt good about doing it.  I hadn’t wanted to before as my dentists and specialist who treated my periodontal disease told me not to as I would really regret it and my gums would get irritated and get worse.  I was going to my dentist every 6 months and my periodontal specialist every 6 months at one time – so you can see I spent lots of money.  My gums got better, thank goodness.  The straw that broke the camel’s back and made me decide to pray about dentures was when the dentist, I was going to at the time, and he had already worked on my teeth to the cost of over $1,000, told me that my bridge on the left of my upper teeth was gone as were the teeth under it and I would need to have “posts” put in which would cost $1,000 for each post.  Also, my caps on my front two teeth had to be replaced, he said and the tooth he had been doing a root canal on and couldn’t find the last canal would need to have more work done and then a crown.  Anyway, I could see I couldn’t afford to have all this done.  Ken had wanted me to get dentures years ago because of the cost and pain with my teeth.  I talked to Banita, Uncle June’s 3rd wife, and she said she loved her dentures (she had had teeth like mine).  I talked to a neighbor when I found out she had dentures and they were beautiful and she loved them, so told me to go to Dr. Gray in Kaysville.  I did, and he realized that I should have top dentures, but not the bottom.  I have loved them.

I had **a hernia & then operation** to have it removed when we were living in Era.  I had the operation at the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake.  At that time, the doctors used to have you come to the hospital the night before the operation.  My doctor came in to see me and asked how I was doing and if there was anything that he should know about that might be going on in my body that might prevent this operation.  I mentioned a rash that itched which was on my back.  He looked at it and said, “You are not going to be operated on in the morning, you have “shingles”.  I called Ken and he had to come get me and we had to reschedule the operation.  The shingles were not terrible, like Ken’s mom and many others have; they just mainly itched and burned some.  They finally cleared up and I went in for the operation.  They gave me a spinal for the anesthetic, and neither the doctor, nor the anesthesiologist told me to stay down and not move around for the 3 days I was in the hospital, which I found out later, I should have done.  In fact, the doctor came in to check me later that day an asked how I was feeling.  I told him I was feeling good, so he told me I could get up and go to the restroom whenever I needed to – so I did.  The next morning, he came in again to check me and asked how I was doing.  I told him, great! He said “Good! Then you can get up and move around more and walk the halls”. So, I did, in fact, I stopped in the rooms and visited with other patients and went to the gift shop, etc.  When I got home, I got **spinal headaches** which were so bad that I had to lie on the couch and not move.  Mom & dad came to help take care of the family.  Dad brought me his dramatized church history tapes which helped me so much.  It hurt so bad to even move my head a little and it was practically torture, to get up and go to the bathroom.  Mom talked to her friend, who was a nurse about it and that is when she said “What, they didn’t tell her to lie quiet and let the hole in the spine close up.” She told mom that by my getting up and walking around, it let air go in the hole and caused these terrible **spinal headaches**.  I sure wasn’t happy with the doctor and anesthesiologist when I found that out.

I had **5 miscarriages**, one before Sandi, two between Sandi and Shellie and one after losing little Amy.  I lost these four at three months along. The hardest being our little Amy who died when I was 7 months along.  She had water on the brain.  We were living in Arizona when I got pregnant.  I didn’t feel much life, like I had with the other babies, so I asked the doctor about it and he said not to worry as she was just a petite little gal.  When we moved to Grantsville and I went to an obstetrician in Salt Lake, he couldn’t get a heartbeat and said the baby was dead.  I was so sad.  I had been worried, when I got pregnant, about having another baby as we had moved to Arizona the 2nd time since Larry Braithwaite had convinced us that the building industry was booming, but a few months later a recession hit again, and Ken didn’t have the work that he needed, and I was worried about another mouth to feed and how we could afford this baby.  The baby wasn’t planned, in fact, I had a birth control coil inserted after having Jeff.  But after we found out we would be moving to Grantsville for Ken to manage the Grantsville Stake Farm, I wasn’t worried anymore and was excited to have another baby, especially since it was a girl.  Anyway, they had me come in and they checked my blood every few days.  That was also hard because they supposed that she would have shriveled up since I carried her for almost a month before they had me come to the hospital and induce her. They didn’t give me any pain killer, just the medicine to induce me.  I asked if they were not going to give me anything for the pain and the doctor said “No, we don’t need to.” Well, she came breach and her head was huge, so it was terribly painful, and I went into shock. I was freezing and shaking so hard.  They piled warm blankets on me, but it took quite a while for me to get over it.  When I went into the obstetrician, for my 3-month checkup, he told me that I was in great shape for a 40-year-old and that I should try to have another baby.  Since Ken, the children and I were disappointed that I lost this baby, I did get pregnant again, but I lost it at 3 months.  Again, I went in for my checkup and again he told me that I should try again to have a baby.  I was upset that he would even suggest such a thing now and I told him “If I got pregnant again and lost it, you would lose me.  You don’t know how hard this has been on me and my family to lost both these babies.  No thanks, I will raise the 6 I have.”

I have had **incontinence** for some time, so have had to wear pads for several years.  That isn’t fun, but mom had it and it appears that many older people do, especially women.  My one obstetrician told me he could write me out a prescription for some medicine that would help it, but I hate taking medications as they usually always have side effects, and I would have to take the pills the rest of my life.

I had tendonitis for 3 months in one arm and then it went to both of them which was so painful I couldn’t sleep or hardly do anything.  I thought I would go nuts.  We were living with Ken’s mom and she had to do practically everything as I couldn’t do much.  I couldn’t even do my hair.  It was a hard time.  Mom & dad took me to people they thought could help me, but no help until someone told me about Dr. Dale Bennett in Layton, who is a chiropractor.  After one treatment, it was relieved some so now I had some hope and after 3 treatments, it was gone.  Wow, was I ever relieved as I thought I might have to live with it the rest of my life and if so, I would not have a very good quality of life as I wouldn’t be able to take care of my family and hardly even me.

Not being able to sleep at night.  Some nights I can go right to sleep & sleep most of the night, but other nights I lay awake for 1 or 2 hours and finally get up and type on the computer (like I am doing now) or read.  I go from my bed, to the guest room bed, to a recliner in the living room.  My mind won’t shut off and my legs bother me (restless, jumpy, achy or shooting pains).  I’ve tried low doses of a sleeping pill Georgia takes & told me about, but it doesn’t help.  Jeanenne told me she takes liquid Melatonin, but it doesn’t seem to help much either.  I asked Lorraine at the health store and she sold me a bottle of homeopathic pills for sleeplessness & mental anxiety.  It helps some, but not always (it didn’t tonight).  Some nights I am so tired that I am sure I will go right to sleep, but sleep doesn’t come.  Getting old isn’t so fun.  I have to get up anywhere from 2 to 7 times a night to go to the bathroom, that isn’t fun either.  Sometimes I can’t go back to sleep, but most times I can.  Jenny Porter, who is a homeopathic practitioner, has helped me.  As she has scanned my body, she found that my thyroid isn’t working normally and that has caused me to not sleep well and also my energy level is low.  She has given me pills to help my thyroid and that has helped me to sleep better and feel more energy.  Sometimes I feel that these pills are getting used to my body, so don’t help as much.  Thyroid problems are in our family.  Mom had it and even had to have her guarder removed.  Bryce & Georgia have this problem and are taking medication for it.

I **don’t have the energy I wish I had**, especially when I am tending grandchildren.  Even though I have taken calcium, magnesium and other vitamins for a long time, gone to chiropractors, walked & did stretch exercises, I still struggle with it.  I went to Jenny Porter, who is a homeopathic practitioner; she did a scan on me and found that my **thyroid** wasn’t functioning like it should.  She had asked me if I had much energy and if I slept well.  I told her no, that I didn’t sleep well, and I didn’t have much energy.  She gave me (I paid for them) some drops, and they have helped.  Thyroid problems run in our family.  Mom had **thyroid** problems and had a goiter which had to be removed.  Georgia and Bryce take medication for their **thyroid**, and the problem with that is when you start taking this medication, you have to take it the rest of your life and I didn’t want to do this.  With Jenny’s drops, it cleared it up for the time being.  A few years later I needed to take these drops again, but they aren’t expensive, and they work.

**Osteoporosis, the pre-stage of it**, in my right hip and it sure bothers me.  I sure hope I don’t get it like my mother and her mother had it, but I might.  Mom had it much worse than grandma, but Mom lived thirteen years longer than Grandma Bushnell.  I’m starting to understand a little of what Mom went through.  My back hurts so bad that many times I have to lay down flat on the floor and it sure hurts when I do, but after laying there for a while & doing some stretch exercises, it helps.  I remember seeing Mom doing that when she was about my age or younger**. It is now 2016 and I do have Osteoporosis**.  I have lost over 4 inches.  Most of my life I was 5’5 ½ “, but now I am only 5’1 ¼ “.  The doctor wants me to take Fosamax and has given me a prescription.  I got the pills, but haven’t taken them yet as I have read the side effects and don’t like them.  I would have to take this the rest of my life too.  The doctor explained that if I fell and broke my hip or back then it would be a lot worse than taking these pills, but I have talked to others who say they haven’t help them and others who have said they did cause side effects – so we’ll see if I end up taking them or not.  I have shrunk 3 ½ inches.  I used to be 5’5 ½ “, but now I am 5’2”.  My lower back and hips hurt a lot, but I do my exercises each morning and that helps, plus both Ken and I use a roller.  Ken calls it a log.  It is round, long, foam log.  We roll on it and it really helps.  Randy told me about it.  It is now 2017 and I have shrunk another ½ “.  I don’t have much of a waist anymore and I have a stomach, which I’m not happy with, but the flesh has to go somewhere when you have shrunk 4 inches.  David is upset that I am not taking Fosamax as he says if I don’t, my bones will keep breaking and it will be too late for medications to help me and I will be in a lot of pain.  (December 2017) He said what Dr. Flinders said about if I should fall and break my hip or back, then it is a “death sentence”.  I know this happens, so it scared me, and I told him I would make an appointment with Dr. Flinders after the 1st of the year, and get a bone scan, and do what Dr. Flinders tells me to do.  He was glad to hear that

Well I have had health problems, and still do, but nothing like most people my age, and I am surely grateful for my health and those who have helped me throughout my life and my parents who were health conscious, especially my dad, and the good genes I have.
