# Chapter 75 - KEN’S PARENTS & SIBLINGS


**Ken’s mom remarried ****after Charles (Ken’s father) **died in March of 67.  She married Leo Jensen in June of 1970.  He is a wonderful man and we love him.  He was a temple worker and now she is.  They serve in the Idaho Falls Temple.

This is a family picture taken at a family reunion with Marge’s children – Rich (Dad Browning’s youngest son by his first wife), Margaret (Marge’s daughter by her first husband, Less), Roy (Ken’s older brother – he, Ken & Irven are children of Marge and Charles Browning), Irven is standing at the left of Leo Jensen.  Ken is on the front with his older brother, Bob (Floyd Robert), but he was called Bob.  Bob was also a son born to Marge and her first husband, Less).  Leo and Marge live at the time at 90 Boise Ave. in .  They are happy.

Leo was about 15 years older than Ken’s mom.  She, Marge, waned to be closer to her family and she didn’t like living in the home his first wife and he had built together, so they bought a home in Layton.  We were living in Grantsville at the time.  I think Ken’s mom wanted to live by us as previously they had visited us in Mesa, Arizona and thought of buying a home there, but we were only there 9 months when Ken was asked to manage the Grantsville Farm and because of a recession in Arizona, that was good timing and we moved up.  Ken’s mom loved her children, especially Margaret as she was her only daughter and she would drop whatever she was doing to go and help Margaret, but I think Ken was her next favorite, but she loved them all
Ken’s mom and Leo enjoyed each other and they went fishing together.  Leo was a fisherman and loved to fish the streams.  Ken’s mom would take a lawn chair and a good book and read while he fished, until one day she tried it and caught several fish and decided she liked to fish also.  The only problem was that Leo was baiting her hook and took off her fish, so he didn’t get as much time to fish, so he finally said: “Lady, if you want to fish, you will have to bait your own hook, and take care of your own fish as I am going upstream so I can get some fishing done.”  So, she learned to do it herself and they enjoyed going fishing together.
Leo’s heart started having problems and the doctor put in a pace maker.  Well, that was a bad decision as he only lived a year longer (as I remember) and it was a hard year for both of them as he developed other health problems because of age and finally passed away.  We loved Leo, he was a good man.
Several years later, after we had left the Grantsville farm, moved to Firth, Idaho for two years, then moved to Mesa, Arizona for the 3rd time, but was only there for another nine months when we had financial problems.  I had gone to work for NFIB and was doing good, but it was hard on me and on the family.  Ken was in a terrible depression and finally asked me about moving back to Utah and moving in with his mother.  Her home had five bedrooms.  I didn’t want to do that, but Ken asked me if I would pray about it.  I was desperate by that time, so I did pray and had the impression that we should move in with his mom.  I didn’t want to, but felt that was the answer to our problems so we could get back on our feet.  We were able to sell our home, but only got $1,000 out of it because we had only lived there for that short of a time.  We lived there for four years at which time Mike went on his mission, Shellie got married and then David left for his mission.  These were all expensive, so I had gone to work for S.O.S. Temporary Services and then got the job of Head Secretary at Lincoln Elementary.  Ken was working at Tooele Army Depot.  With problems of Ken’s mom not treating our son, Jeff, right, we knew we had to move and get our own place.  The Lord blessed us to find a beautiful HUD home in Layton, so it didn’t cost us what most homes would.  As we drove into that neighborhood, I had a wonderful feeling and as I saw the home, outside and inside, I had the same wonderful feeling and felt the Lord had led us to this home.  Actually, I know He did as it was like a miracle that we were able to get it.  (I’m sure I have written more about this in the chapter about this move.)
Ken’s mom was getting dementia and would lose things all the time – her purse, wallet, glasses, keys, etc.  She would call Bob.  He had retired from the Air Force after 20 years of being a baker and had bought a home in Sunset.  Bob would come over and look all over, but couldn’t find what she was looking for, so he would call me and ask if I could come over after work and look for it.  I would do that, but first I would say a prayer asking Heavenly Father to help me find it, and He did.  Mom Jensen would say, “I looked there and it wasn’t there.”
Mom Jensen’s sister, Aunt Vida, was living in an Assisted Living Center, and both of them were lonely, so Ken’s mom invited her to come and live with her, which she did.  That worked well until they were both having more problems.  Mom’s dementia was getting worse and it went into Alzheimer’s, so Ken and Bob decided they needing to move them in with one of them.  Bob ended up buying a home in Clinton with a full basement and Ken, with Bob helping, built their mother a nice apartment in his basement.  Aunt Vida moved there with Ken’s mom and that worked for a while until Aunt Vida got worse and her son, Mark, came to live with them as there was three bedrooms in that basement apartment.  He fixed most of their meals, and took care of his mom until she passed away just three months prior to turning 100.  We liked Aunt Vida.
Bob & Carroll took care of Mom Jensen for seven years when they called and told us it was getting too much for them and they needed help, so we worked it out with Irven and Sandy that we would take turns staying with her, but that didn’t work well, so Ken and I rented our home in Layton to Scott and Mishelle as Scott was going to College and they were just renting an apartment at the time.  Ken and I moved in with Ken’s mom and lived with her until we had to put her in a care facility as her Alzheimer’s disease was too hard on us as care givers.  Her doctor had told us that we needed to do that.  Her health was good, but her mind was gone.  She had a stroke and passed away at age 92.   (I’ve written more on all this in another chapter) and Ken and I went on our mission to the Philippines.



# RICH:
Rich & Lois live in Pocatello, Idaho.  They have raised a wonderful family who are all active in the church and are raising good families.  Rich & Lois are such good people and good examples.  They have always supported their siblings and families in all we do.  If there is a reunion, wedding, funeral, birthday party for Ken’s mom, etc., they are there, and they bring part of their family with them.  We love and admire them, and we love being with them.  We are always welcome at their home and they love us to stay overnight, and they feed us and we always play Mormon Bridge at night and have ice cream.  Rich loves that game and loves ice cream.
I think/hope I have written about the wonderful vacations we had with them at their condo in Island Park every February for several years, but I will add a little here about them.  They had snowmobiles and we would go on all the groomed trailed leading to Big Piney where we loved to go to watch the big fish in the river.  We would go up trailed to the tops of mountains.  One of them had all sorts of wonderful snow and ice creatures as the snow would blow on the trees, freeze and more snow would settle on them and freeze. It was really magnificent to see.  We also would go into Yellowstone and ride on the snow packed roads, see Buffalo, Elk, etc., see Old Faithful and all the beautiful places in Yellowstone.  Back at their condo, we would go to the clubhouse where we would swim, sit in the sauna, play ping pong, etc., and then eat dinner at the condo, play “Mormon Bridge”, read scriptures together and family prayer and call it a day.  We would stay with them a week and share expenses.  We got along so great and loved being with them.

# FLOYD ROBERT “BOB”:
Bob, Carroll and family, after Bob retired from the Air Force, bought a home and were living in Sunset, Utah.  Several years later, after their children were grown and gone, they bought a home in Clinton so Ken could remodel the basement and make an apartment for their mother.
Bob & Carroll had 6 children, but the one daughter died soon after child birth, so they raised five children – Bruce, Kathy, Grant, Robert, & Sherry.  Kathy & Sherry left the church and.  Sherrie had a child, Cole, out of wedlock and he has turned out to be a great young man, is living with his grandparents and going to college.  Sherry did marry another man later and both of them drank.  Sherry finally passed away from the Alcohol consumption.  Bob & Carroll never knew about this.  Carroll passed away with a stroke about a year before Sherry did.  This was hard on Bob.



# Bob’s family at Carroll’s funeral.

When we came back from our mission, we again lived in their basement apartment, that Ken had built for their mother and we had lived there for a few months, taking care of their mother as she had Alzheimer’s disease. As we had sold our home in Layton to Scott & Mishelle and had planned to build on our lot in Star Valley, Wyoming.  (I have written all about this in other chapters.)  Anyway, it worked out well living there with Bob & Carroll.  We shared all the expenses – utilities, property taxes and home insurance, repairs on the home, replacing the furnace, etc., etc.  Bob mainly cooked even though Carroll was a good cook, because Bob would complain at times about her cooking and she didn’t like to cook, so told him, he could do it.  They would invite us up for meals sometimes, especially on Sundays when we weren’t having our family over for dinner or going to their homes.  Carroll loved to play Canasta and that was about the only game she wanted to play.  We all enjoyed playing it.  Bob would pop, pop corn and we had enjoyable evenings.
Carroll got dementia and was imagining all kinds of things that were not true, and was so upset because no one would believe her.  She thought the neighbors were stealing their electricity, she knew they were up in their attic stealing things, etc., etc.  She called the Bishop to come check it out, she called the police several times until they quit coming.  That was a hard time for all of us.  She also had other health problems and her feet and legs would swell up so terribly.  After Carroll passed away with a massage stroke, Bob wanted to remarry so he asked me to look for him ladies to date on the “Mormon Singles Date Site” on the computer.  I found a couple and he dated them once each.  He realized that they all were older, like him, so had health problems and they all had baggage, so after a time, he gave it up.
Bob was a great baker, as he had done that in the Air Force, so he made delicious pies and brownies.  He would rap on the door, or up by the stairs and when I came to the door, he would say “Mae, I made a coconut cream pie.  I know Ken can’t eat it because of the sugar, but you can, so come and have a piece with me.”  I loved them.  At Thanksgiving, he would make all kinds of pies – apple, pumpkin, cherry, banana cream, coconut cream, lemon, etc.  Carroll made a soda cracker pie that was delicious too. Bob’s brownies were the best brownies around and the ward would ask him to make them when they had a ward dinner or activity.  He was always glad to do that.  He had worked
The main thing that was annoying about them, was that when they wanted Ken to do something or fix something for them, they wanted it done right now.  Ken had other things that he needed to do, but he would finally give up and do it for them.  Bob kept doing that after Carroll passed away.  If we didn’t get to the door right away, he had a hammer and would pound it and make a real racket.  We told him to have patience, that it took a minute or two for us to get to the door if we were in the bedroom or bathroom.
Bob’s health kept failing, so his kids felt he should be in an assisted living center.  Stacey (Grant’s wife) found a nice one in Layton and they moved him there.  That meant we had to move also, since Bob & Carroll had put their home on a reverse mortgage.  We bought a mobile home in the Monte Vista Mobile Home Park – a very nice senior living park in Roy and we are happy here.  We have a small lot, but it is beautiful with trees, bushes and flower gardens.  We also have a garden box in back.  It is nice not to have such a large garden and yard to take care of as Bob & Carroll had an acre lot and it was mainly Ken & I to take care of it.  Bob, would mow the lawns with his riding lawn mower before his health got worse.
Bob passed away while living at Chandler Gardens in Layton.  He had had heart operations in the past and his heart was getting worse.  His doctor wanted him to take some new medication.  He asked the doctor if the medicine would help him to have a better quality of life, or if it would just prolong his life.  The doctor said it would just prolong his life, so he said “I don’t want to take it them.”  The doctor said “Okay”, and just threw the medicine in the garbage can.  We have missed Bob as he was a great guy, had a good (kind of funny) sense of humor and usually always had a positive, good attitude.



ROY:
Roy, Linda and two children, Steven and Barbara, moved to Fresno, California as they don’t like the winters.  Roy worked for the IRS in Ogden and was able to transfer to Fresno .  Linda wasn’t able to have children, so they adopted Steve & Barbie.  Linda’s patriarchal blessing said she would have children, and she finally did at age 40.  Linda got pregnant with Julianna.  Steve got into drugs when he was a teenager, but got off them, went on a mission to Hawaii, came home and married a beautiful girl in the temple.  She died about a year later from a disease she had.  Steve had a terrible time and finally married another beautiful girl, and had two children.  He treated Heather badly and she finally divorced him.  He went back to drugs, but moved to Texas when she was living with her parents, so he could be near his children.  A few years later, they found him dead in a bar – so sad.  Barbara married a great guy in the temple and they had four children.  They are doing good.
When Ken and I were on our second mission – a service mission to Wasco, California, we would visit Roy & Linda as Fresno was only an hour away.  They would visit us also.  When we went there, we would all go to the Fresno Temple, go out to eat, play games and visit.  We also went on several trips with them during holidays.  We went to Yosemite National Park, San Francisco and Hollywood.  Those were fun trips.  They also invited us to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with them.  We did and had a wonderful time also.  (I think I wrote more about this in the chapter on our missions)
Linda was diagnosed with a liver disease and eventually passed away in 2013? (I think that’s the year).  Roy is lonesome and has dementia.  Barbara & Russell live in Sacramental California and Roy lives in Fresno, about 3 hours away, but they come down about every week to check on him and help him.  Julianna & Phil live in the state of Washington.  She wasn’t able to have children, so they do foster care and they adopted a little boy.


# IRVEN:
Irven dated a real nice girl in Salt Lake while working as a milk man and going to college.  Irven and Sandy, married in the Salt Lake Temple.  They were both 28 when they married.  They wanted to have a large family, so their children are close together –
Andrea, Doug, Jennifer, Christine and Mark.  They all married in the temple, except Andrea, who is a beautiful, sweet and talented young woman, but she didn’t find the right guy – at least not yet and she is 44 now (2018).  Irven & Sandy’s family at Mark & Becky’s Temple wedding.


Irven had a terrible accident when he was working for NFIB.  He was driving and a storm came up, he was hit by a semi and it should have killed him, but he survived.  He has had some operations and has a limp, can’t drive, so had to retire early.  Irven & Sandy lived in Clearfield, Utah for several years, but have moved to Smithfield, by Logan and have a nice home there.  Their children were concerned that none of them lived close to them in Clearfield, and three of them live in the Logan area – Jennifer, Christine, and Mark, so they talked them into moving up there with them.  We visit them occasionally, stay overnight and mainly play games.  Irven and my brother, Bryce, became close friends in Junior High and High School since they live in the same ward, and they have remained good friends as their wives enjoy each other also.  Irven and Sandy have invited us and Bryce & Deanna to come for New Year’s Eve, eat dinner and play games.  Since they moved to Smithfield, we stay overnight and play games and eat on New Year’s Day also.  We all enjoy being together.

**This picture is of ****Irven** & Sandy’s children and their spouses after Mark & Becky’s Logan Temple wedding.  Doug & Karen, Chris & Jennifer, Becky & Mark, Andrea, Christine & ? (I can’t remember his name, I’ll have to find out)


**Brothers: Ken, Roy, ******Irven****, Rich and Bob.  Bob shares the same mother with Roy, Ken & ****Irven****, and Rich shares the same father.  Rich and Bob have both passed away now (2019)
They had a sister, Margaret, who passed away when she was only about 54 years old.

**Sister-in-laws: Mae (married to Ken), Lois (married to Rich), Sandy (married to ******Irven****) and Linda (married to ****Irven****)  Carroll had passed away by this time. (Carroll was married to Floyd Robert “Bob”)
