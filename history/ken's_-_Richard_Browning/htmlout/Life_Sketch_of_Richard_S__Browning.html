<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Before I began I want to give
a special thanks for mom, Elise and Janet for countless hours of tender service
to dad over the past years most especially the past several months. I want to
thank my dad for all he taught me, working with him, and the fun times,
observing his unconditional love. I am proud to be his daughter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Richard Stephen Browning was
born January 6, 1924, in the home of his parents, Charles Henry Browning, and
Viola Rebecca McFate, in Sugar City, Idaho. He had two older sisters; Geneva
and Florence (we called her Flossie) and an older brother, Cleo. Dad’s family
called him Rich.  He always said, “I may not have much money but I will always
be Rich.”  And his wife, Mom, could claim, “I married Rich.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When Dad was six years old,
he had pneumonia and almost died.  The doctor operated on him and took out part
of a rib and drained his lungs. The first time he stood up and started to walk
across the room he fainted. He had to learn to walk again. Because of this
illness, he was a year late starting school. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>As a child Dad always liked
to play with toy bulldozers and trucks, make roads and bridges, and make tree
houses. Maybe that is why he chose the vocation he did.  He never liked school
until high school. Then he quite liked agriculture class, an aeronautics class,
typing and especially the basketball games and dances. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad’s family lived in Sugar
City during the winter, so that the children could attend school.  But in the
summer they lived on a dry farm on Canyon Creek. It consisted of 640 acres, a
three-room log house, root cellar, barn, machine shed and granary. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>After several years of hard
work, drought, hail and poor price for wheat Grandpa lost his farm. It was a
sad day for Dad.  Some of his fondest memories are of that grand old place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad had a dog named Snip that
he trained to pull him on a sleigh in the winter and a wagon in the summer.
They had some good times together. One day Dad and his cousin decided to go
camping.  They put blankets and food in the wagon that Snip pulled.  It started
to get dark.  Thinking it was getting night time they decided to get their bed
roll made and go to bed.  Then it started to rain.  After a while the sun came
out again.  Because they were wet and cold they decided to go home for the
night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad could hardly remember his
mother. In the fall of 1932, when Dad was eight years old, Grandma became ill
suddenly and died. Dad’s oldest sister and brother had both married that summer
so that left Aunt Flossy to take over the home chores. One time she tried to
get Dad to do the dishes.  He didn’t want to, so ran outside and climbed up on
a rope.  The rope broke and Dad fell and broke his arm.  He didn’t have to wash
dishes for some time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In 1934, when Dad was 10,
Grandpa married Margaret Hill Young who had two children, Margaret and Robert
(Uncle Bob), who were both younger than Dad. Three boys were born to this
union, LeRoy, Kenneth and Irven. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Grandpa heard of a big boom
at Sun Valley. Grandpa made arrangements to move his butcher shop into a store
at Ketchum, one mile from Sun Valley. Grandpa and Dad went to Ketchum.  Housing
was scarce due to the sudden influx of people. They had a homemade camper for
the pickup, made of three bows and a custom made heavy treated canvas cover,
much like a covered wagon, which they lived in for several weeks. Marge and the
three younger kids, Margaret, Bobby and Roy came out later. The first house
they lived in was a tent house about 16 feet square, made of rough lumber floor
and walls about 4 feet high with a canvas top. Later they moved into a better
home, a cabin. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad attended the sixth and
seventh grades of school at Ketchum. He did a little skiing and was a caddy on
the golf course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The boom was mostly over in a
couple of years and the family moved out of Ketchum. Dad went back to Sugar
City and stayed with his older brother’s family. Dad was 14 and earned his keep
by working in his brother's store after school, during lunch, and on Saturdays,
and other odd jobs during the summer.  One summer he ran a butcher shop for Van
Price in Driggs, Idaho.  Dad graduated from the Sugar Salem High School. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The day after graduation Dad
and his friend, Mark Hulet, were hitch hiking a ride to Victor where their
parents lived.  Their first ride was from Sugar City to Clementsville.  They
were walking down the road from there when a farmer, Roy Anderson, came along
and offered them a job on his dry farm.  Mr. Anderson said he could tell a good
worker from the way they hitch hiked. The ones who got out and hiked were good
workers but the ones that just stood or sat at the side of the road were lazy. 
Well, Dad took him up on his offer, $90.00 a month, 12 hours a day, 7 days a
week, room and board, and a farm deferment from the draft.  Mr. Anderson and
his sons also had a dairy farm in Lost River Valley where Dad helped milk 80
heads of Holstein cows during the winter. He didn’t like the cow milking, but
he really liked the dry farm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad would tease us by saying
that the dust got so thick you could ride the dust out over the canyon to turn
around.  Because of the dust they had to clean the air filter quite often.  Dad
was cleaning the filter with gasoline.  Mr. Anderson got after him and said,
“don’t use that expensive gasoline.  It cost 15 cents a gallon. Use diesel, it
only costs 10 cents a gallon.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad said, “I couldn’t
convince Uncle Sam that farming was more important than soldiering and was
drafted on 28 June 1944.”  Dad reported to Fort Douglas Army base in Salt Lake
City and after a few days was sent to Arkansas for infantry training.  After
seventeen weeks of infantry training Dad and some of his buddies had a choice
to make.  They could have two weeks delay in route to Japan or they could join
the paratroopers, take an additional four weeks paratrooper jump school at Fort
Benning, Georgia and be home for Christmas on the way to Germany beside getting
$50 a month jump pay, in addition to the $50 regular pay and then another $50 when
they went overseas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The recruiters told the men
that if they joined the paratroopers they wouldn’t have to march and get
blisters on your feet and carry all that gear.  They would be flown to the
job.  Dad said the recruiters where right about not marching, now they had to
run.  Dad graduated with wings and was home on furlough for Christmas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad was sent to France and
was there until the Germans surrendered.  His unit made several practice
jumps.  They were alerted and equipped with ammunition and on the plane two
different times all ready to be dropped on the front lines when the maneuver
was called off because of the successful advancement of the ground troops. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad was on the way to Japan
by way of the U.S. when the Japanese surrendered.  He arrived in New York to a
hero’s welcome.  Then he was sent to Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  Since he had
some experience in running a movie projector, he was given that job at camp. 
He would run the projector 3 or 4 hours a night but the rest of the time he was
free to do about anything.  One of his buddies became assistant to the chaplain
and because of his position had access to a jeep and they spent time riding
around the country.  This was an enjoyable stay but they were anxious to get
home.  They were sent back to Fort Douglas for discharge. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When Dad was discharged from
the Army on April 29, 1946, he came home and went to work in Island Park
cutting down mining timber.  After a week of that he went to work at a rock
quarry near Victor.  It was lime rock which was used to process sugar.  At
first he was using a sledge hammer to break up the rock.  Soon he was able to
drive the truck hauling the rock from the quarry to the railroad where it was
loaded onto railroad cars and taken to the sugar factory.  That was a much
better job.  That fall he went to Sugar City and stayed with his brother, Cleo,
and family.  He spent the winter working in the potato cellar and chasing
girls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In February of 1947, Dad met
Lois Wheeler at a stake dance in Rexburg.  She was attending Ricks College. 
They dated until school was out in June.  The next winter they began dating
again.  In December Dad went to Jackson, Wyoming to work in a butcher shop. 
They continued to write and to see each other on weekends.  Dad gave Mom a
diamond ring on May 16, 1948, and they were married in the Salt Lake Temple on
June 24, 1948.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>On the 11th of June 1949,
they welcomed their first child, a little dark haired, brown eyed baby girl.
They named her Janet. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>On January 23, 1952, Dad took
Mom to the St. Anthony Hospital in Pocatello.  Fifteen minutes later Dr. R.R.
Merrill announced to Dad that they had a red headed blue-eyed baby girl.  This
was Carla.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The rest of the children were
born in the hospital with the star on top.  Phillip Stephen was born March 12,
1953.  He was the first boy. The next child was Elise, born June 28, 1955. 
Then there were two more boys, Deven Kay born September 2, 1956 and Dale
Richard born August 5, 1958. The seventh child came to the family February 22,
1960. We named her Joyce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Family was very important to
Mom and Dad.  They supported their descendants and extended family in special
occasions such as blessing of babies, baptisms, graduation, priesthood
ordinations, weddings, funerals, musical performances, drama productions, and
sporting events.  They loved family reunions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad also kept in touch with
schoolmates by attending class reunions.</span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'>By Carla</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mom and Dad made their first
home in Jackson, Wyoming. The home was a small camp trailer, about 15 feet long
and 8 feet wide. They had it parked in a trailer park where they could hook up
to water and electricity.  There was a public rest room, shower and laundry that
they could use. It was quite comfortable and not much house work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When the weather became cold
the trailer park closed and they were obliged to find another place to park.
One of the customers of the store where Dad was working, an elderly, widow lady
by the name of Mrs. Saunders, offered to let them park by her home, which was
closer to town. She was very good to them and they really enjoyed visiting with
her.  Because of the cold temperature they could not hook up to a water supply,
but carried water from the house. The trailer was heated by an oil heater.  A
barrel of oil was outside the trailer with a small tube attached to bring the
oil to the heater.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The winter of 1948-1949 was
one of the hardest winters that has been recorded in this area. The snow was
very deep that winter and the weather was very cold at times. The trailer had
thin walls and no insulation. Most nights it was so cold that the blankets on
their bed would be frozen to the wall when they awoke. They were thankful to
have enough bedding to keep them warm.  One night the temperature dropped to 60
degrees below zero.  At that temperature the oil could not flow through the
tubing, so the fire went out. When morning came they brought a can full of oil
into the trailer and put it in the tank on the heater and were able to get a
fire going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The months of February and
March were especially difficult for the Jackson area. Because of the
mountainous terrain many snow slides occurred, blocking the roads so that no
vehicles could get through. Nothing came into the area for three weeks until
they were able to get some mail and medical supplies flown in by air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The last of the snow melted
about the first of May and spring came again to the Jackson Hole area. Dad
traded in the trailer for a new one and they moved in on June 4. It had
insulated walls, was about three feet longer, and had a water heater but not a
bathroom.  However, they really were happy to be living in such a nice home.
Shortly thereafter they celebrated their first wedding anniversary. They had
experienced several different circumstances, but had learned that they could
cope with trials in their lives and also appreciate the blessings they had. It
had been a good year!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In September of 1949 Mom and
Dad moved to Idaho Falls, Idaho. The store in Jackson was sold and Dad had to
seek employment elsewhere. He dug sugar beets for the U &amp; I Sugar Company. 
When that job was finished Dad began selling Rena Ware cooking utensils. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In December a welcome job was
offered in Pocatello cutting meat for Okay Food Stores.  Mom and Dad never
thought they would like to live in Pocatello, as it was a big wicked city, but
were very glad to find work, especially that time of year.  They moved their
18-foot trailer home to the Barret Trailer Park on Yellowstone Ave.  Mom and
Dad really enjoyed living in Pocatello and raising their family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the spring of 1951 Dad
bought 5 acres of land on Mink Creek Road for $500.00 from J. V. Frazier.  He
financed it by selling war bonds that he had bought while he was in the
service.  They moved their trailer onto the property April 9, 1951.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When Mom and Dad moved onto
the property it was nothing more than a sagebrush-covered hill and some Juniper
trees. It took two weeks before they could get electricity. It was four months
before they were able to get a well drilled so they could have water. They
brought water from town for culinary purposes, but sometimes they dipped water
out of a ditch that ran through the property and heated it on a bonfire to do
the laundry. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad borrowed Mr. Frazier’s
horse and plow and plowed a little garden spot below the ditch that ran through
the place. He watered the garden out of the ditch with a syphon hose. They had
a very good garden, even cantaloupe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad rented Anderson’s
tractor, plow and scraper and dug the basement and also a place to put the
well. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad tried to get a loan to
build a house but without a credit record nor enough ground for a farm loan
they gave him the run around.  Dad didn’t want to go in debt anyway, so they
lived in the trailer house for two more years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the spring of 1953 Dad
began working on the basement. He sold the trailer house to finance the
project.  They wanted the trailer by the opening of fishing season the latter
part of May.  Dad put up the cinder block walls and got a roof overhead but no
floor.  The concrete was poured in one room but it was not dry enough to walk
on when they came to get the trailer.  They moved into the one room that had a
dirt floor and a trench for a sewer pipe running through it.  They put a little
trash burner in one end to use for heat and to cook with. A few days later they
were able to move into the other room home where it was more comfortable. Later
that summer they were able to put a concrete floor in a third room and that
gave them two rooms and a bath room.  We lived in the basement until May of
1961.  A few years later Dad was able to add a two-car garage onto the house.
It was several years before Dad was able to buy bricks for the outside of the
house. Dad was able to do much of the brick work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The nice thing about not
finishing the house all at one time is that he never had to make any monthly
house payments, nor did he have interest to pay.  How many can say they never
had a mortgage.  But we were very comfortable and happy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad was a hard worker. Dad
cut meat for Okays for about eight years.  In his spare time he plowed gardens
and did landscaping with his tractor.  Later Dad bought some hay equipment and
did custom haying.  One time Dad asked for some time off to do some haying. 
The boss at the store asked him which he would rather do.  He told him cut hay.
Dad decided to quit the store and cut hay.  It was a hard decision to make. 
The steady income was hard to give up. But he didn’t like working Sundays and
preferred working with machinery so decided to make the change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad’s brothers, Roy, Ken and
Irven and Mom’s brothers, Delynn and Byron, helped quite a bit in the summer.
He also hired some other help at different times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Through the years Dad taught
his children to operate the trucks, tractors and hay equipment.  All of the
boys helped Dad as much as they could and even us girls helped some.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad had two hay balers for a
while and did custom haying for people in Inkom, Marsh Valley, north to and on
the Indian Reservation and also in Arbon Valley.  He decided to get out of the
haying business and do landscaping only.  So he sold the hay equipment to the
Pocatello Stake farm.  Dad continued doing landscaping and plowing gardens
until 1972. At that time Dad bought a backhoe and added digging basements to
his vocation.  He seemed to be making more money with the backhoe so he
concentrated more on that kind of work.  In 1975 Rex Browning came to help Dad
and they established a partnership called Browning Excavation. They dug
basements for many homes and put in sewer systems for numerous people.  Grant
Stowell hired them to put in the water system in the Indian Hills Subdivision.
Dad, Rex and Phillip spent most of the summer of 1976 in Rexburg helping with
the clean up after the Teton Dam broke and flooded the area.  Dad worked with
Rex until the latter part of 1992 when he sold his share of the business to Rex
and began preparing to go on a mission for the Church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>After dad got home from his
mission, he was watching Janet machine quilt and thought he could do that.  He
started quilting and ran the quilting machine up until the Charlotte Fire, this
year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>For the last 20 years if Dad
was not quilting he was usually outside taking care of the yard, or chopping
wood for the wood stove.  When he was not busy with that you may of found him
watching Little House on the Prairie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>By Janet</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad was a hard worker.  He
also knew how to have fun.  He liked to play games with family and friends.  He
was good at checkers and liked to play Racko.  But his favorite was a game we
call “Mormon Bridge.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Saturday night was spent
watching Lawrence Welk.  Sunday nights were time for popcorn and apples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When we were young, dad would
come home from work and say let’s go swimming or lets go camping.  How we
enjoyed swimming at Lava Hot Springs or Indian Springs or Green Canyon. I have
memories of camping in Yellowstone Park, Stanley Basin, Green Canyon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Winters were especially fun
for us because we had snow machines.  Dad was normally a quiet, calm, cautious
man.  But when he got on a snow machine, he was quite aggressive.  We spent
many memorable times riding snow machines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In 1976 Mom and Dad bought a
time share condominium in Island Park.  They enjoyed going to Island Park over
the years and always shared the time with friends and family.  They had a Club
House where we could swim, sit in the hot tubs, play racket ball or ping pong. 
They would go snowmobiling when the weather was good enough.  Almost every year
they went through Yellowstone Park.  They usually made it to Old Faithful but
several times made the loop around Thumb, Yellowstone Lake and Canyon.  Our
favorite places to go were Two Top and Big Springs. Other places of interest
were Mesa Falls and Lion Head. On stormy days we would play games or watch
movies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mom and Dad owned several
different Motor homes.  They took vacations all over the United States. They
have been to all of the states except (9) Hawaii, Maine, Vermont, New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, (I’m not sure about
Delaware) and New Mexico. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Rich and Lois were very
generous and never took a vacation without a parent, sibling, child,
grandchild, niece, nephew, or even a friend along. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>One of my vacations with then
was in 1992, when they took me, JaNae and Tassi to Missouri to get the quilting
machine. We stop at Church sites and spent 3 days in Nauvoo. This was a turning
point in JaNae’s life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad gave us a wonderful
heritage and a great legacy. He has 28 grandchildren and 34
great-grandchildren.   We had a very comfortable life.  We have many happy
memories to remember him by.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We would like to thank Access
Home Health and Hospice for the loving kindness in helping us to take care of
dad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mine was an honor and
privilege to be able to help care for dad the last two months. We had some very
tender moments together. I know the veil was very thin. He asked me if I would
like him to take my picture with all those people that were there behind me. I
wish he could have. I know he is with his mother and father sisters and
brother. I know he is forgiven for not knowing his colors and is worthy to be
with Heavenly Father.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>  We love you Dad!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>PS. Note: not given at the
funeral. When I (Janet) was a little girl I did not know dad did not know his
colors. Dad would point to my color crayons and ask what color is that and then
to another and another. I just thought he was checking to see if I knew my
colors. About the time I started to drive is when I became aware he was color
blind. He knew the stop light by where the red or green light was. He couldn’t see
the colors of the flowers so didn’t like them very much. He thought the drapes
and the wall was the same color.  One day this in the last few weeks dad had a
hold of my hand and was praying to Heavenly Father that he would be forgiven
because he didn’t know his colors and would be found worthy. </span></p>
