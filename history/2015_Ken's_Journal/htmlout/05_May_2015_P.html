got up early and prepared a nice breakfast of egg omelet.  We then packed the
car and said our good bye and left for home.  We took the 101 belt loop to get
to the north side of Phoenix.  We did stop at a Wal-Mart where we bought a
Birthday card for Jase and mailed it off to him.  We stopped in Flagstaff at a
Denies where we ate lunch.  I let Mae drive from there while I took a nap.  We
stopped at Page where we stretched and bought a frozen yogurt.  When we got to
Kanab I had Mae go into a Subway and get us a sandwich while I went to the gas
station and filled the car with gas.  We went to Judies where we visited and
shared our dinner with her.  Judy sure isn’t feeling very well.  I wish there
was something that we could do for her.</p>

got up and had a dish of cold cereal for breakfast as we didn’t want to wake
Judy as she hadn’t slept very well.  She got up and thanked us for stopping and
apologized that she hadn’t been a better host but thanked us for stopping in to
be with her.  We left there and I drove until we got almost to the turn off to
Bryce cannon.  I had Mae drive from there and gave her instruction as where to
turn off Hwy 89 to cross over to the interstate.  When I woke I didn’t
recognize where we were but we soon came to Circle Ville.  Mae had seen the
signs when she went through Panquitch that turned towards Salt Lake and had
just followed that.  It took us an extra 45 minutes to an hour longer going
that way, but it worked out ok.  We got home about 2:30pm, unpacked and went to
Lael and Neil Wall’s where we had a Porter Cousins party.  It was a good
event.  When we got home Mae worked on her lesson for R.S. in the morning.  I
showered and filled in my journal before we went to bed.</p>

enjoyed a relaxing morning.  Mae taught the lesson for Relief Society today and
I am sure it went pretty well, it should have with all the time she spent
preparing it.  This afternoon I attended the weekly missionary meeting plus the

Mae had thing ready to leave when I got home and we drove out to Tooele where
we spent the evening visiting and playing games.  We stayed overnight.</p>

got up early and went to work.  We took a more leisure morning and we had
breakfast.  While Mae got things cleaned up and packed, I repaired a plumbing
leak in Sandi’s basement.  We stopped at a couple of stores on the way home. 
After getting home Mae and I worked on the lawns getting them mowed and weeded
along with trimming some dead branches out of our trees.  I next started
working on the light above the kitchen sink but my back started hurting so bad
that I called Dr. Toone to see if I could get in for a treatment.  He said that
I could if I came right down.  We made it in time and he gave me a back
adjustment and it sure felt better afterwards.  We stopped and got some chicken
from Madox’s in Layton and after eating we went to visit with Bob for a little
while.  We got home before 8pm, so we set down to watch a show on TV.  The TV
was out of adjustment and we couldn’t get it to work.  I called Grant and he
helped me but then our phones cut out and I lost contact with him.  Before we
could get reconnected I played around and suddenly the TV started working.  I
am not quite sure as to what I did to correct the problem.  We turned on one
show but after a few minutes shut it off due to the language.  We watched a
older show and enjoyed it.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep the best last night but I slept well.  Mae was concerned about
getting the water on the lawns and flowers so I started work on that.  I
couldn’t get any water through the secondary water lines and spent all morning
searching on that.  I finally contacted Jimmy and he thinks it may be because
some of the water has been turned off due to a water leak in the lower part of
the courts.  I did get another coat of mud put on our bathroom.  Mae and I went
down to Home Depot where we looked at floor tile and other materials.  They
didn’t have the electrical box I need to repair the light over the kitchen
sink.  I will have to go to an electrical supply store tomorrow.  It is now
after 10 PM so I had better close and get to bed.</p>

got up at 6AM but let Mae sleep a little longer.  She had been up 4 or 5 times
during the night.  Time sure went fast today.  I first took down the one
ceiling fan.  I later went to town to return the ceiling fan, plus I needed a
new ceiling light outlet box to replace the one that was holding the light over
the kitchen sink.  It had come down with the pounding on the roof when it was
re-shingled.  I also bought a small spatula to use for a trial to finish the inset
shelfs in the bathroom.  I then spent some time at Home Depot getting floor
tile, shelving material and checking the price for cabinet doors to put above
the freezer.  I think I had better build them myself.  This evening we went to
the Jones for our Study Group.  It was very interesting as we talked about the
birth of Christ.  After coming home I entered this entry.  </p>

was tired and discouraged and so we went to bed and I did not write this entry
yesterday.  I had worked all day on the house but felt like I had accomplished
very little.  Mae went to a baseball game that Connor participated in but I
stayed home, working on the house.  I guess I did get the hallway light put
back together and I spent some time getting the light above the kitchen sink
put back up.  I also spent some time getting materials at Home Depot.  At 6PM I
quite and got me something to eat while I watched a show on Netflix.  Mae came
home about the time my show ended and we watched the last part of a baseball
game with BYU vs St. Marys.  BYU lost very badly, 5 to 14 runs.</p>

prepared breakfast.  After breakfast, I started worked on the house.  Mae
helped me and did some chasing for me.  I quit for lunch at 1:40pm as I had an
appointment to meet with Bishop Mullin concerning a report I am suppose to turn
in quarterly to the Stake.   We went to Mike and Becky’s for dinner and to
attend Jessie’s school choir concert.  Shortly after we got to Salt Lake the
traffic just came to a stop and go situation and did not let up until we got to
Thanksgiving point.  We did have a nice evening and it was quite late getting

to Jeff and Gail’s for dinner at 4:30PM.  I helped Jeff prepare dinner.  They
had also invited Marcy for dinner.  We were going to play some games after
dinner but Gail’s brother came by to wish Marcy a Happy Mother’s Day and

afternoon we went over to Ron and Diann Garf’s where I figured materials that
we will need to start finishing their basement.  Mae went on over to see Bob
and to give him a haircut.  We then went up to Georgia and Rick’s where we had
dinner.  Kim, Jeanenne, Bryce and Deanna were also there.  We had a wonderful
dinner and a great evening visiting about our missionary experiences.  We are
looking forward to when Terry and Angela will be moving down.  We will be glad
to be able to have then with us more but I felt that it was good that they
weren’t with us tonight as they are the only ones that haven’t been able to
serve a mission yet.  Their mission seems to be taking care of Jaben as that is
a full time job for both of them.  It was late when we got home.</p>

Sister Gifford’s to help Lee figure out an electrical problem.  They have two
breakers that are blown.  Lee was trying to install a new fan control switch
but lost all power.  The breakers were tripped but they were also burned up.  I
don’t know what would cause that.  I had to go into Ogden and take a complete
drivers test in order to keep my driver’s license.  It took about 1 &amp; ½
hours to complete the total testing but I passed it ok.  After getting home we
had some lunch and I took a nap.  Mae went out with the Relief Society
Presidency to celebrate Sister Andrus’s birthday.  While I was gone Lee went
into Ogden and bought two new breakers.  I went back to Gifford’s and installed
the new breakers and corrected the wiring problem so that the fan and light
works now.  They offered me $40 for my time but I said $20 would be enough. 
After returning home I did more prefer tapping of the sheetrock.  At 6:30PM Mae
and I went Home Teaching / Visiting Teaching to Sister Leah Nelson, Brother
Siglin, Brother and Sister Hilton.  When we got home I realized that I had lost
my glasses.  We called the Hilton’s but they couldn’t find them there.  Mae
then called Brother Siglin and he had found my glasses on the couch where I had
been setting.  I was sure glad to find them.  I then spent the next hour
catching my journal up to date.  It is now lat and we are going to bed.</p>

worked on the house all day today.  Scott called this morning and said that
Mishelle was in bed with a migraine headache.  Mae went over and got the twins
and brought them here for the morning.  She then took them back at noon so they
could get ready and then she took them to school.  After taking the twins to
school Mae went to J &amp; J Nursery where she bought some plants.  She also
asked them about our trees that don’t look the healthiest and he said it looks
like a fungus that seems to be affecting this type of tree this year.  He said
that there is a spray but it is rather expensive but he thinks they will
recover without using it.  It was almost 3:30PM when Mae got back home.  I was
quite hungry by the time she got home.  Shellie called and she is on her way to
see a doctor.  She called David and he suggested that she see a Dr. because as
he looked at the picture she sent to him, David thinks she has Shingles.  I
worked until 5:30 when I quit and took a shower and we went to our Study
Group.  After the Study Group Mae and I went over to Sister Shirley Lemon and
visited with her.  On the way home we stopped and visited with the new
neighbors across the street from us, I believe they are the Johnson’s.  We then
came home and I put my tools away while Mae got us some super.  Mae called
Shellie and she does have the Shingles, so that doesn’t sound very good.  We
are having trouble with our computer and we are afraid that it may be going
out.  We really don’t need that nor can we afford to get it fixed or replaced
at this time.  I played a couple of games on the computer while Mae was on the
phone.  It is now 10:35 so we will go to bed.</p>

assignment while Mae was gone but didn’t get much done.  We got a call from
Shellie telling us that she does not have “Shingles” but has “Sinplex Virus”
and one of the main problems is cold sores.  We hope that is better news.  Mae
and I watched a western show on Netflix staring Glen Ford called “Santee” that

am sure disappointed at the craftsmanship that is done in the construction of
these homes.  I guess that you get what you pay for.  Time went fast and we had
to leave to go to Grantsville where Nathan is in a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade
circus.  It was a fun evening.  We stopped at a Mexican Restaurant in
Grantsville and got 3 takeout orders.  We then went to Chelci’s where Sandi was
tending the twins and shared with her.  Mae drove most of the way home while I
took a nap.  We stopped and picked up a prescription for Lynn Ray at the
Wall-Green pharmacy and took it to them.  I am tired so I am ready to go to
bed.  We got word from Mike that Sierra gave birth to a healthy baby boy at
11:45AM, he weighed 7 ½ lb and is 18 ½ inches in length, they will name him
David Henry Browning.  David also called us this evening at 10PM to be sure

understand Sister Evelyn Andrus, our Relief Society President.  I am finding it
to be extremely difficult to be in meeting where there is discussion and keep
focused on what is going on and then to add to that to include making notes. 
By the time we finished Ward Correlation meeting my head felt like I was in a
whirl wind and especially my right ear just hurt.  I did enjoy Sacrament
meeting.  Mae sang in the choir and they did an excellent job.  The speakers
were Brother and Sister Jorgensen and they both gave very good talks.  This
afternoon I attended my Stake Missionary meeting and again I felt confusion
from the discussion.  I did some reading this afternoon but fell asleep for a
while.  After having a light dinner Mae and I read the talk given by Elder
Craig Christensen “I know these things of myself”.  I could not help feeling
gratefulness for my testimony I received as a youth of the Truthfulness of the
Book of Mormon.  JaNae called and talked to Mae for a while.  I am glad that
she still wants to talk to Grandma, but we sure worry about them.  Before going

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up shortly after 7AM and after eating breakfast I started working on the
house.  Mae helped me paint and we got the bathroom and the closet painted. 
This evening we had Irven and Sandy over and a little later Mark and Becky
(Mark’s girl friend) came.  We had a good time visiting and playing table
games.  It was late when they left and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was shortly after 7AM when we got up.  After breakfast I started working on the
house.  Mae went to Mat’s pre-school graduation at 11AM.  I got my tools and
equipment ready, then I finished laying the hardy board down.  I spent quite a
while cutting tiles for insert shelves in our bathroom.  I didn’t complete the
preparation to lay tile until late and so made the determination that I would
hold off until tomorrow.  I returned some extra materials to Home Depot and
then bought a new door bell for our home and for Jackie across the street.  I
installed the door bell for Jackie.  Her old one only worked part time.  She
was sure appreciative of me doing it for her.  She asked how much I charged for
doing it and I said for special people like her I didn’t charge.  Mae had some
Relief Society visiting she did this evening.  I held a Ward Missionary meeting
this evening.  Brother Johnson came but Brother Hess had forgot to tell his
wife and so when they didn’t come I called and they came over.  Brother Hess is
just starting to recover from a shoulder operation.  I think the meeting went
well and we will plan on meeting weekly.  I filled out my journal and we went
to bed before 11PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up and while Mae got breakfast I got things set up for cutting tile and
mixing the quick set.  After breakfast Mae helped me and we started laying tile
by 8:30am.  Mae cut tile for me although I cut the more difficult pieces.  We
quite for lunch at 12:30 and took a short nap.  At 6PM Mae went over to the
Cospers, for our weekly study group, but I continued laying tile.  At 8:30pm I
finished cleaning up.  It has been a long day but it is so good to have it
laid.  We ate dinner in watching a show on Netflix “More Than Chance”, it was a
true story about a child that was abused by her adopted father and became a
paraplegic.   The saddest thing was the statics given at the end of the show,
was that in 2007 over 600,000 children in the United States were abused, with
an average of 5 children dying daily.  Following that show there was another
show on the BYU channel that just started so watched that before going to bed
at mid-night.</p>

woke at 7am and Mae a little after that, but we went back to bed.  We could
hear something electronic alerting us.  We finally found it with was a smoke
alarm with low batteries.  Bishop came at 9am so I had to hurry to get the
door.  Mae made us a great breakfast of hash brown potatoes patties, toast and
eggs.  After breakfast I caught up my journal.  Mae attended a funeral -
viewing for Coleen Mecum, an inactive sister in our Ward.  I got the shelving cut
and installed in the new closet in the 2<sup>nd</sup> bedroom while Mae was
gone.  After the viewing Mae went grocery shopping and then came home and made
dinner for David and Sierra.  We took the dinner with us and went to their home
in Logan.  Little Henry is sure cute and tiny.  After dinner Mae tended the
baby while David and Sierra took time to shower and get some rest.  I fell
asleep in the couch.  It was almost 9pm when we left for home.  it has been a
very nice evening.</p>

woke about 7am and we soon got started.  After breakfast I cut and installed
the shelving in both closets.  It was about noon when I started grouting the
tile floors.  Mae went over to Jeff and Gail’s and got their children.  She
took them to McDonalds as the weather looked too much like rain to take them to
Dinosaur Park.  I needed Mae’s help so they cut the time short and came home. 
I had Mae got to Home Depot for a couple of items.  It was about 7pm when I
finished the floors.  We had some dinner and then watched “Tarzan” with the
children before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
put the bathroom back together most of the morning until we left for Morgan. 
We stopped at Kim and Jeanenne’s where I looked at several items that Kim wants
me to repair for them.  The children got anxious to go so Mae finally took them
and the car up to the cemetery.  I later came up with Kim and Jeanenne in their
car.  We just got the flowers placed on the graves when it started to rain.  We
went to the Morgan City Park and ate under the bowery.  We were the only ones
there so we got our chose.   We did take some pictures there before eating. 
The rain let up so the children did get to play for a little while.  I had to
go back to Kim’s place to finish looking at their repair list.  We took the
children to Gail’s mothers where they will stay until Jeff and Gail gets home. 
we stopped at a grocery store for a few items and then came on home.  we were
both worn out but cleaned and straightened the house for tomorrow.  </p>

woke just before 7AM but let Mae sleep for a little longer as she didn’t sleep
very well last night.  Mae and I worked around the house and the yard getting
things cleaned up and put away.  This evening we drove to Clearfield and got
Bob.  We then went out to eat at Sizzler’s.  After taking Bob back we came home
and watched a show on Netflix titled “The Last Super”.  We then went to bed
quite tired.</p>

didn’t sleep well last night and was up in the front room when I got up.  I got
my clothes out of our room and had Mae go back to bed.  I got myself off to
work.  I went over to Graf’s by 8AM and worked on their basement moving water
lines from being mounted to the surface of the floor joists to being drilled
through the floor joists.  I worked to be through by 3PM but we needed a couple
of fittings.  Diane went down to Lowe’s to get the parts but even though I
wrote down the part and drew a picture of it they sent back the wrong part.  I
still made it home by 4:05PM and I had a Ward Missionary meeting at 4PM. 
Brother Lane Johnson was there just a little early but the rest got there a
little late.  The meeting went well.  Mae took R.S. High Lites around to some
of the Sisters in our Ward while I held my meeting.  Roy called to visit but I
had to cut it short as we have a special meeting to attend this evening.  We
then had dinner and I took a short nap.  We attended a special Ward Counsel
training meeting at the Stake Center and it was conducted by President Hall.  A
video presentation prepared by the Quorum of the Twelve was presented and
discussed on having a more Spiritual Sacrament meeting.  It was very well done
and it recommends that the Ward Counsel work together in achieving these
goals.  I filled out this entry before going to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night so I tried to get myself off but Mae woke
anyway.  I worked from 8AM to 4 PM at Garf’s.  Diane had prepared a nice lunch
of hot pork roast, sweet potatoes and cooked carrots.   It was very good.  She
was chasing most of the day.  After lunch I went to take the tools back to
Durk’s but my pickup wouldn’t start.  I don’t know what we did but suddenly it
started and it seems to be working ok now.  Ron and I did get quite a bit done today. 
I got gas in the truck on the way home.  Mae wasn’t home when I got home, she
had gone with Georgia to get the flowers off the graves in Morgan.  I showered
and got ready to go to our Study Group.  I then laid down for a short nap. 
There was only the Cosper’s and Mae and I tonight.  We had an enjoyable evening
discussing Chapter 9 in Jesus the Christ tonight.  After getting back home Mae
and I had some dinner while we watched a movie on Netflix.  I entered this
journal entry and we went to bed.</p>

got up at 5:45am and had breakfast.  Mae slept well last night and so she felt
well today.  Ron called at 7am and said that he wasn’t feeling so we decided to
hold for today.  That will give me time to work on Jeanenne and Kim’s home.  I
called and talked to Jeanenne about the sink and Kim wants me to try sealing
the present sink.  Mae went looking for a place in Hooper to shred church
papers but found out it is tomorrow that they will do it.  I got my boat up to
the house to get it ready to go fishing tomorrow.  While I was working on it a
neighbor stopped by to meet me.  It was good but he just kept talking and was
here for over 2 hours.  Mae finally came out to rescue me by asking if there
was any thing she could do to help me as I was running out of time.  He took
the hint and finally left.  I was grateful for Mae.</p>

got up shortly after 5am and got something to eat.  Mae had most everything
ready for me.  I picked Randy up at 7am an as we got about 3 blocks from. 700 S
and Main st. the traffic came to a stop.  It took us over ½ hour to get to Main
street.  I made a illegible left turn and went north on Main to 650 S and got
on the freeway going north until we got off at Riverdale and then took the
freeway up Weber cannon.  We lost about an hour but got on the lake about
9:30am.  Fishing was slow for a while but then we started catching fish and was
off the lake by 2pm.  When I got home David, our grandson, was there working on
our computers.  He was able to save my journals for me, so I am very grateful
for that.  I fillet a fish and Mae cooked it up for dinner.  We shared with
David and he sure enjoyed the fish.  Sierra doesn't like fish so when I offered
him a fish to take home he declined.  This evening Mae and I went to David and
Pat Presnell's for the evening. That had lots of finger food for us to enjoy
while we played table games.  It was late when we got home and I was very
tired.  </p>

gust tried to sleep in the recliner.  I got water brought in for the distiller
and hooked the distiller to the tap that goes into the house.  I next painted
the crown molding in our bathroom.  It took three coats to cover the white.  I
had a man come to see me from a insulation co.  I asked him about the rebate
and he told me that I would need to contact Questar using Thermwise.  They will
provide the forms necessary for a rebate.  This afternoon I checked out part of
the sprinkler system on the yard.  We had to go to the Layton City Library to
watch Emily perform I a violin recital.   </p>

did read my scriptures this morning , finishing Ether.  I got on the new
computer and worked with it, printing off what I have for 2015.  I am so
thankful that David (our Grandson) was able to restore these files from our Lap
Top.  I was sure we had lost them when the Lap Top crashed.  This new computer
that we now have is sure a different system and I am having trouble figuring it
out.  We attended our block meetings.  Bishop reminded everyone that we need to
be more reverent in the Chapel.  Once the meeting starts there probably isn't a
Ward in the church that is more reverent than ours but we do like to greet everyone
as we first assemble.  As today is the forth Sunday we have joint R.S. and
Priesthood meeting under the direction of the Bishop.  Bishop Mullins had asked
Mae to take the first 15 minutes of the meeting and discus the special training
that the Ward Counsel received from the Stake President last Tuesday in a
special meeting. Mae gave a very good job with her assignment.  Our Bishop then
took the rest of the meeting time and he also did an excellent job.  </p>
