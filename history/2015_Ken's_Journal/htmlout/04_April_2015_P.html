<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked all day on the house.  Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley came over so that
Mishelle could help Mae with the flower areas.  She and Mae worked all
afternoon on the yards.  I removed the main water lines to the house and
replaced them so that I could have both the old system and the new system
hooked up at the same time.  The one main fitting was so corroded that I could
not break the seal.  I finally had Kylan come out and help me.  I had Kylan use
my 30” pipe wrench and I used both my 16” and 14” pipe wrenches and with both
of us pulling the joint finally gave way.  I quite at 5:30pm, showered and
cleaned up and attended our Family Home Evening study group.  Mae stayed home
with our Great Grand children.  When I got home we watched the show “Mc
Clintock” starring John Wayne.  Although we have seen it many times I still
enjoy the show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
breakfast I again went to work changing the connections from the old water
lines to the new water lines.  JaNae came and got the children shortly after
noon.  They have sure been good children and a pleasure having them.  Mae spent
most of the time with them.  I got everything switched except the last
connection to the bath tub and that one gave me grief.  I could not get it to
seal and had to take it apart twice finally getting some new fittings and
installing it the third time.  That time it worked.  I was sure relieved when
it sealed and I could quite.  Everything is set up and working except I have to
add salt to the water softener and setting the clock on it.  Having that job
done sure seem good!  Mae attended choir practice this evening.  I quite about
7pm and ate some dinner and watched a BYU base ball game.  I then took a shower
and entered this entry.  Mae got things restored under the sink cabinets.  She
is pleased with getting things put away.  It is almost 10:30 pm and we are
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
enjoyed sleeping in, any way I did but Mae hadn’t slept very well.  I made egg
omelets for breakfast.  Irven called just as we set down to eat.  Sandy had
fallen as she got to the bottom of the basement stairs and hurt her food quit
badly.  They are not sure if she broke it or not but for now they wanted to
borrow our crouches.  Mae took them over to them and stopped and got a couple
of items they need from the Health Store.  She also stopped at a couple of
stores for some other items she wanted.  While she was gone I got the water
softener and the water distiller going.  Bishop Mullins and Brother Jorgensen came
over and set me apart as the Ward Mission Leader.  Bishop Mullins gave me a
special blessing included with the setting apart.  Mae didn’t get home until
almost 1PM.  She and I went shopping for some ceiling fans and bought the ones
that she had seen at The Lighting Store.  We then stopped at Costco and the
health food store before coming home.  Mae took a nap as she isn’t feeling the
best.  This evening Scott and Michelle took us out to dinner at Golden Corral
as a Birthday gift.  We had a very enjoyable time.  After returning home we
watched the movie (God is not Dead) and I would recommend it to anyone, in fact
Mae E-mailed that recommendation to all our children, our siblings and many to
friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
didn’t get up until almost 8AM and I didn’t get much done before it was time to
watch General Conference.  Each of the conference session we great and I have
much to reread when we get the New Ensign.  Between conference sessions the
time went quickly and I really didn’t get much accomplished.  Sandi called
quite upset over some of the things between her and JaNae.  Just as I started
watching the Priesthood session of Conference, JaNae called Mae and talked to
her for 2 ½ hours.  I hope that it helped but you really don’t know who to
believe.  I spent the rest of the evening trying to decide the best way to
insulate the base of this mobile home.  It’s getting late and we still need to
take showers so I will end this entry.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept ok last night getting up in time so that we had breakfast and were
able to be in the living room when the Mormon Tabernacle Choir started.  We
really enjoyed the morning session of Conference.  Following the session I
started to write a letter to my family but then we got a E-mail from Jeff that
really shot us down.  The other evening we watched the movie “God Is Not Dead”
and having enjoyed it so much, we E-mailed our family and some friends to let
them know how much we enjoyed it.  Jeff’s return E-mail really told us to keep
out of his life and his children’s lives with anything that has to do with
religion.  That has sure put a damper on our day.  Following the afternoon
session we did some visiting here in the park.  Between family problems, being
out of money and no time to get what I need to get done, I feel quite
depressed.  Mae cooked us a nice dinner and then we went Home Teaching /
Visiting Teaching to the Hilton’s.  We had a nice visit with them.  She is
doing some better but he is having problems with memory loss.  We went by the
Siglin’s and though the TV was on there wasn’t any other signs that any one was
home.  After returning home we received a couple of calls and made a couple of
calls pertaining to our calling and assignments in the Ward.  We then spent 1 ½
hours reading the 4<sup>th</sup> Chapter of “Jesus the Christ”.  We have to use
the dictionary often to understand the meaning of words used in Brother
Talmage’s writing but we did get greater understanding of the Jews feelings
when Jesus announced that he was God of the Old Testament.  It is now
approaching 10pm so we will go right to bed as I want to get up about 6am.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early and tried to go back to sleep in the recliner but didn’t sleep very
well.  I started removing the old A/C shaft so that I might figure out how to
install the two ceiling fans.  Mae and I went visiting to two of the Sisters
that we are assigned to watch over.  We also visited with the Pattersons.  We
then grabbed some lunch and went into the Ogden Temple to help clean it.  However,
due to General Conference the Temple wasn’t open on Saturday so it didn’t need
cleaning.  We therefore were asked to clean the Tabernacle instead of the
Temple.  Mae and I did a little shopping being that we were already downtown. 
We bought some fans for the front room and then looked for a light that we
could put in the hallway to cover the old swamp cooler hole.  We found one at
Home Depot but when we got it home we realized it wouldn’t fit right.  We went
over to Scott and Michelle’s and got Mattie and Jessie.  Mike and Becky asked
if would tend them for two or three days while they took some time by their
self’s.  The girls had stayed at Scott’s as we were at the Temple.  Mae had got
the 2<sup>nd</sup> bedroom cleaned up so they would have a place to sleep.  We
were tired when we got home and I soon went to bed.  Mae stayed up longer
visiting with the girls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
felt the pressure of the work still needing to get done on this house.  Mae was
patient and gentle with me.  After breakfast Mae went to Mountain Heating and
Air Conditioning.  They gave her some pieces of scrap sheet metal that I needed
to put temporary covers over the holes I need to put in the roof in order to
pull electric lines to install the fans in the living room.  She then went to Central
Lighting where she found a light fixture that will work to cover the swamp
cooler hole.  She made a very good selection on that, plus it was a close out
so she got it at a good price.  She next went to White House Electric where she
got some other electrical items that we need.  While she was doing those errons
for me, I plumed in an outside water faucet.  I returned the extra plumbing
supplies to Durk’s Plumbing and paid that bill in full.  I next got electric lines
pulled for the two front room fans.  Jessie helped me pull those wires.  When
Ashley got out of school Mae went over and got her so the girls could have some
time together.  This evening Mae and I went H.T. / V.T. to Lynn and Marianne
Ray.  When we got back home Mae took Ashley back home.  I got back on the roof
and covered the opening in the roof with sheet metal.  I then cleaned up most
of my mess and vacuumed the mess up.  Ben VonderHoek stopped by this afternoon
and said that they could roof our home either Thursday /Friday or
Friday/Saturday.  We gave him 50% down to get the materials.  I am sure tired
this evening.  I entered this entry then showered and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
is raining this morning and so I am unable to run the last wire that requires
me to cut open the roof.  I am hoping that it might let up a little later.  Without
being able to work on the house I got an appointment with Dr. Owens and had him
fill out the letter from Utah Drivers License Department.  I did do a little on
preparing the electrical but then I put a second coat of mud on the sheetrock
in the bathroom.  The girls went over to spend the evening with Ashley.  We
went over to Scott’s and got Mattie and Jessie this evening about 9PM.  It’s
getting late so we will go to bed before long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 6:30 and got ready to start work on the house.  I got started on
covering the holes that I had cut yesterday plus I had one more line to run.  I
worked all day but got all the lines ran and the holes patched so that the
roofers can now get started reroofing tomorrow.  Mae spent most of the day with
the girls until Mike and Becky came to get them about 2PM.  Sister Ray called
Mae and asked if she could take her to the Hospital to have stitches removed. 
Mae quickly got ready so she could go to the Temple as soon as she returned.  I
finished up and took a shower before Mae got home.  The Garf’s came when I was
in the shower so with Mae being gone they came and the car wasn’t here so they
just went to the Temple.  We got together with them at the Temple.  We had a
good group go to the Temple and accomplished quite a lot.  When we got home I
put my tools away.  Mae and I ate some dinner and then took showers before
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in and got going when Ben VanderHoek came to the house to let me know
that they will re-roof our house today.  I got out and moved trash and my
trailer so that we could get Ben’s trailer backed in so the removed shingles
could be loaded.  I mainly worked on electrical in the house today.  We took my
pickup over to Dee’s Service and got it inspected and serviced as well as
renewed the registration.  Ben’s crew was able to get the roof finished today. 
Mae and I went out to eat this evening.  After returning home we watched the
BYU women’s baseball game on TV.  It was a good game with BYU winning Pacific
16 to 9.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was good to not be under the pressure of the house although I spent all day
putting the fans in the front room.  I didn’t study the wiring instructions
when wiring the first fan and I did it wrong.  I may have caused some damage to
that fan.  Mae tended Scott and Mishelle’s children this evening.  We noticed
that the kitchen light over the sink has broken loose from the ceiling.  When I
examined it, it had been poorly wired and mounted when installed.  I finally
gave up on repairing it now but will wait until we return from Arizona.  I quit
and watched a show on Netflix titled “The Man That Wasn’t”.  It was a true
story about a plot of the British to miss leads the German Military in a major
battle.  I quite enjoyed the movie.  It was late by the time we got to bed.</p>

woke about 6AM and studied for about an hour.  We didn’t have breakfast as it
is Fast Sunday today due to having General Conference last weekend.  I attended
Priesthood Executive meeting at 9:30AM but miss read my schedule as it started
at 10AM.  From there it was back to bet Mae for the regular block program. 
After meetings I volunteered to help take the Sacrament into shut inns so
Brother Bell and I went together and took the Sacrament to two families.  After
getting home we had some dinner and I attended a Ward Missionary meeting with
the full time Elders.  Brother Johnson and I met after that for ½ hour and
discussed some possible plans for doing the work in our Ward.  Brother and
Sister Hess were unable to join us due to some emergencies that came up.  When
I got home Mae got me to take a 15 minute nap and then we went over to Georgia
and Rick’s to welcome them home from their mission.  It was a very interesting
and enjoyable evening with them.  After getting back home we had some fruit and
toast. I filled out my journal before we went to bed.  Mae has most things
gathered up for our trip to Arizona tomorrow.  I got thinking of our children
and it sure is a heartache.  I don’t know and hope they never find out how much
it hurts to see our children inactive.  I am sure that Shellie is going through
those feelings with her two sons.</p>

slept in until almost 7AM and then had to hurry to get things packed into the
car.  I went down to the storage lot to get some of my fishing equipment.  It
was 10AM before we got away and I was upset that we were so late leaving and
that upset Mae.  I should ignore this but for some reason I still have trouble
leaving later in the day.  As a youth we always left early and I don’t seem to
get that out of my system.  We did make good time and was to Kanab by 5PM.  We enjoyed
visiting with Judy.  For clarification Judy Gibhine was the wife of my best
friend in High School, Hendrick Brandinburg.  Hendrick was killed in an
automobile accident in 1963.  The accident occurred on 1900 W and 4800 N in Roy
Utah.  I especially remember that period as we live just north of that area
now.   The three of us went out to eat, but it was quite late toe at that big
of meal.  I paid for it almost all night.  It really has been an enjoy evening
visiting with Judy.  She has sure had her share of hard times but still stands
faithful to the Lord.</p>

alarm went off about mid-night and I didn’t sleep much after that.  I woke at
7AM and got up, spending my time reading from the Book of Mormon.  I love that
book but always stand in amaze at how quickly people can go from righteousness
to wickedness so quickly.  We did get up and had breakfast so that we got away
about 9:45AM.  Judy seems to enjoy having us there, and it was a little hard to
get away.  She has sure had a hard life and yet has so much faith.  We traveled
very comfortable with our car.  I sure enjoy the cruise control.  We stopped
for a few minutes in Page and got I frozen yogurt.  We arrived at Shellie and
Roy’s at 4PM but had forgot about daylight saving time so was there an hour to
early.  We found a car wash and got our car cleaned up.  Shellie and Roy sure
have a nice home and they have really done a lot of remodeling and upgrading to
it.  We relaxed and enjoyed the warm Arizona weather.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke feeling quite depressed wondering if what we are accomplishing in life is
really why we are here.  Something just doesn’t seem right to me.  My hearing
is sure bothering me.  Whether it is the altitude change that is causing this,
I do not know.  This afternoon when Jase had finished his school work Mae, Jase
and I went out fishing in the paddle boat.  We didn’t have very long to fish as
Jase had to go over to Tempe for Jase to be tested on his school work.  While
waiting for Jase to take his testing Shellie, Mae and I went outside and just
visited.  Shellie has sure had a bad marriage.  Roy has provided her with nice
homes but he is a sexually unbalanced and Shellie feels that she has just been
a hoer for him.  He certainly doesn’t treat her with love and consideration.  I
can only feel that somewhere I have totally failed.  The only one of my family
that has turned out with what I thought should be is possibly Mike.  When we
left on our mission, we had all our family in the Temple but that has sure
changed now.  I sure don’t have many answers anymore.  After Jase finished we
went to Wal-Mart where we bought some fishing gear for Jase and some
groceries.  We next went to Cost-Co where Mae and Shellie went shopping while I
took Jase to get something to eat.  He was really hungry and wanted three
pieces of pizza.  Well they were big pieces and he only ate two and was full. 
I did get a hotdog.  This evening I helped Jase put new line on his real so
that the real would work better.  Shellie prepared a great dinner that we ate
out on the patio.  After dinner we watched a show on World War 1 which sure
showed the evils of was.  </p>

slept in for a while although I had got up and read from the scriptures.  It is
sure pretty weather right now but I am afraid that things are going to change. 
We woke with the sounds of a backhoe.  When Roy and Shellie went out to
investigate they found that the maintenance crews are removing the grass
areas.  Shellie is quite upset about it.  She said that since they have moved
here they have raised the monthly association cost from $75 a month to now $200
a month.  The main expense is water.  I am afraid that we are going to see much
greater problems than just water in the next few years!  One thing that is
certainly noticeable is the growth that has taken place since the first time we
came to this area.  I will bet that it has increased several hundred times. 
There is now freeways everywhere and the cities have just multiplied in size
until the only thing that separates them is a street sign with the city’s name
on it.  You no longer see any farms lands, they are all gone.  After a late
breakfast Mae, Jase and I went out on the boat fishing.  Jase had a strike but
I only caught a couple of snags.  We did have a good time going around the
lake.  This afternoon Mae, Shellie and I played some games.  This evening we
watched a DVD “Gladiators”.  It was a fair show but I had a hard time hearing
it.</p>

got up and showered planning on going to the Temple this morning.  However
plans changed and we will go another day next week.  I had forgotten to bring
my Temple shirt so I will have to purchase a new one.  Mae and Shellie talked
me out of going to the Temple this morning, so we will wait until next week. 
Shellie, Mae and I played some games this afternoon.  Mae and I went shopping
at Kohls where we found me a long sleeved shirt for the temple.  It was on a
pretty good sale.  Roy had just returned home from going bike riding with a
friend, when we returned from shopping.  This evening we went boating on the
lake.  Roy and Shellie used kayaks while Jase, Mae and I used the paddle boat. 
Roy and Shellie got talking to one of the couples that live on the west leg of
the lake but we got tired and came home.  They were another 45 minutes before
they got back.  We soon had dinner after they came home.  Shellie and Roy put
on the movie “Anne” but this was a new release.  I didn’t like it at all in
fact I thought it was disgusting.  I finally decided that I would go to bed. 
When I left Mae came in and asked if I was going to get in the Hot Tub.  I told
her that I would do that but I wasn’t going to watch that show.  When we went
Roy put the show on pause and came out with us.  I think he was afraid that I
might damage the hot tub.  I sure haven’t felt very welcome from him since I
have been here.  After being in the tub for a little while we got out and Mae
and I took a shower and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was a nice morning and again we ate out on the patio.  They do have a beautiful
yard and with this beautiful weather it is nice to eat outside.  We attended
meetings with them and enjoyed the meeting but I couldn’t hear the first two
speakers.  The last speaker was a young man giving his farewell talk before
leaving to serve a mission.  He spoke loud and clear and gave a beautiful talk
and testimony.  I spoke to him after and told him that I was sure that his
minion president would be pleased to have him.  I enjoyed the both Sunday
School class and the Priesthood meeting.  It is sure different being back in a
family ward again.   This afternoon we had two ducklings come by and so Jase
went into the house and got some bread.  As he was feeding a large carp swam
by.  Jase wanted to put some bread on his pole and try to catch the fish.  I
showed him how he should get an open face real.  In doing so I caught the
carp.  It took me quite a while to bring the carp in so that we could let it
loose.  Roy had to help me land the fish.  We took some pictures and turned it
loose, however it was so worn out it couldn’t swim away so I spent at least ½
an hour working with it before it finally swam away.  That was the first time I
have fished on Sunday and I really wasn’t trying to fish but just wanted to
show Jase how an open face real worked.  Quint came over to see Mae and I and
to have dinner with us.  We enjoyed a very nice dinner.  After dinner Quint
helped me get my Indexing program to work on my computer.  Later this evening
we played a game as a family.  It was until almost 10:30pm before we quite.  It
was a good activity that everyone participated in.  I filled in this entry
before going to bed.  Mae and Shellie stayed up later visiting.  I went to bed
without Mae knowing that Shellie needed this time with her mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 8am and got up, trying to be quiet and let the rest sleep longer.  I
started working on Family Search Indexing and spent most of the day working on
one batch.  There were several interruptions including meals, going over to see
Quint and going out on the lake with Roy, Shellie and Mae.  I got part way
through the one batch but then because of the interruptions I am afraid that I
lost most of my extracted data.  We watched a show that Roy and Shellie thought
was pretty good but I felt it was trash.  I am not sure just what this
generation is coming to but I fear that unless the Lord interferes there is
little to be saved.  Even the shows thought funny on the BYU channel I do not
feel are that good.  It is now 10:30 pm Arizona time and I am ready to go to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke quite early this morning and was up for a while.  I did read a chapter in
the B of M before trying to go back to sleep.  I am still upset at the movie we
watched last night and also that I had lost the work I had done on indexing.  I
finally did go back to sleep and slept until 7:30 before getting up again and
taking a shower.  Mae cooked hot cakes for breakfast along with Shellie’s
scrambled eggs.  After cleaning up for breakfast I re-opened the indexing
program.  After a while Shellie came over to help and I let her take over and I
helped her.  We completed the batch and were able to return it as done. 
Shellie is much better at determining the spelling of names and places so she
will make a much better indexer than I.  We need to find someone that can help
us put the Indexing program onto her note book.  Mae, Shellie, Kevis and I set
down and played the game of Dominion.  Shellie and Kevis ties with me in third
place and Mae lost, however the scores were quite close.  I then took a nap. 
This afternoon Roy, Shellie, Mae and I attended the Gilbert Arizona Temple
completing an Endowment session.  The session was in Spanish so he had to use
the ear phones.   It worked ok but my right ear didn’t work.  When I took them
off I was disoriented for a minute.  I am sure having personal problems with my
feelings and am really not enjoying this trip very much.</p>

made hot cakes for breakfast this morning.  I am used to having a verity of
breakfast meals but Shellie just makes fried eggs every day so Mae made a
change for me this morning.  Mae, Shellie , Kevis and I plaied a game of
Dominion, which Jase won.   Later Mae and Shellie went shopping.  It was almost
noon when they went and I was bored and upset so I took the car for a ride and
ended up at Del Tacos, so I bought me two Fried Chicken Barito’s for lunch and
went to Wal-Mark where I bought some fishing equipment.  Roy and Shellie
attended a Home Owners Association meeting, where they were served pizza for
dinner.  The boys went with them, so Mae and I went to KFC and bought chicken
for our dinner.  After getting home Kevis, Mae, Shellie and I played a game of
Rook which Shellie and Kevis won.  I watched the movie “The Longest Day” before
going to bed.  I got talking to Roy and Shellie about the remodeling of their
home and we talked to long.  Mae got tired of waiting for me so she went to bed
without me.  </p>

slept well and took a shower when I got up.  I am in a depressed mood this
morning and wish we were going home.  I worked on my journal this morning as I
hadn’t entered yesterday’s entry.  I started working on a batch of obituary
records.  I thought I was doing ok with it.  There were only three records in
the batch but they have multiple entries per record.  I worked on it throughout
the day in between other activities.  But when I finished the third record I
was unable to complete and submit the batch.  Shellie, Mae and I went to a
store to purchase some humming bird nectar and while there bought Jase a
fishing pole with an open face reel on it.  This evening Roy was upset at the
purchase.  He feels that we should have bought another closed face reel.  I am
sorry that I ever got involved with it.  Nora and Maggie came over this
afternoon and we played games for a while before she went home to be there when
Garrett came home.</p>

woke again this morning quit depressed.  Mae sure is good to me but I am just
getting old and cranky.  I understand more every day what happens when men
become old and worthless.  I worked on indexing today and submitted a couple of
batches.  I tried to get Indexing downloaded onto Shellie’s IPod but couldn’t
get it to work.  We finally reached someone on the help line and they said that
at the present Indexing will not work on the IPod.  Mae and Shellie went out to
lunch with one of Shellie’s neighbors.  Jase caught his first fish today, it
was a car fish.  It rained quite hard, twice today.  This afternoon I worked on
another batch of indexing and finished it.  Mae and Shellie went to lunch with
one of Shellie’s friend and her mother.  Roy, Jase and Garrett went on a
Father’s and Son’s outing this evening.  Mae and I went to the store shopping
for a couple of items.  This evening Shellie, Mae and I got a Frozen Yogurt,
then watched the movie “Unbroken”.  It was a true story of an Airmen during
World War II that he and two others that crashed in the Pacific Ocean and were
able to survive in life rafts.  They were about 49 days in the raft during
which time one of the three dying.  Then the two of them we rescued by the
Japanese and put into a Prison of War camp.  The commander of the camp picked
him out to break him, but was unsuccessful.  It was a very inspiring show. 
Shellie, Mae and I got in the hot tub before going to bed.</p>

made egg omelets for breakfast.  We ate indoors this morning so that we could
watch a show about dolphins.  It is a little cooler today, I guess because of
the rain we had yesterday.  Shellie made egg omelets for our breakfast.  We
played some games for a while.  We also went over to the pool area where we
played Bocce Ball which Mae ended up winning.  It was too cold for us to go in
swimming.  After coming back home we took a nap and then watched a movie
Dolphin Tale 2.  Mae and Shellie went out in the canoes and I worked on
Indexing.  Roy and the boys came home while Mae and Shellie were still out on
the lake.  Roy grilled chicken for dinner this evening.  Nora is tending one of
her sibling’s children this evening and so Garrett stayed and had dinner with
us.  Roy and Jase watched a movie after dinner.  Shellie, Mae and I played a
game of Three Handed Rook.  Mae and I then got in the hot tub.  A little later
Shellie and Roy joined us.  A storm cam in before we got out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It’s
a pretty sunny morning but still a little cool.  We had got up expecting to
attend the normal block Church meetings but at 9:30am Roy informed us that
Stake Conference was starting at 10am.  We had to hurry and were just a little
late but enjoyed a great conference anyway.  I felt like the first talk was
given especially for my benefit.  After returning home we had some breakfast
for lunch.  I then took a nap.  This afternoon Shellie, Kevis, Mae and I played
Kevis’s game.  The wind came up and we had to quit.  This afternoon I saw two
Canadian geese with three goslings.  Thursday evening we had seen the nest with
the three eggs, so these goslings are only three days old.  We got some good
pictures of them as we fed them some bread.   This evening we went with Roy and
Shellie out to their nephew’s place where their nephew opened his mission
call.  There was a lot there for the event.  He is called to serve in the
Atlanta Georgia mission.  After returning home Shellie, Roy, Mae and I went for
another walk around the lake.  After returning home and before going to bed
Shellie read form the scriptures.  We got in a discussion and I am afraid that
I was misunderstood and I may have offended Roy and Shellie.  I tried to
explain but it just didn’t come our right.  I finally just gave up and went to
bed.</p>

gave me a hair cut this morning before I took my shower.  It is fun to watch
the ducks and the geese that are all around the lakes.  We eat most meals out
on the patio and can enjoy the wild birds along with the beauties of the
neighborhood.  It is still a chilly this morning and now at 10:15 the
thermometer reads 69 degrees.  I got a text from Scott asking about borrowing
some tools to install a fence.  My tools are in my tool trailer that is in the
storage lot, so I called Jimmy Cosper.  He visited with Jimmy across the street
from us.  Jimmy told him that I could give the code to Scott and let him in the
lot.  Scott can then take my key to the trailer and get into the tools.  I
called and visited with Bruce for a few minutes.  We decided that on Wednesday
afternoon we would get together and eat at the “Whole Food’s” so that we might
have some time to visit.  I worked on indexing and entered about 22 records
that I indexed.  We got word from Nora that they are expecting a baby boy about
Sept. 20<sup>th</sup>.  That excited Shellie and Nora and Garrett are very
pleased with the news.  This afternoon Mae, Shellie and I played a similar to
cross word puzzles.  Of course Shellie won that game without any challenge.  I
went fishing for a while but didn’t have any luck.  I did see a pair of ducks
with 8 ducklings that look like new hatch.  We can’t help worrying about the
howls getting them as there is a pair of howls with a young howl that are in
the area.  We believe they have got three out of a batch of 4 ducklings, since
we have been here.  It is fun to watch the wild fowls that live in the area. 
Scott texted me this morning, asking if he could borrow my level.  I had to
call to see if it would be ok to give Scott the code to the storage lot as my
tool trailer is locked up in it.  I was given the approval to give Scott the
code to the lock.  Sandi called and she has a leak in the water pipe in her
basement.  I told her that we would come out Sunday night when we get home and
stay the night with her.  That way a can repair the leak on Monday morning. 
Although it was cold this morning, it warmed up by this afternoon.  We watched
a movie on CD that was a very good show but as with most shows that are made
the Lord’s name is often used in vain.  As Mae and I talked about it later we
are concerned that slowly this is accepted more and more.  In fact I don’t
think most even recognizes that the Lords and Savior as well as our Eternal Father
and God, names are being used in vain.</p>

some ladies coming over to visit so we tried and so we tried to help her
prepare for them.  When they did come I came in the office and worked on some
of my journals and histories.  They were here for six hours.  Judie called us
to let us know that she has been sick for several days and feels that we should
not stop there on the way home.  I told her that we would check back in a day
or two to see how she is doing.  We had a late dinner and just visited after
for a while.  I played a couple of games on the computer and added to mu
journal.  It late and I am ready to go to bed now.  Mae and I took showers

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
breakfast Mae, Shellie and I went over to the Phoenix Arizona Temple and went
through a session.  It is a small temple but very beautiful.  As we were
leaving the Temple I met two Missionaries.  I visited with them for a few
minutes.  Both of them are about at the end of their mission calling.  One of
them was from Omaha, Nebraska and the other was from Burley, Idaho.  They said
that they are allowed to attend the Temple once every three months.  I was glad
to hear that as when we finished our mission in the Philippines we were told
that we couldn’t attend the temple as that was not our purpose for being
there.  After the session I was hungry so I suggested that we stop and get
something to eat.  Shellie drove almost back to the house before stopping at a
salad buffet “Sweet Tomato”.  It was pretty good but that wasn’t quite what I
had in mind.  This evening we met Bruce and Katie, Bruce daughter at “Whole
Foods” where we had dinner and enjoyed visiting with them.  Michalinea was at
an appointment she had so couldn’t be with us.  On the way home Mae and I
stopped and got a Frozen Yogurt before coming home.  After returning to Roy and
Shellie’s we watched the movie “Ice Castles II” which we found very enjoyable but
it is almost a duplication of the original “Ice Castles”.  After it ended we
got ready for bed.  We talked for a while, very concerned about Roy and
Shellie’s relationship.  We see very many danger signs, but we do not know how
to approach the concerns.  I have tried to council Shellie in the past but that
hasn’t helped.  I tried to talk to Roy in the past but that certainly was not accepted
but almost caused great problems.  The only thing I know to do is pray because
all else seems to be out of my abilities.</p>

woke about 7AM still with great concerns for my family.  Almost every time Mae
and I attend the Temple, we add our children to the Prayer Roll and hope for
Heavens intervention in our family’s behalf.  Every day I seem to realize that
I am less and less qualified to council others as to how Life works.  My
greatest comfort comes through my testimony of the truthfulness of the Gospel
of Jesus Christ and I pray continually that my faith in my Savior Jesus Christ
will never falter.  I don’t see anywhere else to turn for help.  How other
possibly continues with life without that faith, I do not comprehend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
is another beautiful day in Arizona.  As I set here at the table typing this
entry I look out the kitchen window onto a beautifully landscaped yard and a
beautiful lake, even though it is a manmade lake, the beauties of nature is
breath taking.  It is certainly a wonder to me, at all God has done for us. 
Jase and I went over to get water and ice for Shellie.  I also stopped at
Chevron and filled up with gas so that we will be ready to go tomorrow.  I did
take a nap today.  Mae, Shellie, Kevis and I played a game of Dominion and
Kevis came in next to last because Shellie, Mae and I tied for last place.  I
worked on a batch of indexing and finished it this evening.  For dinner this
evening Nora, Garrett and Maggie came over for dinner with us.  </p>
