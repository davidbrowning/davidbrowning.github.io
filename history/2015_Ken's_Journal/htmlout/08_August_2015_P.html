<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>        We
didn't get up until almost 8 this morning.  Mae prepared breakfast for me and I
went to the Ray,s where I installed a new water heater.  Most of the job went
well.  The only error was in one sodder joint that was in a tight area and when
I turned the water pressure back on, that joint leaked.  Mae did some chasing
materials for me.  Bishop Mullins came by a couple of times to see if I needed
any help.  The problem was that there just wasn't room for much help.  I didn't
finish up until 5pm, so it was a long day.  Mae got home from shopping shortly
after I got home.  After eating some dinner I took a short nap while Mae
cleaned up and started getting things ready for tomorrow.  She has invited Gail
and the children and also Gail's mother Marcy for dinner tomorrow.  I guess
Jeff is back in Chicago with work.  We watched a fair show on Netflix's and
then I entered my daily journal.  As I finished July's I wanted to print June
and July off as I don't trust this computer.  Sure enough my trust was correct
and we lost my input for today.  It took another hour to rebuild the files and
get thing right again.  Well it is almost mid-night now and Mae is asleep so I
had better get to bed also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>       With
it being Fast Sunday we were able to sleep in a little longer.  Today at church
we held Sacrament meeting in the cultural hall as the chapel is being
remodeled.  During Sacrament meeting I was released as the Ward Mission
Leader.  Brother Flint was sustained in my place.  I think he will do a good
job.  Following the meeting, Brother Fred Amundson and I took the Sacrament to
some of the shut-ins.  I enjoy going with Fred even though he is getting quite
feeble.  This afternoon Mae had invited Gail, her mother Marcy and the children
for dinner.  Jeff flew to Chicago on company business today.  Mae had prepared
a wonderful meal and really went all out.  After dinner we let the children
watch a DVD in our bedroom while Gail, Marcy, Mae and I played games.  It is now
after 10pm so we will go to bed.</p>

returned some extra parts to Kearsley's and Durk's before going to work at
Graf's.  When I got home from work I took the receipts down to Brother Lee
Gifford who is the Ward Finance Clerk.  He will get me a re-reimbursement check
on Sunday.  This evening Mae read from our book “Jesus the Christ” then we went
over the study group questions.  While Mae read I made up some capsules.  I was
sure tired so we soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked at Graf's today.  We are getting closer to being through with this job. 
My Makita 4 ½“ power saw went out on me this afternoon.  Ron bought me some nails
for my finish nailer, but they were the wrong style so after work I took them
back to exchange them, but Lowe's doesn't have the ones that I need.  I decided
to go to Air-O-Fastners in Kaysville to find the nails.  Hurrying I got there
at 4:50PM but they were already locked up.  Their sign indicates that they are
open until 5PM.  That didn't make me happy.  I went to Home Depot in Layton and
found a small package there.  I also bought a new power saw so that should last
as long as I do.  It was late when I got home but Mae didn't have dinner ready
as she has been busy with other items all day.  After we ate dinner I went down
to Ray's where I was going to change the drive belt on their swamp cooler but
the belt they got was too short so they will have to get another one tomorrow
and I will try again.  This evening I showered and then entered this entry into
my journal.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked at Graf's today.  This evening we attended our study group and enjoyed
that.  We took the car so that we could go to a concert after the class but the
lawn sprinklers came on and got the car wet with secondary water.  By the time
we got the car washed and dried off we changed our mind about the concert.  I
went down to Sportsmans Warehouse and got some worms.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up early and went fishing with Randy.  We had some problems with his boat
as it was taking on water and the burg pump wasn't working so we had to scoop
the water out with a small cup.  When we got the water down to a safe point we
took the boat to the dock and got it unloaded.  I could not find where the
water is coming into the boat so we brought the boat back to Randy's home where
I can work on it.  It has been a long day and I was sure tired when we got
home.  With Randy being blind it is a lot of work for me and that is especially
true when there are problems. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked at Garf's today.  The first project was to screw down wood thresholds
going from the hallway into the finished rooms we have built.  I figured that I
could use a 1/8” masonry bit as a starter hole and then enlarging it, however
the concrete was so hard that I couldn't get it to drill.  Finally I gave up
and went to a tool rental and rented a hammer drill.  That did the job in 10
minutes.  I then grouted the tile I had laid in the hallway.  After finishing there
I stopped at a grocery store and got a couple of items for Mae.  I then went to
Dick's to ask some questions concerning Randy's boat.  When I got home, I had
dinner and then went down to Ray's and helped Lynn with the repairs to his
washer.  We couldn't get it finished but quit for tonight as Lynn was
completely tired out.  I was tired when I got home but we watched the movie
“Florance Nightengale”.  That was a very good show.</p>

slept in this morning.  After eating breakfast I went over to Scott's and we
figured out the remodeling of their back porch.  I then checked on Lynn Ray and
he got the washer repaired.  I then installed a new drive belt on their swamp
air conditioner and repaired a hole in the water pan.  Mae had gone to Randy’s
and he worked o her    back.  This evening we visited the Hilton's.  They are
having bad health problems.  I then took Mae for a ride up to Ogden Valley.  We
watched a movie on Netflix before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Having
been released as Ward Mission Leader last week, I didn't have any extra meetings
to attend this morning.  We did enjoy Sacrament meeting, Priesthood meeting and
Sunday school today.  At the opening of S.S. class the instructor told a joke I
quite enjoyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                “A
man worked quite hard all his life.  He had been quite frugal and had saved
$50,000.  He told his wife that he wanted to have that money buried with him
when he died.  Before the casket was closed and he was buried, the wife
inserted a sealed envelope into the casket.  A friend of the wife questioned about
the envelope and the wife told her the promise she had made.  The friend asked
if she had actually put $50,000 in the casket and she said yes I did, I wrote
him out a check for $50,000.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                When
we got home from meetings, we prepared dinner and had Jeff over to eat with us
before he left for Idaho.  We enjoyed visiting with Jeff.  This afternoon we
went visiting to some of the neighbors and took around a Fruit Cocktail
desert.  This evening Mae and I played a couple of games of Rummikub, each of us
won one game. We then read the remainder of the chapter in Jesus the Christ,that
we are assigned to read for this week’s study group.  David called in response
of Mae's call to him.  She wanted to visit with him concerning Evelyn Hilton’s
health.  It was almost 11pm when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in, then after breakfast I went over to Randy's and worked the day on his
boat.  I stopped on the way over at Kevin's and borrowed a steam cleaner.  With
that I steamed the grease and trash out of the engine compartment.  Randy had
me remove the rear seats, then I jacked up the rear of the boat and put water
in the boat until it was about 2 inches from the starter motor.  I then checked
for leaks coming from the boat.  I found some water leaking from the bolts
holding the frame for the outrigger.  It will take some work getting into the
area to tighten the bolts as there are 6 bolts holding that frame and the motor
mounts.  It was getting late so I filled the boat with water within two inches
of the starter motor and let it stand overnight.  I put a pan underneath it to
catch the leaking water so I could see how bad it was.  This evening Mae and I
went over to Georgia and Ricks where we ate and then played “Five Crowns”.  It
was a fun card game and up until the last round I was winning but the last
round Georgia passed me up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
again worked all day at Randy's on his boat.  I still could not find where the
water is coming in.  Randy will have someone help him take it to a lake and
launch it into the water and see if they can see where water is coming in. 
This evening we expected to have Brother Flint come for dinner but he never
showed up.  Later he came by to tell me that he had gone fishing at Deep Creek
and they had problems getting back home.  He gave me a couple of nice fish. 
Mae had gone over to Chris Kenney’s, who had invited her to try on some clothes
that she outgrew and Mae might like.  Later this evening Mae and I watched the
movie on Netflix “The Windwalker” which we really enjoyed and had read the book
before and might have even seen the movie.  I finished this entry before we
went to bed.</p>

woke just before the alarm went off.  After breakfast I filleted the fish that
Brother Flint gave me last night.  Scott came over and helped me take the top
off my pickup.  We then loaded the camper onto the pickup.  I worked most of
the day on the pickup, the boat and the camper.  Randy needs me to put the
bilge pump back into the boat and then Dick's Boats will check the boat for
leaks.  Lynn Ray called and they can smell something coming from the swamp
cooler.  After we returned from Study Group this evening I went down to Ray and
checked the swamp cooler and it seems to be ok for as old as it is.  I am tired
so I think I will get ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                we
enjoyed the morning getting things packed and ready to load the camper.  We
attended the Ogden Temple this morning taking Janice Richie with us.  This is
the 1<sup>st</sup> time she has been back to the Temple in 30 years.  She was
quite nervous but she did enjoy the session. After the session we went to the
cafeteria where I had planned to treat us, but Janice said that she wanted to
pay for it.  It was special of her and we did enjoy our time with her.  I had
planned on going to Randy's to do some work on his boat but he took it to
Dick's Boat Shop and they will check it out.  That gave me time to do more
preparing for our trip.  I went to the Nut &amp; Bolt store for a couple of
bolts and he just gave them to me.  I enjoy going to that store and encourage
everyone that I can to go there.  I was tired this evening so I turned on the
TV.  Mae attended a Wedding Shower for Annika Rogers who will be getting
married on the 21<sup>st</sup> of August in the Logan Temple.  Annika is from
the Clinton Ward.  Mae &amp; Annika hit it off when we moved to Clinton and
Annika was a Beehive in Young Women.  I started one show on Netflix but it
turned me off so I cleared out many of the shows on my list and watched the
rest of “The Great Escape” that we had started the other night.  I sure love my
sweet wife and enjoy being with her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 6:30 this morning and with the normal morning routine, getting the
camper, boat and pickup ready, it was 11am before we left.  We stopped at
Costco in Bountiful for a couple of items.  We then started on down to Southern
Utah.  Just before we got to Scipio I noticed that the alternator gage showed
low voltage.  I had purchased both a new battery and a alternator from Auto
Zone less than two years ago so I wanted to return to a Auto Zone store to have
it checked out.  Not having our GPS with us, Mae called Michelle to see if she
could locate a store for us.  She gave us the number of a store in Cedar City
and they gave us a store in Richfield.  With that location we went that way
where we located the store.  Even though I didn't have my receipt, they were
able to locate it on the computer.  They checked the battery and found it
defective so with the warranty it still cost me $42.84 for a $138.99 battery. 
We lost about an hour there so it was 5:40PM when we got to Tropic.  Shellie
and Roy called us.  They had got delayed in road construction so they will
still be later getting there.  We got the camper set up before the Family
Dinner was ready.  Shellie and Roy got here about 7PM.  They are the only one
of our Family that came this year.  It was great to reunite with others of the
George Bushnell Family.  We enjoyed the evening and got to bed before too late
and both slept well.</p>

was a beautiful morning and breakfast was sure good and all you wanted.  We
spent most of the day just socializing with family.  Shellie, Georgia, Mae and
I did play a game of “Crown 5”, in which I lost on the last hand.  This evening
we especially enjoyed Family program.  I did feel bad that none of the rest of
our family, except Shellie and Roy made the effort to attend.  We have children
and grandchildren that could have added to the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Although
it was a beautiful Sunday morning, I got feeling a little discouraged.   At
breakfast Roy, Shellie, Georgia and I got discussing the raising of children
and I finally just left and went for a walk.  At one time I thought I knew how
to raise children but now I just get discouraged, feeling quite a failure at
that.  After eating breakfast everyone started packing up.  At 10AM most of the
family came back together and after having prayer and singing a hymn we enjoyed
hearing  reports from Georgia and Rick, then Kim and last from Uncle Van's
grandson about their recent missions.  Kim especially testified of the
importance of reading the Book Of Mormon daily to maintain ones testimony. 
After the meeting everyone left for their homes.  Rick and Georgia wanted to at
least stop in Bryce Canyon park and see a couple of sights.  Shellie and Roy
said that they would also like to go in.  Mae said she would like to be with
them so we also went in.  We stopped at Sunset Point and there met Bryon, Jenna
and their family.  Most of them wanted to take a short hike down into the
cannon but Jenna wanted to keep their youngest there so he could sleep in his
stroller.  Mae and I stayed with her and let the rest go.  After they returned,
we left for Fish Lake.  We fueled the pickup, added air to the tires and
purchased a block of ice.  I asked the station attendant directions and he gave
us a much shorter route that I would have taken.  It still took us until 5pm
before we checked in at fish lake.  It took us a while to get set up but I
couldn't find a sewer hook up.  We accepted it this evening and were soon ready
for bed.</p>

slept in and after getting up I started looking for the sewer hookup.  When I
couldn't find one and all the other pads had one, I went to the front desk and
asked them about it.  The girl there said that they had had a bad rain storm
and haven't found the hook up on that pad since.  She gave me a new spot #26
and we moved.  Most of the day was spent relocating.  We went out fishing about
five and did catch four fish before dark.</p>

another great morning.  We stopped at the lodge to see if they carried any
groceries, but not much.  I cleaned the fish while there as they have a better
cleaning station than the one at Bowery Haven.  We then went to the dock  on
the south west end of the lake, but they had the same selection of groceries as
the other two.  I filleted and packaged the fish while Mae got some lunch.  We
ate and then took a nap.  Mae got dinner ready for the evening, while I wrote
in a note book for my journal.  We will transfer it to the computer when we get
home.  We went out fishing about 4:30 pm and though there was a lot of wind, we
both caught our limits, in fact, as Mae was bringing in her last fish, as I
reeled in, I caught another fish.  It was a lip catch so we released it and it
swam away.  After docking our boat, I borrowed a wrench and tightened the belt
on the alternator, as it is squealing when we start the motor.  While I was
working on the boat, Mae read President Uchtorf's talk on the Savior's
Atonement.  It is sure a great talk!  I wonder if there is any way to get David
to read that talk.  I cleaned our fish while Mae went on to our camper and
started dinner.  After dinner, I filleted the fish and Mae packaged them.  We
are getting quite a few fish.  We are tired so we are soon going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up early so we could have the crockpot on before we went out fishing.  It
was windy when we woke, plus I wasn't feeling the best, so we went back to bed.
After getting up, we realized that the furnace wasn't coming on and it was cold
inside the camper.  I went to check the thermostat and realized that the
crockpot was setting right under the thermostat.  We moved the crockpot and the
heat soon came on.  About 8 am we went out fishing.  It was a beatiful
morning.  By 10:45 am we were back in with our limits.  I tried fishing for
Mackinaws, but didn't get a strike there.  We kept the lure out but I also
fished with a 2<sup>nd</sup> pole.  Mae caught five fish and I three.  We had a
good time.  After lunch, we cleaned and filleted the fish.  We took showers and
a nap.  Mae made a southwester chicken dinner for this evening.  We went to the
store for some ice, but they didn't have any.  Then we went for a walk.  After
getting back, we played Rummy Cube in which I won two of three games.  We got
to bed before 9:30 p.m.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept well last night and was up at 5 am.  We enjoyed a nice breakfast of
hot cakes and eggs.  We enjoyed the warmth and conveniences our camper gives
us.  We were on the lake about 7 am.  I tried fishing deep with the down rigger
and it worked pretty well.  We both fished with our standard pop-gear with Mae
catching her limit before I did.  I still had one to have my limit and I hadn't
had anything go for the down rigger lures.  As I was letting my line out to try
to catch my last fish, Mae asked if she could hold my pole while I took a
picture of her fishing.  I no sooner clicked the picture when the pole doubled
over.  I kidded Mae that she just wanted to catch my last fish.  We were back
in the boat dock about noon.  Mae went up to start lunch while I cleaned the
fish.  A couple were there at the cleaning station and he showed a couple of us
how he filleted the fish.  I learned a lot from him on filleting fish, but also
how to skin them.  I also went to the dock store and bought a lure and a bait
box as I had tripped on my box and broke it.  After eating lunch, Mae and I
filleted and packaged our fish.  We then took a nap.  Mae didn't get very much
of a nap as a neighbor's dog started barking.  We went out again this afternoon
and I again spent my time trying to catch a lake trout.  We had quite a wind on
the lake this afternoon so Mae fished for regular trout and I spent my time
trying for the Mackinaws, and keeping the boat under control with the strong
winds.  Mae caught her limit but I didn't have any luck.  Mae read some talks
from the conference Ensign.  They were very good.  When we were about back to
the dock, the wind let up.  I tried to just catch a fish before we finished.  I
had a good strike and for the 2<sup>nd</sup> time today, the line broke and I
lost a 2<sup>nd</sup> set of good pop-gear.  I guess my line must be getting
old.  Those pop gear sets cost about $20 each, so that hurts.  We had a nice
dinner, took care of the fish and went to bed about 10:30 p.m.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
planned on getting up early, but I woke at 5 am.  We decided we were too tired
so went back to sleep.  We got up about 6:30 am.  We were on the lake shortly
after 8.  By 10:15, we had our limits and then just road around on the lake,
just enjoying the morning.   There was a fair wind, but it was still a
beautiful day.  We came in about noon.  Mae helped me clean the fish and then I
stayed and filleted them.  One person told me that they couldn't find a good
spot where the fishing was good.  I said that I couldn't find anywhere that it
wasn't good.  We figure that we have caught over 48 fish this week and used 39
worms.  When I cleaned the bait box, there was 2 ½ worms left.  After lunch, I
had Mae lay down, as she wasn't feeling very well, and I packaged the fish.  I
then took a nap outside as I didn't want to wake Mae, but was woke up with a
wind that took the canopy almost down.  It woke both Mae and I so we finished
taking the canopy down and put it away.  Mae and I played games this
afternoon.  This evening, after dinner, Mae and I went for a walk.  We went
north east on the lake shore trail, although it didn't go close to the lake. 
While walking, we saw a 3 point white tail buck, still in its velvet.  A short
way further, we saw a doe.  Neither deer seemed very worried about us, but just
kept their eyes on us.  It was a beautiful evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in, not worrying about fishing today.  After breakfast we started
packing.  We were glad that we had the canopy already packed as it still took
us until 11 am before we got away.  (Mae inserting this now – I was amazed at
how Ken was able to back up the boat with the camper on, down that short, but
steep dock.  Then he ran around, got in the boat and drove it over and onto the
trailer.  It wasn't quite on, so he had to get out on the boat trailer and jump
over to the cement edge of the dock. He walked to the front of the trailer and
again jumped from the cement onto the top of the trailer to pull the boat the
rest of the way upon the trailer.  The boat wasn't on right, so he again jumped
to the boat from the cement pavement and rocked the boat and threw me the rope
to pull it up.  Other men were standing around marveling at how Ken, as old as
he is, could do what he was doing.  One man said, I couldn't do that, I would
fall in the lake.  Ken is amazing, and I am proud of him for all he can do.  I
am not much help to him, so glad he can do it.)    (Now back to Ken.  I am
typing this up for him.)  Our neighbors to our right had come up last night and
while we were packing, he helped me carry the canopy and put it in the boat.  I
have worried about that as I didn't want Mae to help carry it.  We stopped at
Scipio for gas and because the Chevron was 50 cents per gallon more than the
Texaco across the street, I decided to go to the Texaco.  After paying, I went
in to the restroom.  While there I asked the clerk about those items and she
said that they were in the same association and used the same fuel.  That was
good to find out.  I will watch that from now on and also look for price.  We
stopped a couple of hours to visit with Mike and Becky.  Mike did an excellent
job with the remodeling of the girl's bathroom.  As we didn't go through
Fillmore on our way home, Mae had wanted to stop at a Maverick to get a frozen
yogurt.  We stopped at two Maverick's as we came through Salt Lake, but neither
have the frozen yogurt machines any more.  Most of the stations are no longer
offering this product.  It was 5 pm before we got home and it took us another 3
hours unpacking.  We had stopped in Layton and got some Maddox chicken for
dinner.  We did watch a movie on Netflix before showering and going to bed.                                              </p>

prepared egg omelets for breakfast.  I was mixed up on my timing and hurried
through my breakfast before realizing I still had an hour before leaving for
church.  Meetings went well and we enjoyed the Spirit of all the meetings. 
After returning home we had lunch and then I took a nap.  Mae got on the phone
with Jeff and visited until I woke up.  She filled me in on what is happening. 
It looks like they have sold their home and have bought a home in Twin Falls,
Idaho where the plant is located, that he will be working at.  I hope things
work out ok for them.  We visited with most of our children today by phone and
they are doing ok.  I also visited with Bob for a few minutes.  Irven and Sandy
had called and were going to come over at 6:30pm.  They arrived just before 8pm. 
They apologized, but had Christine and her family come just as they were ready
to leave.  We just visited this evening as they wanted to let us know that they
had sold their home and are moving to the Logan area.  They now have two
children living there and Mark is getting married October 2<sup>nd</sup> and
they will be living up there.  It sounds like thing are working out ok for

have been quite depressed today but got up and got going.  I prepared breakfast
while Mae started the washing.  We cleaned the camper and the boat.  I called
to check on the price for a new boat cover. It looks like it will cost about
$350.00 for a new one.  Mae had an appointment with Randy for a treatment so I
went with her and I worked on Randy's boat.  I got it put back together except
for some bolts that I will need to buy.  We stopped at the grocery store for a
few items.  After getting home I got the camper taken off the pickup.  I got a
call from Mrs. Hali Hunsaker and she now wants me to do the remodeling of her home. 
I thought that she had decided against me doing it, but I doubt if she could
find anyone else that would do it at my price.  I had hoped that she had got
someone else, but I should be glad as we need the money.  I will start that job
next Monday.  We went up to David and Shauna's for dinner and enjoyed the
evening with them.  We played some games on the computer.  Davis and I looked
at remodeling and finishing their basement.  It was 9:30pm when we got home.  I
entered this entry before we went to bed.</p>

took the car into Murdock Chevrolet to have it serviced.  That took up the

shell on the pickup but wasn't able to do it myself. I finally called Scott and
he came over when he got off work and helped me.  With his help it only took us
a few minutes to do the job.  I went down to Randy's and finished putting his
boat back together.  We went Home Teaching this evening to Leah Neilson.  After
that we went over to Sportsman Warehouse where I got some worms and also a set
of pop-gear.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
went down to get Randy at 5AM.  He wasn't quite ready so we lost some time
there.  We tried to find a Flying J gas station but finally stopped at a Willard
station.  We then traveled to the rest area just before Malad to have the boat
inspected for muscles.  There they told us that we had to stop at the sheriffs
for our permit.  We had some trouble finding the court house.  There we bought
a permit to put the boat on any Idaho water.  We then had to go to a station
and purchase a day fishing license.  From there we went to Devil’s Creek
Reservoir but there wasn't enough water there to put a boat on.  I asked the
camp host and she told us there was a Deep Creek Reservoir just back 3 miles
and up the east canyon another 3 or 4 miles.  We found the reservoir and had
trouble getting the boat launched.  With Randy being blind, it means I have to
do all the work.  We enjoyed the day but had a wind to contend with.  That made
it especially difficult to reload the boat as the wind kept blowing the boat
out of line with the trailer.  I had to wade into the water up to my belt and
then have Randy stand on the trailer wheel fenders and hold the boat while I
got back to the pickup to pull it out of the water.  It took much longer to get
the boat loaded and ready to travel so I was late getting home.  Mae had left
me some dinner and I quickly changed and got over to our study group. 
Following the study group, Mae and I visited Sister Lemon and then went to the
Ray's.  We were there for over 1 ½ hours with Sister Ray talking just as fast
as she can.  I was sure tired when we got home so went right to bed.</p>

Temple.  Carrie Shaw was the only one to attend the Temple with us.  I am not
sure just how to get more to attend these Temple Days.  It was a good session.
This afternoon I finished putting my fishing gear up, put some tools away,
straightened the trolling plate for Randy's boat and then went Home teaching
and Visiting Teaching with Mae.  After getting home I caught my journal up to date. 
We stayed up and watched a Western show on Netflix before going to bed.</p>

woke with the alarm but found that Mae didn't sleep well, so I changed my plans
and had Mae go back to sleep.  She has an appointment with a Vain Specialist
today so I am going to go with her.  Jeff &amp; Gail have been wanting her to
go to a vein specialist as they are worried about her legs as she has varicose
veins and many spider veins which have broke and look bad, especially in her
right foot and ankle.   We went into Dr. Oberg at the Tanner Medical clinic. 
After looking at Mae's legs, he said that there were no serious problems to be
concerned with.  He also said that there have been many studies and they cannot
find any connection between veridical vain and leg cramps.  He said that they
could treat Mae's legs but it would be just cosmetic.  Mae decided against
doing anything at this point.  This afternoon I went over to Graf's and worked
four hours setting a medicine cabinet.  After coming home I showered and we
went out to eat.  We met Bob, Robert and Pattie at Sizzler's in Layton.  After
eating all of us went over to Bob,s apartment where we watched a John Wayne
movie.  Mae and I got there first and seeing the checker board set up in the
entry way, Mae and I played a game of checkers.  I got her into a spot in which
she could jump my piece.  Mae didn't want to as it would put her in a position
where I could take two of her pieces.  Pattie came in about that time and when
Mae said that she didn't think that she had to, Pattie agreed with Mae.  I let
it go and won the game anyway.  Bob put on the show “Submarines” with John
Wayne.  Part way through the show Pattie became quite sick, and so before the
movie ended, Robert took her home.  Mae and I stayed and watched the end of the
show and then came home.</p>

Nominee.  She felt quite good about him as a candidate.  It took me 5 hours to
complete the job and they paid me before I left.  Both cabinets were quite a
job as there was plumbing in the walls that took some modification to get the
cabinets to fit.  After getting home, I lay down and slept for a ½ hour.  I
then showered and shaved.  Mae also took a short nap and then she entered my
diary entries that I had put in a note book while we were on our Reunion and
Fishing trip.  After dinner we attended our Saturday Evening session of our
Stake Conference.  It was very good.  After the Conference session, I took Mae
down to Ogden looking for a ice cream store that served frozen yogurt.  We stopped
at one shop but they were out of frozen yogurt.  We then found a Farr's Ice
Cream store on Wall and Riverdale.  We had bought Mae a ice cream cone at the
other store so I got a dish of yogurt and we came home.  Mae took a shower and

but shortly after the meeting started, I realized that the seat choice was a
mistake as my left leg went into muscle cramps and I was unable to get out to
walk the cramps off.  I suffered through the rest of the meeting.  When we got
to the car, Mae had some pills for me, but my leg continued to hurt for some
time even after getting home.  After eating some lunch, I took a nap and it seemed
to help.  I really had a hard time hearing any of the speakers, so that really
took away from the meeting for me.  On the way home Mae dropped her cell phone
under the car seat.  After getting home she searched for her phone but also

Randy would like to go fishing back to Strawberry Reservoir tomorrow and
