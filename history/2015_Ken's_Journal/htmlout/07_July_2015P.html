<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning so it was 9 am when I got to Graf's.  We hung sheet rock
all day.  I quit just after 3 pm.  I went over to Heli Hunsaker, 1248 E 1400 S
in Clearfield.  She needs to have the kitchen cabinets removed and the floor
taken out, replacing the sheeting, reinstalling the cabinets and then having
new linoleum laid and a new counter top.  I told her that I usually worked 6
hours a day and 5 days a week, but I also like to take off a day or two to go
fishing.  I estimated it might take three weeks and she already knows that I am
charging $25.00 per hour.  On the high end it might cost $3,000 for labor, plus
materials.  Mae soon had dinner ready, but she took time to go to the Pharmacy
to get medication for Brother Ray.  After dinner I laid down and took a nap. 
Jeff and his family came over with my pickup about 8:30pm.  Jeff and I took the
camper off the pickup leaving it in the storage area.  With Jeff's help it
didn't take very long.  While we were doing that Rachel saw the drawing that
Kylan had made on our white board.  She asked Grandma's permission to make some
chances to it and then proceeded to add a body to the head, a side walk, a
house, a dog house, and a dog (wagging it's tail) on a Lishe.  It was really cute
and took some talent.  </p>

worked at Garf's today.  After getting home we had some dinner and then we
drove out to Tooele where we watched “The Exit 99 Band”.  That is the band that
Chelci sings with.  They are pretty good but some how they need to get a little
excitement in their music.  When we left to come home the light on the car dash
indicated that the lefl rear tire was low on air.  We checked all the tires and
evened all tires to equal 34 lbs.  About the time we got onto Hwy 215 the light
came back on that the Left rear tire was again low on air.  We pulled of on 7<sup>th</sup>
North and checked it and it was again low.  We again filled the tire and
started again.  This time we got to Layton and the light was again on.  Again
we pulled off and filled the tire.  This time by the time we got to Roy the
light was on again so we again filled it.  By the time we got home it was on
again.  This time I jacked up the car and put the spare on.  By this time it
was late so we went to bed.</p>

slept in and then I called Ron and old him that I was going to take the day
off.  He was fine with that.  I took the car down to Big O Tires in Riverdale
and they replaced the tire as it was worn out.  This was one of the regional tires
as Mae had replaced two tires a year ago. This tire they replaced under
warranty but now I had three new tires and one old tire.  So I had the replace
the fourth tire.  It was after 11 am by the time I got back home.  I started
putting some of the camping gear away but it hadn't got packed away properly
when we left Lave, so I had to unpack and reassembled it properly.  I then took
Sandi's trailer over to Darren Bideaux Sales and Service to have them install a
battery security box on it.  Mae attended the grave side services for Larae K.
in Clinton.  She then went grocery shopping and got back home just before I
did.  After eating lunch I helped Mae by pealing potatoes for her, then I took
a nap but Mae let me sleep much longer that 20 minutes.  I worked on my journal
and then we took Sandi's pickup to the storage lot and also dumped her
port-a-pody from the camper.  We drove out to Tooele to enjoy hearing a
performance of “Exit 99 – the Band” that Chelci sings with.  As we approached
Tooele the tire pressure light came on the dash, indicating that the left rear
tire was low.  After the performance concluded we stopped at a service station
and checked the tire pressure in all four tires.  We then left for home.  When
we got to Hwy 215 the tire pressure light again came on.  We pulled off on
North 7<sup>th</sup> Street and again filled the tire.  We again started for
home but when we got to Layton, the light again came on.  Again we stopped at a
station and filled the tire again.  This time it only lasted until we got to
Roy.  Again we filled the tire and by the time we got home it was again low on
air.  At home I removed the tire and installed the donut spare.  It was late so
we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
had an enjoyable morning as we started this Holiday but have great concerns as
to what is happening in our nation today.  We have so many that are turning
away and destroying our freedoms and laws that were originally established in
the Constitution of our great nation.  It is very depressing to see these
things being destroyed especial by those that are elected offerers in our
government.  I did but out our Flag and enjoyed see it float in the morning
breese.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
took the car down to Discount Tire to get the tire repaired.  It is beyond
repair but still under warranty.  I had them install a new tire but now we have
three new tires, so I bought another to keep the tires balanced.  It took me
until 11:30 am before I got home, so Mae had to take my pickup to attend the
grave side funeral for LaRae from the Clinton 20<sup>th</sup> Ward. This
afternoon we invited Scott's family to come for dinner.  Sandi also came out
after she attended the Grantsville parade where Addie participated. I also
invited Bob and went over and got him.  We had a very enjoyable time but after
eating we found out that we had no water to the house.  We have found that the
water is off at many homes here in the trailer park.  This made an interesting
evening.  After dinner I took Bob back.  Scott and his family left and then
later this evening we met them at the Laton City park where we enjoyed a
concert followed by a fire works display.  The fireworks were not as elaborate
as they were last year but there was still a large amount of money that you can
say went up in smoke.  The thing that bothered me the most was the crudeness
and immodesty that was displayed by so many from children to adults.  It was
late when we got home but Sandi, Mae and I stayed up and played a game of
Rummy, which Mae ended up winning.</p>

got up and left for home about 7am.  It was almost 8am when I got up.  We still
didn't have water so Mae ended up going to our one neighbor who still has
water.  Mary invited Mae to come to her place and shower.  I had taken a shower
yesterday morning so I decided I could make it.  We attended our block
meeting.  Bishop Mullins read a letter from the First Presidency concerning a
special meeting to be held with the Priesthood and Sisters of the Ward. It will
be held next Sunday during Priesthood meeting and Relief Society meeting.  The
subject of the meeting will be “the United States Supreme Court's ruling on
same sex marriage”.  Following our block meeting I took Brother Fred Amundson
and the two of us took the Sacrament to 4 shut in families in out Ward.  It was
an enjoyable experience but we were longer than I had time for and I missed my
Stake Missionary meeting.  We finally got water back on about 9pm.  Running
water is sure a nice convenience that we just take for granite.  We had a light
snack before going to bed.</p>

I did get the bed made for her.  Before I left for work Mae got up.  We got the
sheet rock hung today.  I came home and took a shower and then we went back to
Ron and Dian's for dinner.  Jan made meat loafs for dinner.  It was very good. 
After eating the five of us played a game of Mormon Bridge.  It was a fun
evening.  We got home about 8:45pm and I set the timer on the water
sprinklers.  We soon went to bed, both being tired.</p>

said last night that he didn't want me to come until 9am so I waited.  I tried
to figure out my hours and materials so that I could give Dian and Ron a figure
as to what they now owe me.  It is higher than I estimated so I reduced my
hourly rate to $20 per hour.  Mae continued to figure the invoice and I went to
work.  It was 9:30am when I got there.  I worked putting the cornering on and
before quiting for the day had the ceiling taped.  Mae was gone shopping mainly
for Marianne Ray.  I took a shower and cleaned up.  Marianne called me and
asked if I could come down and give Lynn a blessing.  I called Lee Gifford and
he said that he would go with me.  We gave both Lynn and Marianne a blessing
but I could not tell Lynn that he would get better.  Lee told me afterwards
that he felt that the blessing was the way it should have been.  I did learn
one thing from Lee and that is that we can seal the anointing but we do not
have authority to seal the blessing.  To seal a blessing only is authorized in
the Temple.  Mae attended a meeting with the Bishopric and the Relief Society
Presidency in which they were told that most of the Relief Society  Presidency
has been in for two years so they would soon be reorganizing the Presidency
very shortly.  I hope that Mae is not called as President.  I am concerned
about her health.  After I returned and Mae returned home she and I went Home
Teaching and Visiting Teaching to Sister Nielson.  It has been a very busy day.</p>

awake through the session.  Dian Graf asked if she might attend the Temple with
us and of course we said she could, so she drove to our place and road with
us.  We also picked up Brother Fred Amundson.  Bishop and Sister Mullins also
went to the temple.  Their is about six sisters I the Ward that goes to the
Temple each Tuesday morning.  After returning home and having some lunch Mae
and I took a short nap.  Jeff called and asked me if I could help him.  I went
over to their place and repaired a piece of tile that broke off their counter
top.  I figured the materials that I will need to reinforce their stairs from
the back deck.  I picked up my tool trailer from Graf's and brought it home
with me.  I told Dian that I would be working at Jeff's tomorrow.  Bryce

there also to paint their front door.  Kylan Came over with her so I asked him

just left to bring me clothes so I could clean up.  She returned when she
reached me on my phone and told her that I was at home.  I showered and
changed.  We then drove up to Morgan to the city park.  The park was quite busy

time.  Instead of holding Priesthood and Relief Society Bishop Mullins
conducted a special meeting concerning the U.S. Supreme Court decision to up
hold and make legal “Same Sex Marriage”.  In the meeting Bishop Mullins read a
letter from the First Presidency and Quorum of Twelve Apostles stating that the
Church would not allow any officer or priesthood leader to perform such a
wedding nor could any such practicing individual or group to use any of the
Church Building or property.  I was a little surprised at some of the questions
and comments that was made after the reading of the letter.  The special
meeting took all of the time for Relief Society and Priesthood so I did not
give the lesson that I was asked to give.  After we got home from meetings we
had some dinner.  Mae suggested that we go V.T. and H.T. to Hiltons and I said
that we should visit the Patterson's.  We thought I would still have time to go
to my Missionary meeting but I got mixed up and my meeting started at 3:45pm
and I thought it started at 4:45pm.  I guess that I screwed up again.  We got a
e-mail stating that Judge C. Alan McConnell of Toledo Housing and Environmental
Court, is being requested to resign his office because he will not perform a
Same Sex marriage which is against his Christen beliefs in God's commandments
concerning marriage.  We replied to the e-mail stating that we support his
decision and we sent the e-mail on to everyone we have e-mail addresses.  The
question in my mind is how far this situation will go before the Lord will say
it is enough.  Wile Mae was working on the e-mails and talking to JaNae, I made
some toasted ground rabbit sandwiches for a light super.  </p>

we were going he suggested that I call to see if Kylan would like to go with
us.  I called and Mishelle brought him over to our house.  It was 6 pm by the
time we got on the lake. Fishing was slow but we did catch 4 fish.  By the time

two Brothers but then we let Garrett take our car.  The Hess's had some
problems finding our place as the main entrance that we use is closed off for
the repairs that are being done on the highway.  It all worked out fine.  This
afternoon we went with Roy and Shellie to Spanish Fork where Nora's sister is
performing in a play.  The play was put on by the Community Arts Theater and
the performed “Tarzan”.  It was really well done and it was very enjoyable
evening.  Roy and their family went to Sandi's where they spent the night.  Mae
and I came home and it was almost mid-night when we got there.  The road crews
were still out working with a jack hammer when we got home.  They did quite at
mid-night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It was almost 8am when we got up so I didn't
get to Graf's until 9:10am.  I repaired the 12 holes that were put in the
Graf's Family Room ceiling by the plumbers that re-plumed their home.  It took
me all day and I was tired when I got home.  Mae has been busy all day and she
did get my trailer re-registered.  She also bought a thermometer for the
refrigerator.  She also bought a couple of sharp knifes as I was so upset over
not having a good knife the other morning when I tried to fillet the fish. 
When Mae got home we warmed up some dinner and re-watched the movie, State
Fair.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I got a call from Bishop Mullins asking me
about Sister Delouder's Baptismal services.  I felt bad but I had not been
aware of what was happening.  This afternoon Mae and I went out to Sandi's
where all our family got together.  It was a nice evening although I had a hard
hearing the conversations.  It was late and I was quite sleepy so we stayed over
night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                Mae and I got up
at 6am and came home.  I had to hurry and shower while Mae prepared some
breakfast for us.  I attended Ward Counsel at 10am this morning before our
regular Block meetings.  My back has given me some problems today.  After
getting home from meetings we had lunch and then I got a short nap before I
attended our Stake Missionary meeting.  Brother and Sister Patterson came Home
Teaching/Visiting Teaching this afternoon.  I made some phone calls this
evening.  I turned a John Wayne show on.  “In Harms Way”.  It was good but we
have seen it several times.  I told Mae that the problems with John Wayne is
they don't make any more of them.  We went to bed before 11PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                I worked at

doggy door.  This evening we went over to visit Bob and Mae gave him a hair
cut.  We watched a John Wayne show on DVD, “Searchers”.  That is a show of John
Wayne that I have not seen.  On the way home we stopped and bought a Frozen
Yogurt.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                I woke up very
depressed this morning.  I got Sandi's tent trailer repaired.  Mae and I went
into the Church Cannery expecting to help can beans, but they beans were not
ready yet so it got canceled.  We drove around our first home on 13<sup>th</sup>
Street, while we were in the area.  While there we drove around the old Mount
Fort Ward.  It brought back a lot of fond memories.  I figured out some
materials that I will need to add a water supply valve for the distiller and
also to put a drain line on the A/C unit.  Presently they only put a drain
through the floor and just let the water drip under the house.  I called Dian
Graf and they will still be painting tomorrow so I won't go to work there tomorrow. 
We watched a show on NetFlix before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Wednesday, July 22, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                I slept in until
late this morning.  Dian Garf called and I said that I would to let me know
that they had not finished the painting.  I told her that I would come over and
order the doors and trim for them.  I took Sandi's trailer down to the storage
lot for now.  I guess that Sandi will come out Friday morning to get it.  I
have thought a lot about how to repair the ducting in this house.  We found out
that Duck Tape makes a double face tape and I think that would help me.  Mae
got on the computer and was able to order me a role of it.  Bishop Mullins
stopped by to talk to me about Ray's water heater.  We drove down and looked at
it.  It needs to be replaced and I told our Bishop that I would replace it and
I thought my cost would be around $600 and I would install it with out any
charge.  I would need some help lifting the old water heater out and putting
the new water heater in.  In thinking about the work I need to do on our
furnace duct, I feel that it might help to have a electric metal shear and Mae
found out that Harbor Tool caries one for $40 I might get. I went over to
Graf's and Dian and I went down to Lowe's where we got the doors and trim for
their home.  I came home from Graf's by 3:30pm and so changed clothes.  Mae and
I then drove over to the Dentist office in Clearfield where we picked up Randy
Porter and took him to his home.  While there I helped him find a cane that he
had misplaced.  We then drove to Bryce and Deanna's where we had dinner with
Bryce, Deanna, Irven and Sandy.  After eating we played games for a while.  We
enjoyed being with the four of them.  It was about 11pm when we got home.  Mae
went to bed but I got up for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Thursday, July 23, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I tried to work on my journal and then went
into the front room and read some of my missionary materials.  I don't know
what time I fell asleep in the recliner.  I woke quite early and realized that
Mae had been up as she had turned off he light and put a light blanket over
me.  I got in bed and went back to sleep for a while.  We got up and had
breakfast, then got ready to attend the Temple.  We took the car over to the
car wash and took it through.  We then hurried to the church but no one came to
go to the temple with us.  We went anyway but had trouble finding a parking
spot for ½ hour or more.  We did Initiatory Ordnances for the dead.   After
leaving the Temple we tried to find the distribution store.  While looking we
went to K-mart and purchased a couple of items.  We were hungry so we went to
the Sub Way and shared a Foot Long.  We then went to the Desert Industries
store and I was told that the Distribution store was in the Deseret Book Store
just south of the Temple.  There we purchased me some new shoes for the
Temple.  Mae wasn't really interested in going to the Rodeo this evening so we
dropped that plan.  I worked on cutting the two doors down for the Graf's and
that took most of the evening.  I hurt my back while lifting the doors by myself. 
Mae rubbed my back with the vibrator and I took a muscle relaxer.  Mae went to
bed shortly after 9pm but I stayed up and wrote this entry to my journal.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, July 28, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Well I have lost a few days in my journal. 
I am having trouble with this computer system we now have and I am having
trouble keeping my enthusiasm over my journal.  I haven't worked on the
reentering of my 5 year diary since our lap-top crashed.  I am not sure that I
still have what I had done so far.  Discouragement and depression has bothered
me a lot recently.  Friday and Saturday I spent most of my time removing the
two pine trees to the west side of our lot.  The one was about dead so I just
pulled it up.  The second I dug around it, wrapped it with burlap to hold the root
ball together, then with a come-a-along I pulled the tree into Jeff's trailer. 
We took it out to Sandi's where we replanted it.  I hope it grows for Sandi. 
When we ended the day my back hurt.  It gave me problems through Sunday so I
didn't work Monday or Tuesday.  We did go to Dr. Toone on Monday and that
helped quite a bit.  Today I just slept and watched two shows on Netflix.  This
afternoon I did plant some grass in the area where we removed the trees and a
spot that we killed out do to weeds. This evening I attended a special meeting
called for by the Stake President as requested by the Quorum of the Twelve. 
All ward's Ward Counsel Members were requested to be in attendance.  It was a
good meeting but I left feeling quite depressed due to the fact that four of
our six children are inactive.  I didn't sleep very well tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, July 29, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae didn't sleep well so I let her sleep
when I got up to go to work.  Mae had prepared my breakfast for me.  I work at
Graf's today mainly getting electrical out lets and switches installed.  When I
got home Bishop Mullins stopped by as I was backing into the drive-way.  I
informed him that I had ordered the water heater for the Ray's.  Also while we
were visiting I told him that I felt depressed over the meeting last night.  He
asked why and I explained about the inactivity of our four children.  He
reminded me that those children have their free agency to choose and which ever
way they choose they are still sealed to Mae and I as long as we keep the countenances
that we have made.  We may have to go to Hell to get them and they will have to
pay the price but they are sealed to us upon our faithfulness.  Mae got home
shortly after I came in.  She had been visiting.  While Mae prepared dinner I
took a shower.  After eating I took a short nap.  We then went to our Study
Group.  Following that we stopped and visited with Emma and Marve Heslop for a
few minutes.  After getting home we did a little yard work before coming in. 
Mae got us each a nectarine that we really enjoyed.  She then popped a bag of
popcorn.  We played two game of Rummikub of which I won both games.  We then
went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, July 30, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As I read from the Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi
32, I felt that this is one of the most important messages for us to study and
understand.  I wonder if we failed to teach our children the importance of
prayer and seeking the guidance of the Holy Ghost in our gaining a testimony of
Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  I worked at Garf's today getting the ceiling
fan installed and a good start on installing the suspended ceiling in the wash
room.  As I got ready to leave I though that I should leave my trailer there
but then changed my mind and brought it home.  I came home and Mae had
visitors.  I took my shower and shortly after getting pout Bishop Mullins and
his wife came with some clothes that was given him by the family of Sister Lois
Merrill who recently past away.  What Mae doesn't want then the Bishop
suggested some other Sisters that are about that size.  Any thing left over can
go to the D.I.  Scott and his family came over to bring Kylan who wants to stay
with us tonight.  I had just settled down when Sister Marianne Ray called and
their water heater has gone clear out.  I told her how to shut it down but she
was having difficulty following my instructions so I went down.  When I looked
at it I shuttered as it is a mess.  There was no shut off valve and I had to
shut off the water main valve.  Then Ray didn't have the tools that I needed. 
I was glad that I had brought my trailer home with me.  I needed a valve or a
plug or cap to disconnect  the water heater from the rest of the house.  I
didn't want to leave them with out water over night.  I went for the tools I
would need and when I looked through my spare parts I found the perfect valve. 
I was able to get them set for the night.  The new tank will arrive tomorrow
and I will be able to install it on Saturday morning.  I certainly felt the
blessings of the Lord in this emergency.  Mae and Kylan played games and
visited.  I entered this entry when I got home and it is now almost midnight so
we will get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, July 31, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I didn't go to work at Graf's until 9 am as
we wanted to have breakfast with Kylan this morning and we felt that 7 am would
be earlier than he would want to get up.  At Graf's we worked all day getting
the ceiling grid work installed and installing the two florescent fixtures. 
From there I went to Kearsley and purchased some of the items that I will need
for doing the Ray job tomorrow.  From there I went to Durk's and got the water
heater and additional items for Ray's.  It was after 6 pm when I got home.  Mae
took the twins and Kylan to Dinosaur Park and never got back until after 7 pm. 
I had eaten and set down to watch a show on Netflix, but I kept falling asleep
so when Mae got home I just turned it off.  After Scott and Mishelle came and
got the children and left, I cut Mae's hair before taking a shower and going to
bed.  I was sure tired and went right out when I laid down. </p>
