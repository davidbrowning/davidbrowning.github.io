<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked at Graf's for 8 hours today.  I was sure tired when I got home but did
get quite a lot done.  When I got home I tried repairing the sprinkler system. 
I got some of the heads changed but didn't have time to check out the timer. 
It was late when we got to bed.</p>

worked at Garth's again today but today I quite at 3PM.  Again I felt good at
what we accomplished.  We tried to figure out some of the electrical wiring. 
That was somewhat of a problem.  When I got home I took a shower and cleaned
up.  At 4PM we held Ward Missionary meeting.  As soon as that ended Mae and I
went over to Scott and Mishelle's where we tended children while they went out
to eat.  It was 10PM before we got home.  I entered this journal entry before
going to bed.</p>

woke at 5:30 but I slept until almost 6 before I got up.  Mae left to pickup
Bob shortly after 7am.  She is taking him up to Weber University where the
graduation exercises for Syracuse High School will be held.  Cole is graduating
from High School this year.  Bob, his Grandfather would like to attend he
graduation exercises to support Cole.  Mae is taking him there.  I went to work
at Graf's and worked until after 4pm.  I brought my tool trailer with all my
tools home with me tonight so that I can have them to work at Kim and
Jeannine's on Friday.  I was late getting home and putting my trailer away.  I
had to hurry to shower and eat before we went to the group fireside this evening. 
After getting home Mae went out on Relief Society work and I entered my journal
entry for today.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>        We
woke up early and left by 7 am to go fishing with Ron and Diane Graf.  They met
us in Morgan, where we stopped just long enough to buy ice.  We went on up to
East Canyon Reservoir.  We had a wonderful time fishing.  Ron caught 2 trout,
Diane caught one, Mae caught two and I caught five.  We got off the lake at 3
pm, I cleaned the trout while Mae, Ron &amp; Diane cleaned the boat and wiped
it down.  They left to go home and Mae &amp; I went to Morgan to watch our
grandson, Connor, play baseball.  Connor pitched most of the game and did very
well.  One inning, he pitched three strikeouts, so it was 3 up and 3 down. 
They won 8 to 4.  David is one of the coaches for Connor's team.  He seems to
enjoy that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>After the
game, we took Connor with us to go get a sandwich at Subway and then went back
to the reservoir and fished for another couple of hours.  Fishing wasn't quite
as good as it had been earlier in the day, but Connor caught the first fish
shortly after we got out on the lake.  He caught another one and Mae caught
one, but that was all we caught.  Finally, as it was getting dark, we quit.  I
cleaned the fish while Connor and Mae wiped down the boat.  When we took Connor
home, we visited with David, Shauna and the kids for a few minutes.  We got
home late, but had a wonderful day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>       I
slept until about 8, but Mae woke at 6:30 and went out to sleep later in the
recliner.  She finally slept so didn't wake until 8:50.  I was planning to go
to Kim &amp; Jeanenne's by 10 am, but they wanted to go to the temple and would
be back at 1 pm, so I mowed the lawn and worked on the minutes for my
missionary meeting.  Mae got an e-mail ready for me to send to our ward
missionaries.  I got the boat covered and took it down to the RV lot and
brought back my tool trailer. Mae wasn't planning to go with me, but Jeanenne
talked her into coming and said her and Kim wanted to treat us to dinner at
their Chicken restaurant.  Time went fast.  It was almost 2 when we got to Kim
&amp; Jeanenne's.  I worked on putting a new telephone line into Kim's office,
but ran into some problems with that and it took longer than I planned on.  Kim
ordered dinner for us, then went and picked it up so we could eat it at their
home.  I quit working shortly after five.  Mae enjoyed visiting with Jeanenne,
and Kim, when he wasn't helping me and really enjoyed that.  Kim, Mae and I had
chicken fried steak with baked potatoes, green beans and tossed salad. 
Jeanenne had the fried chicken.  It was delicious.  Afterwards, we played super
Uno.  Kim won a couple of hands, Jeanenne won a couple, I won a couple and the
last game, Mae won.  We got home at ten.  I needed to fillet the fish we caught
yesterday, so we could get them sealed and in the freezer.  Mae is typing this
journal while I am doing the fish.  I am telling her what to type.  It will be
at least eleven by the time we get to bed.</p>

up at 5AM but Mae slept a little longer.  We had breakfast and then went over
to the church at 8am and helped clean the church house.  I brought Mae home and
then I went up to Kim and Jeannine's where I worked most of the day repairing 
their home.  I installed a new faucet and garbage disposal in their basement
kitchen.  I had to replace a plumbing pipe and a supply valve that had gone
bad.  Mae soon had dinner ready when I go home.  I had purchased some salt for
our water softener and so put most of it into the bran tank.  It over flowed
the bran and so had to mop that up.  I showered this evening and then Mae cut
my hair.  We watched the last half of a movie we started the other night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>      We
woke early but by thew time we got going it was time to leave for Ward Counsel
at 9:30am.  This was a special meeting mainly to discus the changes that are
necessary to be in line with the special instructions given to us by the Stake
Presidency as received under the direction of the 1<sup>st</sup> Presidency and
Quorum of the Twelve.  From that meeting we went directly to our Block
Program.  After bring Mae home I went with Brother Fred Amundson and we took
the Sacrament out to shut-ins.  I then attended the Weekly Missionary Report
meeting.  I was late for that meeting as I wasn't watching my watch and took to
long visiting with those we took the Sacrament to.  Following that meeting I
took the Sacrament bags to Brother Haney.   When I got home Mae soon had dinner
ready.  After eating I took a short nap.  Mae and I then worked on getting a
scheduled ready for the July Temple attendance.  On this new computer it takes
us a long time to figure out how work and save the reports we want.  We got a
call from Marianne Ray asking if I would come down and give Lynn a Priesthood
blessing.  I contacted Brother Wayment and he said that he would help me. 
Brother Wayment anointed and I seal and gave the blessing.  I don't think that
the Blessing was what Marianne wanted but I couldn't feel guided except to tell
Ray to trust in the Lord's will and knowledge.  After returning home Mae told
me that she wanted to go with me but had she had ran to a neighbors for a
minute and returned just as Brother Wayment and I left.  She tried to start the
pickup but it wouldn't start.  I tried to start it when she told me and it
acted just the same as it did last week when I was over at Ron's.  Mae and I
had a dish of apple sauce and cottage cheese.  We then played a game of Rummy
before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>       After
breakfast, I worked on the lawn sprinkler timer and was able to get it to water
all the stations, and so I showed Mae how to go through and water each station
for 15 minutes manually.  I will now need to reset the program so that it will
do it automatically, but at least we got the outside watering done for today. 
I tried to start the pickup, but it wouldn't start.  The problem is that all my
tools are in my trailer and my trailer is up at Kim &amp; Jeanennes.  I tried
calling Bryce to see if he could come help me with his tools, but he has some
men coming to help him on a project at his house.  I decided to call our
insurance company and use our roadside assistance to tow the truck over to
Dee's in Clearfield.  Mae finally got through to the insurance company and they
said it would cost us $100.  That upset me, but then I remembered that I had
some tools in the shed.  I found that I did have a small socket set and was
able to find the socket that would fit the terminals on the battery.  I tightened
up the ground connection and the truck started fine.  Mae prayed for me because
I was too upset, and the Lord blessed us.  I worked up at Kim and Jeanenne's
from about 11 to 5 pm on their master bathroom.  I finally put a new drain pipe
in their sink that had been broken, trying to seal the drain pipe with clear
fingernail polish and silicone caulk.  I don't know whether this will work or
not, but it needs to set at least 24 hours or more before using any water in
the sink.  I recaulked their shower as the old caulking had came loose and Kim
&amp; Jeanenne had removed it.  This should seal the shower so that they can
now use it.  Kim wrote me out the checks for the work I have done up there. 
Mae had gone out to lunch for Diane Graf's birthday with friends from the
Clinton ward.  They had a good time and afterwards, Mae took Diane looking for
ceiling fans and lights for their basement.  I was tired when I got home and so
Mae and I ate dinner while we watched a show on Netflix “Last Ounce of
Courage”.  It was a very good show.  It was late when we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>       I
worked over at Graf's today, finished the framing and started the electrical. 
I got home about 3:20 pm and had time to shower and change before holding our
weekly ward missionary meeting.  This evening, we went home teaching/visiting
teaching to Lynn and Marianne Ray.  We were there over two hours.  Marianne
loves to show Mae all her fish and tell her all about them, which took about an
hour and a half.  I talked with Lynn during this time.  We finally got a lesson
in and then it still took us a while before we could get out the door and into
the car, but we know they are quite lonely and have a lot of health problems,
so we just need to be patient with them and show love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>       I
went to work for Graf's today.  Ron and I went to Lowe's and purchased
materials for the basement.  While there I purchased me a shop light that uses
a led light.  It can set on the floor or on a telescoping stand.  I told Mae
that it will be my Fathers day gift.  We worked the rest of the day installing
electrical.  I was sure tired and so I took a short nap after dinner.  Mae has
been cleaning carpets and worked most of the day on it.  We attended our study
group this evening.  After returning home Mae and I watched the show “People
Will Talk” staring Cary Grant and though we have seen it many time it is still
a cute show.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>       We
had both slept okay last night but had very little desire to get up.  I didn't
get over to Graf's until 8:30am and spent the day pulling wires.  Ron gave out
by lunch time and so he took a long nap.  Dian came down and gave me a hand
pulling the wiring.  It was almost 5pm when I got home quite tired.  I called
Mae on the way home and we decided to try going fishing tomorrow.  I went down
to the storage lot and brought back our boat.  After dinner Mae attended choir
practice.  I took a nap but didn't hear the alarm go off so slept almost an
hour.  After Mae returned from choir practice we got some things ready for
tomorrow.  I popped some popcorn for us to take with us.  We read the chapter
in our book “Jesus the Christ” and then started to bed by 10pm.</p>

 We woke up at 5am but I didn't feel very well so we went back to bed.  I woke
again at 7:45am and we decided to still go fishing.  We got some breakfast and
then went over to Scot's where we got Kylan.  It was after 9:30am when we got
on the lake.  We had some strikes but lost most of them.  Kylan landed one.  As
we were coming back into the dock I caught a nice fish.  I then had Mae drop me
off at the dock so I could go to Morgan to repair Kim's bathroom sink.  As I go
off the boat Mae turned away from the dock to quickly and hooked the stringer
line on to the dock and jerked it and the fish off the boat.  I went on to to
Kim's and it didn't take long to repair the sink.  I came back to the lake and
got Mae, Kylan and the boat.  We got home about 3pm.  Mae took the car and got
it washed while Kylan and I put the boat up.  Mae and I got cleaned up and we
went to Garth's.  We picked them up and then took Kylan home.  The Graf's. Mae
and I went out to eat at Sizzler.  After eating we went to the Tabernacle in Salt
Lake where we listened and heard the Bell's perform.  It was late when Mae and
I got home but we had a nice evening.</p>

slept in this morning.  We got some breakfast and then went over to clean our
chapel.  Another Ward was having an activity in the building so we were not
able to do much cleaning.  Mae and I clean the glass entrance doors on the East
side and then left.  We took some old papers to have shredded at American 1<sup>st</sup>
bank.  We got some groceries then got us a hot dog for lunch along with a
frozen yogurt.  We went to Garth's where I got my saw horses and took over to
Irven and Sandy's.  We then went to see Bob.  Mae gave Bob a hair cut and I
took a nap.  When I woke Mae had finished cutting Bob's hair and he had fallen
a sleep.  We came home and I watched a show on Netflix.  This evening I mowed
the lawn and then came  in a worked on the computer.  Mae took invitations out
to the neighbors.  When Mae came home we played a game of Rummy and though she
had the highest score I went out going over the 500 mark, so I won.  Good

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>         We
slept in as long as possible but got up so that I had breakfast before going to
P.E.C. meeting.  I had quite a bit of trouble hearing what was going on during
the meeting.  I really don't feel well but stayed through Sacrament meeting. 
Bishop Mullins asked Terry Shaw, Ravae' Mullins and Ken Browning to meet with
him following Sacrament meeting.  He asked that each of us speak next Sunday in
Sacrament meeting for exactly 10 minutes on our Father.  Not feeling well I
came home and went to bed.  I felt some better and so this afternoon I attended
the Missionary meeting with Boyson and the full time missionaries.  After that
short meeting I met with all of our Ward Missionaries.  That will save us
getting together on Tuesday evening.  I should have attended Stake General
Priesthood meeting but Mae had scheduled dinner at David's this afternoon.  We
enjoyed dinner and then played a couple of game with everyone.  We were late
getting home to bed but it was a good evening.</p>

didn't sleep very well last night and so I stayed home instead of going to work
at Graf's.  About noon I did go over but Ron wasn't there as he had to go into a
Doctors appointment.  I did pull the power line that will feed the shed and get
it ran outside.  The trench has only been started so I couldn't run it out to
the shed yet.  I was tired when I got home so didn't get anything else

up most of the night.  Part of the time I rested in the recliner with the
vibrator on.  This morning I felt quite loose.  Mae left at 7am to take one of
the Sisters into the Doctor.  She took her to David.  When she left I was hurting
quite a bit on the left side just under the arm.  I didn't tell her as I didn't
think there was anything she could do and I didn't want her to worry.  I stayed
home all day today and did catch up my daily journal as I haven't made an entry
for the last couple of days.  Mae took Marianne Ray to several stores as
Marianne doesn't feel safe driving as she doesn't sleep much at night.  I am
concerned that Mae is starting to be taken advantage of.  I spent the day ether
in bed or the recliner.  This evening we watched the show “The Man Called
Peter”, actual I had watched almost all of it when Mae came home.  She wanted
to see the show so we started it over.  It is a good show.  Mae is a good wife

frustrated with the computer that I just gave up.  I watched “Man From Larame”
on the BYU Channel.  We have seen it several times before, but that was all I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
have been down most of the day.  Mae seems to always be on the go.  This
afternoon we did go to Durk's Plumbing and got some sprinkler parts.  I did
repair the two sprinkler heads that are giving us trouble.  We turned on the
watering system as the lawns are needing water but I have still got to work
with the timer.  Mae and I watched a movie before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 6am feeling quite rested.  We got up and got ready and then went to
Dennie's in Layton for breakfast.  I was quite disappointed as in my mind I
compared it to the one in Flagstaff, Arizona.  We then went on to Salt Lake
where we attended a Endowment session in the SL Temple.  It has been 65 years
ago that we first a attended the Temple and on that day were wee Married and
Seal together as Husband and Wife for Time and All Eternity.  That was a
beautiful day with lots of great memories.  After the session we enjoyed just
setting in the Celestial room and just remembering.  As we left we spoke to a
young couple that were waiting for their turn to be Married and Sealed.  I told
them that today was also our Wedding Day but 65 years ago.  We wished them
well. When I went to the dressing rooms, I saw Brother Ron Johnson from
Grantsville.  He works at the Temple as one of the officiators.  We visited for
several minutes.   After leaving the Temple we walked over to the Joseph Smith
Memorial Building, where we viewed the movie, “Meet the Mormons” and really
enjoyed it although we showed it when it first came out to the theaters.  By
this time it was late afternoon so we went out to Chuck-A-Rama for dinner.  We
took our time and by the time we left I felt some tested.  Although I was tired
when we got home we stayed up and watched a movie on Netflix.  It was after
mid-night when we got to be but I have sure enjoyed the day being with my
Eternal Sweetheart.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up before 9am.  Mae gave me a hair cut and we had breakfast, before Mae
left to go over to the church house to help clean the building.  There wasn't a
lot to help with the job this morning.  I felt bad that I am still not feeling
the very best.  I worked on my talk quite a bit today.  Mae has been busy with
Relief Society and visiting neighbors.  This afternoon I did go to Durk's and
buy some sprinkler parts and come home and install them.  I watered the lawn
this evening.  I worked on my talk and we didn't go to bed until mid-night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up at 5:15 this morning.  I did read two chapters from the Book of Mormon
and then worked on my talk.  I still have to much  and I am having trouble
cutting it down.  Mae retyped my talk and we left for church.  Even with all my
cutting I still took 15 minutes.  When we got home from Church, Sandi was
there.  She brought dinner out for me, steak covered with sautéed mushrooms and
onions over them.  I grilled the steak while Sandi and Mae prepared the rest. 
It was a wonderful dinner.  Scott and his family came over for a while.  They
gave me a couple of DVD's of John Wayne, actually 6 shows.   Scott and Kylan
came back taking the rest of the family over to Michelle's parents.  We watched
the movie, “Flying Leathernecks”.  It was a good show.  I finished this entry
and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was up about 5:30am.  Mae slept quite a bit of the night in the recliner.  I
worked at Graf's today.  Mae went up to Pineview boating with David and his
family.  Mike, Becky, Mattie and Jessie, also Sandi came out and went up with
Mae.  Scott and his family were also coming up but they hadn't got there by the
time Mae and Sandi left to come home.  I came home planning on going out
visiting but when I called Brother Jonson he said that the appointment canceled
out.  This evening Mae and I went Visiting Teaching / Home Teaching this
evening.  When we got home Mae and I put the picnic tables out and cleaned the
back driveway, getting ready for the neighborhood barbecue tomorrow evening. 
It's almost 10pm so I had better go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked at Garth's today.  Mae had most everything ready when I got home just
after 4pm.  As I pulled into the trailer park a car came in behind me.  As we
are having the neighbor party in our back driveway I turned around and parked
my pickup in front of the house.  The car did the same thing but as I got out
of the truck Gary Nelson got out of the car.  He has a meeting with the Clinton
City Counsel concerning the sale of Margie's parents farm.  He came in and we
had a nice visit for a little while although I had to take a shower and get
ready for guests to come.  We had a good group come this evening.  Donna Beus,
Jimmy and Darma Cosper, Jackie and her friend Ellen. Bob and Delaine Jackson,
Marry Teveldahl, Assencio and Marco, Jimmy  came over for just a few minutes,
Mary's daughter Nancy, then Mae and I, but it was a good group and we had an
enjoyable evening.  Assencio stayed and helped me put things away.  Bob and
Delaine also stayed and helped us with some of the clean up, in fact every one
help in some way.  Very successful evening.  We were tired and so soon went to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked at Graf's until 2:30PM.  Today was again working on outside electrical.
I was sure tired when I got home so I laid down and took a nap.  I then went
grocer shopping with Mae.  We got a call from Mike that Mattie is sick and they
took her into the Doctor.  She has Walking Pneumonia.  They wouldn't be able to
come to the gathering at Lava but think she will still be well enough for them
to bring the girls to Becky's sister so they can take their trip to Norway.  We
had just checked out so we went back into the store and bought some more items
for the trip.  When we got home Mae prepared some dinner.  I did some calling
to get dinner appointments lined up for the full time Elders.  Mae and I went
H.T. &amp; V.T. to Sister Lemon, Sister Neilson and Brother and Sister Hilton. 
It was late when we got home.  I entered my journal entry.  Mae helped me sent
a Text to the Elders concerning their dinner appointments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked at Graf's today getting ready to hang Sheetrock.  Diane gave me $2,000
towards the bill.  I don't know if it will be that much or not yet.  I decided
to go over and visit Bob for a few minutes before going home.  I stopped and
deposited the money in our account and while at Winigers I bought some cooked
chicken.  I then stopped at Jennie Porters and bough a bottle of pills.  Bob
and I visited for a while and enjoyed the chicken.  After getting home I took a
short nap.  I then helped Mae get get things ready to go tomorrow and prepared
the camper shell to take off.  Jeff came over and we unloaded the shell and
then put the camper on the truck.  With Jeff's help it didn't take very long to
load the camper.  I then mowed the lawns and turned the water on.  We were
tired and ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
took the day off work today and we finished packing to be ready to leave about
noon for Lava Hot Springs where most of our family is going to spend a few days
together.  Sandi got here about noon and we then got our things packed into her
truck.  We drove up to Jeff and Gail's.  Gail and the children were ready for
us.  I drove my pickup with the camper on it as Gail didn't feel comfortable
driving it.  Jeff has an interview in Twin Falls for a job offer.  He will
drive back to Lava this evening.  It was after 3pm when we got there.  Scott
and Michelle got there shortly after we did.  We set up camp then David's
family arrived and we helped them get set up.  We switched the menu for dinner
and had barbecue hamburgers.  That way it was ready when David's family came
and Jeff got there before we quite.  It has been very hot today so we didn't
think of turning the furnace on until we woke very cooled about 4AM.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke to a beautiful morning and enjoyed a nice breakfast.  Everyone, except Mae
and I went down to the river and floated it.  Most of them started at the Park
in Lava except Scott, Michelle and their family.  They were concerned about the
safety of the twins and we could sure agree with that.  Mae and I shuttled the
rest and then went on to a camp ground further down stream where David had
rented a camp site so that they could get out of the river.  It worked out well
so that those that wanted the thrill of ridding the rapped could do so and then
took a gentle ride down the river.  After every one got down to the camp ground
the younger children played in the river.   Some just relaxed and some of us
played a game that David had brought.  This evening Mae and I cooked Dutch Oven
Chicken for dinner.  This evening Shawna, Emily, Gail, Michelle, Ashley, Sandi,
Mae and I went down to the hot baths and soaked there.  To night Mae and I
slept much better as we had the furnace set to come on when it got cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up and had breakfast, then Mae and I got ready to attend Sacrament meeting
in Lava.  Gail took the children home as she wanted to attend meetings at their
Ward.  Jeff was going to leave when she did but he was going to drive my pickup
with the camped back.  When he started getting ready to leave we couldn't find
the keys to the truck.  After we got back for meeting, we found my keys in the
coverall pocket that Mae had put in the dirty close sack.  After Jeff left
David and Scott took their family to the swimming pool.  Mae and I stayed in
camp and took a nap.  This evening we all set around the campfire and roasted
marshmallows and sang some camp fire songs.  I finally gave up and went to bed
about 11pm.</p>

got up and had breakfast and then got things packed up to go home.  Sandi, Mae
and I left about 9AM.  Scott and David and their family's will be leaving
later.  It has been an enjoyable time and we are talking about planning it
again next year and trying to get more of our family their.  We got home about
11:30am and hadn't been their very long when Mike and Becky came.  Sandi is
driving them to the airport as they will be gone to Norway for two weeks.  This
is for their 25<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary.  This afternoon Mae and I
went to the movie “Coleville Miracle” and we really enjoyed that show.  It was
taken from a true experience.  After enjoying the show we went to Casa Dea
restaurant and had dinner.  It has been a very enjoyable day.  I did repair one
sprinkler in the yard.</p>

was tired when I got home so didn't really do much.  Mae had “The Walton's” on
TV so we watched 3 or 4 episodes of it.  I then caught my journal up as I can't
take this computer with me when we go places.  We did get a nice “Thank You” card
from both Jackie (across the road from us) and from Donna Beus expressing
thanks for the neighborhood barbecue we had last week.  It was special of them,
but the credit all goes to my special wife.</p>
