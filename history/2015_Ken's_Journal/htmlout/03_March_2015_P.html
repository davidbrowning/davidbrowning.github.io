<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
had a quiet morning and I enjoyed reading the book “The New Testament Made
Easier by David J Ridges.”  I found it very interesting in 2 Acts that David
had been told that he would not be cast into Outer Darkness but would be given
place in the Terrestrial Kingdom.  There was quite a bit of visiting prior to
the opening of our Sacrament service but when it began, the normal reverence
resumed.  During Fast and Testimony portion of the meeting, I found the
testimonies very interesting.  After getting home from meetings I called Bob
and invited him to have dinner with us.  Mae needed to take some information
around to some of the Sisters so I drove her around the court.  We then stopped
and got our mail.  I dropped Mae off at our house and drove over to get Bob. 
Bob was waiting for me when I got there.  When we got to our trailer I help Mae
with the final preparations and we set down to a very wonderful dinner.  After
cleaning up from dinner we played Rummy Cube with Bob.  He won the first game
and I won the second game.  Mae and I then drove Bob back to his home.  After
letting him out and making sure that he got in ok, we drove up to Jeff and
Gail’s.  We played a game of harts with Jeff and Gail.  I lost the game with
Gail and Mae tying for winners.  After getting home I started this journal
entry but then Mae prepared us some toast with apple sauce and cottage cheese. 
That is a good snake before going to bed.  I am so blessed to have Mae for my
wife.  I love to be with her in everything we do.  She is just a thrill in my
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked on the plumbing this morning.  Mae did house work and washing.  She went
to lunch with several of the retired teachers and secretaries from the Lincoln
Elementary grade school.   I went over to Larry Steele’s and checked on running
a recycle line for his hot water.  I think it could be done but he would have
to install a recycle pump that cost $180.00 and he felt that it was not worth
that.  I picked up some parts from Durk’s before returning home.  it started
raining this afternoon but I did get the drains and vent installed before I had
to quite.  Mae seemed to really enjoy going out to dinner with the group.  We
watched a very good move “A Mile in His Shoes”.  It was very good.  We then
watched a second show “Trail”.  It kept your interest but really wasn’t much of
a show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept until after 8AM but when I went into the front room I found that Mae had
slept very little last night.  I had her go back to bed and I prepared
breakfast and took it into her.  I hoped that she could go back to sleep but
before long she came out dressed for the day.  It snowed quite hard during the
night.  Although the snow soon started melting I got the snow shovel and cleaned
up some of the north area.  Jimmy came by and told me that in a few minutes the
snow would melt so why shovel it.  I said that I had to clean of my pickup so
that I could turn it around.  My building materials were in the pickup so I
wanted it backed in where I could easily get to the material.  I enjoyed the
opportunity to visit with Jim for a few minutes.  I started working on the
shelf that will hold the storage water barrels. Mae attended her R.S.
presidency meeting.  She then had an appointment to get a treatment on her
back.  I was ready to cut the main boards but needed Mishelle’s scroll saw to
shape two of the boards.  I had Mae come back home and then I took her to her
dr. appointment.  We then went to Scott’s where I used Mishelle’s scroll saw. 
It was getting dinner time when we started for home so we stopped at Del Taco
in Roy and got us some dinner.  Both Mae and I were cold so I mixed some hot
chocolate and we ate dinner while watching “October Baby” recommended to us by
Scott and Mishelle.  It was really a good show.  I typed this entry and it
looks like we will get to bed early tonight.</p>

were late getting up.  I had been up earlier but went back to bed for a while. 
I spent most of the day working on the bathroom but I didn’t seem to get a lot
done.  Mae brought up a couple of thoughts concerning getting the water from
the distiller, into the house.  I don’t think I will worry about that at this
time.  This evening we attended our study group at the Jones’s home.  It was a
good evening.  After getting home I watched a show on TV and one on Netflix.  </p>

didn’t sleep very well last night and when I woke she was asleep in the
recliner.  I tried to let her sleep longer but she soon woke.  I seemed to be
slow at getting started this morning.  After breakfast I did build a part for
Mae’s sewing machine.  I tried to get some information about the upcoming
Temple assignments but didn’t find out much.  It was 10AM before I got started
on the remodeling and at first my mind just wasn’t working.  Mae had a funeral
that she helped with.  I worked until almost 7PM when we had dinner.  After
showering, Mae &amp; I played a game of Rummy before going to bed.  I won that
game but it was close.</p>

still isn’t feeling the best but we got up about 7AM as Scott and Mishelle
brought the twins over for Mae to tend.  With Scott’s company without a
contract all employees are off work until the contract get signed.  Scott and
Mishelle decided to go skiing.  I worked on the remodeling until I went over to
the Food Bank to volunteer.  Mae took the twins to Dinosaur Park and to Mc
Donald’s.  After getting home from the food bank, I picked up a couple of parts
and the finished putting the water barrel platform together.  It was almost 6PM
when Scott and Michelle came for the children.  They had a great day skiing.  Mae
and I relaxed and watched a movie on Netflix “Evelyn” that was taken from a
true event.  It was a British show so it was a little hard for me to hear but
it was a very good show.  We then got watching Santa Clara and LMU North
Carolina play in the Western Conference playoff.  The winner will play BYU
tomorrow night for 1<sup>st</sup> place.  This game was very fun to watch.  SCU
lead the game all the way to a win.  It was fun to watch.  We thought of
turning it off several time and going to bed but we wanted to know the time of
the game tomorrow night.  It looks like ESPN will be televising the game so we
can’t get it on our TV.  It’s time to get to bed as we have to be at the church
by 8AM.</p>

went over to the church and helped clean it.  We had a good group out and it
only took about an hour.  We came home and exchanged the car for the pickup. 
We went to Lowes where they had a tile that we liked at even a better price
than Home Depot.  We opened a charge card and got 10% off our purchase.  I
finished putting up all but one piece of sheetrock in the utility room.  I can
now get the water lines ran.  We went to the Clinton Stake High Priest dinner
and program, with Marge and Morgan Thomas.  It was very good but I was still
hungry when I finished eating.  After the dinner we stopped at Marge and
Morgan’s and visited for a while.  On the way home we stopped at Del Taco’s and
bought a couple of Burritos before going on home.  We tried to find the Western
Basketball final Championship tournament, as we wanted to see BYU vs Santa
Clara, but we couldn’t find the station that was to carry that game.  We go
onto Day Light Saving Time so we lose an hour sleep tonight.  I filled in this

woke about 7:30 this morning having slept quite well.  I am always glad when my
sweetheart is still sleeping when I wake up.  By the time I finished reading my
scriptures Mae was up.  She said that she had slept well, only getting up a
couple of times during the night but each time was able to go back to sleep.  I
helped her get some breakfast and then we had to hurry and get ready for
meetings.  We quite enjoy our Church schedule starting at 11AM.  Meetings were
very good with Elder Aaron Cooper reporting on his mission.  I am not
acquainted with the Coopers although Mae said that she knew of them.  The
lessons in Priesthood and Sunday School we well presented.  I helped Mae
prepare lunch when we got home.  After lunch Mae and I laid down for a nap.  I
slept about an hour and Mae slept almost 1 ½ hours although it take Mae longer
to get to sleep than it does me.  When I got up I tried to call the Hilton’s
but there was no answer.  We understand that Sister Hilton is going into the
hospital for surgery on her arm tomorrow.  I worked on the transcribing of my
Diary to the computer.  I have added a lot of explanation to those short 4 line
entries.  I am now up to November 1972.  I had set a goal of having this done
by the end of the year 2014 but this move has shot that goal down.  Mae still
isn’t feeling very well this evening.  She has just rested and read most of the
afternoon.  Mae and I just visited for a little while.  I read chapter 6 of
“Teachings of Presidents of the Church – Ezra Taft Benson” and really enjoyed
his Testimony of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.”  It is now 10PM so we will
go to bed.</p>

prepared breakfast of egg omelets.  Mae had a couple of letters she needed
mailed so I took them first to the mail box but was afraid that the mail had
already been picked up, so I took them to the Post Office.  I started laying
tile in the utility room.  Scott came over and helped by cutting tiles for me. 
Mae and I went Home Teaching to the Ray’s this evening.  They sure have their
share of problems.  We ate dinner after getting home and then we watched a

Mae and I slept well last night.  Mae let me sleep until 8:30AM before waking
me.  It was after 10AM when I started working on the house.  I ordered a water
heater through Durk’s as Scott Wayment does not know how long it will be before
the Co. he deals with is going to be before they get the water heaters in. 
While checking waterlines under the house I found that the hot water line to
the shower is cracked and leaking.  I also started removing insulation under
the flooring so I can run new lines.  I have spent a lot of time trying to find
out why we do not get heat into our bathroom.  It was after 3PM when Mae called
me and said that the nurse from our insurance company was coming to give us a
physical.  She was supposed to have been here at 2PM but they couldn’t figure
out the address in the park.  She called Mae for directions while Mae was
shopping.  Mae called me, so I got out from underneath the trailer and came
in.  The nurse started the examinations with me and then did Mae when she got
home.  I then went back to work under the trailer.   I have removed the
insulation clear up to where the furnace hooks into the duct that goes to our
bathroom and I don’t think it has ever worked.  I have not figured out if the
furnace was ever hooked to that trunk line or not.   It got too late to check
further today.  I showered and entered this entry and we went to bed.</p>

let Mae sleep in and she woke shortly after 8AM.  I figured on pluming materials
and then went over to Durk’s and spent over a $1,000 for materials.  They had
my water heater in so that counted for over $500 just for it.  I started
running the water lines to and from the water softener when it was time to
clean up for dinner.  We then went Home &amp; Visiting Teaching to Sister Leah
Neilson.  From there we went to the Jones for our FHE Study Group.  After that
we went over to visit Bob and while there Mae gave Bob a haircut.  We had a
good time visiting with him.  It was 9:30 when we got home.  I filled in this

Bishop Mullins talked to Mae and I after we finished with the cleaning of the
building and asked me if I would accept a calling of Ward Mission Leader.  He
asked us to talk it over and pray about it before we made the decision.  Bishop
Mullins let me take the hand book of instructions to read the duties and
responsibilities associated with that calling.  That is one calling that I have
never had.  It was about 10AM when we got home.  I worked on the house getting
black pipe for the gas line to the new water heater.  I had to make three trips
to Durk’s but the nice thing is the West Haven store is only ¾ mile north of
us.  I also went to Home Depot for some materials.  I quit and cleaned up about
5PM.  After showering I took out to eat at Sizzler’s in Layton.  Mae read the
Handbook of Instructions pertaining to Ward Mission Leader as we drove to and
from the restraint.  After returning home I helped Mae with some of the dinner
preparation for tomorrow.  David and his family are coming for dinner with us. 
David asked Mae I she might fix peach cobbler for desert, so we stopped at the

and our food storage.  When I got up I tried to let her sleep but she soon
woke.  She was quite discouraged over our bills and so that depressed me. 
David called and wanted me to call him back.  At the time he called I was under
the trailer trying to figure out what to do with our heat ducts.  I called him
back and he said that the Church leader,  Elder Christofferson, made a
statement to the press that the Church is changing their views on homosexuals
and same sex marriages.  I looked up the article on the computer in the Salt
Lake Tribune and at first glance you might get that opinion but when you read
the total article it didn’t indicate any such action.  It is discouraging that
David would think such a thing.  I called David back and talked to him about
the article.  I hope he has a better understanding now.  I think it went ok
with him.  I worked on the trailer most of the day.  I did go into Peterson
Medical and they said that I need a new mask but my machine is working fine. 
They told me that I should get a new mask every 3 to 6 months.  They will send
a report to Dr. Lee and if he will approve the order they will have it
delivered to my house.  I decided that I would repair the shower before putting
the sheet rock on the walls.  I am glad I did as I am going to have to change
the complete shower control and head.  It is sure tempting to tear the shower
completely out and rebuild a new one.  I estimate that it will cost $500 to
rebuild it so I guess that I will live with what we have.  I am very tired and
quite discouraged this evening.  I did fill our water storage barrels and they
seem to have all the fittings secure.  That was good to find out.  I got the
flue for the water heater ran through the roof.  I had hoped that I could have
got tile base ran around the wall so that tomorrow I could grout that room
tomorrow but the shower problems cost that timing.  </p>

Mae and I slept pretty good last night.  After breakfast I went to work on the
trailer and Mae worked on the yards.  I was most of the day getting the shower
in the north bathroom ready for sheet rock.  I was unable to get the present
shower faucet apart and had to just replace it.  I found that the water lines
had been hooked up backwards so I corrected that also.  I added some blocking
to make the fiberglass more ridged and also added a grab bar inside the shower. 
I decided to install the old shower head that I had brought from Clinton into
the other tub and shower.  In doing so I bent the shower neck so had to go back
to Durk’s for a new shower neck.  I took the old shower tap from the north
bathroom down to see if there was a way to get it apart as the shower tap in
the other bath also needs to be repaired.  Durk’s had a tool that would hook to
tap and with that we were able to jerk it apart.  We looked for part that would
fit that tap but Durk’s doesn’t carry part to fit that unit.  They suggested
that I go to Jerry’s Plumbing Specialty and he might have parts for that unit. 
That store was closed before I could get there.  I will have to try again
tomorrow.   I came home and showered, quickly ate some dinner and we went to
our study group.  I upset Mae again tonight because I say too much.  It upsets
me that she keeps pocking me to tell me not to talk so much.  Being poked quite
upsets me.  I am not sure how to handle the situation.  After the class we went
shopping at Winco for a few items.  I returned some of the extra tile that I
didn’t need to Lowe’s and also paid the balance on my account.  It was almost
11PM when we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was quite depressed when we went to bed last night and woke a little before
4AM, still feeling quite depressed.  I read for a while in the scriptures but
the depression continued.  I laid in the recliner and occasionally dosed for a
few minutes.  I finally got back up at 6:30.  Mae woke at 7AM and soon stated
breakfast.  Depression was quite heavy and I had a hard time eating but as the
depression relieved I went to work on the house.  I removed the toilet in our
bath and started adding some blocking to the walls to hold them straighter and
give areas for hanging fixtures.  I then started sheet rocking.  About 12:45PM
we stopped for a little lunch to hold us over until 2PM when Bishop and Sister
Mullins are coming for dinner.  Mae had everything ready at 2PM but no one
showed up.  I finally called and they had got busy with other concerns and had
forgotten the appointment.  They got here about 1:20PM and we had a very
enjoyable dinner and a visit with them.  Most of our conversation was centered
on our families and they along with us have problems with their family’s
becoming inactive in the Church.  Bishop Mullins expressed his opinion that
within the next few years up to 50% of those now married in the Temple may
become inactive and leave the Church.  Oh! How I pray that I can remain
faithful until the end.  Mae attended choirs practice this evening.  I fell
asleep in the recliner for a while.  After Mae returned home I called Roy and
visited with him for a little while.  Mae and I then watched the “Story of
Ruth” on Netflix before going to bed.</p>

both slept quite well last night.  That is something that I had never given
much thought about and on occasions when there was special concerns and
worries, sleeping well was just accepted but now it is more to think about. 
With our bathroom being torn apart we have to again share one bathroom.  After
breakfast of waffles I got to work on sheet rocking, and then getting the
border tile around the utility room.  We got interrupted by a salesman trying
to sell us an alarm system.  It sounded good but we still don’t feel that we
can afford it.  After he left I cleaned the tile and put my tools away.  I put
a new tub faucet on the small path room tub as the old one is so corroded with
hard water minerals that it will not work correctly.  While I worked on the
house Mae set out to clean all the windows in the house.  She succeeded to
clean most of them bus gave up before completing them all.  Also we found that
the windows in our bedroom are a cheap double pain window and has moisture and minerals
trapped between the two pains.  I am afraid that those windows will have to be
replaced in order to get them clean.  After dinner we went HT/VT to the
Hilton’s and had a nice visit with them.  We tried to visit the Siglin’s but
they were not home.  Mae had visited with them the other day.  Brother T J
Jones came over and we discussed our F.H.E. lesson plan.  Mae made arrangements
to meet Scott tomorrow morning in Clearfield to get Mishelle’s shower gift and
then Mae will meet Shauna in Riverdale to ride with them to Sierra’s baby
shower in Orem.  As it was now 9PM we had time to do some studding in “Jesus
the Christ” but had to have the dictionary handy to understand many words.  We
were almost 1 ½ hours reading ½ of a chapter.  We are now going to bed as I
will go to the chapel at 8AM to clean.</p>

Warehouse in Riverdale.  Mae road down to American Fork with Shauna and Emily. 
I worked on the house grouting the tile floor in the utility room.  I then got
something for lunch and took a short nap before putting the sheetrock on the
arches in the bathroom.  I finished just as Mae got home.  We then got some
dinner and got ready for our evening session of Stake Conference.  The meeting
was very good.  Because tomorrow is President Alan Hall’s Birthday Anniversary,
they had refreshments in the cultural hall after the meeting.  We stayed for
that and visited for a little while.  We were going to watch a show but just as
it started, Sister Shirley Olsen called and talked with Mae until the show was
about over.  I watched “Kiss them for me” with Carrie Grant.  It was a fair
show but not one of his best.  </p>

I worked on my journal while Mae did her hair.  We picked up Brother Fred
Amundson and took him to Stake Conference with us.  Conference was very good
but I had trouble with my hearing and understood only part of the speakers. 
About 20 minutes before conference ended I got a cramp in my right leg.  I
wasn’t in a position where I could stretch it out but just had to set there and
wiggle in my chair.  When the meeting ended I was able to stand and it seemed
to feel better but as we started to walk out I got quite dizzy for a few
minutes.  Mae got us some dinner after we got home.  After dinner I took a nap
and read from the New Testament (Made Easy by David J. Ridges).  I really enjoy
reading with his interpolations and explanations added.  This evening I went to
Brother and Sister Ray’s home and helped Lynn give Marianne a blessing as she
is going into the hospital in the morning for some bone grafting.  They sure
are having a lot of health trials.  After coming home I cooked us an egg omelet
for super.  It is only 8:30 pm now but I am sure tired tonight.</p>

rained off and on throughout the day.  At 4:30PM we had two insurance sales man
come and explain how due to the Obama insurance program our insurance with
Coventry Health Care is going out of business.  They took almost 2 hours of our
time.  We didn’t change now and will keep what we have until we find that it
isn’t going to last.  We ate dinner and then I went back to work and didn’t
quite until after 9PM.  Mae took dinner down to the Ray’s this evening.

went to work on the first coat of sheetrock mud.  The arches took quite a
while.  I cut that air vents access hole into the door of the water room and
installed screens over the holes.  Before quitting this evening I installed the
water softener and then ask Tim next door to help me put the distiller and the
water heater into the water room.  I think I like that name better than the
utility room.  Mae had cooked fish and sweet potatoes for dinner and had extra
so we invited Tim to have dinner with us.  We enjoyed getting to know him a
little better.  After dinner I was quite tired but we read the notes to chapter
2 of Jesus the Christ.  We then watched the show on Netflix “1000 to 1” which
is a true story of Cory Wiseman.  It was very good.  I entered my journal and
we soon went to bed.  I sure love my sweet, wonderful, beautiful, special WIFE!

dried.  I left it and went to work getting the water heater and distiller
installed.  From there I started running water lines.  I am going to run copper
pipe through the flooring to a new supply valve so that I can quickly change
the water over to the new system.  It has been difficult as I have to go under
the house to be sure I can get the line ran without hitting other objects. 
Plus my drill bit is not long enough to reach completely through the cabinet as
well as the flooring.  I had to have Mae make a couple of trips to Durk’s
Plumbing for more parts.  It was about 6PM when I quite for dinner.  We ate
while we watched a movie on Netflix.  It was pretty good but I had trouble

the main water lines ran in also.  Mae went over to Jeff and Gail’s and tended
their children for them this evening while they went out.  Bishop Mullins
stopped by and asked me to consider calling Layne Johnson to assist me with my
calling as Ward Mission Leader.  Layne was the Ward Mission Leader but is under
a heavy load with his wife’s health.  Layne would know the Ward Membership

that we will have his company do the roofing.  They will have it done in one

I have often thought that I probably felt that way also.  I attended a Stake

to realize that the drain hose was leaking at the connection joint.  I added
some electrical tape to the hose and replaced it.  That is all it took to seal
the leak.  I probably lost about and hours time doing that repair.  As I was
thinking about the water lines I am running I realized that I had forgotten to
add in one mail line.  I had to cut an opening in the wall and add a line for
the cold water.  I got water lines ran to the kitchen sink area and the hooked
up water lines to the washer area.  Next I removed the supply lines to the
small bathroom sink and capped the old lines off.  I had to build a new bottom
to the bathroom vanity and ran into some problems with poor craftsmanship in
the building of the vanity.  I had to quite work and get ready for dinner as we
had the full time Missionaries to our place for dinner.  After dinner Mae and I
went over to visit Bob.  Just as we got to Bob’s room as Sister Ramona Heslop
came out of her room and asked for help.  She felt that she needed a Priesthood
Blessing and had been unable to reach any of her children.  As I didn’t have
any Consecrated Oil with me I called Irven and he came over and assisted me
