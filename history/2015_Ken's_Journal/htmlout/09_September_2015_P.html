<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
went to work at Mrs Hunsaker's until a little after noon.  I then went down to
Randy's and we got his things packed along with my items and left for Deep
Creek Reservoir in Idaho.  The wind came up and made it hard to control the
boat.  Randy caught 1 nice fish that I fileted when we came to the dock for the
night.  Mae had sent me enough food and Randy had also brought food so we just
ate and went to bed on the boat benches.  The stars were bright and beautiful
to see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at I:30 am and the moon was up about ¾ size.  The wind had died down until
the water was perfectly calm.  I really thought of starting the boat up and try
fishing at night, but then I had two thoughts, 1<sup>st</sup> was it was illegal
and 2<sup>nd</sup> would it wake Randy?  I finally did go back to sleep and
woke up before 6am.  This time I started the boat up and fished.  Randy did
sleep until almost 8am.  By then I caught two rainbow trout, both the same
size, 21” long and quite heavy around the middle.  Both of them really put up
quite a fight and were so fun to bring them in.  I then caught a 3<sup>rd</sup>
fish that was fair size but not equal to the first two.  This time Randy woke
up so he also started fishing.  The wind soon came up and that really kept me
busy trying to guide the boat and help Randy with baiting his hook.  The wind
kept getting stronger.  Randy finally caught a fair size fish.  It was almost
noon so we went into the dock.  I cleaned and filleted the fish hoping that the
wind would let up.  We finally loaded up and came home.  It has been a fun trip
but I am sure tired.  I thought I was going to get home in time to go to our
study class but Randy had me help him get quite a few things out of his boat. 
When I got home I quickly took a shower and changed and got to the study group
by 6:30pm.  When we got home we got some dinner and watched a show on Netflix
before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up shortly after 7 am.  Mae cooked us some fish for breakfast and we then
got ready to attend the Ogden Temple.  We picked up Carrie Shaw to take with us,
but no one else came.  We had a wonderful session and then Carrie, Mae and I
went to the cafeteria and ate lunch.  From the Temple we drove up to the Health
store, where Nancy works, and purchased a couple of items.  We stopped at the
Good Earth Health to pick up my order for a case of cereal, but there was an
error on the order and we only got 1 box.  Because of the error, they gave us 6
boxes at a very good discount and will reorder a little later.  After getting
home Brother Lee Gifford called and said that he had some tomatoes ready for us
to pick.  I went to Wheelright Lumber and bought some materials for Mrs
Hunsaker's place.  We then picked the tomatoes, ate dinner, I filled in my
journal and we watched a show on TV before going to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn't sleep well so while she was up, she got my lunch and breakfast ready.  I
got up and with Mae's preparation, I got myself off to work.  Mae did go to
Kaden and Kaitlyn’s school for Grandparents Day.  She said that the twins were
excited when she came.  She then came over to Mrs. Hunsaker's, where I am
working.  From there she went up to Adam's Elementary where she picked up Ben,
Rachel and Matt and took them to Dinosaur Park.  By the time I finished, picked
up my tools and came home, Mae had gotten home and had dinner ready.  I am
really tired and hurting from 10 hours of work.  After eating I went in and
watched part of a BYU Girls Soccer game.  Ben, Matt, Mae and I played a game of
Rummy Cube.  Mae then got the children to bed.  I entered this entry, took a
shower and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                My I pod woke us at mid-night with an alarm
to inform us that Kim and Georgia's Birthdays are coming up.  I couldn't get
back to sleep so got up and slept a while longer in the recliner.  I again woke
and so went back to bed in our bed.  We woke at 7am to get the children ready
as Jeff was coming to get them at 9am.  He came early and spent a few minutes
with us, and ate breakfast with us.  I needed to put some capsules together, so
while doing so, I turned the TV on.  It was a replay of a BYU foot ball game. 
We enjoyed watching it.  This afternoon I went over to Mrs Hunsaker’s and got
my case of nails, as I will need them at Scott's on Monday.  I stopped and
visited with Bob.  Before I left, Bob told me that he has decided that he will
not move somewhere else.  I also watched the BYU vs Nebraska football game.  I
was about ready to leave, because there was only 2:50 minutes left of the game
and Nebraska was controlling the game, but as I started to leave, I thought
that I should stay and watch the end of the game.  I was glad that I did
because with only seconds left on the clock BYU threw a final pass for a touchdown,
winning the game with 1 second on the clock.  When I got home Mae had received
a text from Shellie informing us that Nora delivered a baby boy about 5:30 PM
Arizona time.  Both the mother and boy (Damon Bryce) are doing well.  That will
make our 10<sup>th</sup> Great-Grandchild.  He weighed just under 10 lbs and
seems to be healthy, and from the picture on the phone he has lots of hair.  I
got a call from Darma Cosper asking if I could come over and help their son
give Jimmy a Priesthood Blessing.  Afterwards, their son and I went down to
Sister Jeneane Browning’s and gave her a blessing.  Mae had dinner ready when I
got home.  After eating,  I worked on my journal.  I have still been in quite a
bit of pain especially in my legs today.  I set down in the recliner this
afternoon and fell asleep.  Sandi came and we had dinner about 5 PM.  Mae had
cooked yams, squash and fried fish.  That, along with a tossed salad and bisquits,
made a nice meal.  After dinner we went over to the park where Sandi threw
balls for her dog to fetch.  We enjoyed visiting while Sandi kept the dog
running.  After returning home I made some pop corn and we cut up some water
melon.  We enjoyed that as we played a game of Trans America, which I won.  Mae
and Sandi took the dog for a walk.  While they were gone, I added this entry. 
We sure enjoyed having Sandi here with us this evening and to add to that she
stayed the night with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, September 7, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today is Labor-day, so being a holiday I
didn't go to work at Mrs Hunsaker's.  I slept until 7am then I started
breakfast.  Mae came in and fried the fish and I made an egg omelet.  It was
nice to have Sandi here.  She got up and took her dog for a run and got back
just about time for breakfast.  We enjoyed breakfast and I changed clothes for
work.  Sandi would like to go fishing so I can show her how to clean &amp;
fillet fish.  We decided that we might try going on October the 3<sup>rd</sup>. 
Maybe we could go up the evening of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and camp over.  I went
over to Scott's, but it was almost 11am before I got there.  We worked until
after 5pm and then picked up tools.  It was almost 7pm when I got home.  Mae
had dinner ready.  Mae told me that Jeff stopped by on his way up to Idaho. 
She said he is quite depressed and concerned about his job and the house they
have bought.  Mae also talked to Pat Bradfield this morning.  Her Bishop is
getting her some new eye glasses, although Pat felt bad that she has to have
help from the Bishop to get them.  She is also very depressed with the way life
is going for her.  Her health is very bad and she has very little financial
income.  After eating dinner, I filled out this journal entry.  I then took a
shower and we were going to read from Jesus the Christ for this week’s reading
assignment, however, it got too late so we just went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, September 8, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We woke, but both of us were so tired that
we had a hard time getting up.   I did make it to work for Mrs. Hunsaker by
8am.  I got the flooring finished and moved the cabinets into the kitchen.  The
sink cabinet is in need of some serious repair.  We read in our book of “Jesus
the Christ” tonight.  We had dinner and the time went fast and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, September 9, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked at Mrs. Hunsaker.  Mae wanted me to
stop on the way home and talk to Bob but there just wasn't any place where I
could park with the pickup and trailer.  When I got home, I took a shower and a
nap.  Mae had a nice chicken/vegetable soup made for us and also some delicious
biscuits to go with it.  We went to our study group at the Jones, and after
getting home; I watched the show “The Restoration” while Mae talked on the
telephone to David, Jeff and Barbara Green, the other counselor in the R.S.
presidency.  We watched a few minutes of the BYU Women's Volleyball game before
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, September 10. 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went into work again at Mrs. Hunsaker's, I
got the cabinets just about installed.  That will allow her to get the linoleum
to be ordered as well as the cabinet top.  She can then have a plumber install
the kitchen sink.  I will now start on the basement bathroom and shower.  I was
so busy trying to get the last of the cabinets set that I forgot the time until
it was after 3PM.  Mae called and was down to Randy's getting a treatment.  I
went over and picked Bob up.  We are going to have him cook liver and onions
for dinner this evening.  I helped him with the cooking and Mae is having a
chicken burrito for her dinner.  It was really good although we were out of
ketchup.  There are onions left over so I will have them for breakfast in the
morning.  Mae had Choir Practice this evening so I took her over to the church
and then took Bob home.  When I got home, I turned on the Show “The Robe”. 
When Mae got home she also watched it with me.  It is now late so we will soon
got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, September 11, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked at Mrs. Hunsaker's today.  After
getting home this evening, I decided to take Mae out to eat.  Bishop Mullins
had called earlier today to see if I had a sewer line snake.  I called him and
he had solved his problem.  We visited for a few minutes and I invited he and
his wife to join Mae and I for dinner out.  They accepted, and so Mae and I
picked them up and the four of us went out to Golden Corral in Ogden.  We had a
very enjoyable time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, September 12, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went over to Scott's at 8am and helped
Scott put the decking on their back patio porch.  It was 4pm when I left to
come home.  We had the job just about completed except that we ran out of
screws and Home Depot will have to special order them.  When I got home Mae had
the car just about packed.  I quickly showered and we were soon off to
Kimberly, Idaho where Jeff and Gail now live.  Gail and the kids are there just
for the weekend and then they will be returning to her mothers in Layton.  She
has some Doctor appointments for the children that they had previously arranged
for.  It was after 7pm when we arrived there.  The home is certainly a nice
home on an acre lot.  It will be a job to keep it up.  We sure had an enjoyable
evening being with the family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, September 13, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We had a very enjoyable morning and drove
around the area just to see the sights.  We got back to their home in time to
get ready for Church meetings.  We found out after, that we had attended the
wrong Ward and the their Ward starts at 9am.  Both Mae and Gail had looked up
the starting time on LDS.org, and both showed that the two wards started at
1pm, but the information was in error.  We really feel it was the error if the
Church, an oversight.  The rest of the day was spent mainly just enjoying being
together.  Gail and the children left this evening to return to her mother’s
home in Layton.  Jeff took Mae and I for a ride around the area to see the
river.  At one point Jeff pointed out some young men that were preparing to
jump off the Twin Falls bridge with parachutes.  Jeff said that this bridge is
one of two Bridges in the United States in which it is legal to jump off.  We
parked and waited to see them jump.  The men walked to the center of the
bridge, climbed over the railing and jumped.  After jumping, they have 2
seconds in which to pull the jump cord, and then guide the parachute to a safe
landing approximately 485 feet below.  It was very interesting to see the 6 men
make that jump.  After returning home, Mae, Jeff and I enjoyed playing a game
of Hearts before we went to bed.  Mae won that game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, September 14, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae and I got up in time to prepare
breakfast of fish and eggs for breakfast.  Jeff left for work before 8am.  I
installed the Washer and dryer for them.  We relaxed and enjoyed being
together.  I removed the wand of the kitchen faucet and found that it needed
cleaning from a calcium buildup.  It required a special tool in order to remove
the faucet screen and so we drove to Twine Falls, where I had called a plumber
supply co and they thought that they had what we needed.  We ended up going to
four companies before we found that we had to order the tool we needed.  I had
called Durk's Plumbing and Jared suggested that we clean the wand by soaking it
in vinegar overnight.  That is the choice we made.  Jeff worked late not
getting home until 7:30pm.  Mae cooked a nice chicken dinner and after eating
and cleaning up, we again played a game of Hearts and Mae again won that game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, September 15, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We again had a nice breakfast before Jeff
went to work.  After cleaning up, Mae and I got our car packed and left for
Pocatello.  We stopped at Chubbick to see Terry and Angela.  We were there
until 11:30am, and then drove out to Lois's and visited there for a little over
an hour before we started for home.  Mae drove until we got to the Devil's
creek exit at which I drove on home.  We had a couple of traffic delays due to
road construction and arrived home at 3:30pm.  Mae had to hurry to get to her
meeting at 4pm.  I spent an hour catching my journal up to date.  This evening
Mae and I played a couple of games of Rummy Cube before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, September 15, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to work at Mrs. Hunsakers today.  I
stopped on the way at Universal Rental where I rented a concrete core saw plus
a circular saw bit to cut through the rim joist.  In order to line up the two
holes I used a small wood bit and drilled pilot holes through the rim joist and
then I used a small masonry bit to continue the pilot hole through the bricks. 
I could then use the pilot hole to line up the core saw.  While working on that
vent hole I noticed that the outside water tap was not a frost-less tap, so I
replaced that tap.  This afternoon Mae went up to David and Shauna's.  We will
stay there with their children while they attend a medical conference in
Washington D.C.  I will drive back and forth to work on Mrs. Hunsaker home.  I
thought that maybe I could put my trailer in her garage, so I checked the height
of the trailer by standing on the tail gate.  That was not quite high enough to
see down the top of the trailer so I decided that if I stood on the spare tire
I could see better.  I forgot that the spare tire is only held in place with
one bolt, therefore, when I stepped up on it, it turned and I fell, landing on
my back on the tail gate.  I was lucky as I could have landed on the jack and
that would have been quite serious.  I was ok so I finished the day.  This
evening we played some games with Emily and Conner.  Tyler was busy all evening
with school homework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, September 17, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mrs. Hunsaker had Gay Lucas from Giant
Carpet One come to measure for the Linoleum.  She also had another company come
to measure for the carpeting.  She had also gone to Dal-Tile to find the tile
for the downstairs bathroom.  They won't sell to me as I don't carry a contractor’s
license.  Before leaving this afternoon, I thought about calling Gay and they
can buy from Dal-Tile, so I ordered the tile through her.  This evening was a
relaxing evening with the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, September 18, 2025</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae didn't sleep very well last night so the
kids and I got ourselves off to school and work.  Mae did have my lunch ready
and had cold cereal and fruit on the table for us.  I worked again at
Hunsaker's on the downstairs bathroom.  I really feel that we are trying to
make a silk purse out of a pig’s ear.  I hope I can get it to look good!  Again
this evening we had a relaxing evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, September 19, 2025</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke with my back really hurting.  I
called Dr. Toon to see if I could get in for a treatment, but they were out of
the office.  I thought of winterizing my boat and camper, but the winter
anti-freeze has not came in yet so I will let that wait for now.  This afternoon
we took Conner to a Soccer game he had to play in.  Just before we left their home,
Dr. Toone's office called and they said that I could come in at 4PM.  That will
work out perfect with Connor's game.  I took Mae and the kids to the game and
then I went into Dr. Toone.  He gave me a treatment and then I joined Mae and
the kids at the game.  Following the game we took the kids out to eat at
Chuck-A-Rama there in Bountiful.  David &amp; Shauna had left money for us to
do that.  We had a nice evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, September 20, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We sleph in until 7am, then Mae and I got up
and got ready to attend their Stake Conference.  Emily decided to go but wasn't
ready and so she told Mae and I to do so we wouldn’t be late, so we left without
her.  She said that she would walk down.  We saved her a seat but she never
made it.  The boys just didn't want to go.  I feel bad that the example of
their parents isn't what it should be.  I get pretty discouraged about Sandi
and my three sons.  I am sure thankful for Shellie and Mike.  Mae and I enjoyed
the conference, although I had trouble hearing some of the speakers.  This
afternoon Mae and I read from “Jesus the Christ”.  I am glad we have the study
group that keeps us reading to keep up, and I really do enjoy this book.  This
evening Mae and I took the dog for a walk.  Their dog is quite enjoyable, but I
still don't want one.  We played a game with Emily before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, September 21, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae didn't sleep well last night, but had
prepared cereal for breakfast and had my lunch ready.  I went to work at Mrs.
Hunsaker's.  David called Mae to let her know that their plane had mechanical
problems and they were going to have to stay another night.  I had brought part
of our belongings home but not all of them.  I decided to stay home and Mae
will stay there another night.  After getting something for dinner and
showering, I watched two shows on Netflix before going to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, September 22, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke at 5am and got my breakfast.  After
eating, I did the dishes and entered yesterdays journal entry.  I have missed
entering my daily journal entries some of the days, while we were up to David
and Shauna's, as we don't have a computer that we can take with us now.  Mae
came home, and on the way she brought me a lunch.  I also had her take my
pickup and go to Lowe's and get me some sheetrock for the shower.  She then
went to Costco for a few items. It was nice to have Mae home when I got there
this afternoon. This evening after getting home from work, I went back into my
journal and caught it up to date.  Mae and I went Home Teaching / Visiting
Teaching.  We visited with Harold Hilton but Evelyn is still in bed sick.  They
have sure had their share of sickness for a couple of months now.  We did stop at
Siglin's but no one was there.  When we went to the Ray's, Mariane wasn't there
but was suppose to be back in a few minutes, so we went home and they were to
call us when she got home, and we would come back.  She didn't call us until
after 8pm so we set it up, for us to visit them, tomorrow evening.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, September 23, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked at Mrs. Hunsaker's today.  After
returning from work, I took a shower.  I had hoped that I could take a short
nap, but Irven and Sandy came by.  They had been over to see Bob and stopped by
to get some items that Mae had bought for them when she went to Costco.  They
also wanted to get some distilled water from our unit.  They would like me to
go up to their new home and install their distiller for them.  Even though we
told them that we had the study group at our home, they stayed until Al Ervin
came, before they left.  We only had 5 of us tonight, but we still enjoyed
being together.  T.J. and De'Ann Jones are away this week so we hosted the
group tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, September 24, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke at 12:30am and couldn't go back to
sleep, plus I was afraid that I would wake Mae, so I went into the front room
and slept some in the recliner.  I again woke at 3am, but this time I went back
to bed in our room.  The alarm went off at 5am, but we cuddled for a little
while.  I sure love my sweet wife.  I had to hurry when we did get up, and I
left for Hunsaker’s about 20 after 7 and went down to Wheelwright Lumber for
some material.  I had to buy another box of cedar.  That makes 3 boxes that I
am using.  I was able to use every piece of it, and just had enough to do the
job.  I really had to carefully place each piece, and even had to cut two bad
sections out and reshape some boards, but I ended up just having enough to do
the job.  I started placing the trim that I made yesterday.  At 2:30 I quickly
quit and went into Ogden to Dial Tile to get the tile I had ordered.  I called
Mae, as I knew that she was going into the Home Depot area, and so I asked her
to stop and pickup some Quick Set for me.  When I got home I took a shower and
got ready to go to a class on Church History.  Mae had dinner in the cock pot
so I got that ready and set the table so that when Mae got home, we could
quickly eat.  Mae was later than she wanted to be, and Sister Glory Gifford
stopped to get her for choir practice, earlier that we thought she would, so
Mae didn't get to eat with me.  I ate and cleaned up, and then I took a short
nap.  I picked Mae up at the chapel about 10 to 7 and we went to the class at
the High School Seminary building.  It was very enjoyable but I was sure
tired.  After getting home, I entered this entry before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                 I worked all day tileing Mrs. Hunsaker's
shower in the basement bathroom.  Mae hadn't slept very well last night so we
had her sleep in a little longer this morning.  As a result, we just had a
quick breakfast and I left for work.  Mae had other errands to do this morning
so she brought my lunch over to me.  I was so busy that I didn't have time to
stop to eat, so Mae fed me my lunch while I worked.  It was 3pm when I finished
and then cleaned up my tools.  When I got home I was very tired.  Mae went to
choir practice this evening and I picked her up at 6:45pm and we attended a
class held at the Roy High School Seminary on the history of the Prophet Joseph
Smith.  It was very good.  I was sure tired when we got home and we soon went
to bed.  (**Mae – this is wrong as he has entered this both for Thursday &amp;
Friday.  It happened on Thursday)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, September 26, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke with a dream that someone had taken
my wallet and had taken my bank card and credit cards.  It woke me and I
realized that Mae had found my wallet on the seat of my truck yesterday, when
she brought my lunch.  She had put it out of sight and when I woke I wasn't
sure if I had brought it into the house yesterday when I got home.  I got up
and took the flash light out and checked the pickup.  It was not there and so I
came back in, but before waking Mae up, I looked with the flash light and found
my wallet with everything in it, on my night stand.  I didn't want to wake Mae
so instead of getting back into bed, I went into the front room and slept a couple
of hours in the recliner.  We had a quick breakfast and then left to go out to
Grantsville for Nathan's baptism.  Chelci and the Primary Presidency had made
it a special experience for Nathan.  Nathan's cousin gave the Baptismal talk. 
He was just baptized himself a couple of weeks ago.  He did a very remarkable
job, as good as any adult I have heard.  Another thing that was cute, is that
while Steve and Nathan were changing out of their wet clothes, Sandi was
tending the twins, and Chelci went back to give Nathan some help, Addie began
to cry.  Mae asked her what the problem was and she said she was crying because
she didn't have anyone to sit with.  Mae hugged her and said she wished we had
noticed earlier and we would have loved to have her sit with us.  Following the
Baptismal service everyone was invited to Chelci and Steve's home for a brunch
in honor of the occasion.  When we started to eat, the twins came to Mae to
feed them.  Then when Chelci got them in their high chairs, they still wanted
Mae to feed them.  It was a fun event and Chelci had made it special for Nathan. 
When Mae and I returned home, we took a short nap and then got started on
putting up 21 quarts of Spaghetti sauce.  I kept the sauce cooking and cleaned
up the dishes, while Mae attended the Women's Conference.  After Mae got home,
we finished canning the sauce, then Mae cut my hair, we took our showers and
watched a show on Netflix.  I entered this entry before we went to bed about
12:30am.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, September 27, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We slept in this morning and I got us some
breakfast while Mae did her hair.  We enjoyed the meetings today and I am
always grateful that I have the Light of the Gospel as a guide in my daily
life.  I am continually depressed that Sandi, David, Scott and Jeff have become
weak in their testimonies of the Gospel.  Mae was set apart, after the block
meetings, in her new calling as Ward Historian.  During that blessing Bishop
Mullians admonished her to keep faith in our children and the day would come
that they would return.  I sure pray for that day and hope that it happens
before I leave this life.  This afternoon we had David and his family come for
dinner.   Besides a wonderful meal, we had a wonderful evening being with their
family.  David and Shauna brought a gift for Mae and one for me for our staying
with their children while they were in Washington D.C.  They gave Mae a very
nice silver plate with a stand.  There is an engraving that depicts several of
the national monuments in the Washington D.C. area, on the plate.  They got me
a nice reversible jacket with Washington D.C. printed on it.  That was special
of them.  We enjoyed our visit with them this evening.  After they left, we
went outside to see the super mooner eclipse.  Kim called to see if we had seen
it for he also had gone out to see it.  He said that this won't happen again
for 30 years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, September 28, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                While Mae was getting breakfast, I took off
the betting and placed the mattress cover in the clothes dryer on tumble.  I
then rotated the mattress.  Mae came in and helped me.  We then replaced the
mattress cover and put on clean sheets and pillow cases.  Mae had prepared hot
cakes for breakfast using the last of yesterday’s fruit salad.  I left for
work, but forgot to bring the cleaning towels, for grouting the tile I had
installed on Friday.  I called Mae and was going to have her bring them to me,
but decided to grout the tile tomorrow.  I worked on the closet doors, having
to cut the doors and restyling them, plaining door jambs and cutting the doors
to size.  It required many trips up and down the stairs and by the time I had
finished, I was sure tired.  I stopped and visited with Bob, explaining to him
how Mae had slipped up and told Stacy and Grant that Bob was going to give
Becky and Mark his clock.  Bob wondered how they found out, but said it really didn't
matter to him.  He said that he would go in with us on a gift and then later,
he would still like them to have his clock.  Mae had a nice dinner ready when I
got home and cleaned up.  I took a nap after dinner and then we studied the
questions for our study group.  I filled this entry out and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, September 29, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked again at Mrs. Hunsaker's today.  I
spent some time trying to find out where the water is coming from.  I removed
the cedar ceiling and cut away some of the sheetrock.  I then removed the
insulation that I had placed there.  I found that the water was coming from the
pipe joints where I had installed the frost free tap.  It then leaked onto the
insulation which acted as a wick transferring the water almost 3 feet away.  I
will have to redo the piping with liquid Teflon in hopes that the joints will
seal this time.  I am going to also replace the cedar on the ceiling.  I did
get more of the trim cut and placed.  When I quit for the day and started the
pickup to leave, the engine died and would not restart.  I had to have Mae come
and get me.  I called Scott and he met me back at my pickup.  We towed the
pickup over to Dee's Service and left it for them to check it out.  I then
traded Scott our car for the use of his pickup so I could take my tool trailer
home.  It was after 8pm when I got home for dinner.  After eating, Mae and I
watched a show on Netflix before going to bed.  Neither of us slept very well
last night and it is now 10:30pm, so I hope we will sleep better tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, September 30, 2015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I used Scott's pickup today.  I worked at
Mrs. Hunsaker's and repaired the leak.  It was coming from the new pipes that I
had installed, so because it was my fault, I didn't charge for today’s time,
nor for the package of cedar that I had to have to replace the ceiling in the
shower.  I used the liquid Teflon on each of the joints and they sealed this
time.  Dee's Auto Care called me and they will check out my pickup and let me
know.  This evening after showering, we had dinner.  We then went to our study
group, following that we went to the Ray's Visiting Teaching and Home
Teaching.  We walked, as we are letting  Scott use our car, but it was a nice
walk. </p>
