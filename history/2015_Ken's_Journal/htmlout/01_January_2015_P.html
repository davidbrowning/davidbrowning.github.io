<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was after mid-night when we went to bed.  We had got another E-Mail from Grant
concerning Bob’s life insurance.  Again this left me with concerns that left me
thinking about it most of the night, as a result I didn’t sleep very well.  I
upset Mae before going to bed so that kept her up until early morning.  When I
got up I wrote Grant a letter that I hope we calm them down.  I don’t know what
they are planning but I have got to just let it go.  While Mae was up during
the night she took most of the Christmas decoration down.  After breakfast I
had Mae read over the letter that I had written.  She made a few minor
corrections but liked the letter.  I called Kim and read the letter to him and
after reading it I asked if I should sent a copy to his supervisor at
Beneficial Life Insurance Co.?  He didn’t feel that it was necessary, so
didn’t.  With Mae’s help we took the tool trailer down to the storage lot and
brought Garf’s trailer back with us.  I will try to get it unloaded tomorrow. 
I called Bob to let him know that we would come over to see him but he said
that he was going out to eat with Irven and Sandy.  I talked to Irven and we
decided to go with them.  They drove over and picked us up at 6:20PM and we
went to Chuck-A-Rama in Ogden.  We enjoyed the meal but especially being
together.  After returning home Mae and I watched the VHS, “We are on Our
Own”.  Although we have seen it before we still really enjoyed the movie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke shortly after 4AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so I decided that I would
work on my talk.  I was cold so I lay in the recliner for a few minutes with
the heater and a blanket and I fell asleep.  Mae and I spent most of the day
unloading the trailer and deciding what to keep and what to give away.  It
really made me almost sick to see all that we are getting rid of.  We are
arranging most of the things we are keeping onto the shelves in the shed.  The
day was clear and calm but very cold.  We were glad to find several items that
we were not sure where they had been put.  It became too cold to work out side
any longer so we came inside.  We had to go down to Costco for some pictures
Mae had printed.  After dinner I worked on my talk for Jan. 11, 2015.  Mae has
her talk almost ready.  By 10:30PM we decided to go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up early and did some studying on my talk trying to decide how to pull what
if find in some of the Ensign’s articles into one area so that I can massage
what I want for my talk.  After breakfast I went to work on unloading the
trailer and organizing what we want stored into the shed.  I took several boxes
of items into the house for Mae to sort thru.  By 4:30PM we had everything out
of the trailer and most of it sorted through.  We were able to find several
items that we have wondered where they were.  I especially have to mention that
we have found Mae’s jewelry case.  She has worried about that for a week or
more.  We also found my heavy warm boots.  I believe that we have the shed
fairly well organized with a system so that we can find what we are looking
for.  I took a small load of trash to the dumps, I then took Garf’s trailer
back to their house.  They were not home so I started to put the trailer into
their back yard.  However the snow made it impossible for me to back the
trailer up.  it didn’t help that there was a pile of snow that had been
shoveled from their drive way, right in the path where I had to back the
trailer.  I was doing ok until the truck tires reached the snow and then they
would just spin.  A neighbor came over and asked if I needed help.  He
suggested that we use his four wheel drive pickup.  We did that and were able
to get the trailer put into the back yard.  I sure appreciated the young man’s
help.  I next went over to Winegars grocery store and bought some filtered
water.  From there I went over to visit Bob.  He is doing pretty good but he
sure wants out of that place.  I think the main problem is that he feels that
he has no control over his life.  In visiting with him it looks like Stacy is
demanding full control of his situation and gets upset if any one darers
challenge her.  Bob told me that Stacy told Grant that I just wanted to get
Bob’s money.  Bob wants the Power of Attorney taken back so he has some
control.  He wants me to take him out to the base where he hopes to get some
legal counsel.  I told Bob that I would talk to his children and to Irven and
Sandy plus Mae.  I would then get back with him and if he still wants to go to
the base I would take him.  After getting home I talked to Mae about the
situation.  I also talked to Robert about the situation as well as I tried to
call Bruce.  I suggested to Robert that they should also include Kathy in this
decision.  I entered this journal entry and cut Mae’s hair before she took her
shower.  As I have thought about the situation with Bob I feel that my name
should be taken off the policy as beneficiary and change it to go to all living
siblings equally.  The money isn’t worth feelings.  It is now 11:30PM and I am
tired.</p>

were able to sleep in this morning as our Ward now starts our meeting at 11AM. 
However Mae didn’t sleep much mainly worrying about this situation with Bob. 
She got about 4 hours sleep and that was interrupted.  Meeting went very well
and the testimonies were very Spiritual.  I had gone to meetings without
putting a handkerchief in my pocket and I sure needed it.  I was able to
circulate the sign-up sheets for the Ceiling Session in Priesthood meeting and
also in Relief Society.  We have a good group that signed up to go this coming
Thursday.  I spent quite a while making sure that we will be ready for
Thursday.  Mae and I have spent time today studying both individually and
together.  Kim called and we discussed some of the insurances regulations.  I
also visited with Irven and Sandy concerning Bob.  Robert also contacted me and
we visited for a while.  This concern for Bob has taken up some time.  I worry
about how we should handle his situation.  It is now getting late so we had
better get to bed.</p>

did sleep well last night and especially Mae, which I am sure grateful for.  I
prepared breakfast while Mae started the washing and did her exercises.  I
stopped at the store for Mae and then picked up Irven.  We visited Bob and I
hope we were able to encourage Bob to try harder to enjoy the Assisted Living
where he is.  I really believe it is the best for him. I got home about time to
leave to take Gail’s Birthday gift to her.  We just had time to drive back to
Garf’s and go out with them to eat.  They told us that it would be with friends
but I didn’t realize that there would be 11 of us.  Ron insisted that he pay
for Mae and my dinner, including the tip.  We really enjoyed the group.  They
were all members of the Ward in which Ron and Dian had lived when they served
as missionaries.  After we came back to Ron and Dian’s, we went into their home
and visited for about an hour.  It has been a very enjoyable evening.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning after breakfast I took the car to Murdock Chevrolet to be serviced and
checked.  I also had then do the Recall notice that we received a couple of
weeks ago.  I also reported that we were losing air in the left front tire. 
They found the problem there was a nail in the tire.  I took my laptop with me
so that I could work on my talk for Sunday.  K.O. walked through the waiting
room and I stopped him to inquire how his Father was doing.  He said that he
was doing well and that he was coming into the office this morning.  He said
that he usually came in about noon, but if he got here earlier he would let me
know.  A few minutes later K.O. returned and said that his father was there and
he wanted me to come and visit him in his office.  I just left my laptop on the
desk and went to Kent’s office.  We had a wonderful visit.  It was so good to
see him.  I don’t know how long we visited but by the time I left Kent, my car
was finished and they had been looking for me.  I stopped at the D.I. in
Centerville to drop off a few items and to look for a floor lamp.  They didn’t
have anything I liked.  I stopped at Jennies and got some pills for Mae.  I
then went to The Home Depot in Riverdale and picked up some parts I had
ordered.  While I was doing all this chasing, Mae went to the Church house to
help prepare lunches for a funeral.  She also attended Relief Society
Presidency meeting.  Mae had to drive my pickup as I had the car.  I spent the
evening working on my talk for Sunday.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

slept very well.  I spent most of the day working on my talk.  After lunch I
took a 15 minute nap, then Mae and I walked to the mail box to get the mail.  A
lamp that Mae ordered came in the mail, so when we got back home I opened it. 
I them mounted it above our picture of Christ.  I really like it there.  This
evening Mae and I attended Family Home Evening at the home of Brother and
Sister T.J. Jones.  We had two other couples there with us.  It was an
enjoyable time there.  We are going to try to hold these every Wednesday
evening.  I think I have finished my talk but I haven’t timed it yet.  I have
helped Mae a few times during the day.  She has been busy preparing for dinner
tomorrow evening with the Missionaries here.  </p>

got up at 6:45AM but time went fast.  After breakfast I worked on my talk and
helped Mae.  Mae and I  left a little after noon and picked up Brother Fred
Amundson and took him to the Temple with us.  We got to the Marquart road and
remembered that I didn’t bring ordnance cards of Sister Pirlet.  We turned
around and came back home but I couldn’t find them, so we went without them. 
We had a good group and a very enjoyable session.  When we got back home I
searched for the cards.  I finally used the flash light and started looking to
the sides of furniture and found them behind the computer desk door.  What a
relief.  We had the Missionaries over for dinner and that was an enjoyable
time.  This evening we set down and watched a show “The Underdogs” that was
very enjoyable.  It was taken from a real event.  When I started to shut down
the TV there was a documentary on.  It mentioned Mt. Helena and that caught my
attention.  The documentary was about volcanos; both Mae and I got interested
and watched it to the end.  It ended with Yellow Stone National Park with the
closing comments that “It will again erupt but no one knows when!”  </p>

woke at 4AM and was up for a few minutes.  I didn’t put my mask back on when I
got back in bed and I found that I couldn’t go back to sleep.  Then I noticed
that Mae was tossing some.  I put the mask back on and went right back to sleep
and woke at 7:45AM.  When I got up I noticed that Mae was in the front room
saying her prayers.  We had both slept pretty good.  We worked together getting
breakfast and then started on a few items, with the thought that we would go
back into the Temple and do those sealing’s for Sister Judy Pirlet that I
hadn’t done yesterday.  Then Bryce came by and we enjoyed visiting with him. 
We still thought that we could make it to the Temple.  Then Bishop Mullin
stopped by to thank us for arranging for the session yesterday and we discussed
some possible changes we might make so that our group can be together better. 
I think I need to discuss this with the Sealing Directors at the Temple.  While
we were visiting with Bishop Mullin, Shaunna (Mishelle’s sister) came.  She is
the nurse that comes to Judy Tassone who lives across the street.  Mae had
taken dinner to Judy last evening and when Shunna came this morning, Judy asked
her to return the dishes.  Of course when we recognized who it was there was a
short time to introduce her to our Bishop and visit for a minute.  Shaunna
certainly gave Scott a complement.   When Shunna left Bishop Mullin finished
and soon left.  Time slipped by and we decided that we would have to choose
another day to take the names to the Temple.  This afternoon soon slipped by. 
I brought my tool trailer up so that I can have my tools here to install the
threshold and seal on our shed door.  Scott is coming over to help me.  Mae and
I went to Jeff and Gail’s about 5PM to tend their children while Jeff and Gail
go out to dinner and to a movie.  When they came home the four of us played a
game of Hearts.  It was late when we got home and to bed.</p>

got up at 6:30AM.  After breakfast I started working on preparing the shed door
to install the threshold.  Scott came over and helped me take the door off and
put it on the saw horses so I could cut the door.  I bought some metal flashing
and used it to sear the raw wood on the doorway.  Scott came in the house and
helped Mae back up her files from the old computer.  We are concerned that that
computer is going to go out on us. Kylan and Kaden came over with Scott.  While
the rest of us was busy they walked down closer to the airport where they
watched the planes come and go.  After lunch Kylan and I re-hung the door.  We
sure appreciated Scott and Kylan’s help.  I repaired a picture frame for Mae
and installed a picture of the Salt Lake Temple in it.  I then hung it in our
front room.  Mae and I worked on our talks for tomorrow.  We both have to
shorten our information, due to the time.  We attended a basket ball game that
Connor participated in.  It was good to visit with David while we were there. 
When we returned home we both continued working on our talks.  At 9:30PM we
quit and started preparing for bed.</p>

arose early so that we could have time to study more on our talks.  We both
fasted this morning.  Our talks went well and many commented to us after
meeting about our talks.  Bishop Mullin was very pleased with my talk as there
was a couple there that he said the talk was definitely appropriate for them. 
We did fill the Spirit there and appreciated that.  Following church, when we
got home, we prepared waffles and eggs.  We went visiting some of the families
that we are assigned to visit as Visiting Teacher and Home Teacher.  We visited
Leah Neilson, Shirley Lemon and Lynn &amp; Marianne Ray before coming home as
Dennis &amp; Judy Patterson came visiting to us.  With the Patterson’s we decided
that in as much as we are assigned to each other that they would visit us odd
months and we would visit them on the even months and the one who visits will
give the lesson.  Later this evening we ate and then did some studying.</p>

repairs around the house.  At 11AM we went shopping for drapes.  We got home
just in time to meet with Irven, Sandy, Mark and Bob and go out to eat for
Bob’s Birthday.  We met Grant their and enjoyed the evening.  We came back to
our place where Irven and Sandy, Mark and Bob, and Mae and I played Canasta. 
Bob and Mark won but we all enjoyed the game.  It was good to see Bob do some
thinking, which showed me that Bob could do more if he would just try.</p>

This couple are one of the couples that live outside of our Ward but have been
called to help our Ward out.  Neither Mae nor I remember their names but we
enjoyed visiting with them.  We are not sure just why they came visiting.   Mae
had to excuse herself as she had Relief Society Presidency meeting.  They asked
about our mission callings and about our farming experiences.  I repaired the
card shuffler this afternoon and that was tricky.  I then brought the Kerosene
heater in and assembled it.  When I checked out the lighter I couldn’t get it
to work.  After Mae got back we went to Home Depot and bought some Kerosene, a
floor lamp and some light bulbs.  I came home and again worked on the heater
but finally gave up.  I will have to try to contact the company as I think I
have a default in the lighter coil.  When Mae got home we went out to visit
Harold and Evelyn Hilton, and then we stopped at Wendell Siglin’s but no one
was there.  We had a little dinner after getting home.  I worked on the heater
longer but still no luck.  I put our new floor lamp together and got it set up
in the front room.  I worked on my journal getting it up to date.  It is now

were expecting to have the power turned off this morning about 9AM.  Mae woke
me at 8AM as she had just got up herself.  I hurried and prepared egg omelet
for breakfast.  We had tried to make arrangement to go somewhere else after
having breakfast.  We were concerned about the house getting cold with the
power being off, but nothing seemed to work out, so we decided to just stay in
bed for a while.  The power never did go off but we enjoyed the morning.  After
getting up I called the company that handled the Kerosene heater and the girl
told me to clean up the power contacts on the battery.  I did that but it
didn’t help.  I then went to home depot and purchased some new batteries and
that solved the problem.  However as the power never did go off, I dissembled
the stove packing it back up and put it away.  This afternoon I went with Mae
to Heritage Park care center to see Helen Johnston, from out Ward.  She has
been there since April as she had a in her brain, which after having it removed
it left her paralyzed on the right side.  As I get acquainted with people in
our Ward, I am getting very depressed.  Getting old doesn’t look to exciting to
me.  We stopped at Winco and then at Winger’s before going home.  Scott and
Mishelle called and wanted us to tend the twins for a little while as they are
looking at a car to buy.  We were late again getting to the Jones for Family
Home Evening.  We had a good discussion.  After getting home I got some files
from the laptop backed up onto our external hard drive.  I also popped some
corn while backing up Mae’s pictures as they take a while to back up.  I caught
my journal up to date.  I played two games of Solitary, the first hand I moved
1 card before turning the deck and 2 cards on that turn and 1 card on the next
turn so I just closed it and started over.   It is about time for bed.  Good
night! </p>

both slept well last night.  After getting up we took our showers and got dressed
to attend the temple.  Mae tried to call Georgia, but no one answered.  She
then called and talked to JaNae.  We attended the 11:30AM Endowment Session and
after the session ended we went to the Sealing office, there we did a Sealing
Session getting 5 couples sealed for Sister Pirlet of our Ward.  We ate at the
Temple cafeteria for lunch.  After leaving the Temple we went to the Motor
Vehicle Registration office but we still need one signature before we can get
the title to the trailer.  On the way home we found the Joyce Hall Food Bank
where both Mae and I have volunteered to serve next week.  This evening I had a
fellow come by and buy my float tubs.  Mae reserved a room at The Home in Lava
Hot Springs for my Birthday.  This evening we watched a good movie on NETFLIX. 
Then they put a cartoon??? For the twins to go to sleep with.  I sure didn’t
think very much of that cartoon.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 2:15 thinking about Scott and Michelle’s bathroom floor and how to
finish it off.  I just dosed off and on until 7AM before getting up.  Mae soon
woke and helped me get some breakfast.  Then Kylan and I went down to the model
airplane airport where Kylan flew his airplane.  There were 6 to 10 older men,
most retired or close to it, that also came to fly their planes.  It is quite a
hobby for them.  I think it is quite special that they have taken Kylan, as
young as he is, into their group.  This afternoon I filled the space in Scott
and Michelle’s bathroom floor with the Plaster of Paris that I had left.  Mae,
Ashley and I played Raco but before we finished Scott and Mishelle came home. 
I was declared the winner as I was ahead when we quit.  Mae and I went over and
visited Bob for a little while.  While there Mae gave Bob a haircut.  We did
some grocery shopping and then went to the Wolfley’s where we got the signature
we needed on the Title application.  We stopped at Good Earth and bought a few
items and then came home.  As we drove from place to place this afternoon, Mae
read from the Ensign.  She read two articles that left me depressed.  I just
feel so badly that none of our children are very active in the Church.  Shellie
is trying the hardest but her marriage has sure been an anchor to her.  Sandi
sure struggles and seems very discouraged about her marriages, besides it seems
to me that she still wants to live worldly.  Mike is doing fair but I can’t
help but feel that his courier comes 1<sup>st</sup> in his life.  David and
Scott are on the line of being inactive.  And Jeff is bitter towards God and
the Church.  Mae heated up some stew that we ate for dinner.  Some of my
Grand-children are trying but others a struggling.  This is a tough world we
are living in.  Before going to sleep we took our showers and then watched the
movie “Charlie” and I was humbled and inspired by that beautiful story.  Life
might be hard but I know that God is in charge.</p>

well last night.  A lady called and wanted to purchase the china closet.  At
first she wanted us to lower the price but I let Mae talk to her and she told
her she that she didn’t feel she could.  The lady called back and talked to Mae
again and said that they would take it and they would be up here by 3:30PM. 
Mae felt bad that they are coming today.  I prepared breakfast of egg omelet.  
We attended our Ward meeting’s and they went very well.  I still received
comments about how well I did with my talk last week.  There was a baby in the
audience but she was pretty good and we do enjoy the reverence here in this
ward.  While Mae was preparing our lunch the couple came for the cabinet.  I
helped them load it and they seemed very pleased that they were able to get
it.  After lunch I contacted Sister Leah Neilson to see how she is feeling. 
Although it was by phone we had a good visit and she is filling better but the
Doctor felt that she should stay home.  She is still coughing but feels she is
getting over an upper respiratory infection.  Shellie called and I visited with
her for a few minutes as Mae was on the phone doing R.S. work.  When Mae
finished I gave the phone to her and I took a nap.  I slept for over an hour
but Mae was still on the phone with R.S. calling when I woke.  After meeting we
came home and had a grilled chicken and sweet potatoes tots.  This evening we
went over to Jeff and Gail’s.  Marcy also came over.  The five of us played
games.</p>

bathrooms today but I can’t find the parts.  I did change the air filters on
our furnace and wash the grill of the furnace.  Although I scrubbed the grill
in the bath tub with soap and hot water it still didn’t come clean.  Mae used a
spray cleaner and scrubbed each bar in the grill and it looks much better. 
This evening we had Ron and Dian Graf over for dinner.  Mae prepared a very
nice dinner of ham, funeral potatoes, toss salad and the pomegranate fruit
salad.  After eating we played a game of Mormon Bridge.  Dian won on the last

about them.  I then went over to the Catholic Joyce Hall Food Bank in West
Ogden.  I work their helping give food to the needy.  We had three of us from
our Ward volunteering today.  It wasn’t really very hard but I just sacked
oranges and gave them out.  One Brother that volunteers almost every day that
the Food Bank is open was 83 years old and has been a Bishop.  He told me that
most of the food was donated by privet groceries and he mentioned that a lot
came from Harmon’s.  Also on Friday after they have finished with the regular
patrons, that most of the perishables are that are left over are taken to a
school where it is distributed to children that wouldn’t otherwise have food to
eat over the weekend.  I was impressed with the program.  After getting home I
started to install one of the ventilator fans but I don’t like the way it
looks.  I am going to do some more checking.  Mae had been visiting this
afternoon but came back and got dinner on.  After dinner I helped clean up as
she went out again visiting with our Stake President’s wife.  She is the 1<sup>st</sup>
Counselor in the Stake R.S.  Because we are holding Ward Conference this
weekend, the Stake Relief Society Presidency are visiting with their Ward
Counterparts, Sisters in our Ward.  Sandi called and we visited for quite a
while.  Mae came home and wanted me to meet our Stake President’s wife, Sister
Jeanne Hall.  It was good to meet her.  Mae then visited with Sandi on the
phone.  I watched a show on Netflix, “The Quiet Man” starring John Wayne and
Marine O’Hara.  Half way through Mae came and joined me to see the last of it.

toast.  I helped Mae make some hand-outs for her Relief Society lesson next
week.  I had several phone calls this morning.  Mae got back up as she couldn’t
go back to sleep.  I went over to the Catholic Joyce Hall Food Bank in West
Ogden again today.  After coming home we went over to Kersley’s and found that
they have a fan motor that I think will fir our ventilator fans.  I wish that I
had taken the old unit with me.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  This
evening we attended the Study Group at Brother and Sister Jones.  Brother Jones
led the discussion and gave us an assignment.  I guess that I didn’t get a full

better when I do those exercises.  Scott came over for brunch this morning.  It
was his lunch and our breakfast but we sure enjoyed having him with us.  Mae
and I left about 11:45AM for the Temple and were up at the Sealing office by
12:15PM.  We had a list of all those expected at the Temple today.  Bishop and
Sister Mullin got there about 12:40 PM so they had the 4 of us start.  A little
later Brother TJ Jones was brought into the Sealing room with us.  We did
several Sealing of couples and several Sealing of children to parents.  All of
those that we did were ancestors of Bishop and Sister Mullin’s.  It was a
special day for all of us.  While I was waiting for Mae, Sandy came up to me.  She
and Irven had gone through a Endowment Session.  She said that Bob had another
Dizzy spell the other day.   After going to the Temple we went over to the
Motor Vehicle Registration to get our trailer home registered.  They couldn’t
get the old registration to come up on the computer and finally we had to go
home and get our bill of sale and bring back.  When the Lady at the Motor
Vehicle had filled out the form last time she invariantly had added one extra
number which made the form void.  She filled out another form making sure that
the number was correct but we now have to get it resigned!  We left and went to
The Home Depot and returned the bathroom ventilator fan’s as they won’t cover
the markings of the old fans.  We went to Kearsley’s in Clearfield, where we
bought just the fan motor.  We then stopped at Kent’s Market to buy just a
couple of items and ended up buying $49 worth of groceries.  From there we went
to Golden Corral and ate.  We enjoyed that.  We stopped and visited with Bob
for a few minutes.  He said that he was feeling some better but still is afraid
of the dizziness.  It was almost 9PM when we got home.  We are tired and so
will go to bed.</p>

take a nap but I couldn’t stop from coughing so the nap didn’t work out.  When

the materials for this week’s Study Group.  The topic for this week is prayer
and that covers a lot of area.  I am so grateful that somewhere in my youth I
felt the need to pray.  I do not believe I know where or when the desire came
to me, but I am so grateful for that privilege to know that there is a God who
is personal to me as well as everyone that has or will come to this earth or
even further than that, for we know that there are worlds without number to man
but each is known to God.  We watched another great show taken from a true
event titled “Abducted”.  It is interesting that we hear and see stories that
have such profound and deep meanings.  I find more and more reasons to be
grateful to God that He has reserved Judgment to Him.  I hope that I can always
try to remember that!  Mae is studying while I am finishing this entry.  It is

but then I quit for now.  I worked on my Diary getting 1971 completed.  I still
will need to do some editing on it but that is another one transcribed over to
the computer.  My goal was to have that done before the end of 2014 but the
move threw that target date off.  Mae cooked and took dinner to Lyndsay and
Darrell Wayment this evening.  Sister Andrus called to let us know that Brother
Becraft who lived just north of us, passed away this morning.   Mae went over
to visit with Mary, our neighbor who is a widow and was close friends with the
Becrafts, to let her know and she took some fruit salad over to her.  The
morning that we started moving into this trailer, was the morning that they
took Brother Becraft into the hospital suffering from a stroke.  This evening I
worked some time on my Diary retyping.  Mae also helped me edit what I have
expanded.  I can’t help but wonder if that work will ever be of any importance

spent some time visiting with the Relief Society and some shopping.  She is
also studying for her Relief Society lesson that she is to give this Sunday. 
It is amazing to me the hours that she puts into a lesson and the materials and
hand outs that she works on.  I guess that’s the reason the Sisters out shine
the Brothers in their lessons.  I am not sure that it is all necessary, but Mae
feels it is.  I am not feeling the best this afternoon, I watched a couple more
shows.  Mae came into the front room this evening, exhausted and set down.  I
asked her if she wanted to do something else or watch a show.  Mae said that
she would like to set down and watch a show.  We selected the Movie “That’s
what I am”.  It was an interesting show.  Then we noticed the show “Daniel” and
it caught our attention so we watched it.  It was very well presented and we
enjoyed that show.  It was late when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept fairly well last night.  Mae did exercises without me and I slept an
extra hour.   Mae got breakfast while I showered.  Mae worked on her lesson
again this morning.  At 12:50PM Mae went to the Chapel to prepare a luncheon
for the Funeral today.  I made up capsules of Phy-Alo as Mae had to make up our
pill boxes today.  I watched a wild life show on Netflix titled the “River of
no Return”, filmed by a couple that went into the Salmon River Wilderness area
in Idaho.  They spent a year in that area, mainly searching for wolfs.  It was
quite interesting.  I just started a western movie when Mae came home.  It was
after 3 and she hadn’t had anything to eat since breakfast, and she had been
standing a lot and it is hard for her to stand for very long, so she was really
tired, cold and had a bad headache.  I got her some lunch and we watched the
show together.  We went to the pharmacy and picked up a prescription for the
Ray’s and then stopped at Del –Taco and got two Classic Chicken Burritos for
our dinner.  After getting home we played a game of Rummy in which the score
was Mae = 545 and Ken = 585 but Mae went out so she won again tonight.  Mae
took a shower and went to bed as she was quite tired.  I stayed up and watched
“True Grit” on Netflix before going to bed at 11:45PM.</p>
