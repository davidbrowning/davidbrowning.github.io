<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
went into work at Mrs. Hunsakers again today.  I worked a full 8 hours, plus,
trying to finish the job.  I did get it finished, but then I went down to Dee's
and paid for the repairs, on the truck, plus an oil and filter change.  It cost
me $469.00, but I was warned that if it required the one type of fuel pump then
it would cost another $500.00 on top of that.  It only cost us the lower price
so I felt better about that.  I returned Scott's pickup to him and then went
back and cleaned up my tools and the mess I have made.  I then drove our car
home and got Mae to take me back to Dee's where we got my pickup.  We drove
back to Mrs Hunsakers to get my trailer, when I remembered that I hadn't got my
trailer hitch from Scott's pickup.  He had the pickup with him and he was at
the Davis Technology Collage.  We decided that we will have to have Scott leave
the trailer hitch there at the trailer, after he gets through at the DTC , so
we just came home.  We will pick up my pickup and trailer in the morning when
we go to get Bob.  I can then bring my pickup and trailer home and Mae will
stop and get me.  We will then go to Logan to be at Mark and Becky's wedding at
the Logan Temple.  I did get settled with Mrs. Hunsaker.  It's been a very busy
day and I am tired.  It will be a early morning so we had better get to bed.</p>

and I got up early, got ready and had breakfast.  We then went to Mrs.
Hunsaker's, where I hooked up the pickup to the trailer and I left for home. 
Mae went over to get Bob, and to my surprise got home before I did.  We drove
up to Logan and were able to join with Irven and Sandy's family and Sid and
Vera Fridal's family to witness the Sealing of Becky Fridal and Mark Browning
as Husband and wife for time and all Eternity in the Logan Temple.  Following
the beautiful Sealing ceremony, and the picture taking outside the Temple, we
went to a chapel nearby where we enjoyed visiting and had a nice dinner.  As we
drove up to Logan we experienced some heavy rain but by the time the ceremony
was concluded the rain had quit and the day became quite nice.  After taking
Bob back to his home we went to Grenn and Kathleen Clark's and from there we
went to Provo.  It took us 2 and ½ hours to drive from Bountiful to Provo, due
to the traffic.  We averaged, from being stopped, to as high as  15 miles per
hour until after we got past American Fork.  There in Provo we enjoyed a
reunion with several of those that we knew while on our mission in the
Philippines.  We enjoyed visiting with Grenn &amp; Kathleen as we drove to
Provo &amp; back, they are good friends.  It was late when we got home and to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Most
of our day was spent watching General Conference and we just enjoyed every
talk.  We were thrilled and pleased with the sustaining of the three new
Apostles that were sustained.  I did go to Home Depot between the Afternoon
Session and the Priesthood Session, and buy materials so that I can get started
on the trailer on Monday.  Mae had talked to Shellie on Thursday, and Shellie
was very depressed and upset because of her sons.  The one that is causing her
the most stress right now is Kevis.  He came over the night before and looked
like a monster, she said.  She said he had died his hair jet black and it is
long and unkept and he had on all black clothes, as he is “goth” and he had
black makeup all around his eyes, so looked really frightening.  She is also
concerned that Garrett seems to be struggling with depression and with his
marriage.  He told Shellie that he doesn’t love Nora now.  Shellie loves Nora
and their two little children, so, of course, that was about more than she
could take also.  She told Mae that her patriarchal blessing is a lie as it
told her that her children would be a blessing to her and bring her job and
happiness – and she said they are not.  Quint has been such a challenge for
them.  He is a good kid, but doesn’t have a testimony of the gospel so isn’t
going to church nor paying tithing, etc.  He finally went on a mission, but was
only there a short time, when he convinced his mission president to let him
come home.  That was such a disappointment for Shellie &amp; Roy.  Then he did
get a job, but the rest of the time, he just played video games and she felt he
was a bad influence for Kevis.  Kevis has always idolized Quint, and always
wanted to be with him.  Kevis is a smart young man and could do anything if he
would apply himself and go to college, but he won’t – so they had to kick him
out.  They found a home &amp; roommates and moved him there.  They did the same
with Quint and it is working out ok for Quint, but the so called LDS guys that
Roy lined Kevis up with are bad, and it is not good for Kevis.  We feel so bad
for Shellie too, and we love our grandsons, so Mae typed letters to both Kevis
&amp; Garrett, but e-mailed them to Shellie first to see if she was okay if Mae
sent them.  Mae read them to me, and I liked what she wrote.  She felt that she
had been inspired to write them, but Shellie responded back to not send them. 
We are worried about Shellie since she is so depressed and upset.  Shellie told
Mae that she hoped to find some comfort and inspiration from the General
Authorities at conference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
again enjoyed General Conference today.  As we have enjoyed the messages given
by each speaker my heart has still ached with thoughts of our family members
that are not watching or listening to these sessions.  Mae did let me take a
nap between sessions.  Following Conference we had something to eat and then we
went over to visit Ron and Diane Graf.  Ron is still recovering from having his
right foot operated on to remove all his toes on that foot.  He is still in
quite a lot of pain from the operation.  Diane would like me to build a ramp so
that their dogs can use their pet door.  After visiting a little while, we came
home.  Mae tried to contact our neighbor. Jackie, but still could not get her
to answer the phone.  We, therefore, went over and used the key in her security
box to let us in.   she was in, but had been over to her son's home this
afternoon.  She was talking on the phone when we entered.  We visited for a
little while before coming home.   Jackie had fallen the other day but is ok
now.  We were glad that she is ok.  We did some studying for our class on
Wednesday and read some from our Priesthood &amp; Relief Society manual before
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning.  After breakfast I started working on the house.  When I
started cleaning up the area, I noticed water around the water main.  I dug
down to uncover the pipes and found a joint leaking.  I went over to Jimmy's
and got him.  He said that it was the trailer courts responsibility to maintain
the water lines to the trailer.  Jimmy got a hold of the new court manager and
he tried to contact Scott Wayment, but he cannot come until 8am tomorrow.  We
will get by until then.  We are quite concerned about Shellie, but when we
tried to contact her, she wouldn't respond.  We debated on driving down to
Arizona.  I tried to get a hold of Roy, and Shellie finally responded and told
us to leave them alone.  Shellie met Roy for lunch and they were discussing
their situation.  Mae said something which upset Shellie and so Shellie
retorted back making Mae feel bad.  I don't know what else we can do at this
point.  Life is sure getting very tough.  Mae and I played three games of
Rummikub and Mae won all three hands.  We watched a show on Netflix before
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up this morning and had breakfast.  I then started removing the skirting
from around the trailer home.  By 9am I was getting concerned that Scott
Wayment had not shown up to repair the water leak.  Mae got after me because I
wasn't being more patient.  Right after that Jimmy stopped by and he checked on
Scott.  Scott can't make it today.  I told Jimmy that I could repair it.  He
called the office and in a few minutes (the new manager) came over and he told
me to go ahead and repair it and they will credit it on my lot rent.  That made
Mae feel better about me doing it.  They will credit me at $60 per hour plus my
parts.  I went to work on it and went to Durk's to get parts.  It took me about
2 hour’s time that I will charge the trailer court.  While at Durk's I checked
on getting an oval bathroom vanity sink.  They suggested that I go to Great
Western Supply, as they might have on in stock or can order one for me.  On the
way back home, there was a large banana squash laying in the intersection.  I
figured that if I left it there someone would hit it and destroy it, so I
stopped and picked it up.  It looks like it fell of a truck.  It has some skid
marks and some cracks, but other than that it looked ok.  I think that it was a
worthwhile stop.  This afternoon Mae and I went over to Marcy Fairbourn's and
picked 2 five gallon and 3 three gallon buckets of apples.  Her trees are very
full of nice apples this year.  We then went looking for a Dry Cleaners, which
Mae had been told about, but we couldn't find it.  We came back to C-A-L Ranch
where we bought me some new coveralls and some tools.  We stopped and bought us
some fried chicken for our dinner.  After getting home we watched a show on
Netflix before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
getting up and eating we started putting up apple sauce.  Mae had bought a
Apple peeler, corer and slicer yesterday.  It worked great for a couple of
hours but then it started falling apart.  I spent sometime working on it and
got it back to working.  We worked all day getting 30 quarts of apple sauce
bottled.  We were both tired when we finished.  I wrote the company a letter
explaining my disappointment in their machine.  We probably had one of the
original peelers that that company built, but the new one is much more inferior.  
Somewhere in our move we have misplaced our original peeler.  This evening we
attended our study group.  It was an enjoyable experience.  This evening Mae
and I again played Rummikube and tonight I won 2 out of 3 games.  I entered
this entry and we soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
had woke during the night and was worried about our children.  I went into the
living room and knelt in prayer.  After that I went back to bed and slept until
Mae woke me at 7:30am for breakfast.  She had waffles and eggs for breakfast. 
After eating we got ready and went to the temple at 10am.  We picked up Brother
Karrie Shaw, then went to the Church and waited until 10:30am but no one else
joined us.  When we got to the Temple, we found that they were having technical
problems and had to cancel all Endowment sessions.  We volunteered to do a Sealing
session while we were there.  We really enjoyed those that we worked with. 
Kerrie, Mae and I went down and had lunch after we finished with the session. 
After getting home I went down to an upholstery shop to see about getting the
pickup seat repaired.  While there Mae called me and said that she had just
checked our bank account and someone has opened an account under our credit
card and had made two purchases that came out of our checking account.  She called
the bank and they cancelled our debit card, reordered us new cards and will
reinstate the money to our account.  Of course this will take a few days.  We
are sure glad that Mae checked our account and caught it now.  I went over to
Home Depot and purchased some more materials for the house and some materials
to build Graf's dog ramp.  By the time I got home Mae had gone to choir
practice.  When she got home, we ate dinner.  We then played four games of Rummykub
and tonight I won all four games.  I needed that, as the past few night Mae has
won all of the games.  Roy and Linda called and they are planning on coming to
Utah on the 20<sup>th</sup> and will maybe stay until the 27<sup>th</sup> or
the 4<sup>th</sup> of November and wondered if they could stay with us.  Of
course, we told them “yes”.  It looks like they will stay until Nov. 4<sup>th</sup>. 
Mae had to finish the report of the fraud to our account and write a letter
explaining the actions she has taken.  She will now take that into our bank.</p>

spent most of the day building a ramp for Graf's dogs to be able to go in and
out of the doggie door.  Sandi called and decided that she couldn't go fishing
tomorrow.  It may not be, but I am afraid that I spoiled the trip when
yesterday Sandi asked me if Gary could meet us up there and fish with us.  I
hesitated and then said that I would prefer not. It was after 8pm when I
finished the doggie ramp.  Mae got her hair cut and a permanent today.  This
evening Mae and I watched a show on Netflix that was kind of a different
story.  When it finished we weren't sure weather or not we liked it.  We were

Smith &amp; Edward's, some more work clothes at Cal Ranch, some anti-freeze for
the boat and camper and getting a cashier’s check for the repair of my pickup
seat repairs.  I took the ramp over to the Graf's and set it up.  It was what
they wanted but I think Ron was surprised at the cost.  Mae took grandchildren
to the Dinosaur Park and from there went to Connor’s soccer game.  I installed
the new bathroom sink.  When Mae got home we went out to Sizzler for dinner.  I

woke up just before 7am and Mae got up a few minutes later.  I read my
scriptures from the New Testament Made Easier by David J. Ridges.  He sure
helps me to be able to understand the writings of Paul better.  Mae also read
the Priesthood and R.S. lesson to me while I tried to get the Chee machine to
work but it is not working.  It’s another project for later.  We got a call
from Sister Shear’s just before leaving for Church, asking if we could take
them to Sacrament meeting with us.  We stopped by their home and picked them
up.  She said that Brother Kyle DeNaughel would take them home.  The Chapel is
completed and the remodeling really is nice.  I sure was impressed with it.  In
Priesthood some started criticizing what wasn’t changed and I just spoke up and
said that they should go to the Philippines.  I really enjoyed the Priesthood
lesson and also the Sunday School lesson, which was given by Bill Curtis taken
from the writings of Paul.  Mae was in a lot of pain with her back when we got
finished with the block.  When we got home I went with Brother David Presnell
to take the Sacrament to some of the shut-ins.  That is always an enjoyable
experience.  When I got home I tried to solve the problem Mae is having with
the seats in the Relief Society room.  By the time she has sat on those chairs
for R.S. and S.S. for 2 hours, her back is about killing her.  I drove her over
to the chapel and we checked out the seats.  We decided that if she had one of
the chairs from the Priesthood room it would be better for her.  When I got
home I was excited about calling Shellie and giving her some Fatherly advice. 
Mae didn’t feel good about that.  I was ready to leave in the morning and drive
to Arizona and straighten her out.  Mae felt that I was going to cause more
problems if we did.  Mae asked me to talk with our Bishop about it first.  I
had a couple of items that I wanted to visit with him about so I told Mae that
I would ask Bishop about my feelings.  I called and asked if I could come down
to visit with him and, of course, he extended to me an invitation to come
down.  After we ate our dinner I went down and had a nice visit with him and
also received some good council.  With his advice, I realized that Mae was
right, and I also realized that I handled the Fishing Trip with Sandi wrong.  I
have just got to trust in the Lord and extend love to my children and let them
come around when they are ready even though they may have to wait until they
have to face Our Lord themselves.  After returning home I had to apologize to
Mae.  Mae helped me get part of my journal entries transferred back to our Lap
Top.  I am sure much more comfortable with it.  It is now almost bed time so we
will go to bed now.</p>

came at 9am to service our furnace before winter.  He cleaned it up and
installed a new set of filters.  After breakfast I started working on the
house.  I am quite discouraged over the carelessness that this trailer has been
built.  I think that I have figured out how to remodel the air ducking so that
we get a more efficient and a more even flow of the air.  This evening we went

recliner when I got up.  When she woke I had her go back to bed where she could
cover up as the house is cold and I have the duct open so that for now all the
air would just go outside.  I will work on that first thing this morning.  My
IPOD was low on power so I pluged it into the Lap Top and it did install the
software needed to recharge the IPOD and back up the data that is on it.  I am
not sure what that means, but I think there must be a way to retrieve the
current data should the IPOD be lost or destroyed, any way I hope that is the
case.  Just as we were ready to set down for breakfast, Mae said that I needed
to move my boat back down to the storage area.  That really hurt me and I just
went to pieces.  I just can’t go any faster than I am.  Mae felt bad that she
had said anything about the boat to me, but she was worried that we would get
in trouble for having it out on the road for these few days.   I started
working on the ducting by 9am and quit for lunch and a short nap before going
back to work.  It was after 8pm when I finished for today.  We turned the fan
on the furnace and we are now getting air out of every vent in the house.  Mae
had dinner ready and after eating I took a shower and cleaned up.  We then
finished reading our chapter in Jesus The Christ for our study group tomorrow
night.</p>

slept in and then had waffles for breakfast.  We took my pickup over to have
AAA Upholstery repair the seat cover.  I worked on the house.  We put the new
cover on the boat.  I built a light frame that will hold the boat cover up and
allow the rain and snow water to drain off the boat instead of puddeling and
soaking through the canvas.  This afternoon Mae went over to Scott’s and
brought Kylan back.  He worked under the house cleaning up the mess.  I got
most of the skirting off the house.  Mae attended our class this evening and I
took Kylan home.  Mae cut my hair and then I took a shower.  Mae and I played a
game of Rummikub which Mae won.  I then entered this journal entry before we
went to bed.</p>

picking up Kylan.  He came over again today and helped me with the house.  I
sure appreciate his help and today he helped without pay.  We put in a pretty
long day.  This evening David brought Connor over.  He is going to stay with us
tonight as well as Kylan will stay overnight.  We will take the two of them
fishing with us tomorrow.  I hooked up the boat to the pickup so that it would
be ready for us in the morning.  I tried to start the boat and found that the
battery was dead.  I also noticed that the left turn signal light does not
work.  I went over to Auto Zone and purchased a new battery and a turn signal
and a tail light combination.  I installed the battery but will have to install
the light at a later date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 5am but it was still after 7 am before we got away.  We met Scott at
the Air Force Museum on the North West entrance to Hill Field and got Kylan’s
fishing license.  Kylan had forgotten to bring it with him.  We then drove up
to Morgan where we stopped at the store to buy some paper cups, as Mae had
forgotten to bring cups with us.  We then went on to East Canon reservoir and
were just ready to launch the boat when I asked Mae if she had brought the
worms.  She had forgotten to get them out of the fridge.  That upset me but
somehow I kept my cool and we drove back to Morgan.  (Mae – Ken has me edit his
journals and so I inserted this - that he should have remembered the worms too,
as that is what he usually did.  I didn’t know it was my responsibility to do
that too.  Ken expects a lot from me a lot of the time).  As I drove, I felt
like we should just go on home, but we stopped at a gas station and they sold
worms.  We then drove back to the reservoir, launched the boat and started
fishing at 10am.  At first we started into having bites and caught some small
fish, most of which we released.  We fished until after noon and then took a
break, where I let Kylan and Connor drive the boat around just boating.  We
then went to the shore so that we could use the restrooms.  We debated on
quitting for the day but I felt that we should fish a little longer.  We did
catch some keepers, but it was still quite slow.  We all had caught fish except
Kylan and he was having trouble hooking them well enough to get them to the
boat.  It was after 3PM when we decided to just fish to the dock and quit for
today.  Shortly before getting to the dock I hooked a very nice fish that
really gave me a fight, and that made my day.  By that time we had 11 fish and
our limit was 12 so we all felt good about the day.  I let Kylan drive the boat
and it took him a couple of tries to get the boat to the dock so I could get
off to go get the truck.  While I was doing that they took another short ride. 
When I got back Kylan drove the boat right onto the trailer and I think that
really made him feel good.  I did complement him on the way he handled the
boat.  When we went to clean the fish we found that the cleaning station was
closed up for the winter.  We stopped in Morgan, where we got some ice and something
to drink.  It was 6 pm when we got to David’s to let Connor off.  It was good
that we were not later than that as his family were planning to drive to a
theater for a movie.  We then took Kylan home and that was about 7pm.  By the
time we got home, got some dinner and I cleaned the fish it was after 10pm.  I
felt totally exhausted by the time we got to bed, and so was Mae as she had
gotten the dinner for us and cleaned up afterwards and had put away all the
stuff we had taken with us.</p>

came in and woke me at 9am.  I was sleeping so sound that she thought that I
must have woken during the night and hadn’t slept well.  That was not the case
for I had slept all night.  Mae cooked a nice breakfast before I started
working.  Bishop Mullins stopped by, mainly to talk to Mae.  The phone rang so
I answered it.  It was JaNae and we had a nice visit.  Before starting work,
Mae asked if I could change the light bulb in the washroom.  Mae took Marianne
Ray  to her bank so that she could withdraw the money to repay Mae for the
groceries Mae bought for her when Mae had taken Marianne  grocery shopping a
couple days ago, and her credit card wouldn’t work.  While Mae was gone, I
removed the cover and went out to the shed to get a new package of bulbs. 
Outside, I noticed the main water line was still uncovered and so I proceeded
to finish that job and got the heat line installed around the water line.  I
then cut a piece of 4 inch PVC pipe down the length way of the pipe so that I
could spread the pipe and install it around the water main.  This will protect
the heat  line from getting wet.  I then filled the dirt back around the main
and leveled the area, finishing that job.  Just as I had finished with the job,
Mae came out and started cleaning up some of my construction mess.  I went back
into the house, remembering that I hadn’t installed the light for Mae.  I went
back to the shed and got the bulbs and finished that job.  I told Mae that it
only took me 3 hours to change that light bulb.  Mae went outside and came back
in to tell me that it was starting to rain.  We went out and with her help got
all our construction material and tools put away and covered.  We then went to
work on the boat.  We took it over to the gas station, added gas and fuel
stabilizer to the boat and filled the pickup with fuel.  We then came back home
and pumped a marine anti-freeze into the boat engine.  Next we put the new
cover on the boat.  As it was raining quite hard while we lay the old cover
over the boat also.  It took us a while to attach the new tie down straps onto
the cover.  I then took the boat and put it in the storage lot.  It has been a
busy day but we felt good at what we were able to accomplish.  I sure
appreciate all the help Mae has been for me today.  We ate dinner while we
watched a show on NetFlix.  The title of the show was “To Young A Hero”.  It
was a true story of a boy, only 12 years old that joined the Navy during World
War II.  After enjoying the show, we took our showers and went to bed.</p>

has been a very enjoyable Sabbath as we attended our meetings.  We picked up
the Ray’s and took them to Church with us.  They are a very interesting couple
and I hope we are handling our help to them in a proper and best way for them. 
We enjoyed the meetings and after returning home, Mae got us some lunch.  I
then took a short nap.  We went to Sister Leah Neilson’s and took a small gift
and card to her.  She is such a joy to visit with.  I attended the Stake High
Priest Annual meeting.  Our Stake Presidency conducted and each gave us some
appropriate council.  Although there was a good group in attendance, I felt
that there were many others that should have been there.  After the meeting, I
came home and got Mae.  We then went over to visit Bob.  He put on the show
“God’s Army” and we quite enjoyed the movie although there was a lot of static
in the recording.  When we got home, we stopped at the Ray’s and got the keys
to their car.  We are going to take it to Dee’s to be repaired.  We were tired

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke early this morning.  I sure have a wonderful wife that is so special.  As
I read from the writings of Paul,  I am impressed with the Gifts of the Spirit
that I have been given, especially the Gift of Testimony that Jesus is the
Christ and that Joseph Smith was and still is the chosen Prophet to restore the
knowledge of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in these latter days.  I will be eternally
grateful for that gift a lone, to say nothing of all the other blessings that
God has showered down on me.  At 7:30am we took the Ray’s car over to Dee’s
Auto Repair to get it repaired.  After leaving the car, we went out to eat
breakfast at the Star Café in Clearfield.  We found that the Café is under new
management and we wondered how it would be, but we found that the food was
still very good and the prices ok.  After returning home, I went to Home Depot
and bought a new outlet for our bathroom.  I also rechecked the different
insulations and I feel that putting the pads in will be the best.  I also went
to the Wal Mart optical department and they straightened my glass frames for
me.  Last week my glasses had fallen out of my pocket and somehow I crushed them
when I was under the house.  I had tried to straighten them, but couldn’t get
them right and I was afraid of breaking them.  The girl that helped me did a
much better job and said that she was afraid of breaking them also if she did
more.  They fit much better.  I went out to Cal Ranch to check on some shoes,
but they didn’t have what I wanted.  I got home just before Mae left for the
Daughters of The Utah Pioneers meeting.  I replaced the outlet in our bathroom
and also took the ceiling fan apart to clean out debris that locked it up from
when the house was reroofed.  I was going to work out side, but it started
raining very hard.   It rained off and on the rest of the day.  This evening we
went H.T./V.T. to the Ray’s.  We were there for 1 ½ hours as they like to visit
so much.  I was to give the lesson and I finally had to just break in and even
then I didn’t get much of it given before other things took over.   Before
going to bed we studied our chapter in “Jesus the Christ” for our group meeting
Wednesday evening.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was up a couple of times during the night thinking of the Ray’s and their
condition.  After breakfast we soon had to get ready to attend the Funeral
services for Leah Nelson’s son.  Knowing that Sister Nelson’s son and his
family were members of the Catholic Church, we wondered just what to expect in
way of a funeral service.  We were surprised when the services were conducted
by a LDS Bishop of the Ward of which area they resided.  It was a very
traditional LDS service.  Although Mae and I set in the front of the Chapel, I
had a difficult time hearing much of what was said.  Following the services Mae
and I stopped at the store for a few items and to make a banking transaction. 
After getting home and having some lunch, Mae went to town to do some
shopping.  I went to work on the house.  I called Mae and had her stop at Home
Depot and purchase me some saw metal cutting blades for my Sawsall.  I was able
to remove the metal beam that ran across the back end of the trailer house.  It
was installed, calked and was making it very difficult to frame the pony wall
in that area.  Mae was concerned about losing strength by removing the beam,
but I feel confident that the pony wall will give more than adequate strength
and even more than the beam offered.  My last cut off the beam, the saw blade
touched the electrical cable that connects the main power to the right side of
the trailer, just making enough of a nick that it shorted out the power and
tripped the fuses.  I moved the cable, repaired the nick and reset the breakers
and all is well.  Roy and Linda called at 6:30PM to tell us that they had just
passed the city of Winnemucca Nevada and said that they would be late getting
here.  I figured that it would be about mid-night at the earliest.  Mae and I
played three games of Sequence in which Mae won two of them.  We then went to
bed leaving the door unlocked and the lights on for Roy and Linda when they get
here.</p>

some studying of the Scriptures and entered my journal, trying not to disturb
anyone.  Roy helped me with some of the framing of the pony wall today.  This
evening Roy and Linda borrowed our car and went to meet some of Linda’s
family.  Mae and I went to our study group and also to visit Sister Shirley

Linda, Mae and I went to the Ogden Temple on the noon session.  Roy had to rent
his clothing and I had to go back twice to exchange the pants.  In the
confusion, and knowing that Linda and Mae would be waiting for us, I forgot
that we needed to go through the New Name booth and so when the session started,
we had to hold the session up in order to receive the new name.  I sure felt
embarrassed.  In as much as Roy told his incident in the Temple to others, I
guess I can put it in my journal.  Roy and Linda didn’t bring their Temple
clothing so they had to rent it at the Temple.  Roy got a size 44” waist but
that was too small so I exchanged it for a 46” and that was too small.  I
exchanged those for a 48” waist which Roy said fit ok.  I told him that we
could take them in with the buttons on the side, but he felt that they would be
ok.  During the Temple Ceremony, when we put on the Robes, Roy’s pants fell to
his knees.  He had some trouble getting them pulled up, but I don’t think
anyone noticed what had happened.  Then when participants were called for the
Prayer Circle, Linda stood and motioned for Roy to join her.  I thought Roy was
going to swallow his tongue, but he went up.  I am not sure how he made it, but
his pants remained up.  He must have been praying that they would stay up.  After
we finished the Temple session, the four of us went to the cafeteria and ate
lunch.  Then Linda wanted to go to the D.I.  From there we started to the
Distribution Center but stopped at Farr’s Ice Cream where we got a treat.  This
evening we watched the show “To Young A Hero”, before we went to bed.</p>

have then check it out.  They found a reset switch didn’t work.  Even with the

getting very little done.  We took Roy and Linda over to Scott and Mishelle’s
for Roy and Linda to see them and their family.  We returned home and had
dinner and then we played Rummikub before going to bed.  While Mae was getting

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were late at getting started and I hadn’t been under the house very long before
I realized that I needed some safety glasses, so I went to Home Depot and
bought some.  While there I looked at some siding to use for the skirting on
our trailer.  When I got home, Roy and Linda came and Mae had lunch for us
ready.  They had just eaten with some friends so we just visited while we ate. 
It started raining so that stopped my work.  This evening we took Roy and Linda
over to see Bob, and then Mae and I went over to Layton High School where we
enjoyed the Fall Band Concert.  When we returned to Bob’s, they had just finished
watching a show with him.</p>

made waffles for breakfast and with visiting, it was late before I got started
on the house.  It started raining this afternoon which stopped me from working
this afternoon.  I did get the insulation all put in the flooring and started
putting the netting up.  Roy and Linda borrowed our car and went out to eat
dinner with some of their friends.  Mae and I used that time to study our
assignment in “Jesus the Christ”.  After Roy and Linda came back home, we
played four games of “Rummikub” in which I won the first three games.  We then
called it a day and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
breakfast I went to Home Depot and returned material and then purchased the
siding that we are going to use for skirting on the trailer home.  I had them
cut the siding in 27” lengths and they did it for nothing.  I tried to give him
a tip but he said that he couldn’t accept that.  It sure saved me a lot of work. 
I installed the netting under the insulation that I put in the flooring joists,
to secure the insulation from falling down.  Roy gave me some help.  Linda
wanted to go shopping so we let them use our car.  This evening Roy and Linda
took Mae and I out to dinner at Sizzler.  After getting home, we watched a war
show “The Allies”.  It was a non-rated movie but it did have some language and
a sex scene in it, we fast forwarded that part.  Mae got things ready for
dinner tomorrow with Jeff’s family and Sandi invited.  We set the clocks back
this evening before going to bed as tomorrow it goes off Day-light Savings time. 
(Note: Mae talked with Sandi this afternoon and she said that JaNae and Brad
have confessed that both of them have been using all types of drugs and they
are both addicts.  Chelci is the first one that JaNae confessed to, and later
JaNae confessed to Sandi and said she was surprised that she had come to see
her.  Sandi said “Well, you hurt me pretty bad by the things you said, but I am
still your mother.”  We don’t know just what will happen now, but at least
confession is a start.)</p>
