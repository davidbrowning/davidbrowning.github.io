could be dressed before Becky came.  Becky was coming shortly after 7AM as Mae
wanted her to get her Birthday Gift.  We knew that they were going to go to
Logan to attend Becky, sister Mishelle, daughter’s baby blessing.  As they were
coming through the area then we thought that it would possibly work out so that
they could stop for the gift.  It did and we enjoyed Becky stopping.  Mike had
been at David, our son’s, so he stopped here also.  It was good to visit with
them for a few minutes.  They had bought a new car, so they were taking the old
one up to Page and Garrett.  We weren’t rushed as our Ward meetings start at
11AM.  I still had time for a short nap and to take a shower and shave with
still spare time.  Meetings went well.  Mae’s lesson went well in Relief
Society this morning.  We relaxed this afternoon.  I called Scott Wayment to
see if he might come by so that I could visit with him about our trailer home. 
he said that he would stop at out 2:30PM tomorrow.  This evening Mae and I
played a game of Rummy Cube and I won that game.</p>

helped Mae with some preparations for dinner this evening.  Scott Wayment
stopped by this afternoon and I was able to visit with him about the plumbing
in the house and he said that most of these home had been plumed with _____
tubing and now that tubing is worn out and starting to leak.  He suggested that
we replace it with Pex tubing.  He also agreed with me about insulating the
skirting.  This evening we invited Mishelle, Scott’s and their family over for
dinner.  Scott helped me get our storage forms set up on the EXCEL program.  We
enjoyed visiting.  The children watched some shows on Netflix.</p>

what kind of Father I have been and I feel that I have failed in several
areas.  I also thought about the work this home yet needs.  It is quite
discouraging, especially when I am not sure where we are going to get the funds
to do them.  Bishop Mullin stopped by this morning just to see how I am
feeling.  He is sure concerned about the Ward membership and their needs.  Mae
and I walked over to the office and paid our rent.  We also talked to the
office about removing the pine trees to our west.  I installed a motion
detection light on the shed. Mae attended Relief Society Presidency meeting.  I
started figuring of materials for home projects.  This evening we went up to
Morgan to watch the Tyler’s basketball team play.  I thought it was interesting
that they played a private school’s team.  It was a close game although the
other team held the lead through the game but Morgan tied at the end and went
into overtime.  It looked like Morgan was going to lose but then in the last
few minutes Morgan pulled ahead and won by 5 points.  It was a good game
although I felt the ref’s favored the other team.  Tyler felt bad as he missed
3 out of 4 foul shots.  On the way home we stopped at Del Taco and got
something to eat.  After getting home we watched a show on Netflix that was
pretty good.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

have ran into a unexpected cost.  I don’t know but we may have made a mistake

afternoon.  I entered the inventory that we have stored under the East Deck,
into to our computer.  I still have some questions that I need help to get the
listings the way I want them.  This evening we went to T J and D Ann Jones for
Family Home Evening.  I have got to learn that I keep my mouth shut.  It was a
good evening but Scott and Silvia didn’t come again.  I am afraid that they
feel inferior to the rest of us.  I had hoped to visit with Scott after the
meeting about the plumbing in our home.   After getting home Mae made calls
getting appointments set up for our H.T./V.T.  I read one of the assignments

breakfast this morning.  I called Kim this morning and he confirmed that the
insurance policy on Bob has been signed over to Mae and I.  We have the options
to keep the policy of a little over $12,000 and letting the cash value continue
to pay the yearly payment, or we could cash it out now and get a little over
$7,000 or the third option would be to borrow $5,000 out of it and pay the $500
payment each year.  This would maintain the $12,000 death benefit.  We are
considering the 3<sup>rd</sup> option.  We attended the Ogden Temple and went
on the 1PM Endowment session, joining Irven, Sandy and Bob.  Mae and I were
asked to be the company witnesses.  Bob was not able to hear the session
narration.  We thought that they would also have the TV screen with Caption
that Bob would be able to read the narration but with Mae and I setting up
front, Bob and Irven came up front also but the TV screen’s were in the back. 
Kim and Jeanenne were also on our session.  Following the session Irven, Sandy,
Bob, Mae and I went to the Chuck-A-Rama and had dinner.  It wasn’t the best
tonight.  Sandy needed something at Costco so we stopped and Mae took her in. 
Mae bought a couple of items while there.  Mae and I played some Rummy which
Mae won.  We then played Rummy Cube, which I won.  We then played one more game
of rummy and I won that.  That is the first time I have beat Mae at Rummy since
we have moved over here.  We soon went to bed.</p>

Kim this morning and he said that the policy of Bob’s has been transferred to

back.  He said that we could draw out close to $5,000 from it and then make the
yearly payment of about $500 and keep the insurance enforce and still get
almost the full face value should Bob die.  That may be the thing we will do in
order to have the funds to do the repairs on the home.  We went into the tax
Asser and paid the taxes on the mobile home.  While there we also changed our voter’s
registration.  We then went to the Vehicle Department and were able to get the
title registered in our names.  We stopped at Wal-Mart and bought some drapery
rods.  We got to Morgan in time to see the sophomore basketball team play the
team from Park City.  Morgan won 83 to 40.  We enjoyed being with David’s
family to support Tyler.  Tyler did much better with his shooting.  On the way
home we stopped at the grocery store in Morgan and bought some groceries along
with some fried chicken that we ate on the way home.  We watched the movie “The
Ron Clark Story” on DVD before going to bed.  It was a very good movie. </p>

to visit.  Mae has to be the fastest house cleaner that was ever born!  By the
time I invited them in and had them set down, Mae had the kitchen cleaned up
and ready to show the house.  Mae had an appointment to go visiting with Sister
Andrus at 11AM but the Steels didn’t leave until 11:30AM.  Mae called and told
Sister Andrus the situation and she said that they would go when Mae could make
it.  When the Steels left I took the car and fueled it and had it washed.  Mae
left and I got something to eat.  I then worked on the assignment for our Ward
to do Baptism’s for the Dead at the Ogden Temple on April 09, 2015.  I worked
on the Temple forms for over three hours.  JaNae called and talked to Mae for
almost 2 hours.  I guess she needs someone to talk to.  I ate by myself while
they talked.  Mae and I went over to Layton this evening to watch Connor play
basketball.  Connor’s team lost but it was a good game.  After getting home Mae

during the Sacrament meeting program.  They both did very good jobs.  We got
quite a few that signed up for the Temple Baptismal assignment and we have a
few people report that they have names that need baptisms done.  After Church
Brother Lee Gifford stopped us and invited us to have dinner with them this
afternoon.  We enjoyed becoming better acquainted with Brother Lee Gifford and
his wife Glory and Mother-in-law Sister Jean Thornock.  Sister Gifford had a
very nice dinner prepared and we enjoyed the visit.  After the main course
Sister Gifford had a Key lime pie for desert.  Brother Gifford cut Mae a small
piece of pie and I told him I would take one about the same size, but I think
he increased the size considerable.  It was very good but I am concerned at my
reaction to it.  We excused our self at 6:30PM so that we could take Rachael a
Birthday present before the children went to bed.  We enjoyed visiting with

reroute the outlet circuit on the bathroom vanity.  This evening we went over

before going to meetings.  Meetings were very good and especially enjoyable was
Brother Wayne Bell’s talk explaining his life prior to his conversion to the
Church.  In our Sunday School Class I gained a new insight to Christ healing
the man brought to him by for associates and when they couldn’t bring him
through the doorway, they took to the roof and uncovering it they lowered him
into the home.  there Jesus told him that his sins be forgiven and when
question by the scribes Jesus questioned “Which is easier, to say thy sins or
forgiven or rise up and walk.  My thoughts are that it is easier to say rise up
and walk because only Christ has the power to forgive one’s sins.  Following
meetings I went across to Jimmy’s and checked to see how his wife is.  She was
taken into the hospital in an ambulance this morning but she is home now.  I

Rummy Cube and Bob did very well.  We then took Bob back home but we stopped

took Bob there to let him get a comparison between her facilities compared the
Chandler Gardens where he is living.  I hope he thinks about it.  I wanted to
visit with Bob about other areas also but Irven and Sandy wants to watch a
movie with Bob this evening so we just took him home and then we came home.  I
entered this entry after getting home.   We then read for a little while before
going to bed.</p>

times last night and I woke before 5AM.  I was up for a while but went back to
bed for almost an hour.  After getting up we exercised for almost an hour.  Mae
prepared breakfast while I figured out some materials I needed.  After eating
breakfast I went to Whitehead Electric and Home Depot for materials.  Sandi had
come by the time I got home.  We sure enjoyed visiting with her.  While we were
visiting Sandi received word on her phone that the Judge had granted her the divorce
from Nick.  We hope that it is for the best.  I grilled chicken on the grill
outside, for our lunch.  Mae and Sandi went for a walk so I did get just a
little work done on the bathroom.  David called and invited us up to their
place this afternoon.  After Sandi left we went up to David’s.  We enjoyed
playing games and visiting.  David grilled chicken on their grill for dinner
while Shauna and the children made a fried pocket out of torte shells filled
with sausage and vegetables.  David showed us a flash light that he had bought
and Mae said that is what I told her I wanted for my Birthday.  David laughed
and said Happy Birthday and gave me one that they had bought for me.  We had a
wonderful evening, getting home about 9PM.  I didn’t get much done today but it
was a good day.</p>

made waffles and they were sure good.  Somehow I got the drape rods over the
patio door ½ inch out of level so I spent over an hour correcting that.  I
worked the rest of the day on getting the electricity ran in the master
bathroom and into the utility room and cutting the outside doorway and then
installing the door for the utility room.  I had to get Tim, next door, to help
me install the door.  Mae has been busy most of the day.  She picked up some
prescriptions for the Ray’s, bought a wedding gift for Uncle Van’s
granddaughter, bought a few groceries, attended R.S. Presidency meeting and
went visiting as a R.S. Presidency.  We were both tired so after dinner we
relaxed and watched a show on Netflix before going to bed.  </p>

It was late and I didn’t want to go but Mae insisted.  When we got there, it
was closed so I wanted to go home.  Mae insisted that we drive around back to
check if someone might be in the back.  Again I went just to satisfy Mae.  No
one was there.  As we started back around the building there was a car there
and Mae wanted to see if someone was there.  We stopped and a lady got out and
came over.  She explained that the previous owner had been foreclosed and
evicted by the bank.  She was the new owned.  She asked if we had something
scheduled there.  We told her that we had a wedding breakfast there for
tomorrow.  She said that the previous owner had refused to leave any scheduled
events for the new owner so she was very glad that we had stopped by.  We
couldn’t help but wonder what we would have done if Mae hadn’t followed her
promptings to check it out.</p>

stopped at Jennie’s and bought some nutrition pills and then came on home.  I
went over to Sister Shirley Lemon’s and changed the hinge on her doggie gate so
that when it was opened and closed it did not come of the hinge.  Ron Garf came
over and we loaded my demolition trash into his trailer and he took it to the
dumps for me.  I was going to go with him but he insisted that I didn’t need to
and I had plenty of other work to take care of.  I did get him to take $5 for
the dumping fee.  Mae started working on the outside yard work.  I then started
on the remodeling and decided that I needed to remove part of the skirting to
get under the trailer.  What I found made me sick as there is going to be so
much work to repair problems under the trailer.  </p>

morning concerned about the water and insulation under the house.  I couldn’t
go back to sleep.  At 8:30AM I called Scott Wayment, asking him if he could
stop by and see what he thought.  He actually came by twice as the first time
Mae was in the shower and I was under the house.  He came back a little later
and he feels that there is very little chance of mildew with the weather as
cool as it is.  He does feel that I could pull the insulation out and replace
it after replacing the water lines.  I think I know where the water came from. 
It was when I removed the tub and cut the water lines.  There has been some
water damage before that and something is plugging the heat run.  Mae had an
appointment this afternoon to have permanent.  She also washed and dried our bed
spread and shams.  I worked on the remodeling and went to Home Depot for

getting them off the outside.  Mae went to Kaysville and got my boots from the

change the handles.  While in Kaysville, Mae picked up the medical reports on
our physical check-up.  They are normal and we are doing well.  From there Mae
picked up Bob and they went to the commissary on base where Mae bought some
groceries.  Bob also got a few items.  She went up to Jeff’s and got the
children for us to tend this weekend while Jeff and Gail take a weekend trip. 
Mae prepared dinner for us about 6:30PM.  After eating I did a little more on
the remodeling and then put the tools and materials away.  I took a shower in

had storm most of the day but I was able to work around it.  mae took the

Katelyn is Uncle Van and Aunt Allison granddaughter.  Alan &amp; Mary Pearson
of course were there as Mary’s parents but we didn’t see any one else from the

being with Kim and Bryce.  Bryce thought that the way I came home was twice as
far as taking off the Riverdale exit.  I didn’t think it was that much farther
but we got on Google Earth at our place and it lacks .4 miles from being twice
as far.  Mae had the children to bed when we got home and was filling our pill
boxes.  It seems that those 3 weeks go by so fast.</p>

meeting and then after that I brought the children home as our Ward doesn’t
have a Jr. Sunday school Program.  Mae stayed but I misunderstood that she
wanted me to pick her up after Relief Society and I was thinking of Sunday
School, so she walked home.  That wasn’t bad except it was cold today.  After I
brought the children home I turned on Netflix and we watched “Old Yellow”.  The
children really enjoyed the movie and I felt that it was a good one for them to
watch.  I helped Mae prepare dinner but as much as anything I played with the
children while Mae was busy getting dinner prepared.  We played “Seven’s” which
is good for their minds and they enjoyed it.  Jeff and Gail got here about
5PM.  They had a good trip.  We had a very nice dinner and everyone really
enjoyed it.  The children watched a show on Netflix while Mae and Gail cleaned
up the dishes.  Jeff, Gail, Mae and I then played a game of Rook.  It was close
but Gail and Mae beat the game with the last hand.  Jeff, Gail and the children
left for home about 7:60PM.  Mae and I called Roy and Quint and wished them a
Happy Birthday.  Mae then visited with Quint, Nora and Shellie.  Mae and I then
read the assignment for our family Home Evening and Study Group.  We are
concerned with Shellie’s health and the work she is doing.  We are trying to

Brother David Presnell and Pat brought Max Fife.  The Temple parking lot was
