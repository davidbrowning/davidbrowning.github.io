<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
went off Day Light Saving Time this morning.  With the insulating of the floor
of the trailer and the remodeling of the furnace duct, our trailer home is much
more comfortable and enjoyable.  I just hope that I can have time before bad
weather sets in to finish the job.  We slept in until 7am before getting up.  Brother
Lynn Ray called me at 9am and asked if I could help him reset one of his
toilets.  I suggested that we do it tomorrow morning.  Our Sacrament meeting
was so spiritual and especially the testimonies that were expressed were very
inspirational and appropriate.  I had the opportunity to participate in the
passing of the Sacrament.  Brother Patterson gave a very inspirational lesson
in our Priesthood class and Sister Patterson gave a very good lesson in Sunday
School.  Mae had prepared dinner for today, yesterday, and even set the table. 
I came home before Sunday School class started and put the casseroles in the
ovens to warm.  Brother Flint was having trouble getting someone to feed the
missionaries this afternoon.  I told him that if he couldn’t get someone, he
could take them to the Burger Bar and I would pay the bill.  When we got home
Jeff and his family were waiting for us and before we could get out of the car,
Sandi arrived.  Sandi had expressed her concerns about JaNae and Brad to Mae
this morning on the phone.  When she came, being brought here by her boy
friend, Linda had a little while to visit with her.  I sure hope that it helped
her and I think it did.  It was such an enjoyable afternoon having our family
with us.  It was almost 5pm when Jeff and his family got away for home.  I
remembered that Jeff wanted to borrow my plainer and we were able to get it
into his car trunk.  Sandi, Roy, Linda, Mae and I then played a couple of games
of Rummikub before Sandi’s boy friend came to get her.  After she left the four
of us played a couple more games and then we all read some in our book “Jesus
the Christ” and enjoyed discussing it as we read.  That is a marvelous book and
so filled with insight.  I am so thankful for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and my
testimony of the Church.  Linda and I got talking and it was after 11pm when
Mae and I got to bed.  Mae couldn’t go to sleep and so got up and read more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up about 7am but let everyone else sleep in for a while.  I had some
cereal for breakfast, and while cleaning up my dishes, I also put the dishes in
the dishwasher away.  I then caught my journal up to date.  I went down to
Ray’s and with Roy’s help I was able to secure the sewer line and then refasten
the toilet to the flange.  By the time we finished it was time to go up to
David and Shauna’s so that Roy and Linda could visit with them.  We then went
to Betsy and Devin’s for a visit.  We came home and I was able to sell my extra
sheetrock to a fellow.  I am glad to get rid of it as it was a problem to keep
covering it to protect it from the weather.  After dinner we cleaned up the
kitchen and then played four games of Rummikub and we each won a game.  It’s
now 10:36pm and we are tired and ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept in until 8am although Mae woke at 7am.  After taking a shower we had
breakfast, which Mae had cooked fish and eggs.  Roy and Linda took our car and
went to Linda’s brother.  From there Linda’s sister-in-law took her to
Bountiful where Linda went out to eat with two of her cousins.  Roy stayed at Steve,
Linda’s brother’s home.  Anyway, they were gone most of the day.  Mae was busy
all day and had dinner about ready when Roy and Linda got back.  I got the
north east pony wall built and the old skirting off the front of the house. 
After dinner and the table were cleaned up, Mae and I played Rummy while Roy
and Linda got packed.  All of us then played Rummikub, Roy won the first game
and I won the second game.  We then went to bed shortly after 10PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke early so as to be able to get Roy and Linda to the airport in time for
their flight home.  Mae had breakfast ready by 6:30am and following that we got
the car packed.  I drove them down and Mae went with me.  The traffic was fair
and we made it to the airport on time.  I helped get their baggage into the
check-in counter and said my goodbyes there.   After getting home I changed
clothes and got started on the house.  In order to remove the trailer hitches I
needed to cut the steel beams that the hitches are made of.  I checked on
renting a cutting torch but it is quite expensive.  I next tried a metal
cutting blade in my saw-all and it worked well.  I got all the skirting removed
and cleaned under the house.  I was able to move all the pieces of the hitches
to the back of the house except for the front portion of the hitches and they
were too heavy.  When Tim, next door came home, he came over and helped me
carry them to the back of the house.  I was able to get the front yard cleaned
up and looking good.  Mae gave me a haircut and then prepared dinner while I
took a shower.  After eating we went to our study group.  We sure enjoy and
learn so much from this study group.  We drove Al Ervin home after the class
and then stopped and got our mail.  When we got home, we started checking the
mail.  We got a letter from Phyllis Schlafly of Eagle Form informing us that
Barack Obama is trying to get an International Trade treaty passed in secret
that will totally destroy America and our Freedom to control our Government. 
It sure does not sound good.  It is only 8:30pm but I am sure tired tonight.  I
think we will soon go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was nice to sleep in a little while.  It was lightly snowing this morning so I
got under the house and installed insulation and plastic sheeting along the
pony wall between the trailer and the east porch.  I then installed plastic
sheeting on the framed wall on the east side.  By then it had dried up and I
was able to get the South walls laid out so I can start framing those.  I
installed insulation and the siding on the North East wall.  It was almost 5pm
when I quit for dinner.  Mae has been busy on the computer most of the day. 
She did go to Home Depot and get me a few supplies.  She attended the choir
practice this evening.  I started watching a show but when Mae got home we
started it over.  It was a cute Christmas show.</p>

woke up at 5:15 this morning and I woke up at 6am.  After scripture study and
morning prayers, Mae prepared breakfast.  It was cold outside but I soon got
started on the house.  Having thought of how I should install the pony wall in
the front of the house, this morning I decided to remove the steel frame like I
did on the north side of the trailer and just build it back with 2” X 6”
lumber.  I had to have Mae go to Home Depot and buy me some more metal cutting
blades for the Sawall and I removed the beam.  I got the front plates laid and
am ready to install the vertical studding.  This evening we had the Graf’s come
over for dinner.  We sure enjoyed visiting with them.  Ron’s sister, Jen and
her daughter Lorin also came over.  Mae had a wonderful dinner along with homemade
bread that Mae had baked today.  It is only 8:30PM but I am tired and ready to
go to bed.</p>

standard morning scripture study and prayer, we had breakfast and then I started
on the house.  I got the front pony wall built and then started on the front
east wall.  We had lunch and then left for Logan.  We took our computer and GPS
with us so that our grandson, David, can work on them.  We found their new
Townhouse without any problem.  It is sure a much nicer place than was their
other apartment, although the other place was still nice.  Henry is sure
growing, but isn’t feeling the best today.  Garret and Page soon came to join
us for the evening.  When David hooked up our computer, the mouse started
working without any problems.   David was able to insert the additional memory
stick into our GPS and started the new download and update of the maps.  We
enjoyed visiting and then got the games out which we all enjoyed.  Mae had
brought two lasagna casseroles that we cooked there for dinner.   Sierra and
David made a green salad and Garlic bread.  Page made cookies for desert.   Everyone
sure enjoyed the meal.  Mae had also brought a Fruit Cocktail desert.  I had a
small piece of that and I soon noticed the affect it had on me.  Mae and I left
at 9pm for home, but have sure had a wonderful evening with our grand children. 
We used the GPS on the way home just to see how it worked.  It is good to have
it working better now.  We were tired so soon took showers and went to bed.</p>

able to read two chapters in the B.O.M. this morning.  After having prayers, I
prepared breakfast of egg omelets for us.  Mae got up just before I was ready
to go wake her.  When we went to bed Mae started having hiccups and had to get
up.  She told me this morning that she just drank some water and she was able
to go right back to bed and slept well.  I worked on my journal this morning
and the computer and mouse are working great.  Today was a wonderful day as we
attended our block meetings.  Mae and I had read the lesson in the manual for
Priesthood and Relief Society.  When we returned home I started preparing left
over’s for lunch.  Mae and I then lay down and took a nap.  When we got up, I
called Scott to see if he was finished with my air compressor.  He was, and
they returned it to me before going to Mishelle’s parents.  I did a little
figuring as to what materials I need to continue with my work on the house.  This
evening Mae and I read and studied two chapters in the book “Jesus the Christ”
in preparation for our study group on Wednesday evening.  I finished this entry
and we soon went to bed.</p>

finished up and got me some staples.  I was able to get the plastic sheeting
around most of the pony walls.  I also rerouted the Comcast cable so that most
of it will be hidden behind the pony wall.  It was 6pm when I quit.  We ate
dinner and then I cleaned up and we went H.T./V.T. to the Rays.  Although Mae
tried to encourage them to read the Priesthood/Relief Society, I don’t think it
will happen.  As we left I couldn’t help thinking of a saying a former Bishop,
Lyle Deamer, used to say, “A person convinced against their will is of the same
opinion still!”  It’s is now going on 10pm so we had better go to bed.</p>

had breakfast.  I started on the home but while doing so I got thinking about
what David said to Mae yesterday.  He doesn’t want to talk to me about
religion.  The more I thought about it, the more I became depressed.  I got the
Comcast cable removed from the outside of the house and installed it under the
house.  It looks much more professional to do it correctly.  After lunch I
ground up the chicken breasts which Mae purchased yesterday.  While I ground it,
Mae packaged it and put it in the freezer.  I then started insulating and
siding the pony walls.  Mae was going to help me, but she got a call from
Sister Scheer, who is in quite a bit of pain, asking if Mae could drive them to
the Doctors.  After the Doctor examined her, he wanted her to go to the
hospital for further testing.   I did get the siding on the S.E. section of the
wall.  I was tired so quit at 4PM and cleaned up.  Mae stopped on the way home from
the hospital and got us some Classic  Burrito’s for our dinner.  I took a
shower and had the table set when Mae got home.  After eating, we went V.T./H.T
1<sup>st</sup> to the Hilton’s but they weren’t home.  We, therefore, took a
prescription to the Ray’s and then visited Sister Leah Neilson.  We had a nice
visit with her.  She is such a positive person.  We then went back to the
Hilton’s and they had just gotten home.  They invited us in anyway and we had a
nice visit with them.  We gave some pretty straight forward council on being
self sufficient and even selling unneeded items to finance their present
needs.  I hope we were not offensive to them.  When we got home, we had a
missed call from David and one from Jeff.  Mae called Jeff and I called David. 
He needed to know if JaNae’s children had winter coats as they were going to
give some of their kids outgrown coats to the school for needy children.  I
called Sandi and got her in a Board Meeting but she suggested that I call
Chelci, so I did and she said that the kids were ok that way.  Mae returned the
call to Jeff and visited with him for a while.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night.  I slept until 7:45am.  I took the boat over
to Dick’s Boat shop to have it shrink wrapped  to protect it from the winter
storms.   Later, they called me and said it was ready to pick up, but when I
got over there, they hadn’t wrapped it but had winterized it.  It was my fault
as I hadn’t read the work order before signing it.  I left and they shrink
wrapped it and said they would call me when it was finished.  I did get the
insulation installed on all the pony walls and the siding on the front of the
trailer.  Mae took the car over to Dee’s and got the inspection and license
plates, and then when she got home, she helped me with stapling plastic wrap as
I installed the insulation in place.  This evening we attended our study group
and really enjoyed that.  We went H.T./V.T. to Sister Lemon’s this evening. 
Before going to bed we had some cottage cheese and apple sauce.</p>

got there at 9am, no one else was there.  I called Mae and she called Brother
Haney, who said that there was a funeral today so we won’t set up until 3PM.  I
came back home and ate breakfast and then we got ready to go to the Temple.  We
took Brother Carrie Shaw and Sister Judy Decker with us and enjoyed a wonderful
session.  We ate lunch at the cafeteria before coming home.  When we got home,
Sister Ray called and wanted Mae to go grocery shopping for them.  She went.  I
went over to Dick’s Boat and picked up my boat.  I then went over to the church
and helped with some of the setting up for the Ward dinner.  I came home and
found Mae working on our Christmas cards.  We went over to the Ward Veterans
Day social and enjoyed that dinner and program.  I helped put tables and chairs
away before we come home.  I worked on our Christmas card mailing list and then
entered this entry, before we went to bed.</p>

and have a chance to visit with them.  I was very tired when I quit for the
day.  Mae had Scott and Mishelle bring their children over this evening and she

I got up this morning, I read from both the Book of Mormon and from the New
Testament.  I then worked on my journal entries.  I found that all dates that I
put in with the insert function were changed to today’s date.  I had to go back
and reinter the day, month, day and year for several days.  I am concerned with
our computer and the information that we have stored on it.  I had to make a
new form for our Temple announcements as those forms were lost when the
computer crashed.  Meetings went well except I didn’t get but two people who
indicated that they want to attend the temple on the 19<sup>th</sup>.  After
getting some lunch, both Mae and I took a nap.  This evening we went up to
David and Shauna’s for dinner in honor of Emily’s 15<sup>th</sup> birthday. 
Shauna’s parents were also there.  David and Shauna had a very nice dinner
ready with three kinds of meats prepared.  It was a very enjoyable evening.  We
got home about 8:40pm.  </p>

got up about 6am but Mae hadn’t slept very well so I let her sleep in longer
while I read my scriptures and took a shower.   I prepared breakfast of egg
omelets.  We then got the car packed plus I went into Ogden to get some parts
to remodel our outside Christmas lights and a few other errands while I was
out.  It was after noon when we finally got away.  When I was ready to leave,
Mae was talking to Gail on her cell phone.  I told her she could continue the
conversation in the car, so she came out and got in and I took off.  We had
gone a couple of miles and Mae suddenly stopped talking and asked where her
phone was.  She was almost panicky and was about ready for me to turn around
and go back.  I chuckled and told her that she was talking on it.  At least I
did get a laugh out of it, and she did too.  We drove straight through with one
stop at a rest stop.  It was a little after 3pm when we got to Jeff and Gail’s
home.  Gail hadn’t got back from picking the children up from school when we
arrived, so we used their garage door opener and was able to get in.  We had
most of our things in the house when Gail and the children got home.  Those
grandchildren sure gave us lots of hugs and a big welcome.  We had a very
pleasant evening, enjoying a nice dinner, visiting and then ending the evening
by playing games with Jeff and Gail.</p>

was up two or three times during the night.  We slept on our air mattress and
it did go down some during the night.  This morning I re-inflated the mattress
and added some quilts to the bedding.  We will see what happens during the
day.  I spent most of the day working on my Five Year Diary reentering it into
my journal.  I am in November 2<sup>nd</sup>  &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> 1972.  This
was the time that Mae and I had an opportunity to go to Hawaii.  With only 4
short lines per day, there was very little of our experiences recorded.   Most
of the entries will have to be by memory.  When the children came home from
school Gail took Rachel to her piano lesson.  Mae’s place was playing Old Pig
with Ben and Matt.  After a little while, I took Mae’s place, while she
prepared dinner.  After dinner all the family went to Ben’s Cub Scout Pack
meeting.  After returning home the children soon went to bed and then Jeff,
Gail, Mae and I played Rook until 9pm and then we quite to get ready for bed.</p>

We were late getting up.  I took a shower before getting started.  Time goes
fast and we spend quite a bit of time talking.  I did get the dish washer
secured by raising the front leg adjustments.  I checked the lights in the
basement storage room and found that they are florescent light fixtures that
were hooked up without a ground.  I went to a Super Wal Mart and my GPS took me
to Jerome.  Although it was out of the way, I found a Conoco Station with gas
for $2.09 per gallon, plus the super car wash for just a $1.00 with 10 gallons
of gas.  That was worth the out of the way trip.  I worked on my Diary Journal
again today.  Mae also worked on her Ward History besides playing games with
Grandchildren.  This evening after the children went to bed Jeff, Gail, Mae and
I played some games.  It is now almost 10pm so we will get to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep very well but I slept all night.  After scripture study and
prayers I got the internet code from Gail and entered it into our computer. 
This way Mae can assess the internet here.  We had that link before but when
our computer crashed and it was restored by our Grandson David, the link was
lost.  Gail took Ben and Rachel to school and then she went to the gym, leaving
Matt here with us.  After eating breakfast Grandma and Matt played games.  They
were both laughing and enjoying the time together so much.  Although I loved my
grandmother very much and I knew of her love for me, I never remember her
laughing like Mae does.  To me it was a special scene, to see both of them
enjoying being together.  But Mae is that way with all of her grandchildren.  I
worked on my Diary Journal until almost noon.  We had lunch and then got ready
to go to the Twin Falls Temple.  When we got to the Temple we found that the
sessions start at 7am and runs every two hours.  Because of the children
getting home from school shortly after 3pm, the next session would be too late
for us to attend.  They allowed us to join a Sealing Session that we enjoyed
participating in.  After leaving the Temple we tried to find a Maverik station
where they served frozen yogurt.   We couldn’t find one, so when we got home I
called the Maverik Customer number and complained about our disappointment in
the removal of this service.  I worked on my Diary/Journal for some time,
trying to get it straightened out.  It is difficult to remember that far back,
from the brief entries in a Five Year Diary, especially 43 years ago.  This
evening Jeff, Gail, Mae and I finished the game of Hearts that we put aside
last night because it got late.  I think we should have just started another
game as I sure lost this one.  We do enjoy being with Jeff and Gail.</p>

Grandma to play him some Ping Pong this morning.  When I got up, I took over
for her for a few minutes until he had to leave for school.  I then played it
with Matt for a while.  I prepared breakfast for Mae, Matt, Gail and myself.  I
then worked on the computer for a little while.  Gail asked if I could put her
food storage shelves together so I spent the rest of the day doing that.  She
was sure happy when I finished.  When the children got home from school, Rachel
came down and gave me a card she had made at school for me.  It had a large heart
and 2 small hearts cut out.  On the back sheet in the heart it read “YOU ARE
THE BEST” and in the small hearts it read “I LOVE YOU!”  When she gave it to me
she also had a hug and a kiss for me.  She is sure a sweet girl and growing so
fast.  After dinner, Jeff wanted to mount their TV in their bedroom but Gail
was uncertain and so we let it wait for now.  After the children were put to
bed we started a game of “Trans America” but put it up when it got late as Jeff
has to go into work in the morning.</p>

doesn’t plan on working very long today.   I worked on my Five Year Diary for a
while today.  Mae and Gail went with Rachel to her basketball game.  I played
games with the boys.  When Jeff got home we all went to Rachel’s 2<sup>nd</sup>
basketball game.  It was fun to watch those little girls play basketball.  When
we got home, Jeff and I hung a pin board in the office and their TV in their
bedroom.  We only got the stand hung on the wall for them and then Jeff and
Gail had to go to a dinner.  Mae and I cooked fish and fried potatoes for
dinner for us and the children.  Matt wouldn’t try the fish, but the rest of us
really enjoyed the dinner.  Ben loved the fish and had a second helping.  I
helped Mae cleanup after we ate.  The kids and Mae watched a movie on the TV
downstairs.  After getting the children to bed we were going to watch a movie
on Netflix but it froze up.  The first time Matt was still up and he was able
to get it going again, but the next time it froze up, I couldn’t get it to go
so I finally turned the power off and we got ready for bed.  When Jeff and Gail
got home we started a game of “Hand &amp; Foot” for a little while but then
gave up and went to bed as it was getting late.</p>

the Thanksgiving Holliday and will not have much time to enjoy the decorations
for Christmas.  Mae and I prepared lunch by heating up the left over fish and
chicken along with frying some potatoes and making a salad.  After lunch I took
a nap.  This evening we played some games with the children and then Jeff, Gail,
Mae and I played a game of Hand and Foot.  We paused that game to eat dinner,
and then played another game with the children before they went to bed.  Mae,
Gail, Jeff and I then continued our game.  Mae and I won that game.  We then
played two dice games in which I lost the first one but won the second game.

on.  It was about 2pm when we got to Penney’s where we picked up an item for
Christmas that Mae had ordered for me.  After getting home we unpacked and Mae
started washing clothes.  Mae looked at possibilities of rearranging our
bedroom but when I measured it out, it just doesn’t work.  I did move the glass
dish of Mae’s Grandmother that Sandi had made into wind chimes, into the front
room.  Jeff had suggested that we watch a show titled “The Butler”, which we
tried to watch Friday night on their TV, but his reception hung up and we had
to turn the TV off.  We there for decided to watch it on our TV.  It left me
with several mixed feelings and wondered how much facts were presented there or
if it was somewhat distorted to show one side or to emphasize a certain view
point.  I know that there has been and still is great deception in our government
and truths are kept from the public from ever being aware of corruption within
our government.  Mae got on the computer and downloaded the pictures from our
camera along with e-mailing some to Gail as Gail wanted to make a 2015 calendar
on Shutterfly and it would be free if she got it done by midnight tonight.  I

Mullins called to see if I could go to the hospital with Bishop Mullin to
administer to Brother Ray.  He is at the hospital and is going to be operated
on.  When I returned home I did more work on the house.  Mae raked up more
leaves and got them bagged.  We stored some of the trim material under our
house as I am afraid that we are in for some winter weather and I don’t want it
to set out and get wet.  We were tired when we finished.  We need to go grocery
shopping and so I suggested that we get a Fish Sandwich and fry’s for dinner. 
Mary Ann called and asked Mae if she could get to the store for her.  We did
get her things while we got our groceries.  We found out that Lynn is being
life flighted to the University Hospital.  We are not sure what the reason for
that is.  It was 10pm when we got home.  We are sure tired tonight.</p>

time sure went by fast today.  We worked on Thanksgiving plans and got the
turkeys thawing so they will be ready to cook early Friday morning.  I did some
planning on our outside Christmas lights.  Later I went shopping first to
return some excess materials I had purchased from Home Depot and then to
purchase materials for our Christmas lights.  I am going to restring the lights
so that they will hang better, plus I am using a little better quality of
fixtures.  This afternoon we got a fairly heavy snow storm.  Marianne called
this evening and told us that Lynn had been operated on at the Huntsman Cancer
Clinic and not the University Hospital.  He still is in critical condition. 
Marianne said that she needed some furniture moved before Lynn comes home so he
can get around.  She wanted it moved tonight, so we went down.  She wasn’t
ready when we got there for the furniture to be moved, so we told her that we
would check with her in the morning and come back when she had things cleared
out so the furniture could be moved.  This evening Mae worked on Christmas
Cards and letters.  Plus she did some preparations for our Thanksgiving Dinner
that we are holding on Friday.  I worked on the complete rewiring of the
Christmas lighting we brought home from the Philippines.  The wire I got is
heavier than what the parts I bought needed but I am able to make it work.  I

into working on the Christmas lights.  Mae has been making cup cakes and we
decorated them like a turkey.  They turned out quite cute.  Shortly after lunch
Mae helped me hang the Christmas light on our east deck.  It was cold but with
Mae’s help we got them up.  We needed to use the hair dryer to dry the metal so
we also used it to warm our hands as it was very cold.  We gave each other a
hair cut today.  That has sure saved us a lot of money and time.  This evening
I helped Mae decorate the Turkey cup cakes.  I started getting the special
tools and pans for cooking our Thanks Giving dinner for tomorrow.  When I
looked for the pressure cooker to cook the potatoes in I realized that we had
put the canning utensils under the trailer, before I boarded it up.  We talked
about storing those things under the trailer, thinking that we wouldn’t need
them until next canning season, forgetting that we use the cooker for other
items.  I will have to crawl under the trailer from the east porch to get it. 
We decided to watch a movie while we ate out dinner.  We watched on show on the
Hall Mark channel.  Hall Mark had a cute show but the trouble with Hall Mark is
you watch more advertizing that you do show.  We couldn’t get Net Flex to work
so we turned the TV off and went down to Ray’s to see how Lynn is doing.  They
are going to operate again tomorrow.  It doesn’t sound very good to me.  We

cook our potatoes in it for this big of a crowd.  We then got the turkeys ready
and in the oven and Electric roaster.  After breakfast we got the potatoes
peeled and ready to cook.  I picked up the key to the Stake Center from Bishop
Mullins.  We loaded up and went over to the Stake Center about 11am.  We had
borrowed Bishop Mullin’s key but when we got to the Stake Center it wouldn’t
work.  We called Bishop Mullin and asked if that was the same key he had let us
borrow last Wednesday.  It wasn’t and so we took it back and he let us take his
key ring.  That one worked and we were able to get in.  Sandi and Gary came
while we were changing keys and so they were there to help us carry things in. 
They then started setting up the tables and chairs.  I got the potatoes on to
cook and started carving the turkeys.  By the time I got the turkeys carved the
potatoes were cooked.  The rest of our family had also arrived.  David and
Scott whipped the potatoes while Mae made the gravy everyone else got
everything else ready.  We had a prayer of Thanksgiving for the blessings we
enjoy as a family and a Blessing on the food.  We sure enjoyed a wonderful
meal.  After dinner the boys set up the volley ball net and a game soon got
started.  Mike felt bad that he couldn’t play volleyball with the rest but his
shoulder is still healing from the bike accident he had earlier this fall.  All
of the little kids enjoyed playing together.  We did get a couple of pictures
of all 32 of us.  Shellie’s family, JaNae’s family and Page and Garret were the
only ones not there.  We sure missed those that weren’t there.  We cleaned the
church and finished up and was out by 6PM.  Mae and I came home, put things
away and watched “White Christmas” on NetFlix before going to bed, quite tired,
but what a wonderful day.</p>

Christmas decorations out and started getting them up.  We were most of the day
getting the inside decorations up and then I started outside but it was too
cold and dark by then, so they will have to wait and see what the weather is on

her no matter what we are doing.  She is so cute especially about the Christmas
decorations and really about anything I do for her.  What a JOY she is in my

breakfast, but by the time we arrived home after Church, it was after2pm and I
was hungry.  We heated up Thanksgiving leftovers and really enjoyed them.  Mae
is editing some of my journal entries and was on the computer until she went to
choir practice.  I thought I could get some more done on my diary entries when
she was gon, but I turned on the TV to BYU and the “Seventeen Miracles” was on
and I got caught up in that.  I don’t know how many times I have now seen that
show and yet it still pulls on my heart strings and the tears flow in feelings
for the Faith those people had, as they went through so much to serve the
Lord.  Following that show, a live interview of a Young Lady from West Africa,
being the first black person from there to come to Temple Square, was played. 
What a marvelous and inspiring story that is.  Mae returned just as that was
ending.  Oh! How much I need to count my Blessings!  When Mae got home she
again went to work editing my journal entries.  I, therefore, read more from
the New Testament.  It is now after 10Pm so we had better get to bed before
long.  With Mae doing so much work to help me with my journal entrances, plus
all the time I spend on these journals, I am led to wonder if they are really
worth it.  Will they ever be of any worth to anyone?  (Mae – Yes, I feel they
will and I am happy he is doing this.)</p>

house cleaning.  I made a trip to Home Depot for a few items and shortly after
getting home we got a call from American First Credit Union asking us if we had
purchased a travel voucher $198.85 in Indonesia, which of course we hadn’t.  So
they stopped the payment from going through.  Someone has again used our debit
card, and we are lucky that American First recognized it as an illegal use of
our card.  We had to cancel our debit cards again and will have to wait for a
week to 10 days before we will get new ones.  This is getting scary to have
someone get into our account again in about a month’s time since the last
time.  I put up the outside Christmas lights this afternoon.  I have some
concerns about the wind damaging our large star that we bought in the
Philippines.  Mae went grocery shopping this afternoon.  </p>
