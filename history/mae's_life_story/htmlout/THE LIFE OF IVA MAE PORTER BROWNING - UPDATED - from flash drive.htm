 Memorial Hospital in Ogden, Utah to wonderful parents, Glendon C and Mildred
Hope Bushnell Porter.  My parents, older brother, Hal, and I lived in Ogden until I was about a year and a half, then we moved to Sunset, Utah where my folks
bought some property by the highway, and south of the Sunset church.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>They first built a basement home,
and later built on the upstairs.  Bryce was just a little guy when we moved
upstairs, and he was excited that he could stand by the windows in the front
room and be able to look out.</p>

I, born on the 2nd of June 1939. <b> Bryce</b> is about 4 years younger; he was
born April 23, 1944.  Mom was worried, after I was born, that Dad might have to
fight in the 2nd World War so she put off having more children until this
time.  Dad was able to stay at the Arsenal and work on defense equipment there
- much to their relief.  On the 23rd of February 1948, <b>Terry</b> Glen was
born.  <b>Georgia</b> was born 2 ½ years later on the 8th of September so she
is almost 11years younger than I, but boy was I ever excited when she was born
as I had wanted a sister for many years. Georgia was named after Grandpa
Bushnell as his name was George. They just took out the “e” and put “ia”,
making it Georgia.  <b>Kim</b> Byron is the youngest, and is sixteen years
younger, born on the 7th of September 1957.  He was just a little guy when Ken
and I got married.  Georgia was my pretty little flower girl.  It was fun
inviting my siblings to our home to stay for a night, weekend or longer after
we were married.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            I am very blessed to have been born to two
such wonderful parents, who loved me and all their children and taught us the
gospel both by word and by example.  They were faithful, good honorable
people.  Mom was usually a very happy person and people loved to be around
her.  She had many friends and she was on the phone a lot because friends and
family would call her as they loved to talk to her.  She would cheer them up if
they were discouraged or sad and if they had good news, they wanted to tell
her.  Mom didn’t gossip, but just loved to visit with people, they made her
happy and she made them happy.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>Dad was a hard-working, loving and kind father.  He loved
our mother, which was a great blessing.  He loved the Lord and served Him the
best of his ability and was very generous in his tithing, fast offerings and
other church donations.  Dad had a sense of humor, which I loved also.  I loved
to see and hear him laugh. He would call us kids silly names instead of our
given names at times, and when we would say “DAD!”, he would laugh and laugh. 
Dad didn’t enjoy playing games like Mom did, but he did like playing
“Authors”.  He could look us each in the eye and say something like “Do you
have Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain?”  The way dad would look at you and the way he
would say it, made you give yourself away and then we would have to give the
card to him and he would laugh.  In my mind, I can still see him doing that.  He
also played Panjandrum with us and after us kids were all married and moved
out, he and mom would play it before going to bed many nights.  I will tell
more about Mom &amp; Dad later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have just a few experiences I would like to
insert here of my years as a young child.  These were impressed on my mind so
much that I remember them after all these years                                                             </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            “Lost in Salt Lake City”</b> When I was only
two or three years old, I was Christmas shopping with my parents and older
brother, Hal in Salt Lake City.  It was snowing and I had on my new little red
coat and bonnet.  I became so involved in looking in the windows at all the
neat toys, that the next thing I knew I couldn't find my family.  I started
crying and a nice lady took my hand and led me into the nearest store and
explained to the manager that I was lost.  The manager told her they would keep
me there until my parents came after me.  He then sat me up on the counter and
gave me a lollipop and also a windmill to play with.  I was enjoying myself
when my father came in looking very worried and asked if they had seen a little
girl in a red coat and bonnet.  The clerk pointed over at me, and my daddy got
a big smile on his face, came and grabbed me up and hugged me tight.  I
remember this experience, plus I heard the story when I was older, and they
also told me of how worried they were.  They had looked up and down the streets
calling my name and asking people if they had seen me.  Finally, Mom &amp; Dad
split up each looking in a different direction and agreed to meet in front of
the information building on temple square.  Dad said they had looked and looked
and finally he went there to see if Mom had found me.  He said as he approached
her, and they both saw that neither of them had me, Mom began to cry and said
her and Hal had been praying that Dad would have found me.   Dad said he would
go back and ask in the stores.  They all prayed.  We all thanked Heavenly
Father afterwards, that I was found and that I was safe.  My dad wrote me a
letter while we were living in Arizona, one of the few letters I received from
him, but it meant a lot to me.  He told of this experience and I will quote
from his letter...(I can’t find it)......................but I do remember what
he told me.  He said he went into the store named Kreses and asked one of the
clerks if they had seen a little girl in a red coat and bonnet.  The man smiled
and said “yes, she is right over here.”  Dad said he was so relieved, he picked
me up and kept hugging me while he was crying.  When mom &amp; Hal saw dad
coming down the sidewalk carrying me, they were so happy and relieved.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            <b>I had terrible ear aches</b> from the time
I was tiny until I had my tonsils out when I was about 4 or 5 years old.  I
remember waking up many times at night and my sweet Mom warming some ear drops
or oil in a teaspoon on the stove, dropping it in my ear then putting cotton in
and cuddling me up on her lap in the rocking chair.  She would rock me while
singing many songs until I fell back to sleep.  The ones I remember most were
&quot;This Little Piggy Went To Market&quot; and &quot;Rock-a-bye and don't you
cry and we will go to Grannies&quot;.  I sang these to my little ones and now I
do so to my grandchildren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember when I got <b>my tonsils out</b>; it
was done on our kitchen table while we were living in our basement home. 
Doctor Tanner used to make “home calls” back then.  I think I was about 4 or 5
years old.  Just before the doctor was to give me the ether, I remember Hal
coming in and saying &quot;Ha, Ha, we're going to have cake and ice cream and
you can't have any&quot;.  He was always a tease while we were growing up.  He
remarked after we were both married that he didn't know how I had survived our
childhood as he was so mean to me.  He said he was bored and didn't have
anything better to do than tease and torment me, and he did plenty of that.  Thank
goodness we grew up and became good friends, when we reached our later teens
and started dating.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom sang many songs as she worked around the
house, cleaning, fixing meals, etc.  Some were funny - &quot;When I was born my
Ma and Pa&quot;, &quot;Two Little Girlies&quot;, &quot;Slide down My Rain
barrel&quot; and &quot;Has Anybody Seen My Kitty&quot;. (I will add the words
of these songs separately.)  Mom sang and whistled a lot which made for a happy
home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom &amp; Dad both loved to sing and we children
felt they had beautiful voices (at least I did)  Many times as we'd go for a
ride or come home from Morgan, when we would go visit Grandpa &amp; Grandma
Porter or go on vacations, they'd sing &quot;Be Sure It's True When You Say I
Love You&quot;, &quot;I Love You Truly&quot;, &quot;Cruising Down the River On
A Sunday Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, Tramp&quot;, Someone's in
the Kitchen With Dina&quot;, &quot;Sweet Ivory Soap&quot;, &quot;Let Me Call
You Lizzy&quot;, You Are My Sunshine&quot; and many more.  As I think about it
now (Nov. 1993 with my wonderful Dad gone) I can picture and almost hear him
and Mom singing these songs and dad laughing as they would sing &quot;Sweet
Ivory Soap&quot; or &quot;Let Me Call You Lizzy&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>One thing I did which I'm certainly not proud
of involved our neighbors on the south of us.</b>  It was while we were living in
the basement house (before the top floor was added) so I would have had to be
only <b>4 or 5 years of age</b>.  I played with one of the girls.  I remember
going to her home and she would ask her mother if we could have cookies, candy,
etc.  I remember wishing we had lots of goodies like they did.  One day I was
especially hungry for some sweets or snacks - so I went over to her house
hoping her Mom would give us some.  No one was home.  I tried the door and it
was unlocked.  I knew better than to go in someone else's home when they were
not there, but I wanted something good to eat, so (like Goldilocks - my
experience reminds me of Goldilocks &amp; the Three Bears) I went in.  I knew
where they kept the cookies, crackers, etc., so I got a chair and climbed up on
the counter and got into the top cupboard.  I had just filled my pockets when I
heard their car drive in.  I knew they would see me whether I went out the
front door or the side door as you could see either door from their driveway. 
I knew I couldn't hide in their house or I would be found - so I just bolted
out the back door leaving the chair up to the counter and the cupboard doors
open.  I ran over home and into my bedroom and was really scared as I knew they
had seen me.  I didn't have to wait very long until a knock came to the door
and Mom answered it.  She soon came and found me and asked me what I had been
doing at the neighbors while they were gone.  I confessed and really got a
strong talking to about honesty, etc.  I was grounded for a long time.  I was
really ashamed of myself and learned a valuable lesson.  I never did anything
like that again, but I still wasn't as honest as I should have been as I
remember going through my Mom's purse and my dad's coat pockets once in a while
seeing if they had any change so I could go to the corner gas station and get
some treats.  I guess that’s why I always wanted to give our children an
allowance, when they were young, because I knew how I felt and I didn't want
our children to be tempted to be dishonest.  When they had ways to earn money,
they didn't always receive an allowance, but in the meantime, we tried to give
them one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Back in those days we didn’t have the many
convenience appliances like we do today</b>.  They hadn’t invented the
automatic washer &amp; dryer, so mom had a Dexter washer with twin tubs and a
wringer which had a handle and you would put an article of clothes on the one
side and start turning the handle and the clothes would go through between two
round wooden cylinders (looked like big rolling pins) and fall into the next
tub.  Mom would put Tide &amp; bleach in the washer which had an agitator that
went back and forth when you pushed the lever.  This did work with an electric
motor.  Mom would put bluing in the last tub.  We had a “wash house” in back of
our house, which was a shed.  It had one little electric bulb in the middle,
but it seemed really dark and creepy out there.  It seems like it had a dirt
floor and I remember lots of spiders, etc., so I didn’t like being there, but I
was the oldest daughter and I was expected to help with everything a woman
does.  I felt picked on, as my brothers did practically nothing, but I learned
a lot which made me a better mother and homemaker..  After the clothes had been
in the washer for a length of time, Mom or I would stop the agitator, take out
the clothes one by one and take them through the wringer into the first rinse
tub.  We would swish them around in that tub and take them through the wringer
into the second tub with the bluing.  The bluing was to make the white clothes
whiter.  We would them take them through the wringer and they would drop into a
basket.  Mom made starch to starch Dad’s collars on his white shirts, etc. 
Then Mom &amp; I would take the clothes outside to the clothes lines and hang
them on the lines with clothes pins.  In the winter, this was difficult as our
fingers would get so cold hanging these wet clothes on the lines.  They
wouldn’t get completely dry, in the winter, unless there was a good breeze and
so we would gather them up in the late afternoon, take them into the house and
drape them over the chairs, or on anything we could find, for them to dry.   We
didn’t have permanent press clothes, they was all cotton and we used to iron
practically everything.  So Mondays were wash days and Tuesdays were ironing
days.  On Monday afternoons, we would sprinkle the clothing that was to be
ironed.  Sometimes you had a bottle with a top which had holes in it, otherwise
you just used a pan of water and used your hand to sprinkle water on the clothes. 
You would them roll them up and put them into the basket, and put a folded bath
towel over the basket.  If it was winter and the clothes did not get dry, you
didn’t have to sprinkle them very much.  We didn’t have steam irons, so that’s
why we needed to sprinkle and roll them up to iron the next day, as they needed
to be damp.  I didn’t enjoy ironing.  We didn’t iron sheets, towels, underwear
or socks, but practically everything else.  It took most of the day.  I was
surely glad when permanent press clothes came out.  I don't mind pressing
clothes sometimes, but I dislike ironing like we used to have to do then. 
Later on, Mom got a &quot;Mangle Ironer&quot;.  It was a machine with a
roller.  You could easily iron pillow cases, handkerchiefs, table cloths, etc.,
but it was a little tricky to do shirts, blouses and dresses, but we did what
we could of them and then used the other iron to do the rest.  We thought that
was great when we got it.  After I was married and living in Mesa, Arizona,
we bought a &quot;Mangle Ironer&quot; also - until the permanent press clothes
came out.  Of course when I was old enough to go to school, then mom would do
most of these jobs, except for the summers.  However, it was usually my job to
fold the clothes when I got home from school on Mondays.  We didn’t have paper
diapers in those days and since I was the 2<sup>nd</sup> of 6 children, there
were lots of cloth diapers to wash and fold.  I also remember washing the dirty
diapers out in the toilet a lot and then putting them into a bucket with a lid
to wait until Monday to wash.  On Mondays, Mom usually cooked beans for supper
as it was easy and could cook for several hours while we were doing the
laundry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I was a young girl, probably six or seven, an older
man, a grandpa <b>- Mr. William Boren</b>, moved into our ward.  He lived
alone.  I later found out he was divorced.  He was active in the church and
worked at Hill Air Force Base.  I guess his wife must have turned his children
against him as he seemed a little bitter towards his wife and children.  He
didn't have anyone to spend his money on and he enjoyed making little girls
happy - so he'd buy presents, for several of us girls in the ward, especially
on our birthdays and Christmas.  He'd take us to the circus, Lagoon and other
fun places.  He'd buy us candy and other treats.  When we were sick he'd come
to visit us and bring us goodies and comic books to cheer us up.  I seemed to
be his favorite as he would always buy me the nicest and most expensive items. 
For example, one year for Christmas he gave me and my friends a bike.  Theirs
were smaller, cheaper bikes, but mine was a Swinn.  It had lights, a horn and
was a larger, nicer one.  Another year he gave us watches.  He gave them
Cinderella watches, but he gave me a beautiful woman’s watch.  He told me the
reason he did this was because he knew I appreciated it more and that I would
take better care of the things he gave me than the other girls would.  When I
was sick, he'd bring me comic books, pop and ice cream, (usually a quart) and
sometimes cookies.  I was always really excited, but this caused Hal to be
jealous.  I don't blame him.  It would have been hard for him when I was always
getting nice presents or treats or being taken to special places where children
love to go and he wasn't invited or given gifts.  Bryce was a lot younger so he
didn't understand too much about it so I don't believe it affected him too
much.  I didn't always get to go because dad sometimes didn't approve and
didn't know whether to trust him that much.  Some people in the ward gossiped
about him and said he was probably a &quot;dirty old man&quot;.  This hurt and
upset him as he wasn't that way at all.  He was a gentle, kind, good man.  He
just preferred little girls and enjoyed doing things for them and making them
happy since his own family was a source of unhappiness.  He was like a grandpa
to us and we, at least I, grew to love him like one. I never remember him ever
doing or saying anything out of line. Later, his health began to fail and he
was retired and went to live with one of his daughters.  He came to visit me
after I was married, and I was thrilled to see him.  Mom always felt he was a
kind elderly man and appreciated the kindness he showed me.  Mr. Boren gave me
a <b>beautiful green parakeet.</b> We kept the cage door open and it would fly
around the house &amp; land on your shoulder or head.  One day my friend, Patsy
Morris, was at my house and we were making cookies.  All of a sudden, Patsy
started screaming and jumping up and down and waving her hands frantically.  I
looked over at her and my Parakeet had landed on Patsy’s head and scared her to
pieces.  I started laughing, but she didn’t think it was funny.  When she
started screaming and jumping up and down, it scared the bird and he flew back
in his cage.  Patsy hadn’t known that the parakeet could get out of its cage.  He
would fly around sometimes and land on the wall can opener and you could lean
over and he would give you a kiss on the cheek - cute bird.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I had a friend, <b>Anna Mae Bodily</b>,
who lived in Clinton.  Her Mom had died and she had two older brothers and the
father never remarried.  Sometimes Mom would let me go to her house after
Elementary School and play for an hour or so and then walk home.  One day after
I got there, she wanted to show me her puppies.  They were such cute, tiny
little things.  They were weaned.  I made such a fuss over them that she asked
if I would like one.  I certainly did so I called Mom and she said I could have
one.  I brought it home with me that day in my coat pocket.  It was that little. 
I named her <b>“Skippy”.  </b>I took good care of her and I loved her so much. 
All the family loved her.  When she came I heat we tried to keep her inside as
there were large dogs roaming around outside all the time.  Well, one time she
got out and a big dog mated her.  She had a hard time delivering her puppy as
it was large.  It was a brown and one mutt, but we loved it too.  We named it <b>“Brownie”.</b> 
We had Skippy spaded after that. .  We had about three years, I think, when she
was out one morning and up by the highway and we heard a noise and ran outside
and a car hurried off.  The car had swung out onto the gravel (off the road) to
hit and kill our Skippy.  Mom &amp; Dad were so upset that someone would do
that, and I was heartbroken as I loved my little dog.  I don’t remember how
long we had Brownie when we found out that he had been picked up and was in the
pound.  We called the pound and they said we could come get him, but when we
got there, he wasn’t there.  They said that he had escaped over the chain
fence, but we think they had already put him to sleep, so just told us that. 
We were sad about that too.  The reason why he was in the pound was because of
some bad neighbors, who lived in Lyman’s back apartments (close to the park). 
The man taught his kids to steal people’s fruit off their trees and other
things.  They stole fruit from Grandpa, and he caught them and took them to
their parent’s home and the dad got mad at them and said “I taught you not to
get caught.”  The man would walk past our house to get to the corner store and
buy his beer and cigarettes, and if Brownie was outside, he would run towards
him barking and growling as he didn’t like him.  I think animals have an
instinct when people are bad, because Brownie didn’t bark at other people
passing by.  Anyway, we’re sure that this man turned Brownie in.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Grandma Bushnell had a beautiful <b>yellow
canary</b>.  I loved listening to her canary sing.  Sometimes it sang so loud
that if she had other people there, they couldn’t hear each other talk, so she
would put a cover over the cage and it would quiet down.  Since I loved that
canary, she gave it to me after Ken and I were married and living in our home
in Ogden.  Grandma had a feather mattress and sometimes, when Grandpa was away
for the night, like when he took one of my brothers with him to Meadow when he
was asked to sing, Grandma had me sleep with her.  She was always nervous about
being alone in her home, and I loved spending the night with her and sleeping
in that soft feather mattress.  One day I asked her if when she died, if she
would will her mattress to me.  She did, but Ken didn’t want it, so I didn’t
get it.  I wasn’t too happy with him.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            I started babysitting from the time I was 10
years old, and made $.25 an hour</b>, and then I did have money to be able to
spend on myself and I liked that.  I babysat some for people in Lyman’s back
apartments.  They were down at the end of their property, close by where the
park is now.  They were cheap apartments so all kinds of people lived there.  I
remember babysitting one time and after I got the children to sleep, I saw a <span
style='color:red'>hugh</span> spider and it ran so fast across the floor.  I
was very afraid of it so I sat the rest of the night on the couch, with my feet
up on the couch, watching for it to reappear, but hoping it wouldn’t, until the
couple got home.  Another time after the children were in bed, I saw a man outside,
staring at me through the window.  They didn’t have blinds on that front
window.  Thank goodness I had the door locked, but it still made me very
nervous.  I ran into the other room and was relieved when the people got home. 
I remember other times I would hear all kinds of strange noises and I could
imagine someone walking around in the house and I knew the children were
asleep.  I was very nervous.  I think it was just the sounds of the furnace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             I babysat until <b>I was 15 when I got a job as
a carhop at an A &amp; W Drive-in in Clearfield.  </b>.  I didn't like
carhopping so the next summer I applied at the <b>Arctic Circle</b> in Roy and
got the job.  Delgarn Smith was the owner.  He was really strict.  He only had
old fashioned cash registers at the two counters.  We were to help all the
customers as they walked up to the counter.  We were to keep the orders in our
heads, figure them up in our heads and get the orders out in the order they
came in.  It was hard, especially at first, but I liked the job.  I liked the
girls &amp; guys I worked with.  They were from Weber High so it was easy for
me to get them to trade with me so I could go to the activities, games and
dances at Davis, because Weber activities were usually on different nights.  I
could even get them to trade with me when I had dates as there were so many of
them who wanted me to trade with them.  It was also fun flirting with the cute
guys who came there.  I worked there until I was married.  </p>

align=left hspace=12><b>For my schooling, I went to Clinton Elementary, North
Davis Jr. High, and graduated from Davis High in Kaysville, Utah in 1959.  I
also graduated from Seminary.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We rode a school bus to Clinton Elementary, but it was only
a mile from my house to the school so sometimes when I had to come home for
dentist appointments or other reasons, Mom would call to excuse me and I would
walk home.  I enjoyed walking home as there was a ditch by the side of the road
and in the middle of it was a cement division about six inches wide - so I
liked to walk it and pretend I was a tightrope walker.  There was one place
about halfway home that made me nervous.  It was an old deserted house with
trees around it.  It looked really scary and I had heard tales that a witch
lives in it - so I would walk on the other side of the road just before I got
to that place and I walked or ran really fast past it and was greatly relieved
when I came to other houses and knew I could go to them for help if the witch
started chasing me. (Oh boy, children's fantasies)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I liked Clinton Elementary and had many friends
who I grew up with, and boy friends too which made it fun.  I can remember (I
think it was in the 5th grade) that I had two boyfriends who would write and
pass notes to me saying &quot;Do you like me more than Dan?&quot; and Dan would
say &quot;Do you like me better than John?&quot;  I would write back saying I
liked them both the same.  We played softball, especially during my 6th grade
and I usually played 2nd base.  I also played &quot;Jacks&quot; a lot and got
pretty good at it.  Pat &amp; I played it a lot at our homes and we played with
a group of girls during recess in elementary school.  I still like playing
&quot;Jacks and am still pretty good at it.  I have taught it to my children. 
We also played &quot;hop scotch&quot; &amp; &quot;jump rope&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>We had ward shows on Monday nights</b>.  They
were paid for out of the monthly &quot;budget&quot; check every active family
paid.  We had a budget card which we showed to get into the movies which were
held in the cultural hall.  They had Walt Disney and other good family shows. 
Of course, in those days, most of the movies were good.  The mutual youth (now
called Young Men and Young Women) would bake goodies and make pop corn and have
drinks to sell to earn money for their organizations.  Usually, just the kids
went to the shows and not the adults as it was too noisy and the adults didn't
enjoy them.  I remember Jimmy Petersen wanting to &quot;take me&quot; to the
ward shows and asking me on the school bus if I would go with him and sit with
him.  Usually, I would sit with my girl friends and sometimes my brothers &amp;
sister.  Those movies were something we looked forward to each week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Since I lived up by the highway and my other
friends lived in subdivisions further west, I didn't get to play with them as
much as I would have liked, and as much as they played with each other. 
Another reason was Mom had me helping with the housework, meals, laundry,
tending children, etc., so I didn't have as much extra time to play.  Saturdays
were really busy cleaning the house and going grocery shopping - so when I was
younger I didn't get to play much on Saturdays either.  On Sundays, after the
dinner dishes were over, Mom would let me go play with my friends.  We were not
allowed to play softball or go to the park, however, as it was Sunday.  Many
times she asked me to take Bryce along (when I was about 8 - 12 years old) and
Georgia from the time I was about 12 - 15)  My friend, Patsy, just had one
brother and he was older than her, so she didn’t always like me bringing Bryce
with me.   I remember one incident when I was riding Georgia behind me on my
bike to go down to Patsy Morris's house.  Georgia was about 2 or 3 years old. 
I put her on behind and took off.  As I rounded a corner in the housing project
where Patsy lived, Georgia's foot got caught in the spokes, she screamed and I
quickly stopped the bike, but her poor little foot and leg were caught and were
bleeding.  A neighbor saw what had happened so he ran over to help me.  Finally
we got her leg out and he took us home in his car where Georgia
could be bandaged up.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            One day I was down to my friend, Margie
Martin's house.  We were twirling around on a home made merry-go-round.  All of
a sudden a board, that was propped up to hold up her mother's clothes lines,
fell and hit me on the head.  It didn't seem to hurt too bad so I didn't think
too much about it until Margie noticed my head was bleeding.  The board had a
nail in it and it went into the top of my head.  It began to bleed quite a bit
and I got scared and started running for home.  Margie ran into her house and
told her mom who immediately jumped into her car and came and picked me up and
took me home.  She told me I shouldn't run when I was bleeding or it could make
it worse.  Mom put antiseptic on it and bandaged it, but felt it would be
alright and not need stitches or tetanus shot as I had recently had one.  It
healed, but for several years whenever I parted my hair differently it would
hurt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Mom didn’t learn to drive until I was a
teenager</b> so dad either drove us places or we rode the bus.  The bus stop
was across the street.  I can remember standing at the bus stop with Mom and
riding the bus to Ogden to go shopping.  I remember, when I was a little girl,
walking with Mom as we shopped and I had a hard time keeping up with her as she
walked so fast.  Now I have to slow down, when I walk with her, as she can’t
walk very fast now that she is older.  But, I still enjoy walking with her and
being with her.  Mom would spoil me sometimes, especially when I was a teenager
and we went to Samuel’s sale.  She would be excited when I would try on clothes
that looked cute on me, and say “let’s get it for you”.  I knew that was a
sacrifice as my parents didn’t have much money.  Throughout my life, she has
always liked to give me clothes and other things as well.  In fact, I rarely
left Mom’s house without something in my arms that she had given me.  Sometimes
it was clothes, sometimes bread or cookies, fruit or vegetables or maybe some
stew she had made.  Many times it was something for Ken or the children too. 
Some times it was a “treasure” she got at a garage sale or a box of cereal she got
at the “Canned Foods” store.  Now that she is gone (today’s date 4/28/2000) I
don’t want to go to the “Canned Foods” store because I took her to that store  often,
and it brings back all those memories, and makes me sad as I miss her.</p>

very long.  Bonnie Draper is next to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the summer before the third grade a new friend, <b>Patricia
Kleitches (Pat)</b> moved in three houses away from me.  Actually they moved
into a duplex apartment that one of our neighbors owned behind her home.  Pat
was an only child and we became fast friends.  She was tall and I was a lot
shorter than her, but we really enjoyed each other.  She wasn't a member of the
church, but her parents let her attend church with me.  They were not very good
parents.  Her mother had Pat do most of the housework, and always the dishes. 
If Pat left any water spots on a glass or any food on a dish, etc., her mother
would make her wash and dry all the dishes over again.  Her mother would run
her fingers over the top of the stove and if there was any grease on it, she
would make her scrub it all over again.  Many times we had something planned so
Pat would hurry to get them done, and her mother would make her do them again,
thus making us late or canceling our plans.  I was nervous when I went to her
house because her mother was so nervous that I might break something or bring
dirt into the house, etc.  Her dad didn't like our church and was always
confronting me with things like: &quot;How come your church tells your people
you can't smoke or drink?  When I would explain, he'd say &quot;well I work
with some of your people and they sure smoke and drink, step out on their
wives, swear, take the Lord's name in vain, etc., etc., etc.  He was a
character.  I wondered, over the years, if maybe Pat's parents had had to get
married and so they blamed Pat, as they sure were not very good to her.  For
Christmas they would buy each other lots of nice clothes, shoes, appliances for
Hazel, (her Mom) guns, etc., for Robert/Bob (her dad), but they would hardly
buy Pat anything at all, and what they did buy her was usually from the Deseret
Industries or other thrift stores.  They wouldn't give her the money to join
sports or clubs at school or do extracurricular things.  One thing they did do
for her though was to let her take accordion lessons with me and they bought
her a nice accordion.  Two of our other friends, Margie &amp; Joanne took these
lessons with us too.  Pat became the most proficient on it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Pat's parents did invite me to go fishing a
couple of times with them, and Pat and I had fun.  Her parents weren't all bad,
but I sure appreciated my parents when I would be around hers.  Her mother
yelled at her a lot.  Her Mom was quite sickly (probably why she was so
temperamental) so was in the hospital quite a bit.  One day when we were
teenagers, Pat said &quot;I hate my dad&quot;  I said &quot;Oh, I know you get
upset with him and I don't blame you, but you can't hate him&quot;.  She said
&quot;Mae, if your dad did to you what my dad does to me, you would hate your
dad too.&quot;  She then proceeded to tell me how he abused her sexually
whenever her mother was in the hospital or out of town, and would threaten her
not to tell her mother or anyone.  Boy that blew me away.  I had never heard
much of sexual abuse at that time - so I was shocked.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>When I was growing up, Mom needed my help with cleaning
house, laundry, meals, tending the younger children, etc</b>.  I didn't think
it was fair that my brothers didn't have to help.  Dad had grown up on a farm
and thought boys should do outside work and girls should help their mothers and
do the inside work.  The problem with that was - I only had one sister and she
was almost 11 years younger than I and I had four brothers.  They only had the
lawns to mow in the summer and the chickens to feed.  Sometimes they had to help
weed the garden, but I did too.  Oh, they had to take out the garbage too (Big
deal) Sometimes <b>Hal would sit around teasing me while I was doing dishes,
etc.  He would say &quot;work harder slave&quot;.  He'd laugh and say, &quot;I
can go play with friends, or do anything I want, but you have to stay here and
work, work, work - work harder slave.&quot; </b> Sometimes I'd get so upset and
tell him to get the heck out of here - to go to his friends then.  One time I
got so angry that I threw a glass at him.  (Sure glad he ducked)  I got in
trouble for that.  I am thankful that even though I complained and thought it
was unfair then, I am thankful I was taught the value of work.  My mom &amp;
dad used a “switch” which they kept on the top of the top cupboard by the
door.  Whenever they asked us to do something and we didn’t do it or complained
or were fighting with each other, they would get the “switch” (small, long tree
branch) down and threaten to use it on us.  I don’t remember them using it on
me, but I think they did on Hal a time or two.  I remember Mom counting to five
as a means of getting us to do things also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Our family went on a vacation</b> a few times
while I was growing up.  We usually went to Southern Utah - Bryce's Canyon, Zion’s,
or to visit relatives who lived in southern Utah. It was great. I enjoyed these
trips very much and loved doing things and going places with the family.  I had
2 cousins who were close to my age – Joyce was 6 months younger and lived in
Fillmore and Koye was 6 months older and lived in Henryville.  Koye would get
to come up sometimes in the summer and stay with Grandpa and Grandma and we had
lots of fun together and became good friends.  I was also able to stay at
Joyce’s home for a week some summers and we had lots of fun together and became
good friends.  Whenever we had a family reunion, us three cousins loved it so
we could be together again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember stopping at <b>Brown's Ice Cream Store</b>
in Ogden where Dad would buy us an ice cream cone for a treat when we were
coming back from visiting our grandparents in Richville, Morgan County, or when
we were in Ogden for other reasons.  I usually choose Green Pineapple.  That
was my favorite.  After the soft ice cream came in and we had drive-ins, we
sometimes stopped at the Arctic Circle in Roy for an ice cream cone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went on picnics up Weber canyon sometimes. 
Those were always great times.  Sometimes, in the summer, Mom would have us
kids set up a card table out on the front lawn and we would have a picnic
supper out there.  When I was younger I liked it, but when I was a teenager, I
was embarrassed that cars passing by would see us and think that was strange,
and maybe some of my friends would be in those cars.  We didn’t have lawn in
back of the house, just buildings, a garden, fruit trees and before Sunset City
bought some of dad’s property to make the Sunset Park, we had chickens and a
cow back there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Sunday church was different back then</b>. 
First, the men and Aaronic Priesthood young men would go to Priesthood Meeting
at 8:00 am.  Sunday School started at 10 a.m. and was for everyone.  We had
opening exercises first which consisted of opening song, prayer, 2 two and a
half minute talks by the youth, and music time when the chorister would teach
us a new hymn or go over some of the other hymns with us.  We would then
separate for class.  Sacrament Meeting was at 5 or 7 PM.  In those days the
parents sat with their young children, but the older children and teenagers sat
with their friends.  They changed this a few years later and asked parents to
have all their children sit with them.  I’m sure this is because they could see
the older children and teenagers were not paying attention to the speakers,
they were whispering to each other and goofing off.  Many times when my
brothers and sister were young, Mom would have either Hal or I or both of us
stay home and tend the younger children.  Later on, parents were asked not to
do this either as they told the parents that even if you think you’re not
getting much out of the meetings because your babies &amp; younger children are
acting up, they need to be there with you to learn how to be reverent.  Mom
didn’t usually go to Sunday School, instead she would stay home and cook our
wonderful Sunday dinner for us, so it would be ready shortly after we got home
from Sunday School.  Mom would make roast beef, potatoes, brown gravy,
vegetable (peas, beans or corn), Jell-O salad with fruit in, and a delicious cake. 
Sometimes it had 7 minute frosting on, other times Carmel, chocolate or white.

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            I enjoyed my Junior High and High School
days.</b>  Eleanor Ewing moved into our ward during our 7th grade.  Pat &amp; I
were best friends, but Eleanor and I became good friends also.  We had another
friend, Patsy Morris, who lived close to Eleanor.  She wasn't a member of the
church either.  She had nice parents.  I grew up with Patsy, and she and I used
to play together in grade school, however, she was moody quite a bit of the
time and I didn't enjoy that. When we were in the 9th grade, Pat and her
parents moved to Syracuse.  I felt really bad, but her and I still did a lot
together and would stay the weekends with each other sometimes (or at least
Friday nights.  I'd usually go home the next morning if I stayed at her house).
I remember one time Pat &amp; I were eating breakfast with her parents and got
the giggles.  Her mother told us to stop, but we couldn't.  She said if we
couldn't stop laughing, we should leave the table – we couldn’t stop so we did
leave the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Eleanor &amp; Patsy had become good friends, but
they took me in, after Pat moved and we became a threesome.  We had our main
group of friends – Joanne Hill, Margie Martin, Corrine Larsen (they lived in
the Sunset 1st ward, but we had grown up together and did a lot together) then
Eleanor, Patsy, Pat, Bonnie, Connie &amp; myself.  Connie &amp; Bonnie were
really cute, had plenty of money so had the latest fashions in clothes and were
very popular.  We didn't do as much with them (as they thought they were too
good for us) Bonnie was a cheerleader and she was voted the queen of several of
the school dances.  She always gave me a hard time.  She teased me about being
&quot;Preacher Porter&quot; and would say in Sunday School or MIA &quot;let
Preacher Porter say the prayer&quot;.  She always tried to make me look foolish
in one way or another.  If we were in a group and I tried to add to the
conversation, she would try to belittle me.  I've often wondered why.  Some have
said that she was jealous of me, but why would she be jealous?  She had
everything going for her.  She did a couple of terrible things to me that I had
a hard time forgiving her for, but think I have now.  However, I can still
vividly remember them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One incident happened while I was working
part-time at the Arctic Circle in Roy.   During this time, <b>Bonnie</b> played
up to me to get information about Geneal who was Bonnie's boyfriend's EX
girlfriend.  I didn't tell Bonnie anything bad about Genial as there wasn't
anything bad to say about her.  She was a neat girl and I really liked her. 
Bonnie came to the Arctic Circle one day when I wasn't there and told the other
girls that I was spying for her and telling her everything I could about Genial. 
The other girls really shunned me and were upset with me until I found out the
cause of it.  I finally convinced them that I hadn't said anything bad and that
I was Genial’s friend.  I was really upset with Bonnie, but I tried to forgive
her.</p>

align=left hspace=12>Soon after Ken and I were married, Bonnie came to me and
said what a wonderful reception we had, and that since her and David Jacobs
were getting married soon, could I help her?  I told her where we got our
invitations, napkins, decorations, etc., and that I had rented my wedding dress
and where I rented it.  She said she thought that was a good idea to rent it as
you only use it once.  She looked at our picture and saw my wedding dress again
and said that it was beautiful, but that she wouldn't rent my dress if she
decided to rent a wedding dress.  She later told me that she had rented a
dress, but that it was not the one I had rented, and she thanked me for my
help.  She asked me and my friends to serve at her reception.  I had to go
early, so I went with Eleanor and her mother.  What should I find when I got
there? - Everything was the same as mine, only much more elaborate.  She used
the same colors - blue and pink, the same napkin idea, same decorations, only
like I said - more elaborate.  She held it in the stake house instead of our
chapel where I did.  Then when I went through the line<b>, I was so stunned to
find she was wearing my wedding dress that I could hardly speak to he</b>r. 
Eleanor's mother told me, when we were talking afterwards, that I should be
flattered that Bonnie thought I had such good taste that she wanted to copy
me.  I wouldn't have been so upset except that Bonnie had told me she didn't
rent my dress.  And I knew that behind all this she mainly wanted to outdo me. 
She had always tried to do this, and usually she succeeded because my family
didn't have as much money as hers because her mother worked, and mine didn't. 
I was glad that my mother didn't work, however, and that when I came home from
school, she was there, and many times I would walk into the house and smell fresh
homemade bread. Maybe that was the reason she was jealous of me.   </p>

took me awhile to forgive her of this, but what the heck, I'm happy with my
life and my family and so I hope she is with hers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I saw her and her husband in the Celestial room
at the Ogden Temple in Feb. of 1998, we hugged and had a good visit.  Her and
David have strong testimonies and have raised a wonderful family, so that’s
great.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My parents wanted their children to have
opportunities for music and dance so <b>I took tap dancing</b> lessons from Mr.
&amp; Mrs. Albright for three years - 2nd to 5th grades.  My friends, Margie
Martin and Bonnie Draper took them with me.  Also, a boy from South Weber, Paul
Thorpe took lessons with us.  We had fun being in recitals and performing in
the ward, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>My Accordion </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was twelve, my parents let me take
accordion lessons which I took for four years.  Mom &amp; Dad had bought the
accordion for Hal, but he didn't want to practice and didn't like it so they
gave it to me.  Later on,Hal they bought me a new one.  I loved the new one, it
was red and white.  I still have it.  As I mentioned earlier, Pat was able to
take accordion lessons with me plus two of our other friends, Margie and
Joanne.  Mr. Berry, our teacher, came out to Sunset and taught us in the church
for awhile, then he got a studio in Ogden and we went there.  Soon he had
enough students that we formed an accordion band and met one day a week for
lessons and another day for the band lessons.  We met a lot of neat kids and
flirted with the cute boys.  For the 24th of July celebration one year, Mr. Berry
had a float built and we all got to ride on it and play our accordions. 
Afterwards we played at the city park where there was also other entertainment
and concessions.  My friends and I played in ward and MIA activities.  One time
Pat and I played a duet at a ward activity.  That was fun, however, another
time I was asked to play a solo at a Ward Christmas party.  That was not fun. 
When I had my friends, I was confident and was able to do fine, but all by
myself, that was another story and I was really nervous so my fingers went cold
and I did awful.</p>

align=left hspace=12>When we were living in Clearfield, the ward had a talent
show, had heard that I played and asked me to be in it.  I decided to play <b>&quot;Washington
Post March</b>&quot;.  I practiced a lot, memorized it and got so I could play
it really well.  However, the night of the performance, I got scared again, my
fingers went cold (which isn't good when you have to play a song that is a fast
tempo) I made a lot of mistakes and felt awful, but I received compliments
anyway.  In fact, a young man in our ward, who had just come home from his
mission and was starting up a band approached me and asked if I would join his
band.  I was really honored because he was a very talented young man.  He told
me who the others were in the band, and they were great also.  I told him I
would think about it because we would be moving to Arizona shortly.  I later
called and declined saying that since Ken was already working in Arizona
and just flying home for weekends and I had young children, it would be difficult
to get away for the practices and I would be busy packing.  I also felt it
wouldn't be fair to him for me to just be in for such a short time.  He said he
was disappointed, but would honor my wishes.  I have later regretted not taking
the opportunity to do this.  It might have made a great difference in my life. 
I might have gotten more confidence and kept up with my accordion.  It would
have been great for the family for family home evenings, camping, etc., to sing
when I accompanied them on the accordion.  I really missed out and mainly it
was because of fear.  Fear is of the devil.  He doesn't want us to progress.  I
hope my family will learn from my mistake - to take advantage of
opportunities.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>            I did take advantages of a few other opportunities
to play my accordion.  Somehow the word usually leaked out in wards where we
lived, that I could play.  I was asked to play at a High Priest party and a
Relief Society Birthday Party while living in Erda.  A few months later,
another woman moved into our ward who was very talented on the piano and
accordion.  Her name was Susan Derricott.  Susan and I were asked to play an
accordion duet at a ward Christmas party.  That was fun because, here again, I
had someone with me - not a solo.  She was so good that it was fun performing
with her.  She played the hard part and I played the melody.  We received lots
of compliments.    Sandi, Shellie, Mike &amp; David took piano lessons from her
for a while; they later took from a lady at Stansberry Park.  Susan was good,
but they didn't like going there because her house was such a mess and her
children unruly.  She was great at music, gardening, etc., and that was where
she spent her time.  They liked the lady at Stansberry Park better because her
home &amp; children were orderly.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Back to my youth</b>.  When I was a sophomore
in High School, I was tired of practicing my accordion and wanted to quit
taking lessons.  Mom was expecting Kim and her varicose veins were so bad that
she had to stay off her feet as much as possible.  I persuaded Mom and my
accordion teacher, Mr. Berry, that I needed to help out more with the home and
children and therefore, would need to quit as I wouldn't have time to
practice.  Mr. Berry was disappointed and told me to not put it up for good,
but to keep playing.  I didn't heed his advice very well though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I started dating when I was in the 8th grade. 
(The church hadn't come up with the standards of dating - no dating until age
16 - at that time) I went to the &quot;Night Dance&quot; that year with Harry
Campbell and thought I was on top of the world as he was one of the most
popular boys.  I was elated when he asked me.  However, I came down sick with
the flu that morning.  I made myself go to school because I knew my parents
wouldn't allow me to go to the dance if I was sick.  I also was afraid that
Harry would wonder why I wasn't at school - so I had to go.  I was still so
sick when he came to get me, but I wouldn't let on to anyone.  We double dated
with Harry’s friend, Jay Barlow &amp; his date.  Jay’s dad drove us.   I didn't
have a very good time because when we went out to eat, I didn't feel like
eating.  I wasn't a very good dancer or conservationist because I was too sick
so neither of us had a very good time.  I should have stayed home where I
belonged, but another reason I didn't was because I didn’t want him to have to
stay home too and it was too late for him to ask anyone else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In the Ninth grade I went with Burt Weaver.  We
were voted to be King and Queen of the &quot;Night Dance&quot; in most of the
home rooms, but then they decided to put the names in a hat and draw one out,
and it wasn't us.  Burt and I had a lot of fun going together.  A few months
later our ward was having a dance.  Most of my girlfriends said they were
going, but when I got there only one of my friends were there.  But there were
lots of boys, even some from Clinton.  They started asking me to dance.  Soon
they were cutting in on each other, and I was having a great time.  Burt also
came to the dance, but every time he asked me to dance, the other boys would
cut in on him.  Finally, he got mad and went home.  When it was almost time for
the dance to end, one of the boys, named Veldon Baird, tried to persuade me to
let him take me home and go out the back way so the other boys wouldn't see us
go.  I asked him why, and he said that something was going to happen, and I'd
better decide quickly.  I didn't know what to do, but I wasn't too worried
because they were all good guys and I trusted them, so I decided to stay and
see what would happen.  During the last dance, they all kept cutting in so fast
that we hardly had time to dance a step or two before the next one would cut
in.  Finally, it was over, and they said they would all walk me home.  When we
got to the door, the one boy who was the last to dance with me (Jimmy Petersen)
grabbed me and kissed me.  They had decided that the last one dancing with me,
when the dance ended, got to kiss me. They would all walk me home, but he would
kiss me.  Guess they forgot one thing - to ask me.  On well, it wasn't so bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At North Davis Jr. High, we had dances in the
gym before school, during lunch break and after school.  They played records.
One of my favorites was &quot;Sincerely&quot;.  Most of the kids attended these
dances.  Those who were going together or going &quot;steady&quot; went right
out on the floor and danced every dance together. Margie Martin was going
steady with Gary Nelson (who she later married) and Bonnie Draper was going
steady with Ronny Pauling.  Boy that was way too young to go steady.  I think
we had these dances at Davis High also.  I can't remember for sure.  Anyway,
the rest of the boys were on one side of the gym and the girls were on the
other side.  A boy my age, Gary Youngberg, liked me and would always come over
to ask me to dance.  Many times, I did dance with him.  He was a good kid, but
he danced so funny that I was embarrassed and didn't like to dance with him. 
Many times, when I would see him coming over, I would hide or talk my friends
into walking the halls with me.  I did like to go to the dances, however, to
dance with other guys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Elvis Presley</b> became popular about this
time.  The first song I remember was <b>“Don’t Be Cruel</b>”.  Wow! I loved
that song.  I still love it.  I bought the record and Pat and I would listen to
it over and over.  I loved a lot of the other songs Elvis sang, but especially
“Don’t Be Cruel”.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Hal and Religion</b>: When Hal and I were in
our teens, <i>one day he asked me why I didn’t open my mind to other religions,
why I believed everything our parents taught us.</i>  He told me that I should
go to other churches and investigate them.  Hal didn’t like going to church. 
He was expected to by our parents, but he didn’t want to go, so he never
studied the scriptures or rarely prayed – so he never gained a testimony of the
gospel<i>.  I said to him “Why would I want to do that?  I know for sure that
this is the true church, I have had my prayers answered and have felt the
spirit of the Holy Ghost testifying to me that it is the true church.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Pat, myself &amp; the Savior</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was about 14, my best friend, Pat
Kleitches and I were babysitting for a family in the ward.  They had asked me
to tend their children and I asked if Pat could come along.  Pat’s parents
weren’t members of our church, so, of course, she wasn’t either.  They were
antagonistic to the church and forbid Pat to join.  They had allowed her to go
to church with me.  She had always gone to Sunday School, Primary, M.I.A. and
sometimes Sacrament Meeting with me.  They had moved from Pennsylvania to
Sunset, Utah when Pat was seven years old.  She lived on the highway about 4
houses away from me.  We had become best friends.  Pat and I had discussions
about the church many times.  On this particular night, after the children were
asleep, Pat and I began discussing the church again.  I bore my testimony to
her and we began to feel the spirit of the Lord.  All of a sudden, I looked
over at the big chair which was to my left.  It was aglow.  There was a
beautiful brightness and in the middle of it was Jesus Christ - or an angel. 
I’m not sure which, although we felt it was Christ.  I was so filled with the
love of this being that I immediately began to cry.  Pat began crying almost at
the same time.  When I looked again, he was gone.  We cried and cried for a
long time.  When we at last gained composure, she said, “Mae, did you see
Christ?”  I nodded yes, and we hugged each other.  She had seen him the exact
same time I had, but he didn’t stay long, just long enough for us to see him
sitting in that chair and to feel his presence.  It was such a beautiful
experience and I know it helped to instill the desire in Pat’s heart to join
the church. Her parents wouldn’t let her join while she was in their home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>**I had e-mailed Pat the experience entitled “Pat, Me and
the Savior” to ask if I had recorded it corrected &amp; to make any changes if
she remembered it differently.  This was her reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Girls Camp</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The summer between my Freshman and Sophomore
years, I went to MIA camp up at Bear Lake.  We had lots of fun and I met three
boys with whom I wrote to for about a year.  Especially John &amp; Glen.  They
were quite the characters.  They wrote mushy love letters.  At camp, my friends
and I were the oldest, so the leaders were lenient with us.  We sunbathed on
the beach.  That’s where we met these boys.  There was also an inside swimming
pool right by the park where we camped.  That’s where I first experienced
kissing underwater.  Glen had talked me into kissing him underwater and when we
came up, the younger girls were up on the balcony, had watched us and were
laughing. (Not sure why I didn't get in trouble with the leaders.  Guess the
girls didn’t tell on me.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I always loved camp and went every year.  Our
stake had purchased some land but were developing it and building a lodge, so
we went other places until they had it finished. The first year we went to the
Meadows in the canyon up east of Huntsville, the second year we went to Lava
Hot Springs and stayed in cabins by the river.  We had lots of fun swimming in
the pools, soaking in the hot tubs, eating good food, etc.  The next year we
went to Bear Lake and the last year we did go to our stake camp.  I remember
helping to take the younger girls on a &quot;snipe hunt&quot; that year.  It
was fun.  We had them take their flashlights, we took them out in the woods,
gave them a paper sack and told them to call &quot;here snippy, here
snippy&quot; and snipes would run into their bag.  I'm not sure they knew what
a snipe was (no such thing) or that we told them anything about them.  One
Beehive girl came back crying and showed us a hole in her paper sack.  She said
one had run in, but had escaped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I guess because of my love for girl’s camp, I
was involved in the camping program in several of the stakes where we lived
after I was married. But one thing for sure, we had stricter rules when I was a
leader, than when I was a girl.  I guess I realized, from my experience, that
boys shouldn't be allowed in camp.  I hadn’t done anything really bad, but
kissing boys you hardly know, isn't too appropriate.  I'm sure my mother
wouldn't have approved.  I don't think I was &quot;boy-crazy&quot; as some of
the girls seemed to be, but I did enjoy the attention that some of the boys
gave me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            These older teenage years can be full of fun,
they can be hard, and they can be dangerous.  I wanted to have lots of fun and
I did.  I think, for the most part, I was a good girl - obedient &amp;
respectful to my parents &amp; others.  I always knew I wanted to be married in
the temple, but looking back I don't think I was as careful as I should have
been.  I didn't &quot;make-out&quot; with boys (well, maybe a couple of times),
but I enjoyed the &quot;good-night kisses &amp; hugs&quot;.  I can see the
wisdom the Prophets had in giving the council “not to date until age 16&quot;. 
That council didn’t come out until after I was married.  The world is getting
more and more immoral and the temptations are getting greater because Satan is
making a great thrust before the second coming of the Lord, Jesus Christ, and
so the leaders of the Church are giving more council to keep us on the right
path, if we will just heed their council.  Some of this council is: not dating
until age 16, not watching “R” rated movies, dressing modestly, etc.  If we
will follow the prophet, we will be safe from Satan’s grasp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I'd like to insert a couple of paragraphs
including a small example <b>Elder Marlin K. Jensen</b> of the Seventy gave in
a talk entitled &quot;A Union of Love and Understanding&quot;.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            “A very natural and wonderful consequence of
becoming a person capable of great love is described in this passage: &quot;For
intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth
embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light: (D&amp;C
88:40)  If we pursue the goal of an eternal marriage with purity and with both
our hearts and our minds, I believe in most cases we will eventually be
rewarded with a companion who is at least our spiritual equal and who will
cleave unto intelligence and light as we do, who will receive wisdom as we
receive it, who will embrace truth as we embrace it, and who will love virtue
as we love it.  To spend the eternities with a companion who shares the most
important fundamental values with us and who will discuss them, live them, and
join in teaching them to children is among the most soul-satisfying experiences
of true romantic love.  To know that there will be someone who walks a parallel
path of goodness and growth with us and yearns for the same eternal values and
happiness is of great comfort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I witnessed a powerful example of this principle
recently as I sealed a young couple in the Salt Lake Temple.  After I had
performed the sealing ceremony and the couple had exchanged rings and embraces,
I asked them to share their feelings about each other and the Lord.  The new
bride spoke first.  Her brief remarks expressed both gratitude and emotion as
she told how from her very youngest years she had desired to keep herself
virtuous and had hoped to find a companion who shared her values and righteous
aspirations.  She confirmed the goodness of her new husband by witnessing that
he was all she had hoped for and more.  Then the young husband spoke.  He, too,
was tearful as he shared how at age fourteen he had begun to pray to the Lord
that the wife of his future, whoever she might be, would be protected and would
keep herself virtuous while preparing for an eternal marriage.  He also told
how he had committed himself again and again over the years to that same path. 
Then he expressed his great joy at having met this wife of his prayers, and he
mentioned his high hopes for a truly exceptional marriage.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This is the kind of relationship that our
Heavenly Father wishes for all of his children.  None of his faithful children
will miss out on the opportunity for eternal marriage with one who is equally
prepared for eternal life.  Virtue loveth virtue! Truth embraceth truth!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I will insert here that this is what I hope and
pray for - for all our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, etc. Ken
and I do have this kind of relationship and it is so wonderful and brings us so
much joy and happiness.  It isn't a perfect marriage, we still occasionally get
upset with each other, but not for long.  We forgive each other and try
harder.  We pray continually that we will endure to the end and be able to have
each other for eternity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Well, back to my youth</b> - I dated quite a
bit in High School.  I dated some boys from my high school and some from Ben
Lomond High.  Dennis Ewing had moved out to Sunset and his friends came out to
visit him.  Me and my friends met them and started dating them.  We double
dated most of the time and had lots of fun.  We went to dances, movies, or just
went for a ride and got a cheese burger, fries and shake.  We also went to our
homes and learned new dance steps together or played games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=157 height=221
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image023.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>This is how we met the boys from Ben Lomond High: When I
got back from camp at Bear Lake, we met four boys from Ben Lomond High who were
riding around in a red convertible.  Actually, we saw them come into Sacrament
Meeting and sit in the back.  Remember, I said we sat with friends, rather than
families in those days.  I usually walked my friends partway home after the
meeting and then they would walk me partway back - so we could talk and be together. 
This afternoon, these boys rode past us, honked and waved.  We waved back so
they turned around, came back, stopped and asked if we would like to go for a
ride.  There were several of us, but we piled in.  We weren't worried about
being kidnapped, etc., like we would be in today's world.  I'm not sure how we
all fit in, we were like sardines, but it was fun.  After awhile we told them
we needed to get home or our parents would be worried.  Since we were down west
of town, they started dropping off my friends who lived the farthest down. 
They dropped off Bonnie &amp; Connie, then Margie &amp; Joanne, then the next
one to be dropped off was Eleanor and then I would be left alone in the car
with those four boys.  When I realized it, I whispered to Eleanor my fear.  She
said for me to get out with her and we would pretend we were sisters.  We did,
they acted surprised, but didn't say much.  I went in her house and after
awhile she said she would walk me part-way home.  As we were walking, they
drove by, stopped and asked what we were doing.  I had to confess that she was
walking me home as I was nervous about being in the car alone with them since I
didn't really know them.  They laughed and said they knew we were not sisters. 
We talked for awhile longer and Dallas Hemsley (the owner of the car) asked if
I would help him wash his car on Saturday if we did it at my home, so he could
get to know me better.   Dennis Ewing had recently moved to Sunset, and these
were his friends from Ogden, when he used to live. Dennis and his friends were
all seniors at Ben Lomond High.  Dennis had told these friends to come out and
go to Sacrament Meeting with him and maybe they could meet some cute girls. 
When they saw us in Sacrament Meeting, <b>Dallas </b>had told the others<b>
&quot;I get the sunburned girl in the white dress&quot;.  </b>That was me. 
(The white dress is the one I wore when I had my picture taken at age 16.)  Anyway,
I consented to help Dallas wash his car, but on Saturday morning I forgot and
was sleeping in when Dad came in to wake me and tell me that a boy was waiting
for me in the front room.  Dad said the boy told him that I had agreed to help
him wash his red convertible.  I quickly dressed and went into the front room
and found him reading a &quot;Parents magazine” which dad had given him to read
while he waited for me.  I had to laugh at that. We had fun washing his car.  I
found out that Dallas was active in the church and we started going together</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sometime later, Dallas traded in his convertible
for an Oldsmobile.  It had leaded pipes, etc., - really a neat car.  He hung
fur dice (trademark of the 50's) from the rearview mirror.  You could always
hear when Dallas was around because of the leaded pipes on his car.  Since
Dallas &amp; I were going together, and Eleanor started dating Dennis, we
double dated a lot.  Vern Barker and Bob Mansfield dated different girls from
Sunset off and on - so we had a fun time together.  At onetime, Vern was dating
Carol Fisher.  She was a year younger than me.  We had lots of fun going to
dances, drive-in movies, bowling or parties at each other's homes.  Many time
we would just go to get something to eat - hamburgers, fries, malts or Cherry
Cokes (Cherry Root beers when I dated Dallas because he wouldn't buy me a coke)
at the Arctic Circle or A &amp; W Root beer, and go for a ride. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Between my sophomore and senior years, I went
with Dallas, Vern and Bob off and on along with Ted Fifield and other boys from
Davis.  Dallas was getting serious and talking about marriage and how we would
bronze our first child's shoes, and I certainly wasn't ready for marriage at
that time of my life - so I lost interest in him and started treating him
indifferently.  Bob made the statement to Eleanor that no girl would treat him
like that and get away with it.  Later I started going with him, and soon he
also was getting serious.  It turned me off and I started treating him the way
I had Dallas.  He wouldn't break up with me.  He was starting to call my
parents, &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Dad&quot;.  Mom just laughed, but it really
upset Dad.  He was afraid that I would marry Bob and he didn't want that.  Bob
was an only child and really spoiled, and he wasn't very active in the church. 
Bob joined the Air force and wrote to me and sent me a beautiful 8x10 picture
of him in uniform.  He signed on it &quot;All my Love, Reny&quot; (His nickname
was Reny).  I sat it on my dresser, and every time dad came into my room he
would put it in my drawer.  I laughed about it.  I wasn't worried about getting
married, but poor dad was.  Later, however, I received a letter from Reny
telling me that he was getting me an engagement ring, and would bring it to me
on his leave.  I was surprised and wrote back telling him I wasn't ready to get
married.  I was only a Junior in High School.  When he came home on leave, he
was upset that I wouldn't accept his ring, and we had a long talk.  He reached
in his glove compartment and took out a pack of cigarettes and started
smoking.  Wow! I was glad I broke up with him.  He wrote later telling me that
he had met a nice girl in California and that they were going to get married. 
He said he would never forget me, but that he wanted to get married now.  I was
relieved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Vern was the boy I liked best.  He was really
handsome, a neat dancer and fun to be with.  When we would go to dances, Vern
would swing me under his legs, side to side, up high, etc.  It was lots of
fun.  One night, soon after we started going together and I had just broke up
with Reny the first time, we stopped at a drive-in.  Reny was driving by and
saw us, drove in by us, got out and started arguing with Vern that he was
stealing his girl and they started fighting.  (Oh brother, but I was scared.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Vern was a lady’s man. My mother knew his dad
and said his dad was the same way and she was worried that if I got serious
with him and ended up marrying him, he probably would be unfaithful.  While he
was going with me, he was going with two other girls in Ogden.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One time when I was on a date with Vern and we
double dated with Eleanor &amp; Dennis, they stopped at a drive-in in Ogden
and bought us all hamburgers and really large drinks.  Then we went riding
around out in the Plain City area.  We got a flat tire and while Vern &amp;
Dennis went to a house to borrow a jack to fix the tire, Eleanor &amp; I had to
go to the bathroom so bad from drinking so much pop, that we stepped outside
the car and as it was dark and out in the country, we proceeded to quickly
squat there by the car.  It was during the winter - so was really cold.  When
the guys came back, one of them slipped on some ice by the tire and remarked
that they hadn't noticed ice there earlier.  Eleanor &amp; I looked at each
other and smiled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Vern joined the Air force with Bob, and came
home on leave and married Gale, one of the other girls he had been dating.  In
fact, he was going steady with her before he even met me.  I was disappointed,
but my parents were really happy as they didn't approve of him.  I am really
thankful now too.  Dallas was active in the church and they liked him, but not
the others.  Dallas was tall, dark and handsome and a smart dresser.  The
younger girls in our ward really thought he was neat and they swooned over him
when he would come to church with me or to our church dances.  He also had neat
cars -  the red convertible, and then the Oldsmobile.   After we broke up, that
Christmas Eve, he came out and circled around the church several times. 
Finally, Mom told me to go out as he must want to talk to me and didn't have
the nerve to come to the door.  He had brought me a beautiful necklace for
Christmas.  I saved it because it was so beautiful, and I still wear it now and
always get compliments on it.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            While at Davis High, I was in Pro Scola (the
school drill team) my senior year.  You had to be a senior to be in it.  It
wasn't like the drill teams are now.  We wore modest clothes and didn't do
suggestive routines.  Not all drill teams of today are this way, but many are. 
Our outfits consisted of a long, flare dress with vest, a cute hat, brown socks
and brown &amp; white oxford shoes.  We marched during halftime at all the home
games - football and basketball and ended up by making a &quot;D&quot; with the
dart going through it (which was our symbol) and everyone would stand and sing
the school song.  &quot;Dear Old Davis High School&quot;.  All my children know
that song by heart as I sang it a lot especially whenever we drove by Davis
High, and also &quot;North Davis Junior High&quot; school song as we drove by North
 Davis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The words to Davis High's school song are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        Dear Old Davis High School</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        We'll shine for you</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        We'll shine for Davis, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        we're up to stuff we never, never, never
bluff</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        Against the men from Davis,
none can progress</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        Three cheers for Davis, our D (D) H
(H) S (S)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        (repeat - Against the men from Davis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The words to North Davis Jr High's song are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One experience I'd like to relate happened when
I was a junior in High School.  A cute boy sat in front of me in my Seminary
class.  We used to flirt back &amp; forth and visited before and after class. 
He had been going steady with another girl.  He broke up and asked me for a
date.  I accepted, he got my phone number and said he would call me later that
night to tell me what time he would pick me up.  I happened to tell a friend of
mine about the date.  She looked at me surprised and said, &quot;Do you realize
what kind of a guy he is?&quot;  I said I supposed he was a good kid - he was
taking seminary.  She told me that he wasn't a good kid - that he had a bad
reputation and that the girl he had been going with was on the &quot;wild&quot;
side.  She had heard that he couldn't keep his hands to himself when he was on
a date.  She said, &quot;if I were you, I would cancel that date&quot;.  I
asked others about the girl he had been dating and they verified that she had a
bad reputation also.  I wasn't sure how to get out of the date, but knew I had to. 
I didn't have the courage to tell him I couldn't go since I had already
accepted his date - so I went home and took the phone off the hook, so he
couldn't call me.  We had a phone downstairs and that was the one I took off
the hook.  My parents probably wondered why they didn't get any calls that
evening.  Anyway, the next day he told me he had tried several times to call
me, but the line was always busy.  He asked for another date and I declined. 
Soon after he got back together with his former girlfriend and that was good. 
It taught me a lesson to get to know a guy more before you accept dates from
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I always wanted to be a secretary as long as
I can remember.</b>  Pat and I determined that we would both graduate from High
School and then go to Henagar’s Business College, graduate and become
secretaries.  Well, we both ended up marrying young and didn't go to any
college.  I wish both Ken &amp; I had gone to college, we would have been much
better off financially.  I never wanted to work while I raised my family, but a
degree would have been good for me to fall back on now.  I am a secretary now
and I do enjoy it, but if I had a degree from either Henagar's or another
college, I would be making much more money.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I took lots of secretarial classes during high
school - Type I &amp; II, Shorthand I &amp; II, Accounting I &amp; II, Business
Machines, Office Practice and was a secretarial aid for the Dean of Girls -
Mrs. Carol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>My teenage years were during the 50's and
that was a great time to live</b>.  The clothes were fun.  We wore lots of full
slips.  Some were soft and had yards &amp; yards of materials in them, others
were made of net and we would starch them with heavy starch and let them drip
dry on the clothes line.  We had full skirts - some were felt with poodles on,
others were pleated or gathered plaid skirts.  We also wore long tight skirts
with cute sweaters or white blouses worn with colored scarves.  Jansen sweaters
were the “in” thing.  They were expensive, but Mom would buy me one or two when
they were on sale.  We also had large flowers - a rose, etc., that we wore on
our sweaters.  Sometimes we wore the fluffy dice around our necks and the guys
had them hanging from the rearview mirror in their cars.  We wore
&quot;Joyce&quot; shoes or saddle oxfords with white bobby socks.  We also wore
a lot of cardigan sweaters.  The coats were long.  We wore our hair in pony
tails a lot like is depicted in the 50's movies or many other hair styles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Joanne was &quot;sort of&quot; the leader of our
group of friends, and she talked us into wearing the same type of clothes on
certain days.  (I guess so everyone else knew we were all friends and ran
around together) She would tell us what to wear each day.  It was kind of fun
at first, but later Pat &amp; I resented it and decided we would wear just opposite
to what she told us.  When we did, and she would ask us why, we'd say &quot;Oh,
did you tell us to wear full skirts?&quot;  We called her &quot;King Kong&quot;
behind her back (Oh boy, I'm not proud of all the things I have done in my life
- guess my family should know the bad along with the good.  Hopefully the good
outweighs the bad).  Joanne, Margie &amp; Bonnie became cheerleaders in High
School.  Eleanor, Patsy, Corrine, Connie &amp; I were in the drill team.  Pat's
parents didn't allow her to try out for the drill team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>ARTIC CIRCLE</b>: When I was
fifteen, I wanted to get a job, so I put in an application at the new A &amp; W
Root Beer Drive-in.  They were one of the places during the 50s that were like
the “Sonic” is now.  You would drive in next to a stand and a girl on roller-skates
would come out and take your order.  When the order was ready, she would bring
it out and you would pay her for the order and “tip” her if you felt like it. 
I was hired and worked there for a while, but I didn’t like it that much.  The
tips were pretty good, but you took some guff too.  I saw that they were hiring
at the Arctic Circle in Roy, so I applied there and got on.  I enjoyed it there
much better as the customers just walked up to the windows and ordered from
there.  There was usually a cook (a guy about our age) and two girls there at
one time.  Our schedules changed so I got to know all of the guys and girls who
worked there.  They were all from Weber High and since I was from Davis, they
all wanted me to trade with them whenever there was a special sports game or
activity or dance.  That made it great, as I could always get one of them to
trade with me whenever I wanted to go to a dance or game, etc.  DelGarn Smith
was the owner and he wasn’t the greatest.  We had cash registers at each window,
but he wouldn’t allow us to write down the orders, we had to keep them in our
head and then add it up on the cash register for the customers.  He wouldn’t
allow us to let anyone stand in line, so we had to get all the orders and it
was really hard remembering all of them.  The cook had to remember also.  It
was really hard when there was a crowd.  We had to make the drinks, floats,
shakes, malts and cones and put the hot dogs together with the catsup, mustard
&amp; relish.  The cook would make the hamburgers and fries and help us when he
wasn’t busy.  We weren’t always really busy, so we could visit with each other,
but when DelGarn was around, we had to look busy and keep cleaning things.  He
was really picky and made us weigh the ice cream cones on a scale. It didn’t
take long until we could tell how much ice cream we should put in a cone and,
so we didn’t weigh them when he wasn’t there.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My dad was a wonderful father.  I remember
during my childhood of seeing my father studying the scriptures (which he did
whenever he had a few spare minutes) and going to his meetings.  He was in the
Bishopric for seven years while I was growing up.  George Reed was the Bishop
and Oz Knight was the other counselor.  They put Dad in the High Council for a
few years and later he became a Bishop after I was married.  He had been a
scout master, teacher, High Priest Group Leader and always a home teacher.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad worked hard to support his family.  He
usually had a part-time job along with his full-time job.  He worked for the
Ogden Arsenal and it later was merged in with Hill Air Force Base.  He worked
part-time for Sunset City for awhile, and later he sold about everything there
was to sell from Mason Shoes and vitamins to Life Insurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Dad playing catch with us kids out on
the front lawn a few times.  I have fond memories of his laying down in one of
our beds with us at night telling us stories of &quot;Old Ginger&quot; his
horse and his experiences in growing up on the farm.  We children loved these
times.  I was happy that my parents showed love for each other.  It made me
feel happy and secure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad has always had a strong testimony of the
gospel, has been very faithful in his church callings.  He has always had a
testimony of tithing, fast offerings and other donations and always gave more
than was expected.  I always knew Dad loved me and he would hug me and tell me
so.  When he grew up he didn't get this from his parents, and he missed it - so
he did show love and affection to his family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom didn't sleep very well at nights, so Dad
would usually get up in the mornings and fix cooked wheat cereal for breakfast
or once in awhile Oatmeal.  Dad was very health conscious and knew that wheat
and oatmeal were very good for us, so we grew up with them, plus they were
inexpensive to make, and we didn’t have much money to spare.   Dad's family
didn't have much money, when he was growing up, and they just ate the basics or
stables.  On Saturdays, Mom would usually fix pancakes, French toast or once in
awhile, waffles.  On Sunday mornings we could have cold (prepared) cereal like cheerios,
corn flakes, etc.  I got so sick of wheat cereal and oatmeal (especially wheat
cereal) that after I was married I couldn't even think of fixing it until I had
children and I realized how important it was to their health to have it and, so
I began making it.  I didn't make it every day, however, only about once a
week.  Most of the children didn't like it, but they ate it anyway at least
when they were young.  Ken &amp; I really like it now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad &amp; Mom always took vitamins and minerals
and had us children take them also.  I joke about how my friends would come to
my house when we were in Jr High and High School to wait with me for the school
bus (which would stop at the church next door, and if we weren't watching for
it, Joe would stop in front of my house and honk his horn for us - great bus
driver) They would tease me that dad would chase me around the table to make me
take my vitamins before I left for school.  I don't think it was that bad, but
he was really concerned about our health.  If ever we got colds or became sick,
he didn’t give us much sympathy.  He would say we were sick because we stayed
up too late at night so didn't get enough sleep or because we ate too much
candy and sweets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(See if I wrote someplace else about dad giving me money
when Ken and I were struggling financially.  I didn’t ask for it, but he
sincerely wanted to help us.  He was wonderful.  He told me not to tell Mom as
he had saved this money for such purposes.  Dad also came over and had lunch
with me &amp; the children when we were living in Clearfield.  We were renting
this home from Uncle Dale, Dad’s brother, and dad was retired from the
government and working part-time for Dale.  I loved having him come and the
wonderful conversations we had.  One such conversation was when Ken wanted me
to go on a horse pack-in trip with Larry &amp; Tammy, Bob &amp; Pauline and
John &amp; Linda.  I didn’t want to go because I had gone horse-back riding with
Larry &amp; Tammy before and it had turned out horrible – scratched up,
sunburned, saddle sore and very tired.  I was nursing Mike and knew if I went
for that week in Wyoming with them, I would have to stop nursing him and I
didn’t want to.  Dad told me I should stand up for myself and tell Ken I wasn’t
going.  He told me that I was like my little Grandma Bushnell as she would give
in to Grandpa, but after she started sticking up for herself, Grandpa respected
her more and treated her better.  I did go, and was glad I did as it was such
beautiful country and we passed by beautiful lakes and rivers and we were in a
beautiful forest.  It turned out to be a wonderful trip and we all enjoyed
being together.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(For more information on Dad, refer to the Blue &quot;Byron
Porter Family Descendants&quot; book or the talk I gave at his funeral.  I will
try to find and insert that talk here in the &quot;Parents&quot; section of
this history.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>LETTER I WROTE TO DAD ON MAY 22, 1987</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dear Dad,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for being such a wonderful father.  You have
always been handsome and a great example, so I was always proud to be your
daughter.  Thanks for teaching me the gospel and showing love to me in many
ways.  I have wonderful memories of growing up, many of these were because of
you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for telling us stories of Ginger and your
life as we were growing up.  Thanks for taking time to play “catch” with us on
the front lawn, taking us on picnics up Weber Canyon.  I remember how beautiful
it was, and how fun it was to go exploring while Mom got the food on the picnic
table.  Thanks for taking us up to Morgan to visit Grandpa and Grandma Porter. 
I loved to go there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I appreciate your good sense of humor – how
you’d call us children many times, by funny names, also your grandkids.  You
have such a great “laugh”, and it always made me laugh and be happy when you’d
laugh.  I’ll never forget coming over to visit and seeing you chasing Mom’s cat
with the vacuum cleaner – and how you were laughing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember the fun times when you’d lay on the
floor and “balance” us kids.  The first grandkids enjoyed it too.  A few months
ago, Mike and David were balancing Jeff and Scott, and I knew where they had
learned it from.  Thanks for playing “volleyball” with us at family reunions
and other outings.  You were always so good, and it made it more fun to have
you playing there with us.  Thanks for the good ice cream cones at Browns in
Ogden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After I was married and living in Clearfield,
I’d look forward to you coming over from working at Uncle Dales to have lunch
with me, and we’d have lots of good talks.  I’ve enjoyed the good talks since
also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have always been proud to have you conduct
meetings when you were in the Bishopric, give talks, work in the temple, read
the scriptures, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for the many back rubs and foot rubs. 
They sure made me feel better, and it showed you cared when you’d do these
things for us children.  Another special way you and Mom show you care is by
supporting us when we give talks, have our children blessed, baptized, etc.  Also,
the great sacrifice you have given us, many times, of money, cars, being there
when we need you.  What a great dad you are, and I love you very
much.             Mae</p>

align=left hspace=12>            My mom was a good mother.  She loved her
husband and children very much.  Mom was a good cook and always fixed good,
nutritious meals. I loved the roast beef dinners on Sundays and the cakes with
fluffy icing.  I remember coming home from school to the smell of homemade
bread and was able to eat one or more slices of that good, hot bread.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved hearing mom whistle as she worked.  I
loved going to Samuel's sales with her where she always splurged and bought me
so many nice things.  (Samuel's was an expensive woman's clothes store in Ogden)
Many times she sacrificed for me, spending the money on me instead of her.  Mom
didn't learn to drive for several years and so I remember waiting across the
street at the bus stop and ridding the bus to Ogden to go shopping with Mom and
later Mom &amp; Grandma Bushnell.  That was great fun.  I remember as a child
thinking my mother walked so fast.  I could hardly keep up with her when we
would walk the sidewalks in downtown Ogden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom was a secretary and historian in the primary
organization, both in the ward and stake for several years while I was growing
up.  She loved the Primary organization.  She also taught the Beehive girls in
MIA.  I'm sure she had other positions too, but I can't remember.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom never was a very good housekeeper.  She said
she never learned how - that since she was the oldest child, her mother had her
tend her younger brothers and sister while her mother cleaned the house and
performed the other household chores.  Grandma Bushnell was a very good
housekeeper.  Mom liked a clean house, but couldn’t seem it keep it that way
herself.  She didn’t put things away.  She would fix a meal and then leave many
of the items and dishes out that didn’t need to be put away in the
refrigerator.   When she would do the dishes, she would just wipe off the
cupboard around the items and other things.   I liked a clean house and
couldn’t stand the clutter.   I also think it was born into Georgia and I, like
it was Grandma Bushnell, to like a clean home and be able to keep it that
way.   Many times, when Mom went somewhere for a couple of hours or more, I
would hurry and clean the house to surprise her.  When she came home, she would
walk in, look around and say, &quot;I must be in the wrong house, this doesn't
look like my house, it's too clean&quot;.  I would smile, and she would compliment
and praise me for cleaning it so good.  That was reward enough for me (Good
physiology on Mom's part) However, I didn't think it was fair, when I was
growing up, that I had to do so much homework and the boys didn't.  They would
get things out and not put them away either, so I would get frustrated that the
house wouldn't stay clean.  Mom and I would clean thoroughly every Saturday,
but during the week it would go right back to lots of clutter.  Mom would
usually have me clean the kitchen as well as help clean the rest of the house.
We would change the furniture around many times on Saturdays and I liked that. 
In the summer, I usually went outside, picked a bouquet of flowers and put them
in a vase in the front room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember many times when we saw a car pull up
in the drive-way or in front of the house, we would all hurry (at least mom
&amp; I) and gather up things in the front room and put them in other rooms,
etc., so the front room wouldn't be such a mess when they came to the door.  I
remember throwing things behind the couch, etc., as we didn't have much time. 
Maybe that's why I became such a &quot;fast&quot; house cleaner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was hard on me growing up to have our house
such a mess most of the time.  It didn't matter how much I tried to keep the house
clean, I couldn't stay on top of it as the boys didn't care and left their
toys, books, papers, food dishes &amp; wrappers, etc., etc., all over
everywhere.  I was embarrassed to bring my friends home from school.  Georgia says it was hard for her with this problem - growing up also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I had dates, I cleaned and told the boys
they were not to mess up the front room until after I left with my date.  One
night Mom went with me to a mother and daughter party for the MIA.  My brothers
were home and supposed to tend Georgia &amp; Kim.  Kim was in diapers.  When I
got home they told me that some of my friends (boys) had come to see me.  When
I saw the mess and the dirty diaper on the front room floor, I was horrified
and embarrassed and really upset with Hal and Bryce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One night when a &quot;special&quot; date was
coming, I cleaned and then kept picking up after the boys.  Mom finally became
upset with me, took me by the shoulders, sat me on the couch and told me to
stay there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken said he thought my Mom was a good housekeeper
until after we were married because the house was always clean when he came to
see me or take me on a date.  His mother was an immaculate housekeeper - too
immaculate - so he said he probably wouldn't have kept dating me if he had seen
the house messy and dirty because he knew the saying - &quot;Like Mother, Like
Daughter&quot;.  I hope I am like my mother in many other ways, however, as she
has many virtues and not many faults and weaknesses.  None of us are perfect; I
know I'm certainly not.  Dad realized this later in life too.  He always loved
Mom very much, but it did bother him about her housekeeping and &quot;hording&quot;. 
Mom said that since she lived through the depression, she can't stand to throw
anything out because the day will come when her children and grandchildren may
need the clothes to make them over for the children, they will need the
bedding, the food, etc., etc., and that may be, but it is a phobia with her. 
Ken's mom lived through the depression too, and really had a hard time - maybe
more so than my mother, but she is so different - she throws too much away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Mom was gone to get her hair done, etc.,
and I would stop by, Dad was sometimes frustrated and upset and would show me
all the closets and rooms that were full to the brim because she keeps buying
things and won't throw anything out or give to the Deseret Industries.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad finally said years later &quot;She is such a
wonderful woman and I can't expect her to be perfect.  She loves me and is a
wonderful wife and mother - so I will just have to overlook her
housekeeping&quot;.  I was proud of dad for this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Even though Mom wasn't a good housekeeper, she
was a hard worker.  I think now that Mom probably didn’t have the energy as she
had Rheumatic Fever when she was a young girl and that damaged her heart.  During
the spring we usually planted a garden.  We kids helped her weed it.  She had
raspberries, strawberries and currents that we made jam out of.  I didn't like
picking the currents as it took so long to get very many since they were so
small.  We also had fruit trees.  So, we were busy in the spring, summer and
fall, gardening, harvesting and canning the fruit and vegetables.  Mom put
bushels and bushels of fruit &amp; vegetables up each year.  I disliked doing
it as it took so long and made such a mess of the kitchen, but I'm glad I
learned how to do it and the value of doing it.  I have proceeded to do these
things throughout my life also, and Ken &amp; I have taught our children as we
had them help us as they were growing up.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I enjoy gardening and working in the yard.  I
love to see things grow - I love nature.  Not many young people do gardening
and canning these days because it is so easy to buy it at the store.  I do
worry that the time will come when they will need to know these skills and be able
to do them to feed their families.  Our married children are gardening and canning,
and I am thankful they are. (At least the ones who can) I was talking with
Shellie recently (May 1998) and she said she likes to go out each day and look
at her tomato plants to see how much they have grown and also her orange &amp;
grapefruit trees.  She said she will be glad to get the rest of her garden in,
so she can watch it also.  Sandi showed me her garden while we were out there
last weekend and it looks so good.  She has had a garden practically since she
was first married.  Mike &amp; Becky also have a garden.  David &amp; Shauna
are just buying a home and David said he will be glad when he can have an
orchard &amp; garden.  Looks like it paid off to have our children help with gardening,
canning, etc., while they were growing up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Back to Mom</b> - she mended clothes and
socks, and always kept herself busy.  She liked to read also - so at night her
and dad usually read when they were not at meetings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mom took me to Samuels sales (Samuels was a nice, but
expensive store, but when they had sales, you saved a lot of money on clothe.)
and bought me beautiful clothes, when I was a teenager.  I knew she was
sacrificing other things for me, and I loved her for it and I loved the
beautiful clothes she bought me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(For more information on Mom, refer to the Blue &quot;Byron
Porter Family Descendants&quot; book or information in the &quot;Parents&quot;
section of this history)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I feel very fortunate to have been raised by
wonderful parents who loved their children and taught the gospel to us and set
a wonderful example for us by living it.  I also feel fortunate to have lived
close to my <b>grandparents</b> as I was growing up.  They were also wonderful
people who loved and lived the gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grandpa Bushnell would come over each Sunday morning and
give us kids a “Sunday nickel”.  We thought that was great because we didn’t
get an allowance, but this was some money to buy a treat.  In those days you
could buy two pieces of candy for a penny, a nickel would buy a candy bar, a Popsicle,
ice cream on a stick or two nickels would buy a pop.  We had a little store/gas
station across the street from the church on the north corner.  It wasn’t very
far since we lived right next to the church.  Grandpa would take us, on another
day, to spend our nickel many times. Grandpa had a beautiful tenor voice.  He
and Grandma grew up in Meadow and so even though he had moved to Sunset, people
kept asking him to come and sing at their important events, weddings, funerals,
etc., in Meadow, Fillmore and the surrounding areas.  Because of Grandma’s
health and I think because she was shy, and she said she had too much to do to
go (Cleaning, laundry, ironing, etc.), she didn’t go with him, so he took one
of us children with him.  He always stopped in Nephi and bought us hamburgers
and shakes.  Sometimes just a shake, but that was good enough and I loved
traveling too.  My mother couldn’t understand grandma not going with Grandpa and,
so she made up her mind that whenever my dad wanted her to go someplace with
him, she would drop everything and go.  She left a dirty house, etc.  She said
she loved dad and wanted to be with him, which is great, but I wanted a happy
medium.  I didn’t like leaving if my dishes weren’t done and the house wasn’t
clean as I didn’t want to come home to a dirty home, etc.  Grandpa sang at Kens
and my wedding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>LETTER I WROTE MOM ON MAY 22, 1987</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dear Mom,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for being such a wonderful mother.  I
know you’ve always worried about your weight (mainly your stomach) but you
didn’t need to, as you have always been beautiful – and such a great example to
follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I know I’ve told you before, but thanks for the
many things you’ve done for me and my family throughout my life, to show you
care.  The statements you’d make like “Oh, this house is too clean, I must be
in the wrong house” after I’d clean the house while you were away, or “You’ll
never know how I appreciate you until you have a daughter of your own.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for always supporting me – going to my
“Dear to my Heart” nights, etc., while I was in M.I.A., encouraging me to get
my “Golden Gleaner” award, coming to our children’s blessings, baptisms, talks,
etc., encouraging the boys to get their “Eagle” awards, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember, as a young girl, riding the bus with
you to go shopping in Ogden, running to keep up with you, as you could walk so
fast, getting cute clothes at Samuel’s sales &amp; other sales, etc. That was
great!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved to hear you whistle or sing as you
worked around the house.  I loved coming home from school to the smell of fresh
homemade bread.  I loved hearing you and Dad sing as we’d come home from Morgan
or other places.  My children say the same thing to us, as Ken and I used to
sing those same songs that we learned from you, as we’d travel with our
children.  And Shellie was saying, not long ago, when I was rocking Chelci and
singing “This Little Piggy Went to Market” that she remembered me rocking and
singing those songs to her.  Of course, I did the other children too.  I
learned them when you sang them to me when I had earaches as a young child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for pampering me and being so sweet
whenever I’ve been ill.  It meant a lot.  Thanks for caring enough to call just
about each morning (when it wasn’t long distance) to see how we were, for
always calling me and my family on their birthdays. We look forward to that
call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for all the ice cream cones and goodies
as we’d go places together.  I’ve enjoyed being with you and I’m happy that you
want me with you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks, especially, this past year for all the
encouragement, support, both financial and otherwise, help fixing meals, making
bread, helping the children with their homework, etc., letting us use your car,
(I know you loved to drive that car, so it was really a sacrifice for you and I
love you so much for it).  I’m not sure I’d have made it through that difficult
time if it hadn’t been for you and Dad and the Lord.  Thanks so much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thanks for all the Sunday dinners, and other
meals as well as the many snacks.  You’ve always been such an example of loving
and caring for your family and others.  I hope I’m worthy of your love.  You’re
so “special”, Mom, and I love you so very much.          Mae</p>

– my boyfriend, my husband, my Eternal Companion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Kenneth &quot;Ken&quot; Browning moved into our
ward when I was a Sophomore in High School and he was a Senior.  He moved down
by Bonnie Draper and Connie Jones.  He became friends with Hendrick Brandenburg, Buck Heines, &amp; Butch Israelson.  Hendrick became his best friend. 
Hendrick's family were from Holland but were strong members of the church. 
These friends of Ken's were dating girls who lived in Roy and went to Weber
High, so Ken started dating girls from there also to double date with his
friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=131 height=183
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image028.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>            I remember being impressed with Ken because he
was so polite and friendly - good looking too.  At MIA dances, he would ask
lots of girls to dance, and would come to them and politely ask them to dance -
not just come over and grab you by the hand and pull you onto the dance floor
like the other boys did.  When the dance was over, he would walk you back to
your seat, or ask if he could have another dance.  The other boys would just
walk off and leave you standing in the middle of the floor after the dance was
over.  I noticed how he treated his mother so politely by opening the door for
her and he opened the church door for any girl or woman.  He was very polite
and respectful.  Someone has said that you can judge how a man will treat you
by the way he treats his mother.  Ken was very respectful and courteous to his
mother, and they had a good relationship which made me feel good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After Ken graduated from High School, he joined
the Air force.  However, he was sent to Texas for his basic training and he got
a Heat Stroke while standing in formation on a hot summer day.  When the
Sergeant told them to fall out, he literally fell out.  They took him to the
hospital and packed him in ice.  He ended up getting out of the military with a
medical discharge.  They told him they didn't want him there any longer to take
a chance of having to pay his funeral bills.  I guess Ken had had his first
heat stroke when he was a boy in Idaho and had been fishing.  This was his
second and they said he was really lucky to have come out of it alive and then
to not have brain damage was a miracle. They said if he had another one, it
would take his life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When he returned from the service, he wanted to
get into college.  He went to Idaho and lived with his Uncle Irven and Aunt
Bernice, found a job at a gas station and tried to enroll in college, but the
classes he needed were not offered until the next quarter.  He worked and when
the next quarter came, he still could not get into those classes, so he decided
to come back home</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I remember seeing Ken taking a lead
part in our ward play soon after he got home. I remember thinking how handsome
he was and how good he was in the play.  In February of 1958, soon after the
play, he called to ask me to go to the Stake Sweetheart Ball with him.  We were
to double date with his best friend, Hendrick.  As it turned out Hendrick
didn't go.  I didn't find out, until after we were engaged, that he had asked
several other girls to go and since it was a last-minute thing, they all had
other plans.  He was ready to quit trying when Hendrick asked him to call me -
Hal's sister.  He said he hadn't thought of me, didn't really even know me. 
I'm grateful to Hendrick for suggesting me.  I had just broken up with Dallas
again and Vern and Reny were in the service, so I was excited to go with Ken.  I
felt so comfortable around Ken.  We could talk so easily with each other and
found we had much in common.  Ken was a great dancer and I was able to follow
him easily, even though he put in different steps sometimes.  We loved to dance
together.  I went off and on with Ken for two or three months.  Then we started
going steady.  We went steady for about two weeks when I decided that Ken was
getting serious.  I had those plans of going to Heniger's Business College with
Pat, after we graduated, and I wasn't ready to get serious.  I told him we
ought to date other people.  But, even though I didn't wear Ken's ring, we were
still together just about every night, as he came to my house every night.  I
guess he didn't want me to find anyone else as he had decided I was the one for
him.  He had told his mother, after our third date, that he was going to marry
me.  He told me later that when he came to pick me up for our first date, that
he said to himself: “Wow! This girl is beautiful, how come I haven’t noticed
her before?”   He told me, after we were married, that he was sure the Lord put
blinders on his eyes so that he couldn’t see me until after he was old enough
to think of marriage.  Ken was the assistant explorer leader in our ward so one
weekend he went on a camping trip with them.  I was still working at the Arctic Circle so one of the other girls who worked there wanted me to double date with her
to the rodeo.  She said the fellow I would be going with owned a new red
Thunderbird.  At that time that was about the best car you could own.  It was a
sports car.  That excited me, so with my parent's permission, I went.  I didn't
like the guy I was with and the car didn't make up the difference.  He asked me
to go out with him the following night, but I turned him down.  That was the
only date I went on, other than Ken, from the time we started going steady.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=123 height=170

align=left hspace=12>            My brother, Hal, told me one day, &quot;You'd
better marry Ken.  You won't find anyone who will treat you better.  He won't
step out on you and he has a testimony of the church so he will honor his
priesthood and be the kind of husband and father you want.&quot;  This was
special coming from Hal who wasn't active in the church. I had a picture taken
for Ken and made an 8x10.  He loved it, but somehow, we lost the 8x10 and he
was upset, but I still had small pictures, so this is the one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After Ken &amp; I started going together quite
seriously, he would come pick me up when I got off work from the Arctic Circle.  It was usually around 11:00 or 12:00 p.m.  While he waited in back, I would
usually take him a treat - hamburger, malt, fries or Sunday.  He liked that. 
There was a slight disadvantage to this - guys from all over would come to the Arctic Circle and flirt with us.  Lots of times they would ask us out or want to take us
home.  Of course, I couldn't because Ken was always waiting for me.  But many times,
it was an advantage because I wouldn't know the guys or wouldn't want to go
with them and I could &amp; would say &quot;I'm sorry, but my boyfriend is
waiting for me.&quot;  After Ken and I were engaged, and I knew for sure that
he was my &quot;Mr. Right&quot;, then I didn't want to be with anyone else but
him anyway.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In my Patriarchal Blessing, it told me that when
I was ready to choose a mate that I should make it a matter of prayer and the
Lord would help me find the right person.  I began doing this after Ken and I
had been going together for some time, and I soon had the answer - Ken was to
be my Eternal Companion.  I told him of this and began wearing his ring again. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken had always wanted to go on a mission.  From
the time he was a small boy, he said this was one of his greatest desires and
goals.  Several of the boys his age had been called in and interviewed to go on
missions, but he hadn't.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We loved each other and wanted to begin making
plans for marriage, but we both wanted Ken to fill a mission first.  He went to
the Bishop and told him that the two of us were in love; but that he wanted to
go on a mission and that I had promised to wait for him.  The Bishop told him
that when two people find each other and are ready for marriage, that this is a
mission too.  When Ken told me about it, he felt bad and wondered why the
Bishop didn't want him to go on a mission when he wanted to so bad.  He has
since felt bad many times, and felt cheated when other men talk about their
missions and say how it's the best two years of their life.  I have tried to
tell Ken that I'm sure the main reason the Bishop didn't call him to go on a
mission is because he was helping to support Roy on his mission.  Roy
had never wanted to go on a mission and during his teen age years, he was very
wild and gave his folks cause for concern.  He dropped out of school and ended
up joining the military.  While there he became converted to the gospel.  He
was always a member, but like my brother Hal, had never gained a testimony of
it.  While Roy was in the service, he did a lot of good and helped convert
himself and some of his buddies.  When he came home, he went to the Bishop and
told him he wanted to go on a mission.  Ken's mother was working at the school
lunch program and said she couldn't pay it all so my wonderful Ken said he
would pay half.  He was working at California Packing Plant.  So..... I'm sure
that the Bishop could see that Ken was helping to send Roy on his mission and
so there was no money for Ken to go.  But we feel my Uncle Dale could have
supported Ken as he has supported many missionaries over the years, or Ken's
Uncle Irven &amp; other relatives probably would have been glad to help, and
the High Priest Quorum &amp; Elder's Quorum could have helped.  Oh well, that
didn't happen.  Ken supported Roy until we got married and then we continued to
support him until he got home.  We were blessed for it and glad we could do
it.  Not many girls do wait for their missionaries.  They usually find another
returned missionary who has returned earlier and marry them.  So maybe, the
Lord knew I might not wait and we were meant for each other.  Whatever the
reason, Ken has felt bad, but I told him that someday the two of us would go on
a mission together.  Well, I’ll insert here (04-21-06) that we did go on a
mission together to the Philippine Islands from March 17, 2003 to February 17,
2005.  When Ken was being set apart by our stake president, the blessing said
that the Lord knew of the sacrifice he had made years earlier and that the He
(the Lord) was pleased with him and that now it was his turn to go on a
mission.  Tears came to my eyes as I heard that blessing.  I will tell more of
our mission later on in this history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ken gave me my engagement ring in October of 1958</b>. 
We had been to a Stake Harvest Ball.  Afterwards we went to <b>Veldon Baird</b>'s
home with him and his girl and several other couples.  We ate, played games and
watched the midnight &quot;Chiller&quot; show on T.V.  We used to take turns at
each others’ homes after dances.  When Ken took me home, he parked and turned
off the car.  We began discussing the dance, party, etc.  He took his ring off
my finger, slipped the engagement ring on and asked me to marry him.  I didn't
take him seriously at first - until I noticed the ring on my finger and when I
did I didn't answer him, I just squealed and hugged him.  The next day was
Sunday so the word soon got out.  Monday morning when I got on the bus and my
friends saw my ring, they screamed.  Poor Joe, the bus driver, this always
happened when someone got their engagement ring.  I was the second my age to
receive one.  Margie got hers about a month before.  Pat got married in
November of our senior year - not in the temple as she wasn't a member at that
time.  I can't remember when she got her engagement ring, but she lived in Syracuse
at that time - so didn't ride our bus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My parents, brothers and sister were all excited
and happy.  Mom felt I was a little young as I was only 17, but we assured her
that we would wait until I graduated before we got married and I would be 18. 
We did.  We were engaged 8 months.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I don’t remember having a birthday party growing
up.  I’m sure it was because my birthday was just 3 days after Christmas and
everyone was partied out and had no money to buy more presents.  Mom would
always bake me a birthday cake and we would have ice cream and she &amp; dad
would give me a couple of presents, but I always wished my birthday was in the
months of May, June, July, August or September.  Now that I am married, it
doesn’t matter.  Ken gave me a couple of surprise birthday parties.  The first
was when we were engaged.  He had talked to Mom about having it at our home and
he talked with all my friends about coming over after Sacrament Meeting at
night.  Ken’s brother, Bob, was home on leave from the military and he was a
baker, so Ken asked him to make me a birthday cake.  I was really surprised and
happy about the party and we had a fun time, mainly visiting and eating cake
and ice cream.  When I cut into the cake, I was surprised because the color was
“royal blue”.  Bob had wanted it to be white and to make it even whiter, he
would just put a drop of blue coloring into the cake batter.  This time he slipped,
and a lot came out.  It wasn’t white, but a beautiful blue.  I loved it, I
thought that was great!  He had decorated it so beautifully too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>A funny thing happened about
another engagement ring.</b>  It was a fake ring that Hal had bought.  He told
me to put it on and show dad.  I did, and to my surprise, Dad was really
excited.  I had been going with Bob Mansfield (Reny) and broke up with him and
was just starting to go out with Ken.  Dad thought that Ken had given me the
ring and although I was very young, he was relieved that I wasn't going to
marry Reny.  He knew that Ken was such a good guy - so he was excited.  I was
really surprised because I had expected him to be upset.  Then I told him it
was a fake ring that Hal had and we all laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Spiritual Experience:</b> Like I said, Ken
and I were engaged for 8 months.  That is too long when you are in love.  When
we would come home from a date, we would sit in the car and neck for a while
and that’s not healthy.  We didn’t end up making love, thank goodness, but there
was one time that was too close.  Sometimes, instead of sitting in the car,
especially during the winter when it was cold, we would go inside as Mom, Dad
and the children were already in bed and asleep.  We were quiet, and I would
sit on his lap as he sat in the comfortable sofa chair.  One time we told each
other that after we were married, we would sit all night that way in a
comfortable chair in our home – but we didn’t.  Anyway, this night we had been
to a formal dance.  I had on a beautiful formal and as we stood together and
kissed in my parent’s living room, Ken started to unzip my formal.  Just at
that time, we saw Mom walk out from her bedroom; come up the hall and into the
bathroom.  I knew it was Mom because she had on her nightgown and her hair was wrapped
up with toilet paper and clips to keep it nice (as she had her hair done each
week) and then a light cap over it.  We froze, and Ken quickly zipped my dress
back up.  We waited and waited, but Mom never came back out.  Finally, I went
to the bathroom and looked inside, and no one was there.  I then knew it was <b>my
guardian angel</b> who we had seen.  Ken and I then both knelt down by the
couch and thanked Heavenly Father for sending my guardian angel to stop us.  I
doubt if we would have gone all the way as we were not alone in that house, but
we might have petted.  We have thought about that at different times and know
we were blessed because we were praying night and morning and we would pray for
strength to do what was right and safety as we dated, and we were trying to
keep the commandments of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I graduated from High School the end of May
1959.  We had a “Senior Sluff”, where all the seniors got to have the day off
from school and do what they would like.  Me and many of my friends went to
Pine View Dam and had a fun time, swimming, sun bathing, eating our lunch,
visiting and having fun. Prior to my graduation, Ken took pictures of me (I’m
sure Mom did also).  It was exciting to finally be graduating and then soon
after getting married and starting a new life with my sweetheart, Ken Browning.</p>

HONEYMOON</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We were married in the Salt Lake
Temple on the 19th of June 1959, by Elder LaGrand Richards who was an apostle
and is a second cousin to my dad.  <i>Elder Richards gave us such a wonderful
talk.  Some of the council he gave us was to never go to bed upset with each
other - to talk it out and then pray together each night before retiring.  He said,
&quot;you can't pray together if you are mad at each other&quot;.   He also
said to have a weekly date - to keep courting.  He told us that once or twice a
year we should go on a little vacation by ourselves and leave the children
home, if only to the next town and if only for a weekend.  That if we can go
for a week once in awhile, all the better.  He said to build a wonderful
lasting relationship, we need this time to ourselves.  He said to take family
vacations also, but that when the children are raised and leave the nest, we
want to have built our loving relationship, so our marriage will last.  I have
been thankful for this advice and we have complied with it and have built a
wonderful relationship</i>.  Ken and I are really happy, are best friends and
really love and enjoy being together.  <i>He also said that when we get upset
with each other, as all couples do, that one of us should go outside and go for
a walk to cool off, rather than stay and argue.  He said that’s why he is so

align=left hspace=12><b>The day was just perfect.  We had our reception that
night in the Sunset Second Ward Recreational Hall.  </b>Bob was Ken’s best man
and Carroll was my maid of honor.  My bridesmaids were:  My best friend, Pat
Bradfield, my cousin, Joann DeGraw and other best friends, Patsy Morris and
Eleanor Ewing were my bride’s maids, and my flower girl was my sweet little
sister, Georgia.  I felt fortunate that three of my four grandparents were also
in my line.  Grandpa Porter had passed away just before Georgia was born, but
Grandma Porter and Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell were still alive.  We got so
many nice things and so many came that my face hurt from smiling so much.  We
had a program and a dance after.  My grandfather Bushnell sang in our program. 
He had a beautiful tenor voice.  Nada Nicholas, who also has such a beautiful
voice and was the wife of our bishop, sang also.  Mom’s friend who has a
granddaughter who tap danced with a group asked the group to dance in our
program.  There were several numbers and it was wonderful.  Ken and I started
the dance and then others followed.   A friend of Mom’s who is a caterer made
our refreshments, they were delicious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken had to be in training for his job for two
weeks - so we couldn't leave on our honeymoon at that time.  Instead we went to
 Provo and stayed in a cute cabin by the Provo River for the weekend.  We took
a picnic lunch up Provo Canyon on Saturday.  </p>

align=left hspace=12><b>Mom &amp; Dad offered to have us live in one of their
duplex apartments at 1747 North Main, Apt 1</b> at a lower rent ($35.00 a
month) so we were excited.  The couple who were living there were supposed to
be moved out by the time we got married, but they weren't, so we gave them an
extra three weeks and we stayed in a motel over in Roy while Ken went to his
training for the two weeks.  Then we went on our Honeymoon to Yellowstone
 Park.  We had a wonderful time.  As we traveled, we ate twirled candy sticks
that were left over from our reception.  They were really good.  We sang songs
up and back.  I taught Ken the songs I had grown up with and it was fun singing
with him.  We enjoyed the scenery.  We stayed in a small cabin up there.  The next
morning we woke up really cold.  The stove wasn’t putting out hardly any heat.
(There wasn't a damper in the stove) Ken was able to fix it, thank goodness.  He
went out and looked in the big garbage, and found a large coffee can.  He took
his knife and cut down a ways from the top of the can, every few inches.  He
then took these cuts and bent them outward.  He said we would have to get all
the covers we could find and put on our coats because he had to let the fire,
in the stove, go completely out.  We stayed warm under the covers, and then
when the stove was cold, he shoved this can up the smoke stack an lit the
firewood in the stove.  The stove soon became hot and it put out the heat we
needed to keep ward.  Wow! I knew then that I had married a smart man that
could figure things out to do what needed to be done.  It snowed while we were there,
so we had snowball fights.  One day we heard some commotion over by the large
trash cans, so we went over to see what was going on.  There were lots of
people watching a bear rummaging through the trash.  Soon after we got there,
the bear turned and started chasing all of us.  Ken said I left him in the dust
and was racing ahead of all the people.  Guess I didn't want to get eaten by a
bear.  At that time, there were lots of bear in Yellowstone Park. 
Cars would be off to the side of the road watching and some were even feeding
the bears.  Since there were accidents with the bears, they were taken to
higher ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we got back from our Honeymoon, the couple
still had not moved, so we just went and gathered up lots of boxes and went in
and helped them move out.  When we realized how dirty the apartment was, we
were sorry we were going to live there.  We had lots of work trying to clean it
up.  It stunk so bad and we finally moved the refrigerator out and found
spoiled meat underneath it.  Ken had to take off the top of the stove and soak
it in lye in the bathtub for two days before he could get off all the grease
and dirt by using a puddy knife. Ken's mom &amp; sister, Aunt Wilma helped us
clean as also my Mom &amp; Dad.  We had to wash the walls twice before we could
paint them.  When our apartment was clean, it looked really cute.  We were able
to purchase a really nice sectional set from a neighbor of Ken’s who wanted a
new set.  The other furniture was ones Mom had gotten at a second-hand store.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I found out right away that Ken loved to fish</b> as one
night shortly after we were married and living in our apartment, Ken woke me up
suddenly by yelling: <b>“I’ve caught it, I’ve caught it, it’s a big one, it’s a
big one.” </b>He went fishing as a young boy growing up in Victor, Idaho.  He
mostly stream fished there, and most of our married life, he would go stream
fishing.  I would go with him sometimes and take a book and camp chair and read
while he fished.  He went fishing with his brothers, and with neighbors and
friend.  We camped a lot, and many were camping/fishing trips, but they were
fun and we both loved to eat the fish.  After we returned from our Philippine
Mission in 2005, we went fishing with my cousin, Randy Porter, and his wife,
Judy.  They had a boat and we had so much fun, that on the way home, I
suggested that he might want to buy a boat.  He loved that suggestion and it
didn’t take him long to find a nice fishing boat.  He has loved it, I have
too.  We have caught many fish in that boat.  We have taken family, mostly
Sandi and Nick and grandsons.  We have taken friends and extended family, Ken
has taken my cousin, Randy, many times with him.  Sometimes they went in
Randy’s boat, but Ken always has to do all the work as Randy is blind. Randy
helps pay the expenses. A friend, Ron Graf, loves to go with Ken also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The other surprise birthday party Ken gave me
was the first year after we were married.  We lived in Mom &amp; Dad’s duplex
apartments.  When I woke up that morning, I expected Ken to wish me a happy
birthday, but he didn’t.  We both went to work and afterwards I fixed supper
and he still didn’t wish me a happy birthday, give me a card or anything so I
was disappointed.  Later, he said: “Let’s go down to Mom &amp; Dad’s and visit
a while.  I said ok and when we got there, his mother didn’t wish me a happy birthday
either.  We sat &amp; visited, and Ken excused himself, I thought to go to the
bathroom, but a few minutes later he called me and his mom and said for us to
come downstairs as he wanted to show us something.  When I started down the
stairs, everyone yelled “Happy Birthday”.  The cake said “20, and no longer a
teen”.  I hadn’t wanted to turn 20 as I loved being a teenager.  He had invited
all his siblings and families. His mom had decorated the basement with crate
paper and balloons.  They had cake, ice cream and presents.  It was fun.  He
hadn’t forgotten after all.  My birthdays with Ken have always been special. 
Since the after-Christmas sales were on at that time, Ken would take me
shopping to buy clothes or whatever I wanted.  It was fun being with Ken and
having him help me choose what to buy.  Whenever he would take me clothes
shopping, he would have me try on several outfits and if both he and I liked
them, he would want me to buy them all.  Sometimes I would get 3 or 4 dresses
or outfits.  He would usually take me out to eat also and make breakfast for
me.  He spoiled me.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>National Parks (Bryce, Zion &amp; Grand Canyon) in
Southern Utah in 1960.   </b>That summer, we decided to take a vacation to
Southern Utah to see Bryce, Zion’s and Grand Canyon.  It was fun camping with
Ken as he is a great camper and can do everything.  I am blessed to have such a
great husband who takes care of me so well.  When different tourists would see
us, they would say “Look at the cute newlyweds”.  We had been married a year,
but we still acted like newlyweds.  We loved these national parks as they are
each so unique and beautiful.  While at Bryce Canyon, Ken and I decided to walk
down into the canyon to see the different sights, the only problem was that it
was getting late in the afternoon so by the time we were headed back up the
path, it was starting to get dark and it was steep, but we had to hurry.  About
halfway up, I was getting really tired and Ken had to keep saying “The top is
just around the next corner.”  I would make it to that corner and say “No, it’s
not.”  He would keep saying “I’m sure it is just around the next corner.” 
That’s how we made it to the top.  He knew he couldn’t carry me up and if it
got entirely dark, it would be very dangerous, so I’m glad he did that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ken and I love to dance</b>.  We were able to dance in
the stake, and then <b>All-church Dance Festival</b> during June Conference in
Salt Lake City at the University of Utah Stadium, when we were engaged.  This
was really exciting, and we were happy for this opportunity.  We hardly ever
missed any ward or stake dances.  We still really enjoy dances, but there are
not very many for adults any more.  Ken instigated a ward Gold and Green Ball
just prior to our moving from Erda to Mesa in May of 1979.  He told the Activity
Committee to go all out and hire a good band, decorate good, have a floor show,
lots of food - the whole works.  Ken was first counselor in the Bishopric and
he convinced Bishop Brown and Brother Gull that this would be good for the ward
- to unite them, and that the money should come out of the budget, so people
wouldn't have an excuse not to come.  They did go all out, and it was
fantastic.  The building was packed and everyone, youth and adults had a grand
time.  They even had the youth teach the adults to &quot;disco&quot; and the
adults taught the youth to waltz, and there were contests for both groups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken &amp; I joined a <b>Square Dance Club</b>
when we were living in Clearfield.  My friend, Margie's sister &amp; her
husband belonged to it and told us about it.  Roy &amp; Linda joined it and
wanted us to join, but Ken felt we were too busy and he really didn’t want to. 
Roy told him that if we would go once and didn’t like it, he would never say
another word about it.  Ken agreed, and we had so much fun and loved it, so we
joined.   It was the Double &quot;J&quot; Rustlers.  The caller was really
good.  We had a great time.  We met once a week at an elementary school gym in Ogden.  Square dancing is so much fun.  It was fun to wear the dresses and full slips, and
Ken the men's western wear.  I made some of my dresses and I made shirts for
Ken to match my dresses.  When you square dance, you concentrate on what the
caller is telling you to do, and it is so much fun.  You can't think of any of
your problems or other concerns, you just concentrate on square dancing.  We
made lots of friends in the club, and looked forward to going each week.  Many times,
the club would join with another club and that was fun too.  One time we danced
at Lava Hot Springs in Idaho - so we took the family and camped them and danced
both Friday and Saturday nights.  Sandi was old enough to tend the younger
children while we were gone over to the building where we danced.  I can't
remember how long we square danced, but finally realized that we could only
spare one night a week for entertainment (our weekly date) and it was becoming
sometimes two times a week that we would go square dancing.  We wanted to do
other things for our weekly date - like go to the temple, go out to eat with
friends or our brother's &amp; sister's and their spouses, invite friends to
our home to play games, go to a movie, etc., etc., and we didn't want to leave
the children that many nights - so we gave up square dancing thinking we would
take it up again after the children were raised.  Thus far we haven't done so.

<p class=MsoNormal><b>             It is now January 1998, and we belong to a

or bands, decorations, door prizes, refreshments, etc.  They have a different
theme each month.  We really enjoy these dances.  Georgia &amp; Rick also
belong and their son Brian &amp; his wife.  Scott &amp; Michelle went last

align=left hspace=12>            We always look forward to a New Year's Eve
Dance.  We have gone to dances on New Year's Eve ever since we started dating. 
They are harder and harder to find, but our good friends, Kent &amp; Darla
Rampton, of the Layton 7th ward (when we lived with Ken's Mom) loved to dance
also and since Kent was the Bishop, he had contacts with other wards and stakes
and could usually find us a dance to go to on New Year's Eve, Valentines and
other dances &quot;Gold &amp; Green Balls&quot; in other stakes as well.  I was
lst counselor in the Relief Society Presidency with Sharon Cottle as President
when we lived there.  Darla and I have always enjoyed each other.  We used to
be walking partners - also Sharon Cottle, Pam Hewitt and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At the present time we belong to the Quarter
Promanadars (square dance club) which meets at the Hay Loft in Plain
 City.  We meet on Friday nights.  Renny Mann is the caller.  We are really
enjoying it.  We jumped into their Beginner’s class when it was about halfway
through, but because we had square danced before, a lot of it came back to us
and we are doing pretty good.  As we stay and watch the regulars or try to
dance with them, we realize there is still a lot to learn.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>Well, let’s get back to when Ken and I first married.</b> 
We lived in my parent's little duplex apartment for two years - <b>06/59 to
08/61</b><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>.  </span></b>The apartment had a
small front room, kitchen, bathroom and one small bedroom.  Dad had built this
duplex behind our home in Sunset.  Mom &amp; Dad had it furnished with used
furniture.  They let us buy our own furniture as we could afford to and then
they would sell the used furniture back to the used furniture store.  That
helped us a lot.  With getting the rent cheaper, we were able to save for a
down payment for our own home.  Ken worked as a computer operator for the
Internal Revenue Service at 2<sup>nd</sup> street in Ogden.  I worked part-time
as a secretary for my Uncle Dale Porter in his farm manufacturing company. 
Later, I worked in the bookkeeping department for Clearfield State Bank.  We
enjoyed it there in our little apartment, living close to Mom &amp; Dad and
also Ken’s family and being in the Sunset Second Ward.  Ken was asked to be in
the Elder's Quorum President, I was asked to be Primary Secretary.  I enjoyed
Belva Provost who was the president, and all the other sisters I worked with. 
Even though I was very young, they didn't treat me that way.  Before we moved,
they asked Ken &amp; me to be ward dance directors.  This was fun.  We mainly
taught the youth in MIA different dances.  Ken worked swing shift a lot, so I
ended up having to teach some of the dances by myself.  The Cha Cha for one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved having my own place, and yet living
close to my family and grandparents as well.  One bad thing about having <b>Grandpa
Bushnell</b> live so close by was he would bang on our door about 7:00 a.m. on
Saturday mornings - when we could and would be sleeping in.  He would say
&quot;you should be up by now&quot;.  He would want Ken to do something for
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Ken worked swing shift, I would be nervous
to be there alone, so I would go up to my parent's home and spend the evenings
with them.  I would have one of my brother's walk me to my apartment.  I would
lock the door and try to go to bed.  The main thing I was nervous about was
evil spirits.  In high school at slumber parties we told stories about evil
spirits (which wasn't a good thing) it got to me and I would have a terrible
time trying to go to sleep.  I would turn on all the lights, turn on the radio,
but I still couldn't get it out of my mind.  Finally, I was getting obsessed
with it and was getting more and more frightened and I dreaded night to come. 
I was always so relieved when Ken got home from work and when he could work the
day shift.  Finally, I realized that this terrible fear was wrong and I had to
get over it.  I prayed hard and worked hard each night to get it out of my mind. 
I finally overcame it, but not without much effort.  I know Heavenly Father
answered my prayers.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            Ken &amp; I made a mistake that haunted us for
at least a couple of years.  We had encyclopedia salesmen come and show us the <b>Burtania
encyclopedia's.</b>  We were young and inexperienced and signed up for them.  I
didn't feel good about doing it, but they high-pressured us into it. 
Practically as soon as they closed the door, I started crying and told Ken I
didn't feel good about it.  He asked why I had signed and I said because I
thought he wanted them and they were pressuring us to sign.  He ran after the
men and told them we had changed our mind.  They wouldn't tear up the contract,
and in those days, you didn't have the 3 days to change your mind.  They sent
the encyclopedias to us, but before they came, the &quot;World Book&quot;
Encyclopedia salesman came to see us.  We listened to his sales pitch, but told
him we couldn't buy his books even if we wanted to because we had just
purchased the Burtania encyclopedia's.  We explained what happened, and he said
that when they were shipped to us, we should just send them back with a letter
that we didn't want them.  He said if we didn't open them, we would be
alright.  I'm sure he thought that if we did this, we would buy his books.  We
did eventually, and they have been good books.  But, the Burtania company did
everything they could to make us pay for the books.  We told them we didn't
have them, and they said we had to pay for them anyway.  They called and
threatened to garnish Ken's wages, they sent bill collectors, they sent nasty
&amp; threatening letters, they called Ken's boss, etc., etc.  It was a bad
experience, but finally they gave up - they had to as we never accepted their
books.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Pat married Ron Bradfield in the
fall of 1958, our junior year</b>.  They were in love and I think Pat wanted to
get out of her parent's home.  Ken and I witnessed their marriage at Pat’s
parent’s home.  About a year later when Ken and I were living in Sunset,
renting Mom and Dad’s apartment behind their home, <b>I got a call from Pat. 
She said the missionaries had finished teaching her the lessons and she wanted
to be baptized as she had a testimony that it was true, but was afraid that if
she did, her parents would disown her.  I went over to her apartment to talk
with her.  I told her that many had joined the church even though it meant
their folks would disown them.  She decided to join as her husband wanted her
to do so also.  Her parents did disown her and made it very miserable for Pat. 
They even came to her apartment and took back everything they had ever given
her (at least the things she still had).  Finally, after several months and
much heartache, they did reunite.  Pat &amp; Ron started having a family and
Pat’s parents wanted to be able to see and enjoy their grandchildren.</b>  <b>Pat
&amp; Ron wanted to be married in the temple, but Pat was having a hard time
with the law of tithing.  We had another good talk.  She explained to me that
she wanted to pay tithing, but there just wasn’t enough money.  She had figured
and refigured and when she paid the bills, and bought the food, there wasn’t
money left to pay tithing.   I explained that if they would pay their tithing
first (before paying their bills) the Lord would bless them, and they would
have enough money left over to pay their bills and buy their food.  I told her
it worked for us and I was sure it would for her.  I told her to at least try
it.  I really prayed hard for her that she would have the faith to try it.  She
did, and it did work.  She called and told me that she didn’t know how it
worked, but it did, and she was so happy.  They were able to get a temple
recommend and go to the temple.  I was able to be the one to go through with
her - since her mother wasn’t a member and she didn’t have a sister or any
close family member.  I was thrilled to be with her.  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>We have always stayed close</b>.  She has
thanked me over and over for being her best friend and fellowshipping her into
the gospel and setting the example for her. Pat is a very special lady.  She
has raised a wonderful family.  She is a wonderful wife, mother and
grandmother.  She has been a YWMIA President and loved the girls.  She has done
a lot for so many people and loves the Lord and continues to serve him and her
fellow men.  I am thankful that Pat was my best friend.  My husband, Ken, is
now my best friend, but she continues to be a very dear friend.  I know that I
was just an instrument in the Lord’s hands to help Pat into the Church, and it
was him, not me.  I don’t want the credit, but I am thankful to my Heavenly
Father for the blessing she has been in my life.  Pat &amp; Ron have four
children, 2 boys and 2 girls.  Ron had been in a motorcycle accident and had
been in a coma for a month or more.  He had many surgeries, but thankfully he
was ok except for lots of arthritis.  He had a stroke and passed away when he
was about 68 years old.  That is young, and Pat has been a widow since then and
it has been hard for her.  She is overweight and has artheoarthritis, which is
very painful, so she is limited on what she can do.  She was in so much pain
that sometimes she couldn’t go to church, but she would try to go to Sacrament
Meeting if she possibly could.  I talked to her the other day, Feb. 2013, and
she said she is going to all her meeting now.  Not because she is feeling
better, but because she feels she needs to be there.  She is in so much pain,
but she tries to concentrate and feel the spirit.  She says it takes 2 or 3
days to recuperate from going, but she is still determined to do it.  Her two
daughters, who were strong in the church, have now left the church and it is
causing her a lot of heartache.  Her two sons are still very strong in the
gospel.  David, her youngest, and his wife and children are living with Pat. 
Pat’s home is paid for and they are not making enough money to buy a home. 
David’s son just left for his mission and Pat was thrilled about that.  She
says her daughter-in-law is not a good housekeeper, and Pat’s health won’t
allow her to keep it up, but she says she is glad they are there as they are
good people and she enjoys them, and her grandchildren are so cute.</p>

were married in the fall.  <b>Eleanor &amp; Dennis</b> had been going together
the longest (6 years), but they didn't get married until the following June. 
They used to fight so much when we were double dating - that we worried they
would kill each other if they should marry.  But, they didn't - in fact, they
get along good and are happy.  We all lived in the Weber &amp; Davis County
area, so we still did a lot together after we were married.  Our husbands all
became good friends also.  Over the years we have stayed close.  Years later,
we still usually get together at least twice a year or more.</p>

they were married, and that became the major topic of conversation<b>.  Ken
&amp; I wanted children also, but weren't able to have any for awhile</b> - so
that worried me and left me feeling bad after being with the other couples and
their babies.  I finally got pregnant and we were so happy, but I had a
miscarriage at about 3 months.  We were really disappointed.  I decided to take
it to the Lord.  I prayed asking for a child, and promised the Lord that if I
was blessed with a child I would do everything in my power to teach the child
righteous principles and set a good example.  I did get pregnant for which I
was very grateful. That special baby, was our “Sandi”.</p>

Snowbird and have invited us a couple of times to be with them and our other
friends (Eleanor &amp; Dennis Ewing, Margie &amp; Gary Nelson &amp; Pat &amp;
Ron Bradfield) to spend a couple of days.  We always had a great time laughing
&amp; talking, hiking, enjoying the beautiful scenery, riding the tram, playing
games, eating, munching, etc.  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Pat was my best friend growing up and Eleanor
was my next best friend.  We were all friends with Margie and Joanne too.  We
had a great time growing up together in the 40’s and 50’s.  We all got married
within a couple of years of each other.  Our husbands enjoyed each other too,
so we got together often to eat, play games, go to dances, etc.  It is now 2013
and we are still good friends although we don’t get together as often since
Pat’s husband, Ron, died with a stroke over five years ago, and Margie was killed
in a car accident a year later.  Her and Gary had put in to serve a mission and
their mission call was in the mailbox when she was killed.  We had missed
them.  Joanne has had kidney problems, was on dialysis, and got a kidney
transplant, but still has problems. Eleanor is on oxygen round the clock so the
last time we got together for lunch, she had to bring her portable oxygen tank
and Joanne was on dialysis every other day.  They live in St. George, but I had
e-mailed her to see if we could all get together when they were up the next
time to visit their family, so she called me to say when they would be up, and
I called the others and we had a great visit.  Gary had remarried a lady named
Ruth, so we met her that day.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>Pat has terrible health and has for a long time.  She is
overweight and has osteoarthritis and suffers terribly from it, but usually is
positive and appreciates the blessings the Lord has given her.  Her two
daughters have left the church, and that is heartache to her, but her two sons
are still strong in the church.  Pat goes to church each week even though she
is in terrible pain.  I love that special friend and am proud of her.  What a
great example she is to me and everyone.  Joanne passed away in 2014 of
Cancer.  Ron left Pat pretty well off, but she divided his retirement with her
four children, then later let her youngest son, David, and his family move into
her home since David was out of work.  This wasn’t a good idea as David’s wife
wasn’t a good housekeeper and soon the house was a mess and that was hard on
Pat since she was a good housekeeper.  They had a big dog and other children. 
Pat had to tend the children a lot and with Pat’s bad health, that was hard on
her too.  Pat helped them with their bills and eventually signed her home over
to them.  Big mistake!  In 2016, David and his wife sold Pat’s home and moved
her with them to Arizona to an apartment.  Pat loved her home and hated to
leave it but had no choice.  Things are even worse now as David and his wife
thought they could find good employment in Arizona, but it hasn’t turned out
that way.  (The grass is always greener on the other side.)  Finances are bad
again and Pat is helping them out with her Social Security.  Pat’s doctor in
Arizona won’t give her the medications her doctors in Utah were giving her for
pain and her health problems, so she is really suffering.  We keep in touch. 
While we were still living in Clinton, I asked Pat if Ken and I could come and
get her and she could stay with us for a week, two weeks or however long she
could.  We thought it would be good to get her out of the house and be with
us.  At first, she was excited and wanted to come, but later she called and
said that she has bladder and bowel problems now too and it just wouldn’t work,
especially since we only had one bathroom there.  I feel so bad for her as she
is such a good person.  She doesn’t blame the Lord for her trials, but said she
wondered what she had done wrong to deserve such a life.  The only happy time
Pat has had, was when raising her children with Ron and their life before Ron
died.  I told her that the Lord chastens those he loves, and that she hadn’t
done anything wrong, that these are just trials and to just have faith and try
to endure to the end.  We sure pray for her.  In November 2017,  I talked to
Pat on the phone and she had fallen and broken her femur bone in her leg and
had to have it operated on.  Her son and daughter-in-law both work and their
children are in school, so there was no one to take care of her after she came
home from the rehab.  She tried to get into a state funded assisted living, but
it didn’t work out.  Ken and I went to visit her in Provo at her rehab and when
we left, we were very concerned about how she would even get to the bathroom
with being alone and we decided that she needed to come and live with us, so we
could take care of her.  She said she would think about it, and she later
called and said she couldn’t as it wouldn’t be fair to us and our children. 
She knows that we usually go visit Shellie and her family in Arizona at least
once a year and they come and stay with us for a couple of weeks each summer or
more often.  We go to Twin Falls, Idaho (Kimberly, Idaho) to visit Jeff and his
family often and we do a lot with our family.  She felt she would be a burden
on us, and she didn’t want that for us or to slow us down, so she said “No”,
that she would work it out and be okay.  She did work it out, and her son and
his family helped her more.  We realized that it would have been hard to have Pat
stay with us, but I was glad we offered that to her, and we would have done it
and the Lord would have helped us, if she had said “Yes”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I worked part-time as a
secretary/receptionist for my Uncle Dale in his farm manufacturing business.  </b>I
enjoyed working as a secretary and working for Uncle Dale.  He was very good to
me.  His business was called Clear-field Manufacturing Company.  Hal and Bryce
worked for Uncle Dale part-time also making farm equipment.  Uncle Dale worked
so many hours there at his business.  I told him one day that he should take
more time off to relax and enjoy life.  He said “Mae, this is what I enjoy
doing.  I love my work.”  Years later I found out that his wife, Aunt Esther,
who I always thought was so happy and fun to be around (at least she was
whenever I was around her) was just the opposite at home.  My cousin, Randy,
said that his mother was a very depressed person, negative and hard to be
around, so it was easier for his dad to just stay at work rather than be around
her.  The children all worked for their dad in his business too and later he
divided the business and gave each of his children part of it.  After a few
months, I wanted full-time work, so I applied at <b>Clearfield State Bank</b>. 
I passed the test with a high score and passed the interview so was hired.  I
was a book-keeper.  I enjoyed the ladies I worked with and I enjoyed the work. 
My second cousin, Marilyn Bushnell also worked there.  She lived in
Clearfield.  I hadn’t known her before I started working here.  I worked there
less than a year because I got pregnant with Sandi, and we bought us our new
home on 13th street in Ogden.  It was funny how the ladies found out that I was
pregnant.  When I was hired, John asked if I would plan on working for at least
a year.  I told him “yes”, as I had had trouble getting pregnant, so I didn’t
think that would be a problem.  Finally, I started having morning sickness, so
I brought soda crackers to munch on to help me.  The other ladies brought snacks,
so I didn’t think anything about it.  The day that I went to the doctor to make
sure I was pregnant, I told the ladies that I had an appointment with the eye
doctor as I didn’t want them to know that I was going to an OBGYN.  When I came
back, they were laughing, and I asked them why they were laughing and they said
“You forgot to take your glasses to your appointment”. (I had left them on my
desk).  They said, “You are pregnant, aren’t you?”.  I told them “yes”, how did
you know?  They said they suspected it when I was always eating soda crackers. 
When I told John that I had to quit before the year was up, he was kind and
understanding.</p>

me practically from the time I was born.  She said he tried to tip over my

cried too easily, but as I remember it, he hurt me a lot – both emotionally and
physically.  Sometimes he would be pulling me around by my hair or doing
wrestle holds on me which hurt me.  I would be screaming, and Mom would come in
to stop him sometimes, (other times, she would just ignore it) but say to me
“Stay away from him; you know you always get the worst of it.”  I couldn’t keep
away from him as he would come where I was.  I remember when I was five years
old and got my tonsils out; it was done on our kitchen table while we were
living in our basement home.  Doctor Tanner used to make “home calls” back
then.  Just before the doctor was to give me the ether, I remember Hal coming
in and saying &quot;Ha, Ha, we're going to have cake and ice cream and you
can't have any&quot;.  He was always a tease while we were growing up.  I’m
sure it wasn’t Hal’s entire fault, however, because I was feisty and would say
plenty back to him.  One time when he was sitting in the kitchen watching me do
the dishes and clean the kitchen and teasing me saying: “Ha Ha, work harder
slave, you have to do all the work and I can go play or do whatever I want, but
you have to work, work, work, so work harder, Slave.”  I got so angry that I
told him to “go play then and get out of here”, but he wouldn’t.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier 10cpi"'> was a good looking little guy and he used
to like to sit on the couch and bounce his head and upper body, going back and
forth.  He would do that for the longest time.  I wondered if he would hurt
himself, but the couch was soft.  This is the picture of him sitting on the
couch wearing a cowboy hat and holding a toy gun.  Terry was a studious boy. 
He read a lot and was a straight “A” student.  Ken &amp; I remember him reading
an encyclopedia and asked him why he was doing that.  He said he wanted to
learn more and this was a good way.  Mom &amp; Dad bought an old upright piano
and Terry took lessons.  He loved the piano and developed his talent on it. 
You could always tell what kind of mood he was in, by the songs he was playing
and how he was playing them.  It seemed Terry was either very happy or very
unhappy.  No one knew until Terry was in High School that he had very poor
vision.  He was with dad at a basketball game, and a friend called down to
him.  Terry looked around, but didn’t do anything.  This happened a couple more
times until dad said: “Terry, why don’t you acknowledge your friend?”  Terry
said he couldn’t see him.  Dad took Terry to the eye doctor soon after, and got
him glasses.  Terry said he could never see the stars at night or birds in the
trees, etc.  Since Terry was so tall and big hands, everyone thought he would
be great at basketball, but he wasn’t, since he couldn’t see the ball coming
until it almost hit him (and it did hit him).  Terry was a social person so had
several friends and dated cute girls. Terry graduated from Weber College in
Journalism.  Terry had a list of the qualities he wanted in a wife.  After I
looked at his list, I said: “Terry, you are a great guy, but you are not
perfect, so how do you expect to find this “perfect” wife?”  Well, he did find
a girl who met all his qualifications, but he had to go to Anchorage, Alaska to
find her.  He went to Anchorage the summer after he graduated from college to
work in the Wonderbread bakery with a friend.  There he met Angela.  Her dad
had been in the military, was retiring and they were moving to Colorado. 
Angela was working at a JC Penny store in Anchorage.  Her parents tried to
persuade her to move there with them, and told her that she could get a job
with a JC Penny store there, but she told them that she had a strong impression
that she was to stay in Anchorage.  She met Terry and found out why she was
given the impression by the Lord to stay there.  After courting a while, they
flew down and were married in the Salt Lake Temple.  We all thought they would
stay and live here in Utah by us, but Terry loved it in Alaska, so they went
back.  They raised five children there and finally the dark and cold winters
were too hard on Angela, so she talked Terry into moving own to Chubbuck, ID
where their daughter, Meleah and family live.  They moved down in August 2015. 
We are glad to have them closer to us.</span></p>

side when I went to bed, so I would slide her over, and during the night her
hands and feet would hit me as she moved around.  Another thing that wasn’t so
fun was when I would leave for school, she would get in my jewelry and makeup
and make a mess of it, but it was still worth it to finally have a sister. 
Georgia said she had trouble with friends as she grew up also.  She, too, was
sweet and wouldn’t get angry and fight back when friends took advantage of her,
she would just go home and cry and feel bad.  Georgia was almost 11 years
younger than me - so I was married and lived away most of this time when she
was having a hard time with friends and with her brothers, as they teased her
unmercifully.  She said at the dinner table, if she ever said anything, they would
make fun of her.   I wish I could have been there for her.  Ken &amp; I did
invite her to stay the weekends with us sometimes.  She loved Sandi and would
play with her.  We enjoyed having her stay with us.  One summer when she was in
high school or college (can’t remember which), we invited her to come down to
Arizona, where we were living at the time, and stay a week with us.  She rode
the bus down and we had a great time.</p>

Christmas 1958 when we were engaged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My friends, Margie &amp; Gary got married in
April of our senior year - not sure why they didn't wait until school was out. 
It wasn’t that they had to get married, as she was not pregnant, and they were
married in the temple.  Ken &amp; I were married next - in June, then Joan
&amp; Ralph were married in the fall.  Eleanor &amp; Dennis had been going
together the longest (6 years), but they didn't get married until the following
June.  They used to fight so much when we were double dating - that we worried
they would kill each other if they should marry.  But, they didn't - in fact,
they get along good and are happy.  We all lived in the Weber &amp; Davis County
area, so we still did a lot together after we were married.  Our husbands all
became good friends also.  Over the years we have stayed close.  We usually get
together at least twice a year or more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Anyway, they all started having children soon
after they were married, and that became the major topic of conversation.  Ken
&amp; I wanted children also, but weren't able to have any for awhile - so that
worried me and left me feeling bad after being with the other couples and their
babies.  I finally got pregnant and we were so happy, but I had a miscarriage
at about 3 months.  We were really disappointed.  I decided to take it to the
Lord.  I prayed asking for a child, and promised the Lord that if I was blessed
with a child I would do everything in my power to teach the child righteous
principles and set a good example.  I did get pregnant for which I was very
grateful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had only been working part time for Uncle Dale
and I wanted full-time work so I applied at Clearfield State Bank.  I passed
the test with a high score and passed the interview so was hired.  I was a
book-keeper.  I enjoyed the ladies I worked with and I enjoyed the work.  I worked
there less than a year because I got pregnant with Sandi, and we bought us our
new home on 13th street in Ogden.   I’ll insert a funny incident that happened
there.  When I came back to work from my first doctor appointment, the ladies
were laughing and said “So, you’re going to have a baby.”  I said “How did you
know.”  They said because you said you were going to the eye doctor, but you
left your glasses here.  Also, we have noticed that you have been eating lots
of soda crackers and you haven’t looked so good so we thought you must be
having morning sickness.  When John hired me, he asked me if I could work at
least a year as they hated to spend the time and money training a person if
they only stayed for a few months.  We had been trying to have a baby, but I
hadn’t been able to get pregnant, other than one miscarriage, so I fully
intended to work there for at least a year.  This would only be about 10 months
so I didn’t want them to know until I had to tell them – but they figured it
out.  John was ok with it, he understood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I quit work at the bank in August as we moved
into our new home in Ogden.  We were excited to move into our home.  Since it
was new, we were able to choose the carpet, Formica, etc.  The home had two
bedrooms and a bath, a long kitchen and long living room and a full unfinished
basement.  We put the landscaping in and had a nice garden out in back.</p>

SANDRA LEE BROWNING “SANDI”</span></b></p>

align=left hspace=12>The Lord did bless us with a child - a beautiful baby
girl.  Our little Sandra Lee was born on November 21, 1961.  When I say
“little”, I mean little.  She weighed only 5 lbs 13 oz.  She had strawberry red
hair - so we named her Sandra Lee, calling her Sandi.  Ken said we already had
that name picked out, but I don’t remember it that way.  I remember seeing her
hair and thinking she should be called “Sandy.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            She was born on a cold snowy night.  I had been
in labor for 23 hours.  The funny thing about that was Ken was working two jobs
(so we could get our home) and he would call me every hour to see how I was
doing.  My mom also called me every hour.  The only problem was – one of them
was calling me every half hour and so I would just get sat down or lay down and
I would have to get up to answer the phone.  (We didn’t have cordless phones in
those days.)  I finally told them that I would be better if they would quit
calling me so often as it was wearing me out to keep getting up to answer the phone. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The roads were really bad when Ken drove me to the old “Dee
 Hospital” in Ogden.  When they put me in the “prep” room, I heard someone
screaming in the next room and it scared me.  I thought “Oh, is sit going to be
that bad?”  I guess I was scared so bad that my labor stopped.  The doctor, on
call, gave me some sleeping pills and told Ken to take me home and that if it
was false labor, I could get a good night’s rest and if it wasn’t , he would
see me back in a few hours.  Well, soon after we went to bed, the labor started
again.  Ken was asleep and I didn’t want to wake him and I didn’t want to go to
the hospital and have them send me back home again – so I just waited it out
until finally I had a showing and decided I’d better wake him as it scared me. 
He quickly got dressed and got me back to the hospital, and the doctor had to
act quick for the baby was about here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Later I found out that the mother who was
screaming in the prep room next to mine was Launa Barrows, a friend in the ward
who was having a miscarriage.  This was her first child also.  It was hard for
Launa and Blaine to see Ken and I with Sandi, especially since Sandi had red
hair and Blain’s hair was red and they had lost their little girl.  We have
seen Blaine and Launa a few times since we moved and Launa always asks about
Sandi.  They did have other children though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was in the hospital for 4 days.  We didn't have private
rooms like we do today, we had wards which had four beds (2 on the east side of
the room and 2 on the west.)  I enjoyed this as the four of us would become
friends and had a good time visiting, seeing each other's babies, husbands,
etc.  It was a fun time.  I think it was when Mike was born that I had the
experience with the one nurse which I shall always remember.  The four of us
ladies were having a good time visiting and laughing when all of a sudden a
booming voice yelled at us from the doorway to &quot;shut the windows, turn off
the light and get to sleep&quot;.  We looked at her and she practically filled
the doorway.  She was the biggest nurse I had ever seen, in fact I think she
was the biggest woman I had ever seen.  She looked like a woman wrestler.  Boy,
we scurried to close the windows, turn out the light and try to go to sleep. 
In the middle of the night my milk came in.  I became more and more
uncomfortable.  I'm not like most women - when my milk comes in, I become
engorged.  I swell up so bad and am in a lot of pain.  I didn't want to get up
because I would have to go to this nurse and I was afraid of her, but I finally
couldn't stand the pain any longer and got out of bed and went to find her.  I
explained what my problem was and she got me some hot towels to put on my
breasts and got me a breast pump.  While she was getting this for me, she
apologized for being so upset with us, but told me how she had been on vacation
and this was her first shift back.  The other nurses had left everything in a
mess and she was very frustrated and upset with them.  I guess she had taken it
out on us.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Anyway, back to when Sandi was born.  I had
Thanksgiving dinner in the hospital on the day Ken took us home.  I later found
out that Ken didn't get to eat a Thanksgiving dinner that year.  I wish I had
shared mine with him, but I thought his family would invite him or bring him over
a plate - guess I didn't think much about it.  We had lots of company that day,
and for several days. I can remember Hal &amp; Jean &amp; Joan &amp; Ralph
among others. I also remember wishing they would leave because I was weak and
needed to lie down, but mainly my milk was coming in and I was getting
engorged, and felt I was going to pass out.  I remember when they left, I went
into the bath room and stripped down to my waist and looked in the mirror.  I
was &quot;huge&quot; and I hurt so bad.  I didn't know what to do.  Ken didn't
know what to do for me.  I started to cry, and about that time my wonderful Mom
came.  Ken let her in and told her I was in the bathroom crying.  She came in,
got me into bed, put towels in hot water and draped over me, got me some
aspirin, etc.  I was so thankful she came at that time.  She said I looked like
&quot;death warmed over&quot;.  I felt that way too.  She told me that my
grandmother Bushnell always became engorged also, but she (Mom)never did.  I
wasn't happy to take after Grandma in that. Anyway, after a couple of days I
was doing much better - at least in that respect, but Sandi had the colic and
would scream night and day.  The most she would sleep was 20 minutes at a time
(and I'm not exaggerating).  I felt really bad for her because I knew she was
in terrible pain by the way she would scream and pull her little legs in.  The
doctor explained to us that some children have colic, but it only lasts three
months - that their intestines are not fully developed and so it causes them
pain.  Sandi had an extreme case of it.  Mike and Jeff also had colic, but
nothing like Sandi.  The only time she wasn't screaming was the 20 minutes or
less she was sleeping and when she was nursing.  My mom finally told me she
wondered if it was my milk - that maybe Sandi wasn't getting what she needed. 
I asked the doctor and he said it might be - so I quit nursing her.  I
regretted that because at least when I nursed her, she would keep it down, when
I quit she threw up all the time, and she still screamed with the colic.  We
tried all the formulas, but nothing worked until we finally tried &quot;Morning
evaporated milk&quot;.  She was able to keep it down better than any of the
other higher priced formulas.  It was hard to take her to church because Ken
&amp; I would take turns being out in the hall with her, and even then it was
hard for people to concentrate as they could still hear her screaming.  Ken's
sister, Margaret, had a baby daughter, Terry who was born about 3 months before
Sandi.  We would get together for family gatherings and we would lay the two
babies down on a blanket on the bed or floor.  Terry was a lot bigger and a
happy baby.  She would look over at Sandi who was always screaming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            With moving to a new area, and not knowing our
neighbors very well at first and with Ken working a full-time job and also a
part-time job, I had the major care of Sandi without much relief.  Ken would
come home at night after working at &quot;Stop &amp; Shop&quot; and find me
walking the floor with tears rolling down my cheeks and Sandi screaming.  We
tried everything anyone told us to do that might help - from holding her on our
lab in front of the warm oven, to giving her paregoric, baby sleeping pills
&amp; colic medicine (doctor prescribed), Catnip &amp; Fennel, rubbing her
stomach, even a drop or two of Brandi etc., etc.  Nothing worked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One time the doctor had prescribed something and
we gave it to her and she slept more than 20 minutes - in fact, after an hour
and a half we were worried that maybe something was wrong.  We called our
neighbor, Pat Wiggins whose father was a pharmacist.  She came over and looked
at the prescription and said &quot;it has sleeping medication in it, go to bed
and get some sleep yourselves&quot;.  We did, but she woke up soon after we got
in bed.  The medicine never worked after that.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            Ken and I would take turns sleeping by Sandi's
bassinet and we would pat her back throughout the night.  Sometimes when I
would be by the bassinet and patting her, Ken would be patting me in his sleep.
(That's how bad it was)  Although, one or the other of us would mainly be up
walking the floor with her or feeding her.  We didn't blame her as it wasn't
her fault, she was hurting so bad and we felt sorry for her - but it was really
hard.  I remember telling my Grandmother Bushnell that Sandi would soon be
three months old and over the colic.  She said &quot;Well, Mae, I have heard of
some babies who have it for six months&quot;.  I said &quot;If Sandi has it for
six months, I will be in the mental hospital in Provo&quot;.  Thank goodness,
she didn't.  When three months was up, she was a completely different baby. 
She was finally a happy baby and we enjoyed her.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had fun dressing my little girl in cute frilly
clothes and doing her hair.  I made the outfit she is wearing in this picture
and also her bunny Easter basket.  I made a lot of her clothes.  I loved being
a mother, and Ken and I loved our beautiful little daughter.  She was a sweet
and obedient little girl.  We would take her to friends homes where we would
put her in her pajamas and lay her down to sleep on their bed at bedtime while
we played games or visited.  When we left to go home, we would just pick her up
and put her in her crib or bed at home and she would seldom ever wake up.  If
she did, we just gave her &quot;her&quot; blanket and she would go right back
to sleep.  She got attached to a yellow blanket, and she always wanted to go to
sleep with it.  I had a hard time getting it away from her long enough to get
it washed and dried.  We tried to give her other blankets, but she didn't want
them, even if they were the same material or color. I remember one time we went
to some friends and left her blanket there.  She woke up as we were putting her
in her crib.  We reached for her blanket and couldn't find it.  We ended up
calling these friends and going over to get it as she just cried and wouldn't
go to sleep without it.  I finally had to cut it in half, so I could wash the
one half while she had the other and that way we had a &quot;spare&quot; at
home if we happened to leave it again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 10 – FIRST HOME IN
OGDEN 324 13<sup>TH</sup> STREET – Aug. 1961 to June 1969</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were excited to move into our home in Ogden.  The home
had two bedrooms &amp; a bath, a long kitchen and long living room and a full
unfinished basement. We had fun landscaping it and putting in our garden.  We
didn’t have sprinkling systems at that time and so we had to drag hoses, with a
sprinkler on, throughout the day.  Boy, did I appreciate sprinkling systems
when they finally came out.  Our neighbors were wonderful.  They were a lot
older than us - most old enough to be our parents or grandparents, but they
were wonderful to us.  There were two neighbors about my age and we became good
friends, but I loved all my neighbors.  Pat &amp; Ray Wiggins lived across the
street.  Pat was a dance teacher.  They only had one child, Susan.  They were
only semi active in the church.  We became good friends with them.  Pat and
Susan taught dance lessons and when Sandi was only three years old, Pat felt
Sandi would do good in dancing as her legs were strong, so we let her start
taking lessons.  Sandi did do very well.  She took lessons until we moved –
when Sandi was seven.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The Ericksons who lived next door
on the west of us had a beautiful yard and had 3 beautiful Horse Chestnut
trees.  They have such beautiful blossoms that last for a long time in the
spring - so Ken &amp; I have always wanted one.  We finally bought one in 1996
at our home in Layton - 778 E 700 S.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Brother Erickson's nephew lived with them.  He
was a bachelor and was almost the same age as Bro. &amp; Sis. Erickson.  His
name was Leonard and he &amp; Ken used to enjoy visiting over the fence and
comparing the vegetables they raised in their gardens.  One year, before
harvest time, Ken came home from work and found Leonard pulling up all his
tomato plants.  Ken asked him what he was doing and he said:  “You win, you
win.”  All his tomato plants were producing tiny yellow bell tomatoes and he
didn’t want them.  He had been sold these plants instead of the plants he
expected.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people on the east were nice people also.  They were not
members of the church, but good people.  He was a sheep herder and he demanded
that his wife fix meat, potatoes &amp; gravy for supper every night.  His
brother also lived with them.  I thought that was a coincidence.  This brother
only had one arm. (Can't remember their names).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken wanted me to stay home and raise our
children after we started having a family and I also wanted to do this.  We had
borrowed some money from Uncle Dale for our down payment on our home, so Ken
got a part-time job with a grocery store nearby, named &quot;Stop and
Shop&quot;.  He worked full-time as a computer operator at 2nd street in Ogden
(Army Depot) and enjoyed it, but they were making some changes and Ken thought
they were going to put him in the IRS dept and he didn't want that - so he
transferred to Hill Air Force Base.  He didn't work long there because there
wasn't enough work to keep him busy and he hated that.  They needed a computer
operator at Commercial Security Bank on Washington Blvd. in Ogden - so he
applied and got the job.  He worked there 7 ½ years - first as a operator, then
as a programmer, then supervisor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken had to work on crazy shifts.  The one I
remember was from 4 a.m. to 12 noon, but he worked all different shifts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We lived in the Mt Fort Ward.  For the first few
weeks we came home feeling bad because no one welcomed us there or was friendly
to us.  Ken said, as we left church one Sunday &quot;if we come next week and
no one speaks to us, we'll go to another ward. Well, the next week we had
practically everyone speak to us - at least it seemed that way and from that
time on we loved the ward. It was a ward that had all ages and we became
friends with all of them.  Pete &amp; Grace Mooney were quite a bit older than
us, but we became good friends.  Grace was a sweet lady and Pete was a
&quot;hoot&quot;.  He always kept us laughing.  We enjoyed being with them. Ken
can retell lots of stories Pete told us.  They were about 10 or 15 years older
than us, but that didn't matter.  I taught one of their daughters in MIA. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Hansen's were old enough to be our
grandparents, but they took us under their wing and were wonderful to us.  They
invited us to their home for dinner, they took us to the temple with them - to
do sealings and endownments.  That was the first time we had done sealings. 
Sister Hansen made our temple clothes for us (robes, sash, veil &amp; cap) and
she wouldn't let us pay her.  We used them from that time until 1997 when we
replaced them on our 36th wedding anniversary. - So we used them for about 33
years.  Sis. Hansen was a tall lady and so my robe never fit really well and it
would slide off my shoulder so I had to always pin it, but I never said
anything to her as I really appreciated her making them for us as a gift.  They
were special people.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another special sister was Sister Butler.  She
was a widow and had an apartment in her basement where usually the missionaries
lived.  We enjoyed her and also another elderly widow, Sister Thompson.  Sister
Thompson was a little Dutch lady - a widow and about 75 years old when we first
met her.  She lived in a basement apartment up by the church.  She had long
white hair and wore it in a bun or braid at the back on her head.  She was
really sweet and she became our second grandmother.  She was the mother to
Carol Petersen.  Alfred was Carol's husband and they lived in the ward too. 
Sister Thompson was such a sweet little sister that we really enjoyed going to
visit her or sitting by her at church, etc.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Blaine &amp; Launa Barrows</b> became our
good friends also.  They were about our age.  She &amp; I were pregnant about
the same time.  When Ken took me to the hospital to have Sandi, they put me in
a prep room and in the room next to me I heard a lady screaming.  I got really
scared and thought &quot;Oh no, is it going to be that bad?&quot;  In fact, my
labor stopped.  The doctor, on call, gave me a sleeping pill, told me to go
home and go to sleep and if it was false labor, I might be a few more days, but
if it was the real thing, he would probably see me back later that night.  It
was the real thing, and I woke up a couple of hours later in hard labor.  I
didn't wake Ken as I didn't want him to take me back to the hospital and have
the same thing happen again.  So I waited it out, until I finally had a
showing.  I got scared and woke Ken.  I wasn't long at the hospital until Sandi
was born.  In fact, I was lucky I had the showing or I might have had her at
home.  That was dumb on my part.  Well, I found out later that the lady
screaming in the room next to mine was Launa.  She was having a miscarriage.  Blaine's hair was red and since Sandi's hair was red (strawberry blond) it was hard for her
and Blaine to see Ken &amp; I with Sandi since they had lost their little
girl.  We have seen Blaine &amp; Launa a few times since we moved and Launa
always asks about Sandi.  They did have other children though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Ken wanted to go homestead in Canada</b>.  He
tried to talk me into going.  I knew it would probably be beautiful in Canada
so I was thinking about it until one night when Sandy woke up with the croup
and she could hardly breathe and the next morning we took her to the doctor and
was able to get medicine to help her.  I knew then that I didn’t want to live
out in the wilderness where I didn’t have close access to doctors and
hospitals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Denver, Colorado and Rocky
Mountain Nat’l Park in 1962 – </b>Ken and I took Sandi and drove to Denver,
Colorado as we had heard that there was lots of jobs there for computer
operators and Ken was working at Hill Air Force Base and didn’t like it as you
had to look busy when you were not.  Ken has always been a hard worker and
wants to give a full day’s work for a full day’s pay.  It turned out that there
were not needed computer operator jobs there.  We had been misinformed.   Ken
and I couldn’t afford to stay in motels and hotels all the time so we had taken
our tent and camping equipment and we camped in the beautiful Rocky Mountains
National Park. Sandi was not quite a year old, but she was very good traveling
and camping.  We went to the Ranger talks at night and camped for a couple of
days there.  Something happened to our car, which was an Oldsmobile.  We had
gotten decent gas millage before, but since going over the mountain, we got
terrible gas millage and could hardly make it from one gas station to another. 
We had to go into a bank in Denver and draw money from our savings to make it
home.  We had to get another car and Ken was able to get us a beautiful little
red car.  I loved it and my neighbor friends and I would wash our cars at each
other’s home while we visited.  I wanted it to stay clean and pretty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>When Sandi was about two years old, we bought
a small dog, a chiwawa</b>.  It was a high strung little dog - so we didn't
have it too long.  It was a house dog and Ken didn't like pets in the house
anyway.  One morning after getting Sandy dressed and fed, I hadn't slept very
well that night so laid down on the coach and fell asleep.  I shouldn't have
done that as when I woke up I found that Sandi had gotten into my lipstick and
got it all over the dog, herself and other things as well.  Thankfully, there
wasn't too much on the walls - anyway, it could have been worse, but wasn't
very pleasant to wake up to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another time, I remember coming into the kitchen
and hearing Sandy counting slowly and distinctly from 1 to 5 and she was
pointing at the dog with a frown on her face.  I used to count to five slowly
to her when she didn't want to pick up her toys and put them away.  I had to
laugh to myself upon seeing that.  I guess the dog didn't do what she wanted it
to do, so she was counting at him for him to obey.  I have always used that
method of discipline (along with many others) to get the children to obey.  I
don't remember ever having them not obey or complete the task when I would
count at them.  Sometimes it took for me to reach the count of 4 before they
started to move, but they did move because they knew I meant business. 
Sometimes they would look at each other and laugh when they were older, but
they still would obey.  I remember wondering what I would do if they didn't
obey, after they were older and even taller than I was.  I'm thankful that they
were respectful of me and would obey.  Maybe they knew they better because if I
told their dad, they would be in big trouble.  If Ken took off his belt, they
knew they were in trouble.  He did use it a couple of times, but usually all he
had to do was take it off and act like he would use it and it got their
attention in a hurry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11-21-1961</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Sandy was three months old, I was asked to
teach the Mia Maid class in M.I.A.  Sister Lois Braithwaite and I taught it
together for a month or so, and then she was released and I taught the girls
for about two months.  Sister Hill, the president asked to be released, and
Sister Joice Eggleston was put in as the new president.  She asked me to be her
Activity Counselor and Lynada Parsons to be her Age Group Counselor.  This was
done the first of June just before camp and the roadshows so boy was I busy.  I
went to Camp Beaver with the Mia Maid and Laurel girls.  Norma Devries was the
Stake Activity Counselor and she was a terrific leader.  Camp Beaver
is an ideal stake camp.  There is a river running just in back of the campfire
site.  They have a large tennis court, nice kitchen, care takers cabin, and
other facilities.  Norma had put a lot of work and planning in for camp that
year, and everyone had a wonderful time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Joice, Lynada, Ralph Lee, Blaine Barrows, and
myself worked on the roadshow.  Diane Barrott wrote the script.  Blaine and
myself were in the roadshow and the other executives directed it.  Blaine and
Ken made most of the scenery and props, and Lynada made the costumes.  The
script was about some Marsions invading Earth and interrupting a campfire
program.  They wore some really clever fluorescent costumes, and they have a rocket
ship which is really effective due to dry ice, and the noise coming from
Ralph's tape recorder.  We were quite discouraged because we had a hard time
getting the cast together, and when we did some would back out, and we were
continually replacing them.  The dress rehearsal was a failure, but the actual
presentations were very successful, and we ended up winning first place, Superior rating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The ward was divided in August, and since Joice
lived in the boundaries of the 2nd ward; they asked me to be the new
president.  I accepted and chose Lynada Parsons to be my Activity Counselor and
Deon Mayberry to be my Age Group Counselor.  Lynada was pregnant at the time so
when her baby was born, she asked to be released.  I chose Darlene Penrod for
my new Activity Counselor.  We had a hard struggle due to the fact that our
ward had a large trailer court and some motels so the people were very
transit.  We would get good women in the various positions and then they would
move out.  We would get very discouraged, especially me.  I worked quite hard
trying to make a success out of it, but different problems kept arising.  One
of the hardest involved Darlene.  We had been good friends, but it didn't work
out having her as my counselor.  She was too laid back (or lazy) and didn't
want to follow the manual.  At the last minute she would just say we were
having a dance and just bring records, or she would say I've decided it would
be fun to have a basketball game between the boys and girls.  At that time, the
church had half of the time for class and the other half for an activity. 
There were people called as speech directors, drama directors, sports directors
and dance directors.  Our manuals outlined what activity we were supposed to do
each week and it rotated the 4 directors.  We had pretty good directors, but
Darlene didn't use them.  Even when she would say we were going to have a
dance, she didn't contact the dance director.  Or when she would say we were
going to play basketball, she wouldn't contact the sports director.  These
people got discouraged because Darlene wasn't letting them do their job.  I
tried talking to her several times about it and that they were called to be
sports, dance, drama or speech directors and that the church wanted us to use
them and wanted us to have these activities for the youth.  It didn't help.  I
became more and more upset about it and finally fasted and prayed and called
her to see if I could meet with her.  She told me to come over.  I told her
that since I was the president, I felt the responsibility to follow the program
like the church had it outlined and that she would need to follow it.  I tried
to say it in a tactful way, but she became really upset and said she would just
quit and I could get someone else who would follow the program if that was so
important.  I tried to explain how I felt and tell her that I would like her to
stay in, but we did need to follow the program.  She wouldn't listen to me and
finally I left.  She called the Bishop and told him to release her.  He did,
and from that time on, Darlene didn't want anything to do with me.  She would
never speak to me and gave me dirty looks.  She would speak to Ken, but not to
me.  It finally got to me and I went to the Bishop and asked what I should do. 
I asked if I should apologize to her even thought I didn't think I had done
anything wrong.  He told me that it might help, so I tried to, but she wouldn't
accept my apology.  She never would speak to me until years later when we met accidentally
in a restaurant.  I guess she had gotten over it and we enjoyed visiting
together and catching up on our families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I asked for Lynada to be put back in the
presidency with me as she was a wonderful counselor and hard worker.  Deon also
was a terrific counselor and friend and I enjoyed working with her very much. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            With all the problems we had, it finally got me
down.  My nerves got the best of me.  I had terrible headaches, nervous stomach
and finally trench mouth.  My doctors advised me to get released, so towards
the end of that year (August) I was released.  Ken had actually gone to the
Bishop and explained how this position was affecting my health and he felt I
should be released.  Deon also wanted to be released so Lynada was asked to be
the president.  Ralph Lee had been the superintendent while I was the
president.  He was terrific at first - so enthusiastic and effective, but he
got so discouraged that he moved out of the ward.  Glen Kinlock was put in.  He
had worked in the Stake M.I.A. Superintendency over in Hawaii, and he was
really organized and efficient also at first, but after I was released he got a
second job in Salt Lake and was hardly ever at M.I.A. after that, so finally
they released him.  I enjoyed M.I.A. so I stayed in as secretary treasurer. 
Lynada was president for about six months.  She, too, got discouraged.  It
wasn’t long until they moved.  They asked Cora Thinnes to be the third
president.  She asked for me to be her Age Group Counselor and Jean Buckanan to
be her Activity Counselor.  I accepted, but this time it didn't work out
either.  Cora's attitude was - if it gets done, fine.  If it doesn't get done,
that’s fine too.  And she didn't want to put in much effort or time into the
program.  Finally she began to find any little excuse to stay home from mutual
or her stake meetings.  Jean moved and Myrna Moulton replaced her.  Since Cora
wasn't doing anything, this left everything up to Myrna and myself.  Myrna
hadn't been replaced as organist so she had to play every week so either Neldon
Braithwaite or myself had to conduct.  I got more discouraged as the time went
on, and finally Cora was released.  They wanted to put me back in as president,
but I knew for sure that I didn't want to try to tackle it again so I told them
that I would like to just stay in as secretary treasurer since I had never been
replaced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            During the year and a half since I was first put
in as secretary treasurer, we had five or six attendant secretaries.  That's
how transit our ward is.  In October of 1964, they asked me to teach the
Firelight class in Primary.  I accepted as I figured I could teach a class and
also be secretary in the M.I.A.  I enjoyed my class very much.  I only had four
girls, age 10.  They were all active.  I took Sandy to Primary with me and she
enjoyed her class also.  I believe it was in January that we had our
Daddy-Daughter Party.  It was a wonderful evening.  I was in charge of the
decorations so we decorated with a winter theme.  We hung paper snowflakes from
the ceiling of the banquet room, and put some on the walls with some cute paper
snowmen and other decorations.  We hung balloons in clusters from the lights
and above the doors.  We decorated the doorway with an arch of crate paper.  We
played games, the girls danced with their fathers, we had a nice program and
served banana splits and cookies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After I was released from president of the
M.I.A. in <b>1963, I got pregnant that October.  </b>Ken and I were very happy,
but I started having trouble.  I started going to Dr. Naisbitt as Mom talked me
into going to him instead of Dr. Jorgenson.  I was doing pretty well until just
before Christmas, in fact, Christmas Eve.  We had invited all Ken's family over
here for a Family Christmas Party.  I cooked a ham, cleaned the house, and
decorated the tree practically by myself (which was a real job in those days -
hanging individual icicles over the entire tree). I wasn't used to decorating a
tree like this because as I grew up, us kids got to help mom decorate the
Christmas tree.  Dad didn't like the commercialized side of Christmas, just the
Spiritual, and he didn't help us decorate the tree, put up any decorations,
etc.  Mom loved Christmas, but wasn't particular and let us kids, from the time
we were young, help put up the decorations and trim the tree.  So, as you can
imagine it wasn't a really fancy Christmas tree, but we loved it.  Ken's mom
had always decorated their tree herself on Christmas Eve.  She sent the
children to a movie, then put a blanket up across the door and they were not
allowed in the living room until Christmas morning.  She would stay up most of
the night trimming the tree until it was very beautiful.  She was very
particular.  I loved her tree and since their family was coming here, I wanted
ours to be beautiful.  I shouldn't have done it because after we had eaten and
the family was visiting, I started spotting.  I was worried and I had reason to
be <b>- at three months along, I had another miscarriage.</b>  It didn't happen
until after the holidays, but the doctor had me stay in bed and I finally lost
it anyway.  I was heart broken, but life goes on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I have surely been happy since our
marriage.  We like the same things, are both active in the church, and love
each other so much.  We're each other's best friend.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken was put in as secretary of the Aaronic
Priesthood shortly after we moved here in the ward.  I think it was November or
December of 1964 that Ken was put in as Elder's President.  He has been a good
president, but due to his work shifts at the bank, and his counselors, Blaine Rice,
and Charles Aravy, not being too dependable; he has had a rough time.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            <b>We have had some wonderful vacations since
our marriage</b>.  The next year after we were married we went down to the
parks - <b>Bryce, Zions and Grand Canyon</b>.  It was very beautiful and we had
a glorious ten days being together and enjoying the out of doors.  We visited
my relatives on the way and tried to attend a session at the St. George Temple,
but we missed the morning session and they didn't have an afternoon session. 
The next summer I was pregnant with Sandy so we didn't take a large vacation,
but we did take trips to Idaho to visit his relatives.  The summer of 62 we
didn't take a vacation as we thought Sandy was too little, but<b> the following
summer, 1963 we went to Denver by route of the Cascade Mountains.</b>  I had
been tending Deon Mayberry's children, Jan, Scottie and Kevin, during the
summer months and she got Luane Moulton to tend them while I was gone.  We
decided to go to Denver mainly to try to find a different job for Ken as he was
discouraged with his job at the bank and we were both discouraged with our
ward.  The mountains and camp grounds were beautiful and we had a wonderful
time there, but when we got into Denver, it was so terribly hot, it was so big,
and we were running out of money due to our terrible gas millage, and there
weren't any jobs to be had in I.B.M. so we were quite discouraged and disappointed. 
Our car was running fine when we left, and we don't know what happened, but it
got so bad we practically had to stop at every gas station.  We had to stop at
a bank and draw more money out of our account in Utah.  When we got home, we
had to trade it in on another car.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The summer of 64 we decided to take short
vacations to Salt Lake and Provo just the two of us.  Mom took Sandy
for us.  We enjoyed these more than the one to Denver the year before.  We went
to shows, went swimming and ice skating, ate out, stayed in motels and just
enjoyed ourselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             This year, 1965, we took our vacation up at
Ireland Park, just a few miles from Yellowstone Park.  We camped at Buttermilk
Camp Grounds, fished with our boat in the lake, and enjoyed ourselves.  At the
first of the week, we went to Lava Hot Springs.  Bob, Carol and their kids met
us there and we went swimming and sight seeing.  We stayed there that night and
the next day and Sunday night we stayed at Rich and Lois's.  We stayed in Pocatello Monday and Tuesday, then on Wednesday we went to the Idaho Falls Temple
to do baptisms for the dead with Rich and Lois.  Afterwards we went on to Ireland
 Park.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Dad</b> had been in the High Counsel of the North Davis
Stake for quite a few years.  He really enjoyed this position.  Shortly after,
Dad was asked to be <b>the Bishop of the Sunset 2nd ward </b>as Bishop Nicholas
was being released after being Bishop for eleven years.  What a challenge for
dad.  Dad Chose Carl Grimstad and Dwane Baldwin for his counselors.  A few
months later, Duane had to move so both he and Carl were released since Carl's
work affected his time too much.  Clayton Peterson and Brother VanBrocklin are
his new counselors. Everyone loved dad and he was a wonderful bishop.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  <b>Mom</b> is the Primary <b>Stake Secretary of the North
Davis Stake</b>.  She enjoys this very much.  <b>Bryce </b>is on his mission in
  Uruguay.  Mom lets us read his letters and lately they are very wonderful and
enlightening.  During the first part of his mission he was quite discouraged
and homesick.  I think this was because most of his companions were just about
ready to come home so they just went sight seeing and buying souvenirs and
didn't do much missionary work.  Now that he's senior companion, things are
working out better for him and he's enjoying his mission.  <b>Hal</b> is still
the same old carefree &quot;live for today, for tomorrow you may die&quot;
fellow.  He is a fireman here at one of the fire stations in Ogden.  He lives
with the folks, and is a pretty good kid other than he isn't a bit religious
and spends his money as fast as he gets it.  He is good to help the down
trotten though.  He always felt sorry for Uncle Royal and Aunt Maurine, and
would go visit them and take them gifts.  When he was in the Air Force and
stationed on the island of Crate, he was always helping the poor people there -
buying groceries for them, etc.  <b>Terry</b> is a Junior at Clearfield High
School.  He's six foot four inches tall and is really thin.  A beanpole you
might say.  When we would invite him to our home and I would fix us meals, I
wondered if I would ever fill him up, especially with pancakes.  I thought he
must have a “hollow” leg.  He's a good piano player and is really studious.  He
likes to read.  I wish I was more like him in that respect.  <b>Georgia</b> is
a Freshman at Sunset Junior High School.  She's really getting cute.  She's a
sweet girl and I'm really thankful for a sister like her.  She went up to camp
with me this year and really had a great time.  She tends Sandy for me
sometimes and is really good with her.  Sandy just loves her.  I'm eleven years
older than Georgia, and Georgia is eleven years older than Sandy - give or take
a few months.  When I was eleven, Grandpa Porter passed away, and when Georgia
was eleven, Grandpa Bushnell passed away.   <b>Kim </b>is feeling his oats
right now and is a worry to our parents.  He isn’t as respectful to our parents
as he needs to be.  I hope he changes and realizes what wonderful parents we
have.  (He did and is a wonderful man, son, husband, father, brother, friend
and a righteous son of God.  I am proud of him and love him very much.)</p>

- Hal met Jean Duke as her parents were friends of our neighbors, the
Thompsons, who bought Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell’s home after they passed
away.  Jean and her parents came to visit the Thompsons and Hal and Jean met. 
Hal had been going with a cute girl, Kathy, who I really liked.  She was sweet
and kind and pretty.  She loved Hal and he liked her, but she was Catholic, so
I think our parents were not as excited that he might get serious and marry
her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>When Hal met Jean, he started dating her and they got

they asked him to marry them and they asked Ken and I if they could be married

just the two of them, their parents and Ken and I at the wedding.  Ken put cans
on a rope and tied it to the back of their car.  They had reception at the
Sunset Church the next night.  It was decorated beautifully, and turned out
nice.  Our little Sandy was their flower girl.  Jean had been semi active in
the church, but I don’t think she went to church after she married Hal.  They
bought a home not too far away from our home in Ogden, so we got together often

align=left hspace=12>and while Hal and Ken played Chess, Jean and I would
visit.  Hal would usually win as Hal was such an intelligent kid that he was
good at everything he did.  Ken won once and was really excited about that. 
Hal &amp; Jean had a daughter, Cindi, who Hal adored.  Hal took her to
amusement parks, other parks and played with her a lot.  She loved him too. 
Hal took our kids on rides in his little Volkswagen.  He would take them on
roads down in Hooper and go fast as the road went up and down hills, they loved
that.  He also took them to Lagoon with Cindy, and would play the games there
and won them all a stuffed animal.  They thought he was the greatest!  Hal
&amp; Jean, Bryce &amp; Deana and Ken &amp; I would do things together also.  Hal
was addicted to sleeping pills as when <img width=319 height=1

align=left hspace=12>he was in the military, they got him on them.  He had not
slept well as a child, but no one knew this.  Hal just figured that everyone
just mainly rested at night.  I don’t know how he was able to function at
school and get good grades, but he did.  He used to tease me by saying: “Why do
you spend so much time studying for school?” and I would tell him that I wasn’t
smart like he was and had to study to get good grades.  Anyway, Hal would
overdose on sleeping pills at times and Jean would have to call an ambulance to
take him to the hospital, and then she would call Mom and say “Well, your son
did it again.”  Mom said how hard this was on her, that her heart would seem
like it went up into her throat, when she heard these words.  One time I was
just getting out of the hospital after having David, and Mom &amp; Dad were
getting in the elevator as Ken, our baby and I were getting out.  At first, I
thought they were coming to see me, but after looking at their faces, I could
tell something was wrong – they were coming to see Hal as he had overdosed
again.  When Bryce &amp; Deanna were having their Bryce &amp; Deanna were having
their reception, he did it again and put a damper on their reception,
especially for Mom &amp; Dad.  Hal would call Bryce sometimes and ask him to go
hiking with him, so he could wear off the drugs, and Bryce would but Bryce
would become upset, when at the top of the mountain, Hal would pop in more
pills.  I would visit Hal at the hospital and we had some good talks.  I loved
that brother.  He and Jean were having problems because of his overdosing, so
he would call me, and we would have long talks.  Ken and I had moved to
Arizona, but moved back to Utah at this time, and I believe it was because Hal
needed me at this time, and I was so glad I was here for him.  He told me that
Jean didn’t love him.  I talked with her about this and she said she didn’t
know how to love, as her parents hadn’t shown her love as she was growing up. 
That is so sad.  Jean eventually decided to take Cindy and separate from Hal
for a time as she felt by doing this, he would miss them so much that he would
get help and get off the sleeping pills, but this backfired.  He took his
life.  He had told me that he would only marry once as he had seen the grief
his buddies had had when they got divorces, and how hard it was that they had
to pay child support and alimony.  I think that he loved Jean and Cindy and
thought he was losing them and it was too much for him.  Mom &amp; Dad’s Bishop
was a social worker and he said that when a person has been on sleeping pills
for over 7 years that if something traumatic happens in their lives they can’t
take it.  I well remember the day that Mom got the word that this had
happened.  We were living in the home I grew up in, in Sunset.  Mom would call
me every morning to see how we were doing and just to talk.  This morning she
didn’t call, and I felt something was wrong.  <b>I called her, and she was
hysterical.  I finally got it out of her that the police had just come to tell
her Hal had taken his life</b>.  When he hadn’t reported to work for a couple
of days and hadn’t called in, his boss called the police and the police found
him in his home.  I jumped in the car and drove down to Mom &amp; Dad’s, but I
know the Lord blessed me that I didn’t get in an accident as I was crying so
hard, I could hardly see where I was going.  Jean felt bad and felt that we
blamed her for his death, but we tried to reassure her that we were not blaming
her and that we still loved her and Cindy and wanted them to still be a part of
our family and our lives.  Mom &amp; Dad were great to invite them to all our
family activities and they came, and they were in our family pictures too.  We
felt bad that Jean didn’t let Cindy come to her father’s funeral or see him in
his casket, so that there no closure for Cindy.  I think Cindy suffered the
rest of her life partly because of this. </p>

&amp; CAMP BEAVER</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In February 1965 I was called in to the Stake
President's office to see Brother Smout of the High Council and President
Thompson.  I knew it must be to take a stake M.I.A. position because that is
what they are over, but I thought it might be secretary or a class teacher. 
Boy, was I ever wrong.  They asked me to be <b>Stake Young Women’s Activity
Counselor</b> under Sister <b>Myrene Dransfield</b>.  I was so shocked I could
hardly drive home.  When I told Ken he told me he didn't think I should take it
as it would require too much of my time, and besides my nerves weren't the best
when I was in an executive position in the ward.  I called and talked to Dad
and Mom and Mom didn't know whether I should take it or not.  When I talked to Dad
about it before I made my decision, Dad said if it was him, he sure would
accept it as he really enjoyed stake work.  He liked going around and visiting
the wards &amp; getting to know more people in the stake.  I had to call
President Thompson that night and tell him my decision as they wanted to put me
in during stake conference on Sunday.  I prayed about it and the more I thought
about it and talked with Ken, we decided I should take it because if that was
what the Lord wanted me to do, then I should do it.  I was sustained during the
second session of conference.  That night they were having their stake speech
festival so Sister Dransfield asked me to come and help greet at the door and
sit up with the rest of the executives.  I replaced Jean Edwards.  Myrene told
me that when President Thompson asked who she wanted to replace Jean, she told
him she wanted me.  President Thompson told her that he didn't think my Bishop
would let me go and that she had better have a second name.  Mike (that was her
nickname) said she told LaRae what President Thompson had said so they both
thought and prayed some more, but couldn't come up with another name so they
knew the Lord wanted me in this position.  President Thompson told me that they
ask the Bishops and if the Bishops say the person is needed in the ward, he
tells them the stake needs them and is taking them.  I heard later that this is
what happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have had many wonderful and rich experiences
during the time that I was activity counselor.  I loved Mike right from the beginning. 
She was almost my mother's age.  I have never seen a woman so enthusiastic and
one who would devote as much time and work to her position as she did.  She was
a remarkable leader.  She could make money stretch further than anyone I have
ever seen, and get the most out of the money she did spend.  She could get
people and girls to do things that very few people could.  She could get up and
talk and the words would just flow out and the things that she would say would
be so timely and appropriate.  I learned a lot from Mike and she will always be
a wonderful friend.  I enjoyed working with LaRae Brown, the age group
counselor also.  She is a very efficient person and she really knows the MIA
program.  She is really quite the conversationist.  You usually couldn't get a
word in edgewise when she was around, but she is a wonderful person.  The women
on the board were really wonderful, especially my activity directors.  They
were: JoAnn Draney, Speech and Drama; Charlene Price, Music Director; Deanna Clark,
Dance Director and Marion Smout, Sports and Camp.  JoAnn was very good, but she
had to be prodded along.  I worked with her mainly on the roadshow preparations
- rules, judging sheets, theme, etc.  Ken helped me a great deal also.  At the
April Leadership Meeting we had all the activity counselors, speech, drama,
music and dance directors meet together and we handed them out the rules and
thoroughly discussed them so that they could get busy on their individual
roadshows and have them ready for July 26th, the date scheduled for the
presentations of the roadshows.  The roadshows went off very well.  Each ward
had a roadshow, and Harrisville won the Superior rating.  Lomond View came
next.  They only lacked a couple of points from being first.  They had put in
so much money into their roadshow that when they didn't win they were really
bitter.  They did have a cute roadshow, but Harrisville went along better with
the main theme &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; and thus received the most points from
the judges.  Mike and the rest of us were really disappointed with the way
Lomond View acted.  I also worked with JoAnn on the skit to be presented in
April Leadership for June Conference.  It turned out really cute.  I also
helped her with the Theme Presentation that was put on in September 65.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I liked Charlene, but I would get upset with her
some times because she would wait until the last minute to get things done. 
She started worrying about them early enough, but it seemed that they didn't
get done until the last minute.  She was very dependable at all her meetings,
however, and I enjoyed working with her.  I worked with her on the Stake and
Region Music Festivals and they were both very successful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Deanna is a very talented and dependable woman. 
She had a tough time, however, as her husband never supported her and was
always giving her a bad time.  I worked with her on the Teen Dances, Stake
Dances and floorshows, and especially the Stake and All-Church Dance
Festivals.  We had an All Girl's Dance and two squares of Square Dancers
participating in the dance festivals.  Deanna taught them these dances and did
a terrific job with them.  She put in a lot of hours and work with rehearsals
and everything.  I made the posters, programs, helped with the decorations,
planning, etc., for the Stake Dance Festival and I mimeographed rules, etc.,
for the dancers for the All-Church Dance Festival.  Deanna is a wonderful girl,
but she sure has a temper and she says what she thinks.  She also put in many
hours teaching dances during the instruction periods prior to the teen dances
every Saturday night during the months of January, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>February and March.  She had to be released due to her
health and her husband's insistence right after June Conference.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            <b>Marian Smoot</b> was my favorite activity
director.  It's funny because when I first met Marian my first impression was
that it would be hard working with her as she is a Gym teacher at North Davis
Junior High, and she is very efficient, dependable and skilled in her position
as Sports Camp Director.  I felt that I was inferior to her and that she would
probably resent me being over her.  Much to my surprise it was just the
opposite.  She went out of her way to support me in my position, and let me
know in various ways that she respected me and was behind me.  I think the
world of Marian.  I have never met a girl that was as efficient, as fair, as
sincere, willing to go the extra mile and had such a sparkling personality as
Marian.  Everyone loved her, especially the girls.  She was so dependable that I
never worried for a minute about the projects and activities that she was over
or working on, as to whether they would get done or not because they always did
and usually better than I could have done them.  Because of my fear of her
resenting me, I didn't get too close to Marian until we started working and
planning together for camp.  While Marian was in school, Mike and I would wash,
dye and crush egg shells for one of the crafts for camp.  We also got most of
the other crafts ready.  Then at night, we would get together with Marian and
LaRae and plan the menus, activities, work schedules, etc.  Marian and I got
together and planned our Campcrafter program for camp.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Soon after I was put in as Activity Counselor, Mike asked me
if I would try to study and prepare to go down to the<b> General Board
Campcrafter Certification Campout the 27th, 28th and 29th of May to become
certified so that we could start this program in our stake this year at camp</b>. 
Marian wanted to go down also, but since school would not be out by then, she
couldn't go.  I was so busy with all the other activities, meetings, etc., that
I didn't have too much time to prepare for this until that month.  That month,
especially the last two weeks, I really crammed.  Phillis Martin was certified
and she worked with me teaching me knots, lashing, map and compass, first aid,
etc.  Phillis lived in the ward I grew up in and was in the MIA part of the
time when I was a teenager.  Shirlene Larsen, the Stake Camp Director from the
North Weber Stake (the stake that shares our camp) went down with me to be
certified.  I have never in my life spent a rougher three days, but I wouldn't
trade those experiences for anything.  Thursday night from 5 p.m. until 11:30
p.m. we went around to the various groups for oral testing.  By the time that
night was over my head was spinning and I felt as if I was in another world.  I
passed everything, however, much to my surprise.  Friday morning we had to be
at the Grand Central Parking Lot at 7 a.m.  I spent Thursday night with Aunt
Enid and Uncle Wayne.  They were surely wonderful to me.  Shirlene spent the
night with her brother and his wife.  I drove her over and went and got her the
next morning.  We traveled from Grand Central in a caravan to Tracy Wigwam camp
where we put our packs on our backs and took our hike.  We arrived at a
campsite with no facilities.  We set up camp - pitched our tents, built
latrines, wood piles, tables, coolers, dug pits for our underground coolers,
etc.  Next we cooked our lunch and went on our map and compass hike.  When we
returned we had to hike down for water and prepare a skit for the campfire
program that night.  We were divided into groups when we registered Thursday
night.  The girls and women in my group were wonderful especially one from
Brigham who was also their Stake Activity Counselor and was about my age.  We
enjoyed each other's company very much.  The campfire program that night was
really great.  The next morning at 6 a.m. we had testimony meeting.  That was
truly a wonderful experience in itself.  The testimonies of those women were
beautiful.  The spirit was very strong. I was able to bear my testimony also. 
After the meeting we built our fires including the one using no matches.  It
took me quite a while to get mine going and to take care of it so I didn't have
much time for my breakfast.  Next we took our nature hike.  On this hike we
made our observations and taught our songs to one another.  We cooked our lunch
on our hike.  When we got back, we broke camp, and took our written tests. 
When I arrived home I was filled with a wonderful feeling for the wonderful
experiences I had had, but I was also so tired that I was about sick.  Ken said
I looked pretty awful.  I was sunburned, had blisters, dirty everywhere, etc. 
Mike had tended Sandy for me while I was gone.  She said it was the least she
could do.  I didn't get my letter telling me what level of achievement I had
passed for almost a month.  They said it should only take about a week, boy was
I ever anxious waiting for that letter.  Mike and Marian were also anxious. 
When it arrived I was so thrilled I could hardly see, for I had passed all four
years, I had achieved the level of Adventurer.  Mike, Marian and everyone was
very happy and excited, but not as excited as I was.  This picture is of Me,
Mike, Marian &amp; one of the other ward leaders, at Camp Beaver.</p>

align=left hspace=12>Our stake camp was called <b>&quot;Camp Beaver&quot;.</b> 
It was up past Huntsville and up South Fork canyon.  It was a beautiful camp. 
It had a river running on the north of it.  The girls used to play in it and
float on inner tubes during their free time.  It had cabins, a large cement
slab the size of a basketball court where we played volleyball, ate on picnic
tables in good weather, (when it was bad weather, we had another building where
we cooked the food and it had tables and benches and would hold about 60
people.)  We also held our activities on that cement slab.  It had a big
fireplace where we would cook food for some meals, it had a big fire area with
logs around where we would gather each night to have a campfire program and the
last night we would have our testimony meeting.  That was always the highlight
of camp as it was so spiritual.  Most all the girls and leaders would bear
their testimonies and the spirit was so strong.  There were large sinks and
mirrors outside the kitchen building where girls and leaders would wash their
hair.  It was a wonderful camp with lots of trees.  I loved it there.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The three cabins each held about 20 people. 
There were cots with mattresses for 20 - so the camp held about 60 people which
meant we had to have the Laurels go up one week, the Mia Maids go up another
week and the Beehives also a separate week.  That meant I was gone for three
weeks each year at camp.  The leaders would go up Sunday night so we could be
up early Monday morning to be ready when the girls and ward leaders arrived. 
We would go home Friday afternoon.  I would wash clothes on Saturday and go
with Mike to buy the next week's groceries for camp.  Sometimes Mike would have
the other counselor go with her.  When the third week was over, I was beat and
had really missed my family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first week I went to camp was the hardest
because I was the only one certified and I had to certify everyone else.  The
first week I passed Mike and Marian off along with the girls - so the 2nd and
3rd weeks Mike and Marian were able to help me pass off the girls and leaders. 
That first week all I heard was &quot;Mae&quot; (I was young then and didn't
particularly want to be called &quot;Sister Browning&quot;).  Some called me
that anyway to show respect.  Anyway.  Since I was certified, they needed to
pass everything off to me.  I had the ward leaders help me teach first aid and
bandaging, and other certification requirements.  Marian and I had the stake
camp staff help us with the activities and campfire programs.  The girls
enjoyed the hikes and most of the certification requirements, but would rather
have had more time to play than they did, so the next year we had the wards
teach their girls some of the requirements and then they just had to pass them
off at camp.  Anyway, back to that first week, I was worn to a frazzle trying
to help all the girls and leaders with certification, running from one to
another.  Finally, Mike called me into the kitchen cabin and told me to lie
down on one of the far benches.  She had a blanket and pillow on it.  I did and
then she scooted the table over by me and the tablecloth went down almost to
the floor - so no one could see me there.  When the girls were shouting for me,
her and Marian told them I wasn't available to help them for awhile.  That way
I got to have a short nap each day which really helped.  Marian and I had fun
with the girls.  We even had shaving cream fights and water fights.  Someone
brought &quot;itching&quot; powder and put down Marian's neck.  It was awful,
about drove her nuts for awhile.  They didn't try that again. </p>

align=left hspace=12>            The first year we only passed off the yearling
level (lst level).  The following year we passed off the 2nd level
(Mountaineer) to those who had passed the &quot;yearling&quot; the year
before.  The third year, we passed off the 1st, 2nd and 3rd levels and the
fourth year we passed off all four levels.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the best parts of camp was having <b>Jr Camp
Counselors</b>.  I would ask the wards to give me a list of their oldest girls
and I would pick one from each ward to be a Jr. Camp Counselor.  I would have
them come to my home where I would teach them the next level of certification
and we would go on a pre-campout where they could pass off this certification
so they could help Marian and I teach and pass off this certification at camp. 
Marian and I became really good friends by working so closely together on camp
and we became close with these Jr Camp Counselors as we taught and trained
them, went on the pre-campout and then worked together at camp.  They were
special girls and were a lot of help to us.  This picture is of me (2<sup>nd</sup>
from left) and my Jr Camp Counselors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Jr Camp Counselors for the fourth year at
camp were my favorites.  I had asked Tammy to help me with camp that year.  She
consented to be over the lst year (Yearling) certification - so we went to camp
with me the first week.  She also consented to go with me and the Jr. Camp
Counselors to the Pre-Campout.  We had lots of experiences there.  We picked
two tents.  Half of the girls were in one tent with Tammy and the other half in
the other tent with me.  I don't remember Marian going with us on this
campout.  We heard noises outside the tent that night, but I assured the girls
that it was probably just squirrels or other small animals.  The next morning
we found bear tracks around our tents.  Later that day a forest ranger stopped
by and asked us if we had seen a brown bear as it had been spotted at several
campsites.  We didn't sleep as well the next night, but he didn't come around,
thank goodness.  Tammy had brought Larry's pistol so in case we needed it - we
did.  On our hike we ran into a rattlesnake and Tammy shot it.  Even though we
had a lot of excitement, we also accomplished a lot and had a lot of fun also. 
We had a big water fight just before we left camp.  These Jr. Camp Counselors
presented Tammy and I each with a book of favorite quotes at the regular camp. 
(I don't remember the name of the book, but I should still have it.) On the
inside cover, the girls had gotten together and composed a poem about our
pre-campout.  It told about the bear, rattlesnake and water fight.  It was
really cute and I have treasured that book.  (Guess I will go down and look for
it in the bookcase.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first year we had some problems with the
older girls.  We had set rules, one of which was that boys were not allowed in
camp and that the girls were not allowed to leave the campground unless, of
course, their parents came to get them as a couple did who were going on
vacation.  We told the girls that if any girl should invite a boy up or entice
him into the campground, she would be taken home.  Well, sure enough, they
tested us by doing it one night.  They snuck out of camp, met their boyfriends
and were necking with them just inside the campgrounds. We took the two girls
home the next morning.  We didn't have trouble with any of the others after
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a girl nicknamed &quot;Scotty&quot; with
us.  She was really a leader, but was leading the girls in the wrong
direction.  She was a troublemaker, and caused us some grief that first year. 
We decided that if she was coming the next year, we had to get her on our side
- so we met with her and told her she was a &quot;natural leader&quot; and that
we needed her to help us with camp.  She was cooperative and liked the
responsibility we had given her.  That following year at camp was much better. 
If the girls would get rowdy while we were trying to teach certification,
Scotty would either just glare at them, or tell them to &quot;listen up - that
they needed to learn these things&quot; and they would listen.  It was great to
have her on our side.  The last night at testimony meeting when most of the
girls and leaders had born their testimonies, Scotty stood up.  With tears
streaming down her cheeks she thanked all the girls and leaders for being her
&quot;friends&quot; and caring about her.  She told the girls that if their
parents are strict and put a curfew on them and want to know where they are
going and what they are doing and want to meet their friends - that they should
be grateful and thankful that their parents care about them.  She said she
wished her parents cared about her, but they don't.  She said they don't care
where she goes, how long she stays, what she does.  She started smoking to
&quot;shock&quot; them and see if they cared.  They didn't.  She then started
drinking and going around with the wrong crowd, they still didn't care.  She
said they wouldn't care if I ended up in the reform school or jail - maybe they
would be happy because then I wouldn't be around.  It gave us all something to
think about - and we felt so bad for Scotty.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            (More about camp - hope it isn’t a repeat, but
not time to keep going through this rough draft at this time).  Camp Clean-Up
was the 26th of June.  We started at 8 a.m. in the morning.  There were to be 4
women and 2 men from each ward and all the stake board.  Everyone brought part
of the lunch.  While the rest were cleaning the camp, Marian and myself, with
the help of Brother Swaner, prepared the fire displays and woodpile for our
campcrafter program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Monday morning at 5:15, Marian stopped by to
pick me up.  We told the girls that they could be there at 6:00 a.m. so we had
to be their a few minutes early.  It was quite chilly at that time of the morning. 
We had the girls go into the kitchen where Mike explained the rules of the camp
- what was expected of them etc.  They went to their cabins, picked out a bed
and spent a few minutes getting settled.  Mike, Marian, and myself were each in
a different cabin.  We also had two ward leaders in each cabin.  After everyone
was situated in their cabins, we had them come up and register, check in crafts
and written reports for the campcrafter program and they were assigned to their
work details.  Breakfast consisted of rolls and hot chocolate, afterwards
everyone got busy on their work details and then straightened their cabins. 
Marian and I tore the material for the lunch sacks.  At 9 a.m., they came up to
the outside tables and make their lunch sacks.  Marian explained the
campcrafter program to them and we passed out their campcrafter booklets for
them to study the rest of the morning and whenever they had time.  At ten,
while the girls were studying, Marian and I taught the leaders their various
fire demonstrations to be presented in the afternoon.  Lunch was served at noon
on paper plates and cups so that immediately after, we could go ahead with the
campcrafter program.  At two the girls were allowed to play in the river or do
crafts.  At five we had supper, 6:45 p.m. we took the flag down, and at seven
we had our relays and junior Olympics.  The girls enjoyed these and had a lot
of fun.  Afterwards we showed films of last year's camp and of June conference
for this year.              We woke the girls at 6:45 a.m. Tuesday morning. 
They moaned and groaned, but they finally got up.  Flag ceremony was at 7:30
and breakfast followed.  We cooked pancakes, bacon and eggs on the outside
grills and ate outside.  It was a beautiful morning.  After breakfast everyone
had their work details to do, then straighten their cabins, and afterwards
everyone that didn't have a hat, had to come up and I helped them make a
wallpaper hat.  While I was doing this, Mike and the other leaders were
preparing the items that the girls were to take on their hike for their lunch. 
At 9:30 everyone came up to the kitchen in their hiking clothes and gathered up
their lunch, put it in their lunch sacks that they had previously made, and at
10:00 we left for our hike.  Mike and one or two of the ward leaders stayed to
get things ready for supper.  Marian and I led the way and the other leaders
were scattered throughout the line, but the last week as we were anticipating
trouble, Marian led the way and I brought up the rear.  The hike led the girls
through creeks, where we had to cross by way of large rocks or a log.  We had
to go through fences and bushes, but finally we arrived at the Weber
 Memorial Park.  The first week the girls built their individual fires in a
large clearing at the park, but the other two weeks we had them build their
fires out in the parking lot before we left for the hike.  We cooked our lunch
and ate, and by then the girls were ready to return to camp so that they could
play in the river.  At 6:00 we had supper and at 7;00 we had a Forrest ranger
come and show films and talk to us about fires and conversation.  This was our
program for M.I.A.  We met over at the campfire, however, at 7:30 for our
opening exercises and afterwards we went back and sang songs around the
campfire.  Every night we took one cabin and taught them north by the stars and
how to make a bedroll.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On Wednesday morning we arose at 7:00, flag
ceremony at 7:30, breakfast right after.  Then work details and cabins to be
straightened.  Between 10 and 11 we taught the leaders First Aid.  Marian
taught a couple of the leaders, and I would teach the other two, then each of
us would prepare for our demonstrations.  Lunch was served at noon, and our
campcrafter program was from 12:45 to 2:00.  The girls played in the river and
worked on arts and crafts until around 5 p.m.  The girls were given sweet rolls
that Mike and some of the ward leaders had made during the day, to tide them
over until our Hawaiian luau.  Between 6:00 and 6:30 we took down the flag,
then we had the girls get in their groups and we gave each leader some
balloons, create paper, tape and other decorations and each group was to
decorate a forth of the slab for our Hawaiian Luau.  The girls were really
clever, they really had some darling ideas.  One week they made a Hawaiian girl
out of a broom, mop, pillows, crate paper, and some of their clothes.  They
also made palm trees, a boat, a hut and various other decorations.  Each week
they really made the slab look like Hawaii.  After we were finished decorating,
we played Tin-A-Ling (Japanese hop scotch), Lummy sticks and they did the
Limbo.  At eight we had our luau outside on the tables which were lined up down
the middle of the slab and decorated.  We barbecued a half of a chicken for
everyone.  We had tossed green salad, cicabobs, rolls, orange drink and cake
with lemon sauce.  One week, we had the stake presidency and their wives and
other high council members and visitors come up for our luau.  This was really
a success and one of the main highlights of the week.  After, if it was late
enough they would go to their cabins and finally go to sleep.  One week it was
too early so Marian took them over to the campfire and led them in songs and
they told scary stories.  Mike and I didn't go down as we were tired and were
doing other things.  The girls thought that we were dressing up and would come
up out of the river to scare them since they were telling scary stories.  They
heard some noises and started screaming and running - so they ran to the cabins
and hid under their covers.  Mike and I wondered what was going on when we
heard the screaming and girls running everyone.  Marian came in and told us
what had happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Thursday morning we were up bright and early at
7:00.  The girls didn't think that this was such a good idea.  They wanted to
sleep in - so Marian, Mike and I had to do as we did every morning; go in each
of the cabins several times, banging on pans, tickling them, pulling down their
covers, etc.  After flag ceremony, breakfast and while the girls were doing
their work details and straightening their cabins, Marian and I taught the
leaders the remainder of the First Aid and north by the sun.  Lunch was at
12:00.  After the campcrafter demonstrations, Marian and I started testing the
girls orally.  The first week I had to test all the girls by myself as Marian
wasn't certified.  Boy was I every exhausted when I finished.  The other two
weeks it wasn't so bad as I only had to test half of them.  We just spot
checked them on their requirements and all that they had learned during the
week.  While one group was being tested the other groups played in the river. 
We had supper at 5:00 and afterwards we gave the girls their written test. 
Following this we had our testimony meeting which was always so inspirational
and wonderful.  We all sat on the logs around the campfire and listened to each
other bear our testimonies.  The second week every girl and leader bore their
testimonies.  The girls went down to their cabins after our Miss Eager Beaver
was awarded and the closing prayer was said.  The last week we gave Mike a
stuffed bear to remember us as her nickname was &quot;Mother Bear&quot;.  The
first week, the first year Beehives gave Marian the nickname of Daddy Bear, I
was Mama Bear, and Mike was Big Beaver.  Thursday night was sad for the girls
as this was the last night they would be at camp as the next morning they would
be leaving for home.  They would miss the friends they had made at camp, this
way of life, and all the fun and wonderful experiences they had had.  Some of
the girls, especially the first year Beehives cried half the night.  We didn't
think we would ever get them to settle down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Friday morning we got the girls up early, had
cereal and toast for breakfast, and assigned them their duties for that morning. 
Some had to clean cabins, some had to clean tills and pick up all around,
others had to defrost and clean the fridge, and still others had to mop and wax
the kitchen floor.  Their parents and leaders came up to get them around
10:00.  Mike, Marian and myself were usually there until noon getting things
ready for the next week and making our new grocery lists.  When we got home we
had to do our washing and ironing, clean house, fix casseroles and cakes, etc.,
for our families to eat for the next week.  Mike's mother-in-law did her
washing and ironing - so she got the groceries and other items we needed. 
Three weeks at camp plus all the time preparing for it, took up most of the
summer.  It was a sacrifice, but I loved it at the time because I loved everything
about camp - the girls, ward and stake leaders I worked with, camping and
having fun along with all the work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Since I was the only one certified, whenever
anyone got hurt, didn't feel good, or were just teasing, they would yell
&quot;Mae&quot;.  They thought that since I was certified and had a sleeve
patch that I should know everything and know how to do everything.  The first
week we had more than our share of accidents so I was running to one or another
a lot of the time.  Finally Marian got disgusted and told them to come and find
me instead of yelling for me all the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The girls or &quot;ladies&quot; as Marian called
them were really a lot of fun and cute kids.  They brought shaving cream, silly
soap, honey, saran wrap, catsup, cereal, rice and many other things plus lots
of squirt guns to play tricks.  We told them that they could play tricks and
have fun as long as it didn't hurt anyone and for everyone to be good sports. 
We had to be good sports to as they were always throwing us in the river, or
putting shaving cream and silly soap all over us.  They used the honey, saran
wrap, and catsup etc., for the tills and un screwed the light bulks so that
when someone came down to use them, they would sit in this mess.  We always had
to take our flashlights when the three of us went down at night.  The three of
us were always the last to go to bed as we would stay and talk up in the
kitchen or get things ready for the next day until the ward leaders got the
girls quieted down.  When we went to bed we would usually find all kinds of
goodies waiting for us, such as our sleeping bags sewed together, or full of
cereal, rice, rocks, grass, etc.  The first week, the girls were continually
putting shaving cream on us or doing something, so Marian and I decided to pay
them back.  Wednesday night after the Luau and the girls had gone back to their
cabins, Marian and I filled our squirt guns and took some matches to light the
small firecrackers she had brought and went down to the cabins.  We locked the
doors from the outside and went around to the back where we put the
firecrackers under the doors and squirted through the windows.  The girls
thought it was boys and they really got scared.  They started screaming and
yelling so we unlocked the doors and tried to keep a straight face and went
into the cabins and told them that we would go scare the boys away and for them
to quiet down and go to sleep.  Apparently they didn't believe us and guessed
who the boys were because the next day they ganged up on us.  First they threw
Marian in, then they grabbed me.  Marian tried to stop them so she got thrown
in again.  We really gave them a fight for it though, and we threw several of
them in.  Darla, Mike's daughter, sat there laughing.  She was the one that
roused them up and then she sat there watching and letting them do all the
dirty work - so we grabbed her.  I've never seen such a wildcat, she kicked and
fought and both Marian and I thought we would never make it to the river with
her, and when we did we sunk down on the bank huffing and puffing.  Mike saw us
grab Darla so she ran and got her movie camera.  She told the ward leaders that
Darla would really give us a fight for our money, and boy she did.  That
afternoon I went down to my cabin for something and there was my sleeping bag
hanging from the rafters.  It was sewed together and filled with goodies of all
kinds.  Marian's was about in that shape too.  We also got our fill of shaving
cream, etc., that day.  The next week Marian and I decided we'd better not try
that trick again, but the last week the girls were asking for it again, and
since it was our last week we decided to live dangerously again so we cut up
onions and put them in the pillow cases of some of the girls who had been the
worst - Pam, Scotty, Chris and a few others.  It took them until the next night
to figure out who did it, but they just blamed Marian.  They thought I was too
sweet and nice to do it, so after Testimony meeting they grabbed her and dumped
itching powder down her back.  I tried to stop them, but was too late.  It was
like little slivers.  They really started to bother her so we ran up to the
kitchen, she threw her blouse off and I tried to gently rub it off and wipe it
off with a damp cloth.  Finally I had to pick some of them off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Marian brought her skate board up to camp and
whenever she got a few minutes which wasn't very often, she would ride around
on it on the slab.  She tried to teach me how to use it, and I have to admit it
is quite fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a couple of incidents with snakes.  The
first Monday we were up there, Marian and I took off around 4 p.m. to make sure
of the trail that we were going to take them on the next morning for their
three mile hike.  As we approached the memorial park we were walking in tall
grass.  I went to take a step and just about stepped on a blow snake.  I jumped
and almost landed on another one.  From then on, I let Marian take the lead. 
The other incident was when the girls found a water snake and tied it down from
the rafters just in front of Marian's bed.  That day after we got out of the
river the girls in that cabin could hardly wait until Marian got down to her
cabin.  Mike found out about it and motioned to me to go over where she was. 
She told me to tell Marian as she was afraid it would really scare her.  I told
her, but she really put on a good show for them pretending she didn't know it
was there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike hated the river so she never got in it
unless the girls threw her in.  Marian and I really enjoyed it though.  It was
great fun floating down it on inner tubes.  There were only a couple of days
each week that we had time to get in it, but when we did, we really took
advantage of it and had a ball.  We made trains with the girls and went down
that way some times.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            One day Marian and I were so beat, and you
couldn't get any rest in the cabins so Marian suggested that we get out pillows
and put the benches under the tables and go to sleep on them.  The table cloths
were down low enough so no one could see us so we were able to get a little
rest that way.  When we got up we were a little stiff though as the benches
were really hard.  Some of the girls came looking for us, but Mike was always
such a good sport and she told them to look elsewhere for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Every night while we were sitting visiting we
would snack on left over doughnuts, cookies, cup cakes, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I really love camp.  I enjoyed the time I spent
up there very much.  I grew to love Marian and Mike very much, also the other
ward leaders and all the girls.  You can get so close to the girls at camp. 
This is one of the reasons I enjoy it so much.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1964 -</b> <b>Larry &amp; Tammy Braithwaite</b> moved
into our ward, the Mt Fort Ward in Ogden.  They were about our age and Bishop
Moulton asked Ken &amp; I to fellowship them as they had been inactive.  They
had just lost a little daughter in an accident.  Larry and his father were
contractors.  They had a large building framed up and Tammy brought her two
girls, Cindy and Lori over to see their dad.  A storm came up and one of the big
beams fell on Cindy, killing her.  Larry &amp; Tammy were devastated.  Bishop
Moulton had helped them and he wanted us to take over.  We did and became best
friends.  We invited them over for Sunday dinners and they invited us to their
home.  We took turns eating Sunday dinners at each other's homes and were
together a lot other times as well.  Sandi &amp; Lori had fun playing
together.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>Larry &amp; Tammy lived in a nice Trailer in a trailer
court in our ward.  At that time Ken &amp; I were Young Marrieds leaders.  We asked
Larry &amp; Tammy to help us.  They did a great job and we had fun working
together<b>.  Tammy &amp; I had fun as we made up corny verses to put in
invitations for Young Married parties, firesides and other activities.</b>  We
had good turnouts at our activities and firesides.  We didn't limit them to
just young marrieds, but all the couples of the ward.  <b>We became good
friends with Bob &amp; Pauline Hein and John &amp; Linda Willerton also</b>. 
The four couples of us were always at the firesides and activities whether many
others came or not - usually there was a good crowd, in fact, most of the
couples in the ward.  We had &quot;Come As You Are&quot; parties,
&quot;Backwards&quot; parties, Progressive dinners, square dances, etc.  We
went deer hunting with Larry &amp; Tammy.  It snowed and was really cold.  We
pitched a tent for the four of us, but that night I dressed really warm (really
funny, but warm) I put on long johns, my flannel nightgown, a sweater, wool
scarf, mittens - I guess that's all.  Anyway, I looked really funny, but I was
warm and that was what mattered.  Then Tammy laughed and said to me
&quot;you're caught, you have to come dressed this way to our Come As You Are
party&quot;.  Her and I were going around the ward catching people in funny
attire to come dressed that way to this party.  I had not &quot;caught&quot;
her and she had not &quot;caught&quot; me - until then     </p>

the temple, out to eat, played games at each other's homes, etc.  After Larry
&amp; Tammy moved to Liberty, they invited us up for New Year's Eve and to
sleep over and spend the next day riding horses.  We went to a New Year's Eve
dance together, then went up to Larry &amp; Tammy's.  We all had baby sitters
for our children.  I think Larry's sister was tending their children at her
home as they were not at their house.  We ate, played games and then tried to
sleep a little, but every time we would quiet down and start to go to sleep,
Bob would come and squirt water on our faces.  We finally all piled on him and
tied him up.  We've laughed about that many times since.  We had a good time
riding horses, visiting, eating, etc., most of New Year's Day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ken had gotten a job with Commercial Security Bank in their
data processing department in Ogden, and he was happy to leave HAFB.  He worked
here for about four years and then he went into partnership with our friend,
Larry Braithwaite, in his construction company.  The four of us had become
great friends.  We seemed to have a lot in common and their other child was
Lori and she was the same age as Sandi<b>, </b>so they had fun together.  Then
they had Holly and I had Shellie soon after.  They had Lonnie and then Jody. 
We had Mike, David, Scott &amp; Jeff.  Holly &amp; Shellie played together when
they were little, Lonnie played with Mike &amp; David.  I was pregnant with David
and Tammy was pregnant with Jody.  I was due a month earlier than Tammy was,
but she said “You go two weeks late and I will come two weeks early and we can
be in the hospital together.”  I told her that it was great for her to come two
weeks early, but I didn’t want to come two weeks late.  Well, that’s exactly
what happened.  I went two weeks over and the doctor was going to start me on
Saturday.  Tammy called me Friday night and said “Mae, I’m on my way to the
hospital and I will tell Linda (a nurse who lived in our ward) to save a bed
for you next to mine.  In those days we didn’t have private rooms, there were
four beds in each room, and we stayed for three days in the hospital after
having our babies.  We had fun together.  Tammy had thought she would have a
boy and I thought I would have a girl, so we were both surprised.  In those
days, we didn’t have ultra sound machines, so we didn’t know the sex of the
baby until it was born.  My doctor, Byron Naisbitt would ask me what I wanted
and if I said I wanted a girl, he would say it was a boy.  If it was a girl,
then I was happy and it didn’t matter what he had said, but if it was a boy,
then he was right.  Tammy and I became best friends and we were always doing
things together and going places together. Tammy &amp; I have always been
close, even when our husbands were having problems, we didn't.  We always felt
we were as close as sisters.  The good part was that we didn't fight as some
sisters do.  We even dressed alike sometimes and people thought we were sisters. 
Many times while our husbands were working, her and I would get together and
make crafts, work on scrapbooks or picture albums, make Christmas candy
together, etc., etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> As families we would eat at each
other’s homes, go to the parks together and have picnics, go camping and

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jennie’s Lake in Wyoming</b> – When the children were
young, in fact we only had Sandi and maybe Shellie at that time, and Larry

to camp and fish.  It was a great place to go and we loved being with our good
friends. We went there several times.  One time we invited the families from
our “Ward’sYoung Married Group” and that was fun too.  Sometimes we would get a
babysitter for our daughters and the four of us would climb in the cab of their
truck and go four wheeling up in the mountains.  It was always fun.</p>

align=left hspace=12>The first summer, when Ken &amp; Larry were working
together, the four of us took our girls, Sandi &amp; Lori, who were the same
age and became good friends, <b>and went to Yellowstone Park together.</b>  The
year was 1966.  Larry &amp; Tammy had bought a camp trailer.  There had been an
earthquake in Montana, close to Yellowstone Park so we went there too.  It had
devastated that area.  We walked onto the roof of a home which had been flooded
and carried away.  We loved Yellowstone Park and enjoyed being together.  We
went to a ghost town too and other places.  We fixed most of our meals in the
camper and we played “Rook” at night after the girls went to bed.  That was the
time when we stopped wanting to play Rook with them as Larry began outbidding
everyone even though he knew he had a bad hand as he thought the odds of
winning were good and he always wanted to control the bid.  Many times he went
under, but he didn’t care, he would still keep outbidding us, so that was no
fun for the rest of us any longer.  I think that’s the last time we played Rook
with him.  The girls had fun together.  We stopped on the way home at the Idaho
Falls Temple and took pictures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Ken didn’t like working for Perk Petersen
because he couldn’t trust him.  He would say one thing and do another.  We had
a hard time getting our pay check and when we did, it usually bounced.  Perk
didn’t keep track of his money, and would write out checks and didn’t know
there wasn’t money to clear them.  This happened time after time until Ken
finally quit and went to work for Modular Construction Company at Free Port
there in Clearfield. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At this time Larry and Tammy had purchased some
land in Liberty (up above the dam at Ogden Canyon) to build their home on and
have some animals.  We figured we would trade our equity on our home in Ogden
for some land in Eden (close to Liberty).  Ken and Larry figured to help each
other build their homes.  We talked with the man about the land and had papers
drawn up. We moved out to Clearfield to Uncle Dale and Aunt Esther’s old home
to rent until we figured we could move into our new home in Eden.  After we
were moved this man figured he had us over a barrow with us out of our home so
he backed out of the agreement - didn’t want to give us what we had asked out
of our home on the land.  He also wanted us to pay closing costs, etc.  We
couldn’t afford to do this.  Like dumb bells, we didn’t have him sign a
contract.  We talked to a lawyer and he advised us to just let it drop and sell
our home to someone else.  We tried to, but were having difficulty so decided
to rent it for awhile.  That was a big mistake as the couple who rented it just
they just had a couple of children and no pets.  Well, soon after they moved
in, other family members moved in with them and they had several pets.  They
didn’t take care of the house or yard and, in fact, wrecked the place.  It
wasn’t long until the neighbors called complaining about these people.  They
didn’t pay the rent either, so we tried to evict them, but it wasn’t that easy
as they had small children.  We took them to court, but they didn’t show up, so
the judge awarded the case to us.  Ken asked him what that meant and he said we
had the right to collect it from them.  Wow! That wasn’t helpful.  Finally, the
gas company called us to tell us that the gas bill hadn’t been paid and they
were going to shut off the gas.  The power company said the same, and we told
them both to go ahead and shut off the utilities.  It wasn’t long until those
people moved out.  But, we sure had a mess to clean up and replace carpet,
screen door, repaint, redo the lawns, etc.  We even found a partially dead cat
in a sack in the garbage. We heard it moving around and thought it might be a
rat.  When Ken took it outside and shook it out, he was mad.  They had kicked
the cat, broke it’s back and put it in the sack to die.  Wish we could have
reported them to the humane society.</p>

align=left hspace=12>When Sandi was about two years old, the church was asking
for families to take in Indian children on the &quot;Indian Placement
Program&quot;.  They announced it in our ward several times and finally Ken
&amp; I decided to take one in.  We were late calling in, but they called us
back saying they had an 8 year old girl named <b>Grace Upshaw </b>who would be
coming to live with us for the school year.  When we went to the stake center
in Provo to pick up the child, (they had come in on buses and had to go through
a screening - hygiene, vaccination shots, checked for head lice, etc.) we found
out she only came with the clothes on her back.  Since we had called late, they
were ready to board the bus in Gallup, New Mexico.  Grace was there with her
father and mother and younger brothers and sisters to see her older brothers
off.  They rushed to Grace's parents and asked if they would like Grace to go
also.  It was a surprise to them, but they were members of the church and knew
it would be an opportunity to have their children live with the
&quot;white&quot; people for one or more school years.  They go back to the
families for the summers.  They agreed, and Grace was picked up and put on the
bus.  When we met her, she was scared and very shy.  She didn't say a word to
us all the way home even though we asked her a few questions.  We understood
somewhat - so just tried to console her.  We showed her to her room in the
basement and gave her a stuffed animal to sleep with.  The next day we got on
the phone to the Bishop and he gave us an order to go to the Deseret Industries
and got Grace some clothes, a coat, etc.  We also purchased a lot of other
things for her at other stores.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grace opened up after a day or two and before
long she was enjoying our family and playing with Sandi.  She made friends at
school and was happy.  She was a cute, rolly polly little girl with long hair. 
Ken &amp; I grew to love her.  One day Grace came in the house and asked why
Pat Wiggins and her teenage daughter (our neighbors) were laying out in the sun
in their bathing suits.  I told her that they wanted to get a beautiful tan,
and pointing to her, I said “like you have.”  She responded “They want to be
Indians?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The school year slipped away quickly and before
we knew it, she was boarding the bus to go home.  We had decided not to take
her the next year because Ken had sent an application to the state of Washington to become a computer programmer there, (This was when he was working for
Commercial Security Bank) and we thought we might be moving. We wouldn't be
allowed to take Grace from the state of Utah.  We didn't get the job - so
didn't move.  Ken said I had become too attached to Grace and he felt it would
be hard on me each year to let her go back to her family.  I remember I did cry
half the night after we put her on the bus.  Ken took me out to eat, but I
didn't feel much like eating.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grace came to a good family in Syracuse the next
year and the following years until she graduated from high school.  She turned
out to be a beautiful young woman.  I talked to her former foster parents a few
months ago (Mom knew them and her and I had gone out for lunch - fall of 97 and
saw them at the restaurant) They said Grace had gone to BYU and married a nice
young man, but her life didn't stay wonderful.  She divorced and went back to
the ways of the Indian people.  I felt bad when I heard that because I knew she
had gone to BYU and felt she would live the gospel and have a good life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grace called us several times while she was
living with her foster family.  It was funny because when the phone would ring
and we would say &quot;Hello&quot;, we wouldn't hear anything.  We would keep
saying Hello and finally we would say &quot;Grace, is this you?&quot;  She
would say &quot;yes&quot; and that would begin our one-sided conversations. 
She never said much.  We would ask her questions and she would usually answer
them with one word (yes or no).  Finally, when we couldn't think of anything
else to ask her or say to her, we would say &quot;well, goodbye, Grace.  Thanks
for calling&quot; and we would hang up.  Each time she called, it was this way,
but we were glad she wanted to call us.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            Ken &amp; I wanted a large family - at least
five or six children.  I still had a hard time getting pregnant.  Mom told me
about a <b>Dr. Close</b> who was a naturopath, lived &amp; practiced in Ogden
and had helped many women be able to have children.  They said that women came
from other states and all over.  I called him and set up an appointment.  He
gave me a series of treatments and soon I was in the &quot;family way&quot;
again.  He told me that the way my back was I had only one chance in 100 to get
pregnant and keep it, but that he had corrected it.  Sandi was almost five
years old by now and Ken &amp; I had decided to put in for adoption since we
didn't want to raise Sandi as an only child and we had wanted several
children.  We had started the adoption proceedings with LDS Social Services.  I
was worried that I might have another miscarriage (guess I didn't have enough
faith in what Dr. Close had told me) and so I didn't want to tell Social
Services.  They finally called to ask why we had not turned in other paper work
they were waiting for.  We explained our situation and they said they
understood and would keep our record on file and if we were able to have the
baby, we would call them and they would take out file out, but if I had another
miscarriage, we would proceed with the adoption.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            LARINA TAVO</b> - When I was about five
months along, the church again asked for families to take in foster Indian
children.  Ken felt we should do it again, but I wasn't certain since I was
pregnant.  I wasn't sure I wanted the responsibility of another child right
then.  I talked to my mother and she felt I shouldn't take the chance of
bringing more stress into my life and maybe causing another miscarriage.  Ken
&amp; I prayed about it and Ken still felt strongly that we should do it.  I
felt ok about it - so we did.  Again, we had taken too long to decide and they
told us that it was too late, but if a child didn't work out in a family, which
sometimes happens, then they would need to place them in another home and
wondered if we would be willing to take one then.  Ken said we would.  About
two weeks before Christmas, they called us saying they had a 15 year old girl, <b>Larina
Tavo</b>, who wasn't working out with the foster family she was with and would
we take her?  I was worried that if she wasn't working out with that family,
would she work out with us?  I wasn't really excited about it, but we took
her.  Mom was worried about us taking her also, for fear it would cause stress
and cause another miscarriage.  Larina turned out to be a cute girl, although
very overweight.  I enjoyed her personality and we got along good.  We found
out, from the caseworker, that the reason she hadn’t worked out in the other
home is because the mother was going through the change of life and having a
hard time.  This made her ornery and she treated Larina like a slave and took
out her frustrations on Larina.  Larina finally called her caseworker and told
this lady that she wanted to go home.  She talked Larina into trying another
family, and we were the other family.   It was hard when she would go home each
summer because she would go back to her old ways and when she would come back
to us each fall, we had to start over again as far as hygiene, manners, etc. 
She was such a large girl that we could only buy her clothes in the
&quot;big&quot; women's sections of the stores.  These didn't look like a
teenage girl, so I would make her clothes.  She looked a lot cuter. She liked
the clothes and really acted like she appreciated me making them for her. 
Larina had a bubbly personality so most of the time I rally enjoyed her.  She
had a lot of problems so she was a challenge also.  Her grooming habits were
bad and she had an odor, which we tried to help her with. We also tried to help
her with her weight.  We took her to a doctor and he put her on a diet, but she
wouldn’t stick to it.  In fact, she ate so much that when she went home in the
summers, our food budget would cut almost in half.  She would offer to gather
up the dishes and then she would eat any food that was left on the table.  She
would also take food and hide it under her bed to eat later at night.  Larina
would confide in me and we had many good talks.  She was usually good to baby
sit Sandy for us and the other children as they came along.  She helped me with
the housework although not too willingly some times.  But, of course, most
children have this problem.  She went to church regularly with us and enjoyed
and participated in family home evening.  For the most part, I really enjoyed
Larina, and I am thankful that we had her and for that experience<b>.   She
lived with us until she graduated from Clearfield High School - so 3 ½ years.</b> 
Her best friend was Debbie Higley.  Debbie was our favorite babysitter, when we
lived I Clearfield.  Debbie would drop other plans when we called to see if she
could babysit our children.  Her loved us and our kids and we all loved her.  I
really missed Larina after she graduated and went back to Fort Hall, Idaho. 
She could have had a good opportunity to go to college or trade school as the
tribal counsel would give these school graduates an aptitude test and then pay
for their board, room and college expenses for them.  But, instead she met an
Indian guy who was ten years older than her and had been married before.  She
married him and had a baby girl.  She realized the mistake she had made as he
was always getting drunk and betting her up so she finally had him put in jail
and divorced him.  She remarried and had three more children and then had
problems with him so left him and the children for a time.  She started
drinking and ended up in the Salt Lake Rehabilitation Center.  She found that
we were living in Taylorsville so called us and we came to get her and kept her
for the weekend, but then we had to take her back.  While she was there, she
started working for them as their cook.  We called each other a few times while
she was there and brought her out another time for dinner.  We went to see her
on Christmas Eve and took her a gift.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>            After we moved to Erda, we didn’t heard from
her again until several years later.  Her mother had died and she was feeling
really bad.  She found Mom &amp; Dad’s phone number and called them to get our
phone number.  I think we were living in Grantsville at the time.  She said she
would like to come see us.  I told her we would like that too, but to let us
know when she was coming so we would be sure to be home.  I don’t know whether
I didn’t sound excited enough or what, but she didn’t come and I didn’t hear
from her again.  I tried to look her up, but didn’t have any success.  Irvin,
Ken’s younger brother, said he saw her scrounging through garbage cans with
some other drunken Indians.  She recognized him and came over to talk to him. 
He said she looked awful and reeked with alcohol.  She wanted our phone number,
but he didn’t give it to her as he was afraid she would just wanted it so she
could play on our sympathy and we would give her money, etc.  He didn’t think
that would help her.  I really feel bad that she messed up her life when she
had a chance of making something of it, but I also realize that with the
Indians, they are like crabs who are put in a bucket and if one tries to get
out, the others pull it back in.  It’s hard for the Indian people to break out
of their environment and succeed in life.  <b>In 2000, I think it was, Larina
found our phone number</b> (we had no idea where she was, so couldn’t find her)
and called us.  She had married again and this guy was good to her.  They were
coming with some of her relatives to Layton and wondered if we could meet her
and her husband in the lobby of the motel they would be staying in.  We were
excited to see her again and to meet her husband.  We met the rest of her
family and then they left, except for Larina and her husband and we had a good
visit and caught up on her life and told her about our life.  Her oldest
daughter had died and she was sad about that.  Larina has had lots of problems
throughout her life, but I just wonder what her life would have been like if
she had been able to stay true to the gospel, gone to college and met a good
man and raised a good family.  I’m sure she and her family would have been much
happier.  I haven’t heard from her since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I will tell a couple of incidents we had with
her</b>.  One was when she came back to us for her junior year.  She had found
a boyfriend over the summer and didn't want to leave him.  Her parents and the
caseworker had told her she had to - so she had come against her will.  She was
not corporative and was moody and ornery.  Finally, we called the case worker
and told him to come get her - that if she didn't want to be here, we didn't
want her here either.  He came and had a long talk with her and convinced her that
this was a wonderful opportunity for her and she might mess up her life if she
went back home.  Larina had come from the Indian reservation by Blackfoot, Idaho. 
She straightened up and we enjoyed her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We didn't overwork Larina, but we expected her to
help out, just like we would our own children.  One day she came home from
school and I asked her to do something.  She looked at me with a frown and said
&quot;What have you been doing all day today?&quot;  That really upset me, as I
have always worked hard.  I said &quot;I've been sitting in front of the TV
watching soap operas, smoking and drinking beer&quot;.  That really shocked her
(it shocked me too that those words came out of my mouth) and she knew I was
angry at her for asking such a question as that, and she never dared ask me
that again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One time when Ken &amp; I were going on a little
weekend vacation with some friends, we asked Ken's Mom if she would watch the
children.  We were living in Clearfield at this time.   Larina didn't have a
driver's license, but we had gone with our friends and left the car at home. 
Ken's Mom was taking the children to church and Larina told her that she wasn't
feeling well so didn't go with them.  Larina had a friend in Ogden (Marianne)  that
she became close to when we lived them.  After Ken's mom &amp; the children
went to church, she called her friend and told her she would drive over to see
her.  She took our car, drove to the friend's house and then they proceeded to
go for a joy ride.  She noticed the car was about out of gas so they stopped at
a gas station.  She didn't judge right and ran into the gas tank.  The owner
called the police and when they found out Larina didn't have a driver's
license, they thought she had stolen the car and took her to jail.  When we got
home Monday morning, Ken's mother told us the story and Ken went to get her out
of jail.  She had spent the night there with a lady who had epileptic fits and
another lady who murdered her husband.  When Ken got Larina, she was white as a
ghost.  She was so scared.  Ken had to go to court with her and he told the
judge that she was our foster daughter and it was our car and he was not
pressing charges - so they let her off.  It scared her bad enough that she
never tried taking the car again, and she never even asked to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was pregnant with Shellie, I not only
would throw up, but I would pass out and throw up at the same time.  It really
scared Ken, but the doctor explained that with some pregnancies, some women did
that.  I hadn't with Sandi.  The first time it happened, after Larina came to
live with us, she was really scared and started to call the ambulance when I
came out of it and told her I was all right.  I would feel like I had to throw
up so would run to the bathroom, then I would feel like I was going to pass out
- and that's right, I did both of them.  It was awful, but it didn't happen
with any other pregnancy, thank goodness.  (I have covered everything about
Larina here in this part of my history.  Now I’ll go back in time again.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Soon after Shellie was born, Dr. Close had a
heart attack and died</b>.  He overworked himself - he couldn't turn people
away and since his office was in his home, people came at all hours of the day
and night.  I was worried that since he had died, maybe I wouldn't be able to
have more children other than Sandi and Shellie.  But, whatever Dr. Close
fixed, he fixed good and I never had problems getting pregnant after that.  I
did have more miscarriages, but we were able to have six wonderful children,
plus our little &quot;Amy&quot; who died due to water on the brain when I was
seven months along.  I will tell about this later on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 14 – DAUGHTER,
SHELLIE ANN BROWNING</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Shellie Ann</b> was born on June 21, 1967.  She was a
beautiful, delightful, contented baby.  She never cried unless she was hungry
or couldn't see me or Ken.  As long as we stayed in the same room with her,
where she could see one or the other of us, she was happy.  If we left the
room, she would cry. I can still see her in my mind, sitting in her little
carrier or swing playing with her toys.  Sandi had been an only child for over
five years so we were concerned she might be jealous of the baby so we bought
her a cute little doll.  She loved the doll, but wasn't jealous.  She loved
Shellie and was a cute, helpful big sister.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 15 – MY CHIROPRACTORS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I have scoliosis and so have had a bad back
all my life</b>.  I've gone to <b>chiropractors</b> since before Ken &amp; I
were married.  I've gone to lots of different chiropractors.  I'll tell about a
couple of them.  One was an older gentleman who lived in Ogden, <b>Dr. Moffitt</b>. 
Dad had been going to him and suggested we go to him.  We were living in Ogden,
I think, at the time.  Dr. Moffitt had his office in his home.  He used
electricity probes as part of the treatment.  He would put the probes on your
legs and your feet and toes would curl right up.  When he put them on your
arms, your hands and fingers curled up.  I remember I didn't like that very
well - so we only went to him for a few treatments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Also, while living in Ogden, I started going to <b>Dr.
Wimmer,</b> who was our Stake President.  I was in the stake YWMIA presidency
at the time.  I thought Dr. Wimmer was a wonderful man and wonderful stake
president.  I loved his wife also.  He took x-rays and had me coming in every
other day for several weeks, then twice a week, then once a week, etc.  The
patients undressed in little dressing rooms and put on a paper gown (like you
do when you go to the doctor's office for an exam).  The first few treatments
were fine, but after awhile he started getting a little too familiar.  He would
hug me when I came into the room.  At first I didn't think too much of it
because I had him on a pedestal of being a great stake president.  I felt he
was just giving me a fatherly hug.  Well he used a vibrator and his hands in
massaging you before he gave the treatment - to help you relax.  I started
getting tense as he massaged me, and didn't feel this was right.  I remember
one time feeling him staring at me, so I glanced up at him.  I quickly tried to
make some conversation and so I said &quot;Isn't it a beautiful day
today&quot;, he said &quot;you sure are beautiful&quot;.  I didn't like that
comment at all.  I went home and told Ken I didn't want to go to Dr. Wimmer
again and tried to explain how uncomfortable I was in his presence.  He could
hardly believe that anything wrong could be going on, but said he would come
with me that next time and go into the treatment room with me.  He did come,
but Dr. Wimmer wouldn't let him come into the room with us.  He had him sit in
the waiting room.  When we went home I told Ken I wasn't ever coming back again
- and I didn't.  As I would go to my stake meetings and PPI's with the stake
presidency, Pres. Wimmer would stop me and ask me how I was feeling and why I
wasn't coming in for treatments.  I told a lie and told him I was doing much
better and didn't feel I needed further treatments.  He tried to convince me
that I did, but I just brushed it off.  I found another chiropractor to go to. 
Some time later, after we had moved from Ogden, we heard that Pres. Wimmer was
excommunicated from the Church for having an affair.  I guess when the church
came out with specific questions before getting temple recommends, a woman
confessed that she had had an affair with Pres. Wimmer.  That she had been a
patient of his and one thing had led to another.  I guess it broke his wife's
heart, but she stayed with him.  He did repent and finally was given his
priesthood blessings back.  His father was the patriarch of our stake when we
lived there, and it hurt and humiliated him so much, that people said he never
left his home again, he died a short time later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Another chiropractor I went to was in Roy. Vern</b>
<b>Kilbourn.</b>  He was good and didn't have you come in for set
appointments.  He told us just to call when we felt we needed a treatment.  One
day we called and they said he was in the hospital.  He had been hang gliding
and he went into the mountain and was paralyzed from the neck down.  That ended
his practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Dr. Opie</b> was one we went to in Arizona
when we first moved down there.  We took the entire family to him.  The
children didn't like him as he was pretty rough.  To tell the truth I didn't
either.  He was a counselor in our ward bishopric. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             From there we found out about  <b><u>DR.  SWANSTROM
in Scottsdale</u></b> and started going to this wonderful little man.  He
wasn't exactly a chiropractor, he was a homoeopathic doctor.  He had studied to
be a medical doctor, but then felt that treatments and nutrition, vitamins,
etc., were very necessary so became a homoeopathic doctor.  In fact, he started
his own college in Chicago.  He was the best we have ever gone to and I grew to
love this little elderly white haired man.  He loved the Lord and wanted to
help people.  He helped us more than any other we have ever gone to and I will
forever be grateful to him and the Lord for how David's life was spared more
than once, and how he help Ken and I and all our family.  When I would thank
him, he would say “Girlie, don’t thank me, thank the Lord”.  Ken was doing
construction work and a fellow above him slipped and dropped the board he was
holding and it fell on Ken’s back and he was in terrible pain.  He went to Dr.
Opie for several treatments, but they didn’t help.  I suggested he go to Dr.
Swanstrom, which he did.  Ken told me that Dr. Swanstrom had him lie face down
on his massage table and he went down Ken’s back with his fingers and all of a
sudden Ken’s body just jerked and the pain was gone.  He asked Dr. Swanstrom
what he did and he said “I just released the vertebra.”  Ken was amazed and he
felt great after that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have only mentioned a few of the chiropractors
I have gone to, and the one I go to now (<b>1998) is Dr. Dr. Dale Bennett.</b> 
He isn't a Dr. Swanstrom, but he is helping me more than any other chiropractor
other than Dr. Swanstrom.  I am thankful the Lord has blessed me to find the
help I need.  Dr. Bennett said awhile back that if he were to take my x-rays to
the Palmer College of chiropractic, they would be amazed that I can live a
normal life with my back the way it is.  He said he has shown my x-rays to the
other doctors he works with and they are amazed also.  I have had a lot of
problems especially with my neck and lower back.  I get terrible headaches and
my eyes burn when my neck goes out, but when I get a treatment from him, I feel
much better.  Also my sackarillack (I used to think that was just a funny term)
gives me a lot of problems.  I come by it rightfully thought as both Dad &amp;
Mom have had terrible backs.  Mom has scollisos too, but also osteoporosis.  I
don't have that and hopefully I never will.  Dr. Dale Bennett says that since I
have always gone to chiropractors and I exercise (walk) and I have taken
estrace (hormones) since I had my hysterectomy, that I should be fine.  Dr.
Johnson had me have a test taken which would determine if I did have osteoporosis
and it showed I didn't, thank goodness.  How I met Dr. Bennett was after we
moved back to Utah the last time from Arizona and moved in with Ken’s mother, I
developed <b>Tendonitis</b> in my right arm.  I think part of it was from
nerves from the problems we had had in Arizona with Larry &amp; Tammy, with the
IRS taking our money from the bank which caused me the stress of me having to
go to work for NFIB and working long hours and traveling lots of miles, and
having to have the children do most of the housework, Meals, laundry, etc. as
when I came home I would have to work on my records and cards for the next
day.  Also, the stress of Ken being so depressed and the stress for having to
sell our beautiful home, the stress of having to make the decision to move in
with Ken’s mother when I had never wanted to do that, but Ken asked if I would
pray about it.  I finally did and I felt good about it so felt the Lord wanted
us to do that.  Also, the work of packing and then unpacking at Ken’s mother’s
home, etc.  Anyway, it kept getting worse and worse until I couldn’t sleep at
night because I would try to get my arm in a comfortable position and I would
just get to sleep when the pain would get so bad it would wake me up again. 
Also, whenever I would move it very much, I would have a terrible pain come
that felt like a knife stabbing me.  Soon the tendonitis came into my left arm
also and then I was really a basket case.  I couldn’t lift my arms to comb or
wash my hair, put on makeup, etc.  Ken or his mother had to do it for me.  I
was grateful for Ken’s mother at that time as she had to make the meals and
clean the house mainly by herself, as I couldn’t help her.  Ken and the
children helped too.  The pain grew worse and worse and I didn’t know what I
would do.  I wondered if I would have to live like this for the rest of my
life, and if so, I hoped I wouldn’t live very long.  My parents tried to help
me in every way they knew.  They took me to Crystal Springs close to Brigham
City where they felt the mineral water would help me.  I enjoyed those times
with them, but the mineral water didn’t seem to help much.  Mom was going to a
little German lady, Phollie or Follie.  I don’t remember her last name.  She
helped Mom so Mom had hoped she could help me.  Follie caused me a lot of pain
as she tried to pull my arms different ways and massage them.  I didn’t feel I
could go through the pain to go to her again. One day someone (don’t remember
who) told me about a chiropractor, Dr. Bennett, who had helped them and a lot
of others so maybe I should try him.  I did and after 3 treatments, the
tendonitis was gone.  Wow! What a blessing that was.  Now I could resume my
functions as a wife, mother, daughter-in-law, church member, etc., and I was
very happy to be able to do that.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>NANCY LITCHFIELD</b> – is a nutritionist, and
we were certainly grateful for her help.  We were living with Ken’s mom in
Layton.  Ken had been to several doctors about the terrible pain he was in, but
each doctor took tests and could find nothing wrong.  One finally said it was a
form of arthritis and he would keep Ken on Penicillin the rest of his life,
plus pain medicine and eventually Cortisone and eventually he would die in a
wheelchair.  Ken came home from that office visit to find my dad in the
driveway.  Dad told him he was taking him to their nutritionist, Nancy
Litchfield in Ogden.  Ken hadn’t wanted to go to her, but he went.  When he
came home, I asked him what she said and he said she talked so fast that he
didn’t know what she said, but that it had something to do with the yeast in
his body and she had him buy several nutritional supplements from her and she
put him on a really strict diet.  He could mainly only eat vegetables and a
little fish and chicken and could only drink water.  She wanted him to go to
our doctor and get a prescription of Nistatin, which he did. Nistatin killed
the yeast.  The next day after following Nancy’s instructions, the pain was
half gone, the following day, it was almost all gone and we were all so
grateful and relieved<b>.  I know the Lord sent dad over just at that day and
time, to take Ken to Nancy.  </b>We have gone to Nancy several times and she
continued to help both of us, but especially Ken.  Ken has pretty much had to stay
on that diet every since.  We were down visiting Shellie &amp; Roy soon after
the birth of little Garrett.  He was in so much pain at that time that Shellie
didn’t think Garrett would get a chance to get to know his Grandpa.  Garrett
was born the 19<sup>th</sup> of August 1989 so Ken has had this problem ever
since, but thankfully to the Lord and Nancy, he is able to manage it and now at
age 78, he can out work most younger men.  I am amazed at all he can do, and
does do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Randy</b>, my cousin on the Porter side
(Uncle Dale’s oldest son) became blind from a inherited eye disease, but he had
a seeing eye dog and took the bus to Salt Lake where he was trained as a
massage therapist and learned “Trigger”, which is deep massage and really can
help people.  He became licensed and had a building built at the end of their
property and was able to give treatments to people.  I was one who gained from
that.  He helped me a lot.  His joints got bad from such hard work, that he had
operations to replace some of his joints – thumbs, etc.  After some of the last
treatments I got from him, he showed me a “Flex Tube”, Ken and I call it the
“log”, but you roll on it and it really helps when your back, neck, etc., are
hurting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>JENNY PORTER</b> - Jenny Porter (Robin’s
wife).  is a homeopathic practitioner and is licensed.  She keeps researching
and knows her stuff.  We have gone to her for several years.  She does a “scan”
on us and then tells us what health problems we have and what we need to take
to keep healthy.  We have been grateful for her and the help she has given us. 
One of the last times I went (Feb. 2017) she said “You must be really tired and
don’t have much energy”. I told her “Yes” and she said my Thyroid was
functioning as it should.  She said you probably are not sleeping very well
either and I agreed that I wasn’t and she gave me homeopathic drops to take and
some other nutritional pills and they really helped me.  I am sleeping much
better and have more energy now.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>DEANNA</b> <b>DAVIS</b> was another person sent to me
by the Lord.  She met Jenny and gave her massages.  They helped Jennie so much
that she talked Deanna into joining her team of “Wellness” people.  Jenny was
working out of her home in Mountain Green, but her husband, Robin, talked her
into taking her office to his manufacturing plant, where he had lots of room
for her.  She has several offices and several certified people who help with
different aspects of our health. It is a “Wellness Clinic”.  This was about in
2012.  Jenny had a nutritional class that I attended and she introduced Deanna
and you could get a free massage.  I did that and Wow, she was great.  I have
scoliosis really bad, I have had it all my life, but thanks to my parents
taking me to chiropractors when I was young and I continued to find good ones
after I married.  My back and neck do hurt me a lot as my scoliosis is in a S
curve and when my neck goes out, so does my lower back and vice versa.  Dr.
Bennett helped me so much with my tendinitis, so I kept going to him until I
met Deanna and she helped me so much that I hardly every have to go to Dr.
Bennett.  I went to Deanna twice a week at her home where she had better
equipment to help me and then it graduated to once a week and then once or
twice a month.  I loved going to her, even though it hurt many times, because
she was such a spiritual and positive person.  I loved talking to her and could
feel that she had the spirit of the Lord with her.  Deanna told me that if I
had waited 10 more years, that she wouldn’t be able to help me as my spine was
going to the right and she said I would have been in so much pain.  I saw a man
whose spine went that way when I was at Camperworld with Georgia.  He was a
friend of hers, and wow he was in bad shape.  Deanna taught me some exercises
to do each morning and said if I would do them, I could keep my back from
hurting so much and my spine from going to the right.  I do them consistently
and they have certainly helped me.  Not long after, Deanna found she had cancer
and passed away.  We were all so sad, but thankfully she helped me and many
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Now I will go back in time to
where I was again.  Myrene Dransfield (Mike) was moving from the stake</b>. 
She told me she thought I would be asked to be the next Stake Young Women's
President.  I told her I hoped not because Ken was feeling that he and Sandi
had been neglected and he wanted me to be released.  I also told her that I
didn't want that responsibility<b>.  She said &quot;Mae, you try to please
everyone and you can't do that.  You can only please half the people half the
time, so you might as well please yourself and you will please half the
people&quot;</b>.  That was the way with Mike.  I loved her, I thought she was
great, but there were others who didn't like her. She was a great leader and I
am thankful I had the opportunity of serving with her.  She was not only was a
lot of fun, but she loved the Lord and loved the girls and sacrificed a lot for
them.  I got close to her children also - who were not much younger than I
was.  Mike &amp; her husband, Ed, had a boat and water skis and they invited
Marian and her husband, and Ken and I to go water skiing with their family
sometimes.  That was great fun. I met Darla (Mike’s oldest daughter) while
working at David School District.  Darla was a social worker for the schools
and had come in to see about classes to get her lane change.  I recognized her
almost immediately, and she did me.  We hugged and updated each other on our
families.  Of course, Darla had married and had a family.  She told me that
Mike, her mother, had passed away unexpectedly and that her dad had soon
remarried.  She said his new wife didn’t want much to do with his family and
was all about her family.  Darla’s dad had gone along with what his new wife
wanted, and Darla said that they hardly ever saw her dad since then, that he
hadn’t been a grandfather to his own grandkids.  That was sad to hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The lst counselor, LaRae Brown, was asked to be
the Young Women's President and she asked for me to stay in with her.  Ken
asked me to please be released with Mike - so I did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike and I were released at stake conference
which was held at the Ogden Tabernacle.  Ken &amp; I came in and saw Marian
sitting at the back of the tabernacle.  We went over and sat by her and her
husband.  She said &quot;Mae, I wouldn't sit way back here if I were you, it's
too far to walk to the front when they ask you to speak&quot;.  I said
&quot;they won't ask me to speak - maybe Mike, but not me.  She said
&quot;don't say I didn't warn you&quot;.  Well, they did call on both Mike and
I to speak after they released us.  It seemed like that was the longest walk I
ever took.  I should have listened to Marian.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Marian was sustained as the activity counselor. 
I was happy about that as I had grown to love her and she was really talented
and efficient and a great leader.  She was a school teacher too.  Not long afterwards<b>
I got a call to meet with the stake presidency and they called me to be the</b>
<b>stake camp director.  Marian had asked for me.</b>  Now, we could still work
together on camp and be there together, only the positions had changed.  I now
was under her where before she was under me, but that didn't matter.  We worked
great together with the help of the Lord.  Shellie was born about this time -
so one year I didn't go to camp, but I helped with it. </p>

align=left hspace=12>            I was also the ward MIA secretary for a short
while, and then I was asked to teach the Mia Maids again.  I really enjoyed
this calling, especially the class <b>Deanna Green</b> was in.  Deanna is now
my sister-in-law.  She married Bryce.  I loved Deanna and her friends in that
class.  We had slumber parties at our home, and I really grew to love these
girls.  I remember for Christmas, they brought me over a present.  The class
had chipped in and bought it together and all of them came over to bring it to
me.  Deanna really kept me on my toes as she was always asking me questions
during the lessons.  I really had to be prepared.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Bryce came back from the service, he asked
me to line him up with the cutest, best girl I knew.  I lined him up with Deanna. 
She had graduated by then and was in college or working, I can’t remember which,
or probably both.  They went together and ended up getting married.  I was
excited and have surely enjoyed her as a special sister-in-law.  Deanna's Mom
was a special friend of mine too.  She was a special friend to everyone.  She
was so cute and fun to be around and she was sure talented on the piano and
organ.  She got cancer and the doctor only gave her 3 months to live.  She had
heard of Dr. Sundance, an old Indian Chief, who worked with herbs and had helped
cure people of Cancer.  She found him and went on the herbs.  She was very sick,
and it was really hard on her, but she wanted to live to raise her family.  She
did live and is still alive today (1998) She would pass the cancers and when
she did, she would pickle them in baby jars.  I remember going to her home one
day and she asked if I had seen her cancer specimens.  I told her
&quot;no&quot; and she proceeded to get them out of the cupboard to show me. 
They were so gross - they looked like terrible giant spiders - only worse than
that.  They had big feelers, etc.  All of a sudden, I felt like I would pass
out.  Marge noticed that and had me lie down on the floor.  She made me some
peppermint tea and I soon revived, but I never wanted to see her specimens
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken was called to be the Elder's Quorum
President,</b> but his two counselors didn't work out.  With Ken's work
schedule at Commercial Security Bank, he wasn't able to oversee everything, and
his counselors didn't do anything without him.  Finally, one moved, and the
other said maybe he should be released also.  Ken took him up on it and called
Larry Braithwaite &amp; Bob Hein to be his new counselors.  The Elder's Quorum
went straight uphill after that.  Ken, Larry &amp; Bob worked great together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our good friends (the ones I grew up with) were
married and two of their husbands went to college after they got married.   Joan
&amp; Ralph were going to college at BYU.   They had two children.  Margie
&amp; Gary had decided that Gary needed to go to college.  They already had
three children.  It was tough for them, but they did it anyway.  <b>We thought
we needed to do that also so we put our house up for sale, so Ken could go to
college. </b> We had several people look at our house, and acted like they
wanted to buy it, but nothing came of it.  <b>Ken was called into the stake
president's office and asked to be first counselor to Bishop Delmar Moulton in
the Mt Fort Ward.  We decided the Lord wanted Ken to serve in the Bishopric, so
we took the &quot;For Sale&quot; sign off the lawn</b>.  Both Ralph and Gary
became engineers.  Pat's husband didn't go to college, but he became a
machinist and was very good at it.  Dennis became a computer operator - like
Ken, but for a company in Salt Lake, then a computer programmer.</p>

operator, programmer and now he was a supervisor, but the shift work was
getting to him, plus always being on call.  He would be called in the middle of
the night and if he couldn't solve the problem over the phone, he would have to
get dressed and go into work.  They had conversions where he would have to work
straight through until the conversion was done.  One time it lasted for 36
hours.  By this time, Ken's head was pulled over to his shoulder and he had to
get several chiropractic treatments to get it straightened out.  It was
stressful and he felt he would like to get out of the office and work with his
hands in the fresh air.  He talked to his Uncle Irven who was a building
contractor all his life.  He counseled Ken not to do it as building is so up
and down and also so hard.  He didn't heed Uncle Irven's advice..</p>

align=left hspace=12>            The bank tried to discourage him from quitting
in every way they could.  They told him he would lose his shirt if he did
because interest rates were going up and also prices on materials.  We thought
they were just saying this as they hated to lose a good man.  This they did,
but they also felt he would be making a big mistake.  The main reason I hated
to see Ken go into this field was because he had had two previous sun strokes. 
One when he was a boy fishing and the other while in basic training for the Air
Force in Lackland, Texas.  The doctors have told him that if he had another  he
couldn’t possible live through it.  That it was practically a miracle that he had
lived through the second one and especially without having any brain damage. 
For this reason I felt Ken might have another if he was out in the sun all day
every day.  Ken felt with being able to cool down at night he would be okay and
if he felt he was getting too much sun he would try to work indoors and he’d
take salt pills.  The first year he enjoyed working with Larry and loved this
work and it seemed to be going well<b>.  They enjoyed working together and when
Ken didn’t get paid for one job, the guy asked him if he would take a couple of
horses for the work.  Larry &amp; Ken had broke some horses and Larry had
horses, so this was fun</b>. We had lots of good times with the horses<u>.  One
trip was a pack-in-trip with Larry &amp; Tammy, Bob &amp; Pauline, John &amp;
Linda &amp; Ken &amp; I.  We were living in Clearfield at the time.  It was so
beautiful there and we all had a great time.  We almost had a terrible accident
coming down the mountain.  Ken was driving the big truck with the horses in
it.  Bob &amp; Pauline were riding with us.  The horse started to slip and it
threw the truck off the small windy road, and I am sure it was the hand of the
Lord who stopped the truck as the truck front tires were resting on a small
tree and only the back tires were on the road.  Ken told Bob, Pauline &amp; I
to carefully get out of the truck.  He stayed in with his foot on the brake. 
We climbed out and Larry had a chain, so he pulled the truck back on the road
with his truck.  I’m sure the Lord made that possible also, as the one Ken was
driving was much bigger and it was a wonder that the horses didn’t keep sliping
and sliding and the four of us could have easily met our death that day. 
Pauline was so scared that she wouldn’t get back in the truck.  She said she
would walk.  We finally convinced her that she couldn’t walk that far, so she
got in</u>.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The second year, with Larry &amp; Ken’s business,
didn’t work so well..  With Ken and Larry working together all day and doing
Bishopric work just about every night, they were with each other more than they
were with us, their wives.  They began to get on each others nerves, and
problems began to arise.  Also interest and lumber prices did go up.  They
would bid on jobs and before they were through with it, with the rising costs,
they would lose money.  Also Larry didn’t bid them high enough because he was
too good hearted and wanted to help the people out as much as he could.  This
didn’t work out either because most of the people he did this for would turn
around and cut his throat - so to speak.  It got worse and worse until finally
after two years they had to drop the business and go to work for another
contractor, Perk Peterson.  They lost about $12,000.  They divided this
amount.  We owed $3,000 to Moyes Glass and Paint Company and $3,000 to
Wheelright Lumber Company. One of the main problems was they had an accountant
who was supposed to keep them advised on how their finances were going, but he
didn’t until he told them they were $12,000 in debt.  They should have checked
more with him, so it was partly their fault too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jennie’s Lake in Wyoming</b> – When the children were
young, in fact we only had Sandi and maybe Shellie at that time, and Larry

Wyoming to camp and fish.  It was a great place to go and we loved being with
our good friends. We went there several times.  One time we invited the
families from our “Ward’sYoung Married Group” and that was fun too.  Sometimes
we would get a babysitter for our daughters and the four of us would climb in

fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first summer, when Ken &amp; Larry were working
together, the four of us took our girls, Sandi &amp; Lori, who were the same
age and became good friends, <b>and went to Yellowstone Park together</b>. 
Larry &amp; Tammy had bought a camp trailer.  We had a great time together. 
Tammy &amp; I have always been close, even when our husbands were having
problems, we didn't.  We always felt we were as close as sisters.  The good
part was that we didn't fight as some sisters do.  We even dressed alike
sometimes and people thought we were sisters.  Many times while our husbands
were working, her and I would get together and make crafts, work on scrapbooks
or picture albums, make Christmas candy together, etc., etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Ken didn’t like working for Perk Petersen
because he couldn’t trust him.  He would say one thing and do another.  We had
a hard time getting our pay check and when we did, it usually bounced.  Perk
didn’t keep track of his money, and would write out checks and didn’t know
there wasn’t money to clear them.  This happened time after time until Ken
finally quit and went to work for Modular Construction Company at Free Port
there in Clearfield. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At this time Larry and Tammy had purchased some
land in Liberty (up above the dam at Ogden Canyon) to build their home on and
have some animals.  We figured we would trade our equity on our home in Ogden
for some land in Eden (close to Liberty).  Ken and Larry figured to help each
other build their homes.  We talked with the man about the land and had papers
drawn up. We moved out to Clearfield to Uncle Dale and Aunt Esther’s old home
to rent until we figured we could move into our new home in Eden.  After we
were moved this man figured he had us over a barrow with us out of our home so
he backed out of the agreement - didn’t want to give us what we had asked out
of our home on the land.  He also wanted us to pay closing costs, etc.  We
couldn’t afford to do this.  Like dumb bells, we hadn’t had him  sign a
contract.  We talked to a lawyer and he advised us to just let it drop and sell
our home to someone else.  We tried to, but were having difficulty so decided
to rent it for awhile.  That was a big mistake as the couple who rented it just
they just had a couple of children and no pets.  Well, soon after they moved
in, other family members moved in with them and they had several pets.  They
didn’t take care of the house or yard and, in fact, wrecked the place.  It
wasn’t long until the neighbors called complaining about these people.  They
didn’t pay the rent either, so we tried to evict them, but it wasn’t that easy
as they had small children.  We took them to court, but they didn’t show up, so
the judge awarded the case to us.  Ken asked him what that meant and he said we
had the right to collect it from them.  Wow! That wasn’t helpful.  Finally, the
gas company called us to tell us that the gas bill hadn’t been paid and they
were going to shut off the gas.  The power company said the same, and we told
them both to go ahead and shut off the utilities.  It wasn’t long until those
people moved out.  But, we sure had a mess to clean up and replace carpet,
screen door, repaint, redo the lawns, etc.  We even found a partially dead cat
in a sack in the garbage. We heard it moving around and thought it might be a
rat.  When Ken took it outside and shook it out, he was mad.  They had kicked
the cat, broke it’s back and put it in the sack to die.  Wish we could have
reported them to the humane society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>GIVING BLOOD – BIG MISTAKE:  While
living in Ogden, we had a family down the street from us, the Beus family, who
had a son with leukemia.  He needed blood transfusions and so our bishop had
asked the ward members to donate blood for this boy.  I had never given blood
before, but wanted to do this to help him.  I had another neighbor who also
wanted to give blood, so I picked her up and we drove up to the Dee Hospital,
where we were told to go.  After testing me, they said I was on the verge of
not being able to give blood, but they would still take it if I wanted to go
ahead with it.  I told them I did.  After they were through, they had me rest a
little and then had me sit up and gave me some orange juice.  After drinking
it, they asked me how I felt and I said I felt fine.  They were going to let me
go, but just then I fainted and I started into convulsions and they quickly
grabbed a wood stick to stop me from swallowing my tongue.  After I woke up,
they had me rest for several more minutes.  Then they asked if I had someone
who could drive me home.  My neighbor, who had come with me, wasn’t able to
give blood as she was anemic and she didn’t drive.  She had never learned to
drive, so I told them “no”, but I was sure I would be fine now.  We walked out
to the car and I started driving us home, but I only made it a few blocks when
I felt like I was going to pass out again, so I quickly swerved off to the side
of the road, stopped the car and threw it in park and I did pass out.  This
happened several times and my neighbor was very frightened, so was I, but I
finally got us home.  She got out and I drove into my driveway and passed out
again.  I could hardly walk and almost fainted getting to the door.  I finally
got the door open, crawled in and pulled myself up on the couch and stayed
there until Ken got home from work.  I had lots of problems for quite a while
and finally Ken took me to the doctor.  He tested my blood and told me that I
barely had enough for myself and not to ever give blood again.  I haven’t.  He
told me it would take months before I had my full strength back again and to
take it easy.  I did.  The  Beaus boy did pass away.  Everyone was sad.</b></p>

align=left hspace=12>We had moved into Uncle Dale and Aunt Esther's home in
Clearfield.  They had built a new home in West Point and had moved there and
were just going to rent this home in Clearfield.  They rented it to us.  It was
a beautiful home with beautiful landscaping.  It had about 3 large blue spruce
trees, a rose garden, beautiful shrubs all around the home, ivy that covered
the brick by the end of the summers.  It had a circular driveway.  In the front
room there was a gas log fireplace which we enjoyed.  It had a large kitchen, a
family room and bedroom were downstairs.  It had a large front porch and land
in back to have animals.  We did have rabbits (for Sandi to care for and learn
responsibility)and horses.  Larry &amp; Ken had gotten horses instead of pay
for a job they had done.  The man couldn't afford to pay them, but would give
them his horses.  We had Bonnie, an older stubborn horse and Kendee, a young Appalachia.  Kendee was great and we all loved her, but Bonnie was slow, so she was good to
put the younger children on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We moved to this house in February of 1969.   We
rented the home in Ogden for about three months.  The people didn’t pay us the
rent on time.  They were wrecking our home so we finally were able to sell it
and get the people out this way.  We lost $90.00 and had to paint the entire
house, put in new screen doors, windows, etc.  The people who bought our home
didn’t have cash for the equity so we agreed to let them have it and pay our
equity to us on escrow.  We later had to give our escrow to Moyes Glass and
Paint Company for the bill we owed on Larry &amp; Ken’s Contracting business –
B &amp; B Contractors.  We had gotten so far behind on our bills with the
business not working out.  We lived off of our two years supply as long as we
could and finally had to go on church welfare to try and get caught up.  This
was very embarrassing for me, but humbling, as I wanted to be independent and
hated to ask for help.  Also, Uncle Dale helped us by letting us get behind on
the rent and catching up later when we were able.  Dad and Mom also gave us
money and bought food and clothes occasionally.  They were wonderful to us. </p>

BROWNING</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mike</b> was born April 28th. My good friends in Ogden
had me come back to Ogden and they gave me a baby shower.  That was special of
them. We loved our precious little girls, but were excited to have a boy.  Mike
had red hair.  We had wanted to name him David, but when Ken's mom heard that,
she said &quot;why would you name a poor little child David?&quot;  She
obviously didn't like the name of David.  My mom came to the hospital when Mike
was born and asked what we were going to name him.  I told her we didn't know -
that we had planned to name him David, but Ken's mom didn't like that name.  My
mom said &quot;he looks like a Michael to me.  Why don't you name him Michael
Ken?&quot;  I liked that name and so did Ken - so that's how Mike got his name. 
Mike had colic, but nothing like Sandi's.  He had problems with his feet and
the doctor suggested we put him in corrective shoes.  Then he added, &quot;or
you could buy cowboy boots for him to wear and that would do the same
thing.&quot;  We decided on the boots.  We also bought him western clothes,
play guns &amp; holster and cowboy hat.  He looked so cute as a little
redheaded cowboy.  Mike was a &quot;mama's boy&quot; and was really demanding -
so I really had my hands full with my three children.  Sandi was 8, Shellie was
3 and Mike one year old when Ken was put in the bishopric in the Clearfield 1st ward.  He was first counselor to Bishop Kent Murdock.  It was hard for me to
wrestle all three, although Sandi was good, and with her being older, she was
able to help me with the younger two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>South Fork above Huntsville</b>
–When we were living in Ogden and Clearfield, we used to take the children
camping or for a picnic up South Fork Canyon to the campgrounds there.  It was
a pretty area and fairly close when we lived in Ogden.  One or more times, we
continued on that road up to Monte Cristo and camped there.  I didn’t like it
as well as there were large horse flies there and they bit hard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My first position in the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup>
ward was <b>Trekker teacher in Primary.</b>  It was in the middle of the year
when they had called the Trekker teacher to be the chorister in YWMIA.  She
loved these boys and so hated to leave them and couldn't understand why someone
else couldn't have been the chorister, but she being a faithful member of the
church, accepted this position.  Her trekker boys loved her too and were very
upset that she wasn't going to be their teacher any longer.  So - this was a hard
position for me to step into.  I remember my first day at primary very well. 
Before opening exercises started, I tried to be friendly to the boys, but they
wouldn't warm up at all.  In fact the one boy scooted away from me and gave me
a dirty look.  In class, it was a nightmare.  They were yelling, climbing under
and over the chairs and benches.  (Our room was the scout room)  They wouldn't
listen to me give the lesson and were &quot;out of control&quot;.  When I got
home, I fell into the big chair and wondered what I had gotten into by
accepting this call.  I have had many challenges in my experience of teaching
positions and this was surely another one of them.  I'm not a quitter - so I
began thinking of different ways to present the lessons, of ways to show the
boys that I cared about them, I made them a birthday cake for their birthday,
etc.  A couple of hard months later, I gave a lesson on knot tying.  I was good
at this because I had been over girl’s camp so much and the certification
program.  When the boys saw that I could tie knots, they were impressed and
that was the turning point.  It got better and better and by the end of the
year, the boys loved me and I surely loved them.  One of the boys was named
Lane Adams.  He was the hardest to warm up to, but in the end was one of my
favorites.  He would come over to our home and help me weed my rose garden,
etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Randy Higley was a challenge because he had been
brain washed by his mother and others that he had a learning disability and
couldn't learn and do like other children his age.  The boys had to pass off
certain requirements to earn badges.  His mother told me, right in front of Randy
that he wouldn't be able to do all these things and that school teachers and
other church teachers had made allowances because of his learning disability. 
I didn't buy that.  Randy could do more than his mother acknowledged.  The
elementary school was just across the road from our home and so I had Randy
come over after school and I would go over and over with him the articles of
faith, tying knots and the other things he needed to learn.  Sometimes he would
get frustrated and blurt out &quot;I can't do it&quot;.  I would say &quot;yes,
you can Randy and I will help you&quot;.  He did learn them and pass them off
much to the surprise of his mother.  She was proud of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            About this time I was called to be the <b>Primary
President.</b>  Since we had just moved into the ward a few months ago and I
had been in Primary and hadn't gotten to know very many sisters, I didn't know
who to call for my counselors.  Kent Murdock was the counselor over the primary
at that time and he told me to fast and pray about it and go over the ward list
and I would be able to choose the ones the Lord would have serve with me.  I
was in the PTA of the elementary school as Sandi was in the 2nd or 3rd grade. 
I finally choose two of the sisters I worked with in the PTA from our ward.  <b>I
called Bro. Murdock and gave him the names. He said &quot;I feel good about the
one, but I think we better fast &amp; pray a little longer about another
name.&quot;  I felt very good that he had been fasting and praying also to help
me choose the right ones.  Finally I felt good about another sister and called
him.  He said &quot;yes, that’s the one I feel should be your other
counselor&quot;.  They were excellent counselors and we grew to love each other
as we worked together as a presidency.  I was thankful for Bro. Murdock and for
the Lord giving me these sisters to be my counselors.  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I decided to have the secretary stay in from the
last presidency since she had not been in very long and was doing a good job. 
Ione Adams (Lane Adams's mom) was my first counselor and Carolyn Cue was my
other counselor.  That was in 1969.  It is now 1998 and Carolyn and I have kept
in touch throughout these years.  We used to get together for lunch once in a
while, but now we just keep in touch at Christmas through notes and letters and
Christmas cards.  They are great women.  I have special memories of working
together on the Primary Sacrament meeting program, Mom &amp; Miss party, Ward dinners
that we were in charge of, pennies by the inch, etc., etc.  I can't remember
how long we served together (probably only about a year as we only lived in Clearfield two years).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>While I was Primary President, one Saturday I
was at the church for a &quot;Miss and her Mom&quot; party when we heard fire
Syrians.  Someone ran into the church where I was and told me it looked like
smoke was coming from our home.  I ran outside and looked, and sure enough it
looked like it was coming from there.  One of the ladies offered to take me
home, so I jumped into her car.  We had a hard time getting there because the
traffic was so bad and they had the road blocked off.  I jumped out of the car
and took off running.  I was very relieved when I saw Sandi and the younger children
standing on the other side of the street with our neighbors.  It wasn't our
home that was on fire, but the old canning factory which was just south of our
home.  They were spraying down our home though as the flames were so hot that
they were afraid our home would catch on fire also.  Sandi was tending her
younger brothers &amp; sisters while I was at the party at the church.  She was
very responsible and I believe had been the one who called the fire
department.  She had quickly gotten the younger children outside and across the
street.  She was holding David and Shellie &amp; Mike were standing by her.  I
was so thankful they were alright</b>.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            Also while we were living in Clearfield, Larry
&amp; Ken decided we should go on a<b> pack-in trip for a vacation and go to Pinedale,
Wyoming.  </b>(Anyway, I think it was Pinedale) They wanted to take Tammy &amp;
I and also invite John &amp; Linda &amp; Bob &amp; Pauline, our other good
friends from Ogden.  They wanted to go for a week.  I was against it for
several reasons.  1) Ken was saying we were going and I didn't like to be told
I had to go.(Guess I'm pretty ornery sometimes) 2) I was nursing Mike and he
was only about six months old and I usually nursed my babies until they were at
least 9 months old and I didn't want to have to quit nursing him, and I would
have to if I were to be gone for a week. 3) I had had a couple of bad
experiences with horses and going with Larry.  The most recent was going up one
of the canyons, coming home scratched up from following Larry through the trees
and bushes, saddle sore, sunburned and feeling miserable.  I liked going on
short rides on the horses, but not all-day rides.  I felt with going on a
pack-in trip, it would be another miserable time.  Ken really wanted to go and
was stubborn and wouldn't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer.  I got pretty
upset and I remember my wonderful dad coming over for lunch (he worked
part-time for my Uncle Dale at his farm manufacturing company &quot;Clear-field
Manufacturing&quot; which was next door on the north.)  He would come over for
lunch sometimes and I enjoyed visiting with him.  One day I was telling him
about Ken wanting us to go on this pack-in trip to Wyoming.  I told him how I
felt and he told me I needed to stand up for myself - that I was a lot like my
sweet little Grandma Bushnell, and that Grandpa Bushnell always bossed grandma
around and didn't treat her very good, but when she finally stood up for
herself (after her children were raised) he respected her more, treated her
better and they had a much better relationship.  He told me that if I didn't
want to go on this pack-in trip, I shouldn't have to.  He was cute.  Well, Ken
still won out in the end - but I am glad he did as I did have a wonderful
time.  Larry &amp; Ken borrowed some big pack horses and cattle trucks from a
friend in Wyoming that they built a home for (actually a home out of a
schoolhouse) We drove to their place, put the horses in the big cattle trucks
and headed up to the mountains.  We parked at a certain place, put everything
on those pack horses, then we got on our horses.  I think I was riding Bonnie
and Ken was on Kendee and us four couples started off.  The area where we went
was so beautiful.  No motorized vehicle could go there, only horses or hikers. 
It was so beautiful.  We followed each other on a trail and rode by beautiful
lakes, river, and meadows.  We saw lots of wildlife.  It was so beautiful and
peaceful.  I don't think I have been to a more beautiful, wonderful, peaceful
place.  We camped at a lake.  The guys fished and Tammy, Pauline, Linda and I visited
and relaxed.  It was so wonderful.  <b>We had a close call on the way back,
however.  Ken was driving one of the big cattle trucks and one of the horses
slipped and caused the truck to swerve off the road.  The Lord was watching
over us because over half of the truck was over the mountain.  The only thing
that was holding it back, keeping it from going over the cliff was a small
tree.  As we think about it now, it was truly a miracle.  Larry quickly
stopped, ran over to us, opened the passenger door and helped us out.  Ken had
his foot on the brake, but Larry helped Bob, Pauline and then me out of the
truck.  Larry then ran over, jumped back into his truck and backed it behind
the truck Ken was in.  He took a big chain and fashioned it to both trucks and
then pulled Ken's back onto the road.  It was hard to watch, and I was praying
with all my might that Ken would be OK.  The horses were all upset and were
rearing, etc., and the truck was swaying back and forth.  I could just imagine
at any moment that little tree breaking and Ken being hurled off that mountain
in the truck.  If that had happened, there would not be any chance that he
could have come out alive.  I'm so thankful to the Lord that our lives were
spared that day.  Pauline was so shaken that she would not get back into the
truck.  She started walking down the road.  She had walked quite a way before
we all convinced her that she couldn't walk all the way to the bottom of the
mountain, so she finally got back in, but was very nervous until we got home. 
To tell the truth, I was also. </b> Pauline was an English girl and had a cute
assent.  Her &amp; Bob are special friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Kent Murdock was called to be the Bishop and he asked Ken
to be his 1st counselor</b>.  With us having a young family, they didn't want both
of us to be in executive positions so I was released. After Ken was put in the
Bishopric, I asked him if he would talk to the Bishop about letting me be the <b>Young
Married’s leader in our ward.</b>  I had enjoyed it so much in the Mount Fort
Ward and we didn’t have one going in the Clearfield lst Ward.  I was sustained
in this position in September.  Our opening social was September the 12<sup>th</sup>,
the day David was born, so Delvin and Dalene Reed, my assistants took over.  Later
Ranae Barney was put in as my assistant and we became great friends.  Ranae is
a different lady, she is a worker and very creative.  She did an amazing job as
my assistant.  However, she offended many people by the things she said and the
way she said them.  The funny thing is that she would become offended very
easily,  But, her and I got along great and grew to love each other.  In
January Dona Kolb, the Relief Society President moved to Roy, and Maurine
Sanders was put in as the new president.  She asked for John’s wife, Amy, and
myself to be her counselors.  I turned it down as both Ken and I felt that with
the size of our family and with them being so small, it would be too hard as I
would have to leave them so much.  I talked to Dona and she verified it.  She
said it was too much on a woman with a small family.  That she couldn’t have
done it except that her husband worked nights so he tended the children while
she went to Relief Society and visited the sisters and had her other meetings. 
She was my age and had three small girls.  Our Relief Society meetings and
activities were held during the week, not on Sundays like they are now.  Later
on that month they asked for me to teach the Spiritual Living class in Relief
Society as Maurine had taught it before she was put in as President.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I remember well the night the Bishopric came
over to ask me to be the Spiritual Living Teacher in Relief Society</b>.  I
wanted to say &quot;no&quot; because I was really nervous about teaching the
women in our ward, especially the Spiritual Living lessons.  There were many
older sisters who were very well versed in the scriptures and I felt one of
them should have been the teacher, not me as I was young and not very well
versed.  I guess the Lord knew I needed to study the scriptures more - so I
accepted.  I remember being so nervous about giving that first lesson.  I had
about a month to prepare so I studied hard, made visual aids, fasted and
prayed.  Our Relief Society meetings were on Tuesday mornings.  I remember
going there, going to prayer meeting and sitting on the front row in the Relief
Society room.  I felt like I would pass out, and was sure that when I got in
front of these sisters, I would pass out, but when I got up there and started
to give the lesson, all the fear went away from me and I was able to give the
lesson better than I had prepared and I felt the spirit of the Holy Ghost
guiding me and helping me.  It was such a warm, wonderful feeling and I was
actually enjoying giving the lesson.  When it was over many of the sisters came
up and told me what a good lesson it was and how they had enjoyed and gained a
lot from it.  I was so happy.  <b>I knew my Heavenly Father had answered my
prayers, and then I knew the meaning of the scripture which has come to be my
favorite. Nephi is speaking - &quot;I will go and do the things which the Lord
has commanded for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children
of men save he shall prepare a way that they can accomplish the thing that he
has commanded them&quot;.  This has given me courage to accept the calls that
have come to me, even though many times I felt inadequate.  My patriarcharal
blessing tells me that I would be a leader among women and so I know that I am
not to turn down these callings, and I have tried to accept and magnify them
with the Lord's help.  As I would try to do my best and ask the Lord for help,
he has helped me greatly and I have been very blessed throughout my life.</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While here in Clearfield, my Mom really
encouraged me to finish the requirements and get my &quot;<b>Golden
Gleaner&quot; award</b>.  They don't have these awards anymore, in fact, they
did away with them right after I received mine.  You had to finish all the
requirements for this award before the age of 30.  I was 29 and Mom said that I
should get an application and see if I hadn't already accomplished most of the
requirements.  I did and found that I had, indeed, fulfilled most of these
requirements from being in Leadership positions, speaking in church, fulfilling
other church callings, etc.  I did have several to finish up, however, and I
was expecting David and didn't feel up to all that I still needed to do.  Mom
kept after me, however, and so I did eventually earn this award before the age
of 30.  They recognized me at Sacrament Meeting and presented me with a
medallion.  Up to this point, the church had a special recognition banquet in
Salt Lake City for all who had earned this special &quot;Golden Gleaner&quot;
award for the women and &quot;Golden M Men&quot; for the men.  With the church
becoming so wide spread and even thought this was a small percentage of the men
and women of the church who had earned this award, it was still getting harder
to have a banquet for this many people - and so they discontinued it.  I didn't
go to a banquet, but that was ok.  I'm sure I grew from doing these
requirements</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I didn’t love sewing, but <b>I was excited that I could make
clothes for our children and I loved dressing my daughters in “Look Alike”
clothes.  I also made pull-over shirts for our sons and many times I would make
them out of the same material, so they all matched too.  They didn’t mind it
when they were young.</b>  I made dresses, tops, shawls &amp; pajamas for the
girls, and shirts and pajamas for the boys.  I tried to make levi’s, but that
was too much work.  I made clothes for myself too and some of my favorites were
clothes I had made.  When we were living in Arizona, the first time, Shellie
was mopping around and I asked her why she was sad.  She said “You make clothes
for Sandy, but not for me”.  I hadn’t realized that it had been that long since
I had sewn anything for her.  I told her that we would go shopping the next day
and she could pick out the pattern, material, lace or whatever she wanted and I
would make a dress for her.  She was so excited, and we had fun shopping
together.  She picked out a cute pattern and material, and after it was
finished, she looked so cute in it and she loved it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Larina</b>, our Indian Foster daughter on the Indian
Placement Program, was still living with us when we lived in Clearfield.  She
graduated from Clearfield High.  When we moved to Clearfield, Larina became
friends with Debbie Higley.  Debbie was a darling girl.  She was overweight and
a little plain, but had a darling personality.  We were glad her and Larina
became friends. Debbie quickly grew to love our children and would love to come
to our home and play with the kids and read them stories.  Larina, it seemed
came second place, when Debbie was at our home.  After Larina graduated and
went back to Idaho, we had Debbie baby sit for us.  Even when she had other
plans, she would cancel them to come and tend our children.  She was the best
babysitter we ever had.  She loved the children and they loved her, and Ken
&amp; I loved her too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Mike was only about 7 months old, I got
pregnant again.  I was concerned because the baby would just be 16 &amp; ½
months younger than Mike and I didn't know how I would manage especially since
Ken was gone so much with being in the Bishopric.   </p>

align=left hspace=12>On September of 1970, the Lord blessed us with another
beautiful baby son whom we named David.  .  When this son was born, I told Ken
I didn't care if his mom didn't like the name of David, we did and he was our
child and we could name him what we wanted - so we named him David Glen.  Glen
after my father.  Ken's mom never said anything about his name.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My concerns about having two children so close,
especially since Shellie &amp; Mike were only two years apart, quickly ended
when David was born.  David didn't have colic and was a contented baby, and
Mike was so cute with David and always wanted to help.  He was a big help.  I
let him get me the diapers, binkee, help feed him when I bottle fed him or gave
him water in the bottle, etc.  He always wanted to hold him, etc., and as soon
as David was old enough to play, they were having fun together.  David,
although a contended baby, was a sickly baby.  He was always getting colds
which would turn into tonsilitis, croup, ear infections, etc.  </p>

want to even consider him, but he told them he would work for such a low wage
and that after he proved himself, they could raise him to the wage that were
planning to pay.  The supervisor said &quot;What can we lose&quot; so they
hired him.  It was such a low wage that we were not able to pay our bills so we
used our food storage instead of buying groceries.  Ken did prove himself, but
about that time the owner of the company, Val Browning, who was a alcoholic had
bought a company, Jarmans, at a party when he was drunk.  Jarmans was about
bankrupt - so that put Browning Arms in a tight squeeze.  When Ken's supervisor
went to get the raise for him, he was told that there was a freeze on wages and
they couldn't give him the raise he deserved.  By this time we had used up our
food storage and had to be put on church welfare.  I hated this.  I always want
to be self sufficient and I didn't like being on church welfare.  We were only
on it about 2 or 3 months when we felt we needed a vacation.  Ken needed to get
away and I did also.  Larry &amp; Tammy had moved to Mesa, Arizona because of
Larry's health.  He had rheumatoid arthritis and it was really hard on him
living in Liberty so they had moved to Mesa for the warm weather.  They invited
us to come down - so we took Mom so she could visit her brother, Uncle Van and
his wife, Aunt Allison, who were living there while Uncle Van was going to Arizona
 University in Tempee to get his doctor's degree in business.   Mom said she
would pay for half the gas since she was going with us.  That really helped
with our finances.  We really enjoyed the vacation.  We went in March I
believe, which is the best time in Arizona.  The orange blossoms are out and it
is beautiful with the flowers, warm weather, etc.  We stopped at Hover Dam on
the way down &amp; other places.  Larry &amp; Tammy were happy to have us there
as we had missed each other, and the children were really happy to be together
as they had played together so much and were good friends.  Lori &amp; Sandi
were the same age, Holly was a few months older than Shellie, Lonnie was a
little older than Mike and David &amp; Jody were the same age.  In fact, they
were born on the same day.  Tammy was due a month later than I was and she had
made the comment that I should go 2 weeks over and she should come 2 weeks
early and we could be together in the hospital.  I told her that it would be
great for her, but I didn't want to go two weeks over my due date.  Well, it
turned out that I did go over two weeks and the doctor finally scheduled me to
go in on the 12th of September and he would start me.  The night of the 11th,
Tammy called me and said &quot;well, Mae, I'm on my way to the hospital.  The
pains are 5 minutes apart - so I'll save you a bed right next to me&quot;.  We
had a friend in the ward who was a nurse at the McKay hospital and after Tammy
had Jody and was in the ward.  She asked this friend if she could save the bed
next to her for me as I was at the hospital now.  She said &quot;sure, that
would be great&quot;.  It was great.  Tammy &amp; I had a wonderful time being
together with our new babies for four days.  It was funny, thought because she
was sure she was going to have a boy and I was sure I was going to have a girl,
and we each had just the opposite.  They were both beautiful babies and have
been special children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Anyway, back to the vacation.  Larry had a
friend and neighbor, <b>Ron Shumway</b>, who was the <b>data </b><img

align=left hspace=12><b>processing manager at Hughes Air West Airlines</b>.  They
called it the “The Yellow Banana”.  Larry introduced Ken to Ron after church
and told Ron about Ken.  Ron needed to hire another programmer so was
interested and had Ken go in to his office for an interview.  He gave Ken some
Cobalt (new programming language) books to study and then would fly him down to
test him on it later.  That happened and Ron offered Ken the job.  We were
excited as it was a big raise - a lot more than he would have made at Browning
Arms even if they had given him the raise.  We were sad to leave our parents,
brothers &amp; sisters and their families, however and so Ken approached his
boss at Browning Arms to tell him of the offer.  He asked Ken how much he would
have to have in order for him to keep him at Browning Arms.  Ken quoted a
figure and it was less than he had been offered by Ron.  His supervisor said
&quot;keep working, I need you here, I'll go approach the big boss.  He came
back after a couple of hours and said &quot;Ken, you're crazy if you don't
accept that offer.  They say the freeze is still on and won't let me give you
the raise&quot;.  So, Ken quit.  Ron wanted Ken to start as soon as possible so
he did.  Because he was working for the airlines, Ron told him he could fly
home Friday after work and fly back Sunday night.  He stayed with Larry &amp;
Tammy for three months as I hated to take Sandi out of school and have her
start in a new school just 3 months before school was out.  Anyway, it gave me
time to sort through everything and get packed and with Ken coming home every
weekend, it wasn't so bad.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Delvin and Dalean Reed had moved so I carried on
the Young Married program alone.  (I still held this position as well as
Spiritual Living Teacher)  <b>RaNae Barney</b> offered to help me as she also
loved this program and hoped to activitate her husband through this program. 
RaNae really has a different personality.  She says what she thinks and throws
digs at people, and many people are offended, but she doesn’t mean it that way
and doesn’t mean to hurt people.  In fact, if she thinks she has offended
someone she worries and really lets it upset her.  She was also really
sensitive so you had to watch what you said to her as she might take it the
wrong way.  We <img width=178 height=1

align=left hspace=12>got to be good friends working closely together, and she
went out of her way to do things for me.  I really appreciated her friendship. 
When we moved to come down to Arizona<b>, the Young Marrieds gave Ken and I a
beautiful cake (it looked like a wedding cake, it had two little kissing cupids
on top)  which Beverly McMillan had made</b>.  She was the Junior Sunday School
Coordinator, a wonderful sister and a cake decorator.  They also gave me a
beautiful orchard for me to wear for “Mother’s Day” which was the next day. 
They had a sign by the cake which read - “You are our angels sent from Heaven
above.”  RaNae and Shirley Murdock were largely responsible for this,
collecting money, making arrangements, etc.  RaNae gave a beautiful speech
about us, it was really a surprise and a thrill.  The Bishopric and clerks gave
a party for us also and gave us a beautiful electric living room clock.</p>

align=left hspace=12>I flew down one weekend to look at homes with Ken.  We
found one in the Lehi area and bought it.  It took a couple of months for the
loan to go through so <b>we rented an apartment close to Larry &amp; Tammy</b>. 
The apartment was very nice and it had a pool.  Ken &amp; I drove down with the
moving truck and unloaded it.  They were supposed to have the power on, but
they didn't, so we spent the night at Larry &amp; Tammy's and I flew back home
to get the children and Ken went to work.  The children had stayed with Mom
&amp; Dad while Ken &amp; I took the truck down.  When Ken met us at the
airport that night, he didn't look so good.  As we drove to our apartment, he
told me that <b>the apartment had caught on fire and burned a lot of our stuff</b>. 
I was sick.  The insurance adjustors wouldn't let us in the apartment and so we
again stayed with Larry &amp; Tammy.  They were always gracious and
hospitable.  The owners of the apartment helped us move into another apartment
and we did salvage most of our things.  I had to take the clothes to the
Laundromat or the cleaners to get the smoke out.  A lot of the things we had in
the kitchen were burned up.  The men Ken worked with all chipped in and gave us
money to replace a lot of it.  They was neat.  Larry &amp; Tammy also gave us
some things they didn't need.  I guess the things I missed the most were my
recipes.  They had burned.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The landlords let us move into another apartment
and we liked it there.  Sometime later, we received a letter from the insurance
company saying they were suing both the power company and Ken &amp; I.  I
couldn't believe it, why would they sue us.  Well, I have since learned that
insurance companies go after anyone they can find that might be responsible -
so they can get their money back (what a gipe - we pay tons of money to all
different insurance companies, auto, life, home owners, health &amp; accident,
etc., and they still go after anyone they can to reclaim the money they put
out.  It makes me mad)  They claimed that we set our boxes on the stove when we
moved into the apartment, and when the power company turned on the power, the
stove was on (left on by the cleaning lady, they think) and it burned the boxes
and started the fire.  We didn't put boxes on the stove, but on the cupboard by
the stove, and since it got so hot, it did ignite the boxes and the fire went fast
after that.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our stake executive secretary was a lawyer, so
we went to him about it since the insurance company had sent us a deposition to
fill out.  We asked this lawyer how much chance we would have if we tried to
fight it ourselves.  He said practically none.  We asked how much chance we had
if we hired him.  He said about a 50% chance.  He charged $40 an hour and that
was in 1970.  We didn't know how we would pay the money, but sure didn't want
to lose the lawsuit.  I think the amount we would have had to pay if we lost
was $5,000 plus court costs, etc.  $5,000 was really a lot of money back then
also.  We had filled out the deposition and he changed everything but our
names.  He told us that we didn't know for sure how the fire started.  We just took
the insurance company's word for it - we were not there when it started.  He
said if we left it the way we answered it, they would be able to sue us.  But
if he changed it and said &quot;we don't know&quot;, the insurance company
would have to prove what happened.  Well, it went on and on and we were pretty
worried, but our lawyer ended up winning in our behalf - so we were grateful we
had hired him. Even though it cost us a few hundred dollars, it was better than
a few thousand dollars.  It is still so unfair that the victim gets this kind
of treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We did have fun those couple of months in the
apartment.  The children and I would swim a lot of the time during the day and
at night when Ken was home, we would swim again.   Sandi got &quot;swimmers
ear&quot; and had to have medication for it.  Ken &amp; I and Larry &amp; Tammy
would get the younger children in bed and let the older girls babysit while the
four of us would go for walks.  It was so beautiful in that area.  I especially
loved the palm trees.  There was an ice cream place between close to where we
lived.  They had a popsicle type treat which we all loved and we got those
quite a lot.</p>

align=left hspace=12>We moved into <b>our home at 233 West Hunter</b> before
school started and liked the home, yard, neighborhood and ward.  The front yard
had a small white picket fence.  It was hard to keep the grass clipped and it
looking nice, but I always worked at it as I like a neat yard.    Every week or
more often if needed, I would get my little lawn sheers out and cut the grass
from around the fence.  It was quite a job, but it looked so nice after it was
done.  I have always enjoyed yard work, but Ken hasn’t.  Good thing one of us
did or our yards wouldn’t have looked very good.  It also had two large trees
in the front yard.  I remember hearing terrible loud noises at one time of the
year.  It was the locus.  These were huge beetles and they liked our trees. 
They made so much noise it about drove me crazy.  Thank goodness they were not
there all year long.  Sometimes they would get on the screen doors and when we
opened the door, they would fly in.  I hated them as they would fly at you.  I
liked our backyard.  We had a covered patio the length of our house.  We put
our washer and dryer out there and a picnic table, etc.  We enjoyed it out
there.  We also had lots of roses.  We had a hedge of small red roses all
around the back yard, plus a beautiful peace rose growing up the clothes line
pole and one on a trellis by the carport.        The one on the clothes line
had beautiful, large pink and yellow roses.  Each rose was different.  Some
were almost all yellow with a little pink and some were almost all pink with a
little yellow and many were somewhere in between.  I loved that rose bush.  We
had both orange and grapefruit trees and enjoyed the fruit from these trees. 
We planted a garden and found that to be very different from our gardens in Utah. 
We didn't plant much during the summer as it was too hot and would burn the
plants, but we had lots of vegetables all during the fall, winter and spring. 
Shellie really loved spinach so we planted that too.  I also used the spinach
in green salads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=258 height=1
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image093.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>       I liked our covered patio also.  It went the length
of the house.  The children played out there all year long.  We had our washer
and dryer out there also, as there wasn’t room in the house.  Ken made the
children a cute set of cupboard and stove and they had fun playing with it.  I 
remember Sandy and Lori (Tammy &amp; Larry’s oldest daughter) getting together
and making up plays.  They would make costumes out of blankets, old clothes,
cardboard, etc., and involve the other children.  When they had it ready, they
would have Larry &amp; Tammy &amp; Ken &amp; I come out and watch it.  They
were very creative, and they were cute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       <b>We also had many wonderful neighbors.  The
Premacks especially</b>.  We met the Premacks through their daughter, LuAnn,
who became Sandy’s best friend.  They moved here from Oregon where he had 
retired from the service.  He got a job in the telephone company in Mesa. 
They bought a new home on Freeman.  We were at the time living on Hunter. 
Sandy and LuAnn had much in common and enjoyed being together.  I went over to
meet LuAnn’s mother and welcome them into the neighborhood.  Both her and her
husband were very friendly and wonderful people.  We started fellowshipping
them as they didn’t belong to any religion.  We became good friends.  One day
Sandy came home and said that if we didn’t ask the Premacks the golden
questions (“what do you know about the Mormon Church, and would you like to
know more?”) that she was afraid that they would join the Methodist Church as a
lady that Mrs. Premack (Joan) worked with had been getting her interested in
that religion.  Immediately we went over to visit with them and asked them
these questions.  Mr. Premack said “Yes, he would.”  Joan hesitated, but
finally said yes.  We though we explained to them that we would have the
missionaries come and explain the gospel to them if they came to our home the
following Sunday night, but they didn’t understand it that way.  They thought
we were going to explain it to them.  They came that night, but when they saw
the missionaries, they became cold.  Especially Joan.  When they left after the
presentation, they accepted a Book of Mormon, but we were afraid that it
wouldn’t go any further.  Hal Premack read and enjoyed the Book of Mormon, but
Joan wouldn’t.  So, they joined the Methodist Church.  We felt bad and
disappointed, but it didn’t stop our friendship with them.  We moved on Freeman
into our new home and became their neighbors.  They lived two houses down from
us.  We visited with them several times and went places together.  When we
moved to Utah, they still wrote for a while.  Sandy sure hated to move and
leave LuAnn because they were such good friends.  So far (1977) she still
hasn’t found as close a friend as LuAnn was, and she still misses her although
she is happy here on the farm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Soon after we had moved in, the Bishopric from
our ward came to visit us.  They asked me to accept the position of <b>Laurel</b><b> teacher</b>.  I was excited as I loved the young women and had been in the
MIA program  most of the time we lived in Ogden.  I had thought the Laurels
would be the best class to teach, but that wasn't the case in this ward.  They
were boy crazy, disrespectful to me and each other (actually everyone), rude,
etc., etc.  I remember the first time I went to teach them.  Again, this was
before the block system and we had MIA on Tuesday nights.  I sat in opening
exercises with these girls and watched them make fun of a younger girl - a Mia
Maid, whose father was the counselor in the bishopric who called me.  They had
14 children.  They were a wonderful family, but didn't have a lot of money
because it took a lot to feed and clothe that many children.  These Laurel girls, especially one, <b>Sharla Allen</b>, really gave this girl a hard time. 
Sharla would say with a sarcastic tone &quot;mice are running all over you - in
your hair, down your back, everywhere&quot; and would laugh.  I didn't take
very much of it when I told Sharla to stop - that it was awful of her to do
that to this girl.  She gave me a dirty look, but did stop.  In class the 8
girls were terrible.  One was combing another's hair, two were talking about
the dates they had the previous night and laughing, another was doing school
homework, etc., etc.  They were definitely not listening to the lesson and I
had taken a lot of time to prepare.  I came home crying and very upset.  It
went on like this for some time.  We had an activity with the boys where we
were to teach them to make cookies and how to iron a shirt (so these things
would help them on their missions).  The boys were to teach us how to change a
tire, check the oil in the car, etc.  This activity turned out to be a
disaster.  One girl, Kathy Westbrook, one of my greatest trials even was
lighting matches and flicking them at other kids.  We got that stopped, but the
entire evening was awful.  I was very discouraged when I went home.  All the
activities turned out a disaster the first six months.  I tried many different
approaches and finally after I decided to fast and pray each week before going
to M.I.A., I was finally able to make some progress.  For our service project
we decided to make cookies, candy and pop corn balls and send to the
missionaries and service men from our ward.  We did this in November.  We made
them at my home; afterwards we had banana splits or Sundays.  I made special
favors for the girls with cards of appreciation to them.  This really helped
their attitude towards me and from then on, they showed love and respect and
listened and participated in the lessons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken had the same girls and also the guys their
age in his Sunday School class.  He is a good teacher and usually doesn't have
any trouble with classes he has taught.  He can also step in at the last minute
when a teacher hasn't shown up and he does great.  But, this class was so awful
that he finally quit.  That's the first time I have seen him quit a church
calling.  He said the final straw was when he saw a guy and girl petting right
in class.  Their parents were leaders in the ward.  He got so angry, he walked
out of the class and told the Sunday School president that he was not going to
waste his time babysitting this group of youth.  Perhaps I would have quit had
that happened to me, but I did have a miserable 6 months.  I came home crying
more than once.  I learned to love those girls and really enjoyed them for the
remaining six months. Their names were: Debbie Opie, Kathy Westbrook, Mechille
Pomeroy, Sharla Allen, Janice Cooley, Chery ? (can’t remember the other’s
names).   Kathy Westbrook, my main problem girl, got married soon after
graduating from high school.  I went to her reception.  After moving back to
Utah, a few months later, we were invited to come to the Salt Lake Temple and
see Debbie Opie married and afterwards to her wedding breakfast.  It was really
nice and I was proud of Debbie that she married in the temple.  She met him at
B.Y.U.  He lived in Salt Lake.  Debbie was the president of our class.  Her dad
was a counselor in the Bishopric.  Now he is Bishop.  He told Ken that if we’d
still been living down there, he would have had him for a counselor.   The one
girl, Sharla Allen got married and had a couple of children and when our family
moved down to Arizona the second time and moved into the Mesa 42nd ward, <b>Sharla,
her husband</b> and their family were in that ward.  <b>They called me to be
the primary president a short while after we were there and I called her to be
my counselor</b>.  She was a great counselor and it was a wonderful experience
serving with her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             In August, after teaching the Laurels, Helen
Freeman, the president of the primary asked for me to be her counselor over the
girls program and the targeteers.  Her other counselor was Kathy Trendler, the
secretary was Norma Powers.  I enjoyed working with these women very much, also
my teachers.  They were terrific.  I loved Helen.  We became good friends.  She
wasn't as organized as I wished, but a great president non-the-less.   Kathy
moved and Helen called Laraine Aldredge to be her new counselor.  She was a
very sweet lady.  We worked well together.    I enjoyed the primary children
and working in this presidency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Helen had a cow and sold milk so we bought milk
from her.  We have always been health conscious and felt that whole milk was
much better for us than pasteurized milk, so always tried to find someone with
a cow (if we didn't have one) and buy milk from them.  My parents were always
health conscious, especially dad, and so I grew up this way and wanted my
family to be healthy too.  Mom always had a garden and I helped weed and care
for it and helped her bottle bushels of fruit and vegetables every summer and
fall. Even at age 81, she still wanted to bottle soup, relish and peaches, even
though her cupboards and fruit shelves are full.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sandy was a Merrie Miss so she was glad I was
over the girls.  The only bad thing was that with me being over the program, I
knew all about the daddy-daughter parties and Mom &amp; Miss parties.  I would
have to conduct and see everything went smoothly so it was hard to be right
with Sandy and make it special for her.  She was disappointed that she couldn’t
surprise me about the projects because I had to help plan them.  Our presidency
meetings were both fun as well as constructive as we’d laugh and joke with each
other and enjoy being together.   I was in this position for two years until we
moved the end of May, 1974.  I felt it was a wonderful and successful two
years.  My teachers were Margie Owens  - Merrie Miss A and Lois Porter - Merrie
Miss B and Darlene Smith - Merrie Miss B.  The Targeteer teachers changed
several times, so I can’t remember all their names.  Lois and I were already
good friends and the two of us and our husbands would get together a lot to
play games, eat, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sandy is in the 4<sup>th</sup> grade.  Shellie
is 4, Mike is 2 and David 11 months.  We sure enjoy our little family and feel
we are really blessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When David was about 18 months old, we had gone
to Utah for Thanksgiving and he got sick while we were there.  I took him to
the doctor when we got home, and he said David had tonsilitis and ear
infections and that he would need a &quot;double&quot; penicillin shot.  (They
used to give shots a lot in those days, now they mainly give liquid or pills)
When the doctor told me that, immediately a terrible sensation came over me and
the feeling that I shouldn't let David have the shot.  I rationalized that when
I was in Utah, Mom &amp; her friend had been talking about penicillin and how
you could have terrible reactions to it.  Deep inside I knew it was the Holy
Ghost warning me not to let the doctor give David the shot, but I guess I was
weak and thought &quot;well, he's the doctor and David is really sick, what
else do I do?&quot;  Well, I let him have the shot and as I went out to the
car, I fell apart and started crying because I knew that feeling was so strong
that I shouldn't have let it happen, that I should have heeded the warning. 
David suffered terribly for several years because of that, and I suffered along
with him and wished I could take the pain and other problems that came along
with it, instead of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=285 height=1
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image095.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>            We did take him to another doctor to see if
the doctor gave the shot in the wrong place.  (Since David went into the
medical field, he found out from another M.D. that the doctor had given it in
the wrong place, and that the other doctor wouldn't &quot;rat&quot; on him as
they cover for each other.  We were told back then, that David was terribly
allergic to penicillin and that if he had been 15 or older when he received the
shot that he would never had walked again.  The doctor said that if he should
ever have penicillin again, it could kill him.  He advised us to get a chain
around his neck or a wrist bracelet showing that he was allergic to it, so in
case he was taken to a clinic or hospital without us being there, that they
would see it and not give it to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I took David home from the doctor, who gave
him the shot, he couldn't walk, it was too painful.  He would scream as I
changed his diaper, dressed him, put on his shoes, etc.  It paralyzed his left
side.  The doctor said that with him being so young, it would heal an inch a
month - so about a year later, the paralysis was gone, but it left him with a
&quot;club foot&quot;.  We had taken David to all kinds of doctors to get
help.  One orthopedic surgeon had him do foot and leg exercises and come back
each month.  He would check it and tell us to continue doing these same
exercises.  We finally could see that it wasn't helping; all it was helping was
the doctor's bank account, so we quit taking him there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David not only had to contend with the paralysis and club
foot, but he also still kept getting sick a lot.  He coughed so much that he
developed what they called a &quot;chicken breast&quot; (I think that was what
it was called) Anyway, the bone in his chest protruded.  The doctors kept
putting him on antibiotics.  I hated to have him have so many drugs and I
couldn't see they were helping - only temporarily.  It wasn't fixing the
problem.  We took him to an ear, nose and throat specialist who lived in our
stake in Lehi.  When I took David into his office, he said &quot;that child
needs his adenoid out&quot;.  He could tell by the way he was breathing.  He
operated and took out his tonsils and adenoids and put tubes in his ears.  That
seemed to help for awhile, but he was still sickly and it really worried me. 
He was going on four at this time.  He got so bad that he would have coughing
spells which started out just every so often. He would cough so hard at nights
and couldn't breathe.  Ken &amp; I would prop his bed up so he could breathe
easier, but it got progressively worse until we would be up most of the night
with him for several nights in a row and then he would be so exhausted and weak
that he would just lay around and not have any energy to do anything.  About
this time Ken &amp; I had been to a party that our Bishop's house.  The
Bishop's wife had been really sick for a long time and told me that she heard
of a Dr. Swanstrom in Scottsdale who was a homoeopathic doctor and had helped so
many people.  She had gone to him and he put her on different vitamins,
minerals, etc., and she couldn't believe the difference.  She was afraid she
was dying and now she was well.  I was really interested, but soon forgot about
it.  My Mom &amp; Dad had been down visiting for Thanksgiving or Christmas, I
can't remember which and Ken's Mom &amp; stepdad were also there.  Dad &amp;
Leo gave David a blessing.  I remember Sandi coming into the kitchen the next
morning and saying &quot;Mom, my grandpa's gave David a blessing, why isn't he
better?&quot;  She had heard him continue to cough so hard all throughout the
night.  I didn't have an answer for her then, but when she came home from
school, I did.  About 11:30 that morning, the thought came to me about Dr.
Swanstrom and that I should take David to him.  I called the Bishop's wife and
got his phone number.  I called and his wife told me that all his appointment
were taken.  She must have sensed how desperate I was as she let me talk to
him.  At first he tried to make an appointment for a later date, but he also
sensed my concern and told me to bring him right in.  I later found out that he
gave up his lunch hour to see David.  When I carried David into his office, he
took one look at him and said &quot;I'm glad you brought him in, girlie&quot;. 
He always called me &quot;girlie&quot; from that time on.  Dr Swanstrom was a
cute little white haired man who was in his 70's.  He had studied to become a
medical doctor, but had gone to Germany for more education.  While there he
learned about homoeopathic.  He didn't get his M.D. because he believed more in
homoeopathic.  He even started a college in Chicago and worked there until he
started having health problems because of working too hard and too long.  He
and his wife were religious.  I can't remember what faith they belonged to, but
he was their organist.  He had a special gift from God and had a lot of faith
in Heavenly Father.  His wife was his receptionist and she also sold
&quot;Shackley&quot; products.  Her name was Dorothy and she was a very special
lady also.  He used a machine to test with, where you could use blood, saliva,
or urine. He usually used saliva as it was the easiest.  He would have you
close your mouth on a paper towel.  He would draw around it with a pen and test
it with his machine.  He also worked on your body - like a chiropractor, but
much more gentle.  He would run his fingers down your spine and tell you not
only what was wrong with your back, but other problems with your body.  He
would sell homoeopathic vitamins &amp; minerals.  They were little white pills
which you would put under your tongue and dissolve.  They tasted good - so it
was not a problem to have the children take them.  I loved this little old man
and knew the Lord sent us to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyway, back to David.  He told me that David was at a zero
with oxygen - that was why he coughed so much and so hard, he didn't have
hardly any oxygen in his body and thus no energy.  He sent us home with iron,
magnesium, calcium, etc.  He also said his blood sugar was low and told me what
to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Sandi came home from school, I told her the
Lord had blessed David - that Heavenly Father usually doesn't just immediately
heal someone, but helps us to know what to do, and that he put the thought in
my head to take him to Dr. Swanstrom which I had done and now he was going to
get well.  I had faith that this would be so.  My parents had left that morning
to go home, and Mom telephoned me later, that when they had left, she told dad
that she didn't expect to see David alive again.  She said he had been so sick
and his skin was turning blue and she felt he wouldn't live much longer.  I
don't think he would have either, if the Lord hadn't blessed us to go to Dr.
Swanstrom.  After a couple of weeks and David was still having these coughing
spells, I became impatient and again called Dr. Swanstrom.  He told me that it
had taken a long time for David to get this bad and it would take awhile for
him to get built back up.  When he was feeling well again, I thanked Dr.
Swanstrom and he said &quot;Don't thank me, girlie, thank the Lord&quot;.  He
always gave the credit to the Lord.  I know that was why he was able to help so
many people.  Over the years until Dr Swanstrom died, Ken &amp; I went to him
and took the family a lot too.  When he first tested the other children, we had
moved down and left the farm in Erda.  He told us he hadn't tested such a
healthy family in a long time.  He told us that we must be feeding them good
nutritious food, and taking good care of them.  We told him we were health
conscious and had always tried to get &quot;whole&quot; milk for the family to
drink.  If we didn't have a cow, then we tried to find someone who had one and
buy milk from them.  We also told him we just moved from a church farm where
the children got lots of exercise and fresh air being out working and also
playing on the farm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our dearest truest friends are <b>Larry and Tammy

said, we never fight like sisters do.  We were together a lot, either just the
two of us with our children or with our husbands or families.  We ate at each other’s
homes, played games, went on trips together, went camping together a lot, we
had so much fun together.  Either she or I would call and say “What are you
doing today?”  And then we would say:“Let’s take the children and go to the
park, or get a sitter and go shopping, or let’s bake together today.”  We had
so much in common that we could talk about anything.  Pat &amp; I were always
best friends, but I think Tammy &amp; I were even closer, we really enjoyed
being together.</p>

together with them.  Sometime after we moved, Pete was put in the Bishopric. 
We went over to the ward as they were having something special - missionary
farewell or something (can’t remember for sure), anyway, we were five or so
minutes late and when we walked in we saw a row in the middle isle partway up
in the chapel and as we walked up there, Pete was conducting and he said “Well,
if it isn’t our good friends Ken &amp; Mae Browning and their family.  Wow,
you’ve got a big family now, don’t you?  You take up an entire row.”  Everyone
chuckled.  We were a little embarrassed, but that was just Pete.  </p>

together for family home evenings and eating at each other’s homes.  John &amp;
Linda moved into a home in Syracuse.  Bob &amp; Pauline bought a home in Salt
 Lake, we moved to Clearfield and Larry &amp; Tammy to Liberty.  We still get
together once or twice a month at each other’s homes for family night and

have been fortunate to have wonderful friends.  I am also thankful for my

PARK</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>It is now July 1975.  We are on vacation at
Island Park in Idaho</b>.  It is so beautiful &amp; peaceful here.  We have
been here almost a week.  This weekend we will enjoy being with relatives for
the Robinson reunion here at Mac’s lodge.   <b>When we were setting up camp,
David started calling me.  I looked around and couldn’t see him.  He yelled “up
here Mom, I’m up in the tree”.  I looked up to where the sound was coming from
and there he was up at the top of a tall pine tree.  He was holding onto the
top and swinging back and forth.  I was really frightened as he was only about
4 years old.  I told him to get back down and we went over to help him after he
got almost to the bottom.  I don’t know how he could have climbed that tree,
but David was daring and loved adventure.  Soon after that, he said he needed
to go to the bathroom.  Shellie was riding her bike and we asked her to take
him to the bathroom.  Some time later, we couldn’t find David and asked Shellie
where he was.  She said “I don’t know”.  We found out she had taken him to the
outhouse and then left him there to go and keep riding her bike.  We became
frightened as it was starting to get dark.  We all went in different
directions, calling him and frantically looking for him.  Finally, a man came
towards us holding David’s hand.  We were so relieved to find him.  David said
he came out and couldn’t find Shellie and started walking to find us, but he
had gotten lost.  He was frightened and started to cry when the man had found
him.  We were upset with Shellie for leaving him, but so thankful he was
alright.  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The past four years have been wonderful and
eventful, but also we’ve had trials and many decisions to make.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>         We enjoyed our home on Hunter, but the home was
small so in October, 1973, we sold our home and bought a larger, newer home
just a block and a half away at 1669 N Freeman.  This was a nicer home in a
better neighborhood.  It was on a corner lot.  We loved this home.  You could
either come in from the carport into the kitchen, or the other front door took
you into the living room.  A nice laundry/storage room was off the kitchen to
the north and a large family room was adjoining the kitchen.  It had 4 bedrooms
and 2 baths, a nice size yard and a covered patio in back.  The master bedroom
&amp; bathroom were really nice with special features.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Scott</b> was born while we lived in our 2<sup>nd</sup>  home,
when we moved to Arizona the first time.   Scott is our &quot;Arizona&quot;
baby.  He was our only child who was born outside of Utah.  Prior to his birth,
all the children had had the Chicken Pox.  Sandi had gone to the Father and
Daughter Party and came home sick.  The next morning she was really sick and
soon broke out with the Chicken Pox.  She had had it before and I didn't think
you could get it twice, but you can and the 2nd time is a lot worse.  I felt so
sorry for her as she ran a high fever and had chicken pox all over her body,
between her toes, down her throat, everywhere and was really sick.  Shellie got
them next and then both Mike and David.  I was hoping not to bring a new baby
home to the chicken pox, plus I didn't want to leave the children when they
were sick to go to the hospital.  In those days, they kept us in the hospital
for at least three days and usually four.  Thankfully, they got over them just
before Scott was born.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=332 height=1
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image107.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>That hospital experience was awful.  As far as the birth
was concerned it went fine, but they had had a bomb scare at that hospital
&quot;The Good Samaritan Hospital&quot; and so they had to check my suitcase,
purse, etc., as I was admitted.  When they took me to my room, it was terribly
hot.  We tried to open the door onto the patio, but it was locked.  Ken went to
see about getting it unlocked, but they told us that because of security, they
had to stay locked.  The thermostat didn't work in my room and I was so hot and
uncomfortable.  Ken tried to stuff up cardboard into the heat vent to shut off
some of the heat.  He complained to the nurses and doctors and they said they
would have someone come look at it, but no one ever came.  I would have to put
cold wash cloths on my face and drink lots of ice water, but it was still so
miserable.  I only stayed the minimum of time I had to, as I wanted to go home
and be able to get some rest.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Scott was a cute baby and very alert and
strong.  The nurse said &quot;if he doesn't turn out to be a football player,
I'll be surprised as he holds his head up so straight and is so strong&quot;. 
He was my biggest baby - almost 9 lbs.  He was a contented, happy baby.  Back
at home, Ken's mom &amp; Leo came to help me and also my Mom came.  I've always
had trouble getting my milk to come in good at first, so I eat lots of corn. 
Someone told me that help the milk come in good.  I also drank a lot of water
and hot postum.  They said &quot;hot&quot; drinks helped.  After my milk was
established, I was fine and so was the baby, it was just getting it to come in,
was the problem.  At night after we put the children down to bed, the five of
us adults would play &quot;rummy&quot;.  I would fix a cup of postum to drink
and asked if any of them would like some.  They said &quot;no&quot;.  I got out
some ginger snap cookies and started dipping them in my postom.  They said
&quot;that looks good&quot; - so I fixed them cups of postom and put the ginger
snaps on the table.  They really liked it - so each evening we would play
&quot;rummy&quot; and drink postom and dip ginger snaps in it.  I still like
postom with ginger snaps and it reminds me of those good evenings with our
parents.  We didn’t name Scott after anyone, we just liked those names, but a
member of our ward, whose name was Leon, thought we had named our baby after
him and he thought he was Scott’s Godfather.  He was excited about this.  We
didn’t tell him different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are very thankful for our little Scott.  He
is now 18 months old.  One thing I’d like to note about him is that he started
whistling when he was fifteen months old.  (I thought he was younger than 15
months and have been saying that he was, and he might have been.)  Scott
started whistling in church in Sunset.   He was whistling and everyone was
looking around to see who was doing it, as it was a strong loud whistle.  I was
trying to stuff soda crackers and cheerios into his mouth to keep him from
whistling.  After church the little widows who were sitting in back of us said
“Was that your baby who was whistling?”  They thought it sounded like it was
coming from him, but couldn’t believe that it was.  Teenagers came up and were
amazed that it was Scott who had been whistling.  .He would whistle as he
walked around the house, and has whistled every since.  We call him <b>“The
Happy Little Whistler”.  </b>We had a cat in Arizona who would play in its cat
house, that Ken built, and would swipe at us with his paws &amp; scratch us,
but if Scott would be there, he would play carefully with him and never hurt
him.  Guess he had that instinct that Scott was a baby and he played so good
with him.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>            We had good benefits with Hughes Airwest
Airlines.  We could fly anywhere Air West flies for $4.00 round trip (just the
cost of the service charge) We flew stand-by, but that hasn’t been a problem
most of the time.  We also got benefits with the other airlines.  Also, Ken’s
parents got this same benefit, but not my parents.  Because of this low expense
to fly, we seldom drove to our parents - or anywhere out of state, and we
usually visited our parents at least once a month.  It has been so great.  I
love to fly and so do the children.  We flew over to visit Ken’s brother Roy
and his family in Fresno, California also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Fresno, California to visit Roy

&amp; many others got sea sick, but Ken didn’t get sick because he had taken
the sea sickness pills which were offered.  They didn’t catch anything.  Steve
was a little boy and had been excited to go, but when he got sick, he kept

at a beautiful hotel.  While Ken was in meetings the next morning, I went out
among the beautiful gardens.  There roses and so many different shrubs, trees,
fountains - it was so beautiful.  It was like a plantation (at least how I
picture them).  I wrote a talk which I was to give the following Sunday in
Sacrament Meeting.  The meeting wasn’t very long because the people, over it
from DC, were not prepared.  Ken was very prepared, and was the first one to
complete the computer software for the Federal Aviation Committee – the Freight
Cargo System  Anyway, that gave us more time to see the sites Ken returned
about noon and we rode the bus to the White House and from there we walked to a
cute café to eat lunch.  We then walked to the Lincoln Memorial, next to the Washington
 Monument where we rode the elevator to the top and then Ken wanted to walk down
the stairs.  They wouldn’t allow you to walk up the stairs - as it was too
steep and too many, but you could walk down.  I didn’t particularly want to
walk down them as we had been walking all over this area to see the sights, but
Ken was persistent.  He said he wanted to be able to say he had walked down the
steps at the Washington Monument.  I gave in, but about half way down, I wished
I hadn’t.  By the time we were at the bottom my legs, feet and whole body were
very tired.  Oh Well, we made it.  We then went over to the Smithsonian
Institute and to the Capital Building.  By then it was starting to get dark. 
We had been warned that it wasn’t safe to be out after dark so we caught the
next bus back to our hotel. We noticed as everyone was getting on the bus, that
they were all black.  As more and more got on, we began to get nervous.  Even
the bus driver was black, we were the only white people on the bus.  We started
praying silently for our safety and we did make it back to the hotel.  We went
across the street to a café to get us something to eat.  It was a great day. 
The weather was beautiful and it was fun being together and being in this
historic place.  The next morning we ate breakfast in the hotel and flew back
home.  I hated to see the time end.  I loved every moment of it and sure
enjoyed being with my wonderful husband</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While Ken was working for Hughes AirWest
Airlines, his manager was <b>Ron Shumway</b>.  Ken really liked Ron.  Ron was
really fair with his employees.  If he needed them to stay late or come early
because of deadlines they had to meet, he would compensate them by having them
take off early another day.  Ken really liked Ron and felt Ron was a great
manager.   However, because of politics in business, Ron was changed to another
department and they put an retired army Sergeant in as their manager.  He
expected way too much and wasn’t fair with them like Ron had been, so the moral
went rock bottom.  The Data Processing Department was about the only department
in their airlines who wasn’t union.  The men started talking about calling in
the union, but no one dared to do it.  Ken had an office where the others were
out on the floor in cubicles - so they would come in and complain to him. 
Finally, he said “alright, I’ll call in the union if you are all for it and
will stand behind me.”  They all said they would, so he called.  That was one
of the biggest mistakes Ken has made.  He loved his job with Hughes Air West
and had really built a reputation for himself.  He was very good at what he did
and would fly over to San Francisco at least once a month to meet with the
company people over there.   Well, as you might suspect, the men didn’t stand
behind Ken.  Someone went to the big bosses and told them that the union had
been called in.  They sent out notices that if anyone went to the meeting, they
would be fired.  Of course, they couldn’t do that, but they frightened these
employees into throwing away their cards and they didn’t attend.  The big
bosses started looking for the person who called the union.  It would have only
been a short time until they would have found Ken, so he quit his job.  Other
employees both at Phoenix and at San Francisco asked him what he was doing. 
They couldn’t believe he would do this when he had made such a name for himself
in the company.  When he explained what he did, they said “Well, it surely was
nice knowing you Ken”.  Ron had quit also as he was very unhappy the way the
company had dealt with him.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Hawaii in 1972 - Ken and Ron got to talking and said they
wished they had taken their wives to Hawaii before they had quit,</b> and Ron
said “Wait a minute, we can still do it as we have so much time before our
paperwork is done.”  He called and made the arrangements and he and Audrey and
Ken &amp; I flew to <u>Hawaii</u> and had a fantastic five days.  <b>This was
the last of April 1972</b>. We flew to San Francisco on Hughes Air West
Airlines and from there went on an American 747.  We enjoyed the flight over. 
We enjoyed being with Ron &amp; Audrey.  Since Ron &amp; Audrey were neighbors,
and in the ward with Larry &amp; Tammy, they had become good friends.  We all
went camping together several times, motor cycle riding and going out to eat
together.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>We saw the movie “What’s Up Doc” on the flight over.  We
stayed in a beautiful hotel on the beach.  That night we all walked along the
beach enjoying the beauty.  We had a balcony overlooking the ocean.  At night
in bed, I would watch the ships come in, watch the palm trees wave with the
breeze and listen to the doves and the sounds of the ocean.  I only slept maybe
an hour or two each night because I was too excited and thrilled to be in Hawaii
and I couldn’t stand to sleep and miss any of this beauty and wonder.  This was
the one special place in the world I’ve always wanted to go and never thought
I’d get the chance to go there.  The next day we rented a car and drove around
the island.  We bought pineapple at the pineapple fields.  We saw the sugar
cane, and banana trees, the beautiful ocean.  We had lots of fun finding
coconuts and trying to open them the way we’d been shown at the Pollyannaism
village.  That was a wonderful highlight going to the Pollyannaism Cultural
Center.  After going through the village and seeing all the different tribes
and what they do, eat and their way of life, we paid $10.00 to see the show
that night which was fantastic.  The costumes, dances, songs, etc., were rally
great.  We also visited a place where there were beautiful flowers, trees,
etc., as we walked along a path.  Then inside the building were lots of parrots. 
They would come and sit on your shoulder or arm.  They had told us to take off
our jewelry or the parrots would try to get them and they could hurt us.  Audrey
didn’t do so and the parrots attacked her for them.  She was so frightened, she
started screaming and running through the building to get out.  They presented
a show where trained parrots would walk a tight rope, ride a bicycle, throw
balls, etc.  We enjoyed that.  We ate at beautiful places where the food was
excellent.  We ate pineapple and papaya almost every meal and it was so good. 
We bought beautiful lays and visited the gift shops to buy souvenirs and gifts
for our children and parents.  We had a glorious three and a half days.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We swam on the beach night and
morning.  Ken and Ron decided to go surfing, so rented surf boards and away
they went.  Ken didn’t do so well, so he came back in.  Audrey asked where Ron
was as she couldn’t see him.  Ken decided he had better go see if he could find
him.  He finally did find him and thankfully he did (I’m sure the Lord was
guiding him) as he would have probably drowned.  He hadn’t worn his glasses out
and he lost his surf board and was swimming to shore.  He was getting really
tired and didn’t know if he could make it.  Ken told him, “What if it was a
ship you were seeing instead of the shore and the ship would get further and
further away.  Ken &amp; Ron took turns lying on the surf board while the other
held on to it and paddled toward shore.  They were sure relieved to get there
and so were we.   I’ve never had a more wonderful time than on that vacation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We arrived in San Francisco Friday
afternoon.  Ron knew the city as he had come many times on business trips so we
rented a car and he showed us part of San Francisco.  The next morning they had
to leave to come back, but Ken and I stayed.  We had a wonderful time being
together.   We drove to the wharf and just walked for awhile enjoying the
scenery.  We visited the shops, ate breakfast at a cute café, rode a trolley,
drove across Golden Gate Bridge, saw many beautiful places, then flew home.  We
flew to Hawaii for $15.00 each round trip.  Tammy tended our children while we
were gone and they had a good time playing with her children.  We took lots of
pictures, but our camera didn’t work, so these two are the only ones we have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Hawaii in 1972</b> with Ron &amp; Audrey Shumway (Ken’s
boss) just prior to both of them leaving Hughes Air West Airlines.<u> (I wrote
this up twice, but decided to add them both.)</u>  Ken was a computer
programmer for Ron.  They both went to Air-Research.  We had a wonderful five
days in Hawaii.  I had always wanted to go to Hawaii, but never really thought
I would be able to, that it was just a dream.  With Ken working for Hughes Air
West Airlines as a computer programmer, we had the privilege of flying for just
the cost of the service charge, which at that time was just $4.00 a person.  We
had to fly “standby” which meant if there was room on the plane after all the
passengers got on, we could go, but if not we would have to wait and try again
on the next flight.  I don’t remember a time when we had to wait.  It was so
great.  We flew up to either my parents in Utah, Ken’s parents in Idaho almost
every month.  We flew to Ken’s brother in Fresno also.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When both Ken and Ron decided they would leave
Hughes Air West (reasons in our history) Ken called me and asked if I would
like to go to Hawaii.  I was shocked, but excited and said “Yes, of course.” 
He said “Get packed, we’re leaving in two days”.  I called Tammy to see if she
could tend the children while we were gone and she was happy to do it.  I was
able to buy a dress to take to Hawaii, which looked Hawaiian and I loved it.  I
bought a necklace, bracelet and earrings to wear with it while in Hawaii.  Audrey
and I also got leis. We had a glorious few days in Hawaii.  People told me that
I would be disappointed as Hawaii was so commercialized, but I wasn’t
disappointed as it was everything I had dreamed it would be and much more.  We
rented a car and the lady drew on a map the places we should go to eat and the
ones not to.  She told us to go to the Polynesian Cultural Center, but not to
eat there as the food wasn’t that good and it was very expensive.  She told us
the sights to see and the ones to avoid as they were tourist traps.  Ron asked
if we could have the map and she gave it to us.  We were grateful as all the
places she told us to go to see and places to go and eat were just great!!!  We
went to beautiful gardens; we went to a place which is full of beautiful
parrots.  They told us to take off our jewelry as the parrots liked shiny
things and we could get hurt.  As we walked among the parrots, they started
flying at Audrey and landing on her and pecking at her.  She was very
frightened and started running to get away from them.  They didn’t bother the
rest of us.  The Polynesian Cultural Center was so great.  I enjoyed every
minute of it.  We were planning to go to a beautiful waterfall, but a storm had
knocked down trees which blocked the road.  One place where we ate was so great
and you could keep going and getting more food.  There was lots of sea food,
plus everything else for a great price.  Our hotel was located right on the
beach and several stories up.  We had a balcony and I couldn’t sleep as I
didn’t want to waste any of the precious time in Hawaii.  Ken was tired so fell
asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, but I would either go out and sit on
the balcony and watch the ships come in and the doves fly on the balcony or in
the palm trees which the tops were eye level with me, or I would get dressed
and go down to the main floor and watch the entertainment or go in the gift
shops or go outside and walk around.  That probably wasn’t very smart to go
outside by myself, but we didn’t think too much about it in those days. I
certainly wouldn’t dare doing it now.  We flew into San Francisco and Ken and I
spent another day there, but Ron had to get back to their family.  It was so
fun being there with Ken too.  We rode the trolley and I loved that and we saw
the Golden Gate Bridge, and had a fun day.  The next day we flew home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I have taken a weekend or two just about
every year to go somewhere by ourselves.  Sometimes we’d go to Salt
 Lake while living in Utah.  We’d eat out, go shopping, go to a movie, stay in
a motel and just enjoy being together.  Sometimes we would go to the zoo
instead of shopping.  We love our children and doing things with them, but we
feel it helps revive and strengthen our marriage to occasionally have a weekend
by ourselves<b>.  Elder LaGrande Richards of the Council of the Twelve</b>, performed
our wedding.  He is my dad’s second cousin.  He is such a great man.  He gave
us this council along with the council to have a weekly date, to speak kindly
to each other and that the marriage license gives us the right to kiss whenever
and wherever we please and we should do it often and express our love for each
other.  He also said to pray together each night - that if you are upset with
each other, you don’t feel like praying together.  This makes us have to make
up so we can pray together.  He told us to always do that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken is such a wonderful husband and father and
I’m so thankful for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and Ron were both able to get jobs with Air
Research, so we were thankful for that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After Ken was released from being a Sunday
School teacher, <b>he was called as Executive Secretary under Bishop Price and
then under Bishop Rice until his stake mission.</b>  He got discouraged serving
under Bishop Rise as he felt they resented his suggestions when they asked for
his opinion.  He felt this way because when he served in the Bishopric, he
gained much knowledge and experience and this bishopric were new so they asked
for his ideas and opinions, but after would seem cold and resentful.  Ken felt
he should be released as he was discouraged and unhappy.  I felt the problem
was a lack of communication so I talked to Bishop Rice myself explaining the
problem.  It was a lack of communication and there was a much better
association after that.  I hated to interfere, but felt it was necessary. 
Bishop assured me that it was my place to help solve a problem that involved my
husband.</p>

align=left hspace=12>We had many <b>friends in the Lehi 3<sup>rd</sup> ward</b>,
but our closest friends were <b>Jim and Maryon Frazer</b>, and <b>Deloy and
Lois Porter</b>.  We grew to love these two couples very much.  We did a lot
with Maryon &amp; Jim.  We would eat at each other’s homes, or play games and
visit.  We would go to the temple together and we went to the BYU Education
Week together and church education classes.  They had a daughter, Malinda, who
was a year younger than Shellie and a few years later, they adopted a daughter,
Pam.  Maryon &amp; Jim later moved to Springville, Ohio.  We visited them once
and had an enjoyable time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We’d go over to the Porters on Sunday evenings
after church or they’d come to our home, and we’d play Rook and eat popcorn and
other goodies, or we’d sing with Deloy as he played his guitar.  Lois and I
went shopping together and sewed together sometimes.  I always picked up Lois
to go to Relief Society.  Lois and Ken gave me a surprise Birthday party at her
home on the 28<sup>th</sup> of Dec. 1973.  The Smiths, Cooleys, Porters and Ken
&amp; I were there.  She made me a birthday cake and gave me a beautiful potted
plant.  We ate, played games, visited and had a good time.  The Fraziers had other
plans that they couldn’t get out of so they couldn’t be there.  After a few
years, Deloy &amp; Lois divorced and they have both remarried.  Lois is much
happier now.  Her &amp; Her husband live in American Fork, Utah.  She invited
me to go to Woman’s Conference with her at BYU one year and stay with them
overnight.  I did and we enjoyed being together again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken had been working for <b>Air Research</b> not
quite a year when our wonderful friend, <b>Larry Braithwaite, asked Ken to work
for him as the crew leader over the finish work in his construction business</b>. 
He made Ken such a good offer that we didn’t feel we could pass it up, plus Ken
wasn’t happy at Air Research because he always wants to do a full day’s work
for a full day’s pay and they didn’t have enough work for Ken to do.  Ken also
had a run-in with his boss, so he was glad to go, and his boss might have been
glad to have him go.  Ken made him look like a fool in front of others in a
meeting as he had done that to Ken earlier.  Ken was right, but if you want to
keep your job, you don’t do that to your boss.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Ken loves to do carpentry work anyway, and
Larry had made lots of money in his business and felt he could help us and Ken
could help him, with this offer.  Ken had been doing part-time work for Larry
off and on before this time.  Ken enjoyed the construction business and all
went well until again the bottom dropped out of the building industry again, at
least here in Arizona.  Interest went sky high and building materials and
lumber again went out of sight.  Larry’s work cut down until he had to lay off
all his men except Ken and his other three crew leaders.  At this point, we
were wondering what to do.  Whether Ken should try again to go back into Data
Processing, or to try and get his own license as a finish carpenter and go out
on his own.  Then, we felt an answer to prayer.   John Howard, Ken’s former
boss at Commercial Security Bank, called and asked if Ken would be willing to
come back to work as a supervisor over the data processing department on the
graveyard shift.  He said if we had any problem selling our home (since he
wanted Ken to start in two weeks) that the bank would help us.  They would pay
our way to move, etc.  Ken had been called as a stake missionary, which he had
always wanted to do, and was enjoying this very much, and we loved our new home
- so this was a hard decision to make.  But, we missed the association with our
families, we missed the mountains, Ken missed the Utah hunting and fishing - so
after praying, talking to the mission president and our Bishop, we decided to
make the move.</p>

and I a surprise farewell open house at our home the Sunday night after
Sacrament meeting.</b>  They invited all the ward members and many helped them
make cookies and they made punch and had a nice guest book for all of them to
sign for us.  It was really a surprise.  We were relaxing after meeting when
the Fraziers and Porters came and started making punch, etc., and soon the ward
members began coming.  It was really fun.  Many came, and we were really
touched by such thoughtfulness and wonderful friends. (Maryon is in pink in the
picture and Lois is in blue.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went to the temple regularly with the
Fraziers and then we’d eat out after or at least get a Sunday.  We also talked
them into going to Education Week with us, and they were really thrilled, as
were we.  They’d invite us to their home to eat occasionally or to come visit
and eat snacks.  We’d invite them also.  We shared a garden with them at their
place since they had two acres.  We invited the Fraziers and Caldwells to our
home for Christmas dinner.  They helped bring food.  We had a wonderful day.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Sandy</b> was 10 and 11 when we
lived in this home.  She was a sweet and obedient daughter.  She was such a
great “big sister”.  She would play dolls with Shellie, Mike &amp; David, play
school with them with her being the teacher, make up plays &amp; make costumes
for them.  Her and her friend, Lori, would many times do this when Larry, Tammy
were visiting us or we were at their home </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Shellie </b>was such a cute
little daughter.  She was so good that sometimes I didn’t give her the
attention she deserved.  Ken remembers how she was so stubborn and strong
willed when she was growing up.  I don’t remember her being that stubborn and
strong willed.  I know she was and usually that was good.  They say that we
should pray that our children will be strong willed so they can resist the evil
temptations of this world.  Most of the time, Shellie was a happy, contented
child - content to play with friends, siblings or by herself.   I remember one
day that she came to me and asked if I could make her a dress.  I had made Sandy
some clothes as she was older and guess I thought she needed them more than
Shellie.  I saw the yearning in her eyes - so I said “yes, and you can pick out
the pattern and material”.  She did and it turned out to be a really cute
dress.  She looked so cute in it and she was so proud of it, that it made me
feel bad that I hadn’t thought of it myself.              </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Mike and David</b> were so cute
too.  They were best buddies from the time David was born.  Oh, they had their
disagreements and battles as all children do, but for the most part, they
really enjoyed each other.  Here in Arizona they didn’t need friends because
they had each other.  The first Christmas when we lived in our new home on
Freeman, Ken build a sandbox for them.  We bought them each a big Tonka truck,
so that morning after we had opened our presents, they wanted to go outside to
play in the alley behind our home with their trucks.  It is nice weather in Arizona
in December so we said “sure”.  We were excited to see if they would notice the
sandbox.  Mike started out the door first and was heading right for the alley. 
David got out the door and spied the sandbox (it was in the far corner of our
lot) and it got so excited and headed for it.  He said “Mike, come over here”. 
When Mike turned around and saw David playing in the sandbox, he was really
excited too and ran as fast as he could to it.  They had lots of fun from then
on playing in that sandbox.  I’m sure Shellie and maybe Sandy played in it
too.   I remember Ken wrestling with the children.  They were so noisy that I
thought the roof would come off, but I loved it.  I loved seeing Ken playing
with the children and all of them having so much fun.  I have the greatest
husband and children in the world - at least as far as I’m concerned.  I
remember seeing David and Mike walking in Ken’s big shoes or boots.  I remember
seeing them riding around on their dad’s back as he gave them horsy rides.  He
wasn’t always a gentle pony, but a bucking bronco lots of times, and they loved
it.  Shellie and Sandy got rides too, at least Shellie. </p>

align=left hspace=12>In May of 1975 when I called Mom to let her know we would
be moving back to Utah, she was so excited and she asked if we’d like to rent
their old home in Sunset.  (The home I grew up in) as it was vacant right now. 
We decided this would be good as then we’d have a home to come to and we could
live there until we decided where we wanted to build or buy our home.  It was
exciting arriving in Sunset and showing the children the home and yard, the
park in back of our home, etc., and sharing with them the memories I had of
growing up and what I liked to do and where I would go, etc. Sometime later, I
took them for walks and showed them where my friends had lived and our other
good neighbors and friends.  The first Sunday when we went to church, the
people were so excited to have us in the ward as they remembered us and needed
us in the ward.  The ward has problems.  The members, it seems, just do what
they have to do and sometimes not even that much.  There’s not much enthusiasm
or the spirit that they should have.  <b>Sister Miskin</b> was the Relief
Society President and she asked the Bishop right away if I could teach in the
Relief Society so I was called to teach the Spiritual Living lessons.  I
enjoyed this calling and felt I learned a lot as the teacher always learns the
most.  They asked Ken to be the High Priest Group Leader.  We had wonderful
neighbors.  The <b>Thompsons</b> bought Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell’s home
after they passed away.  They remodeled the home as he was a carpenter.  They
were an older couple, but very wonderful people.  They were always bringing us
over some goodies.  Around Thanksgiving they brought us over a turkey as they
said they had been given three and they wanted us to have one.  <b>Belva
Provost</b> was Sandy’s lst year Beehive teacher in M.I.A. and a very wonderful
one.  In their class they picked a secret grandmother and Sandy picked Sister
Thompson.  She did special secret things for Sister Thompson during the year
and at the end of the year, they had a special night to honor their secret
grandmothers and when Sister Thompson found out that Sandy was her secret
granddaughter, she made a dip and drape doll for her.  It was really cute with
red hair, a yellow and white plaid dress and hat and a white apron.  Sandy was
really thrilled and it still sets on her dresser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our neighbors next to the Thompsons were <b>Ross
and Glenda Taylor</b>.  Glenda is Melba Miskin’s daughter and Melba lived next
door to them.  We enjoyed Ross and Glenda.  We went out to eat with them,
invited them to our home for dinner, went bike riding with them, etc.  Glenda
and I also worked on several projects and committees for ward activities. 
After about the third one in a row, she told her mother that she needed a rest
from them, as I always went all out and it was so much work.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            We became good friends with <b>Ralph &amp;
Belva Provost</b> and with <b>Ben and Linda Sisneros</b>.  The six of us would
go out to eat together and enjoy visiting.  They were wonderful people.  Sandy
and the Sisneros’s  daughter, Julie, were also good friends.  The only problem
with this friendship was that Ben was too strict.  He would say “No” before the
two children could hardly even ask him anything.  Julie couldn’t play with Sandy
very much when Ben was around.  I guess he thought she should stay home and not
play with friends.  Linda was better about that and would let them play when
Ben wasn’t home.  Linda and I would talk on the phone for an hour or more at a
time.  Whenever she called, I knew I would be on the phone for quite a while,
but she was really fun to talk to.  She is really talented.  She is an artist,
in fact, she painted me a picture that I really love.  She always does the
roadshows because she is so good.  She writes the script, paints the scenery,
designs the costumes, directs the roadshow and everything else.  She asked me
to be in the entre act along with several other women.  It was really fun.  She
made us a costume out of cardboard and painted them.  We carried them and stuck
our heads through.  I was the Shirley Temple doll. <b>Dorothy McKnee,</b>
(another good friend that we went square dancing with, her husband and Ben
Sisneros were counselors in the Bishopric) was another doll, Belva Provost was
the Raggedy Ann doll and Glenda Taylor was a little girl in it who was trying
to decide which doll she wanted to buy.  Linda is such a perfectionist that we
had lots of practices, but I really enjoyed it.  Linda also asked Ken and I to
be in a play that she was asked to direct for our wards Art Festival.  I was
the mother of the bride in the play.  Belva is very talented in drama so she
was the bride.  Her son was also in it, plus Ken and Ben and two other older
teenage boys who were also very good.  It was a hill billy play, and we really
had a ball practicing it and putting it on.  I was surprised that I could do
something like that as I’d never before had a main part in a play.  It’s
surprising what you can do if you try and ask the Lord’s help.  When we had the
Bushnell Reunion in May 1976, Mom asked if we could put this play on for them. 
The rest of the cast agreed and Linda felt it would be good experience for us
and so we did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Several years later, Ralph Provost passed away
and it was hard on Belva.  They were only able to have two children and Robin,
their daughter, married, but he wasn’t a good husband, so she divorced him.
Belva &amp; Ralph’s son became gay.  Belva would have been a wonderful grandmother,
but neither of her children had children.  I’m sure that is so hard on Belva. 
Belva moved to East Fruit Heights and became the mayor.  This picture shows her
in a parade as the mayor.  Her daughter, Robin, is in the DUP with me now in
2017.  She is a sweet lady, like her mother.  She became a school teacher, but
is retired now.  Ben Sisneros passed away also leaving Linda at an early age.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            <b>Mike, David and Scott’s bedroom used to be
my bedroom</b>.  It had a window that was over the roof of the porch of the
basement outside door.  Mike was 5 and David was 4.  I would put them down for
a nap and close the door.  I must have put Scott down for a nap in our
bedroom.  Anyway, a couple of hours later, I would hear them call out to me and
say they were awake and could they get up now.  I didn’t find out until after
they were married that soon after I would close the door, they would open the
bedroom window, climb out onto the porch roof and slide down the column posts
and run down to the part, which was just below the end of our lot.  They said
they would play there until they thought it had been long enough that I might
check on them, so they would run home, climb up the posts, open the window and
climb back into bed and then call out to me.  I’m not sure how I never checked
on them all that time.  Sure glad they didn’t get hurt.  Now days, if that
happened they might be kidnapped, but it was much safer in those days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I used to give our children an
allowance.  They had chores to do each day, but they were expected to do those
and help out as we were a family and worked together, but we knew they needed
some spending money, so we gave them a weekly allowance.   Mike and David have
always been “best buddies”, but they are very different.  One thing I will
point out here is how they deal with money.  David is a saver and Mike is a
spender.   They were this way even starting at this young age.  When they would
get their allowance, they would walk together over to the little store on the
corner.  Mike would spend all his money on candy, pop, ice cream or whatever. 
David would buy a few 2 for 1 penny candies and save the rest of his money.  A
couple of days later, Mike would want some more candy and he didn’t have any
money so he would ask David if he could borrow some money from him.  David knew
about interest, so he told Mike he would give him so much, but he had to pay
him more than he borrowed.  Mike agreed, so when they got their next allowance,
Mike had to pay David almost half of what he got.  Mike kept borrowing
practically every week, so he was always in debt to David and David kept saving
his money and making more from Mike.  They were both good to pay their tithing
first.  I remember when we were first teaching them about tithing and gave them
their allowance; Mike gave us most of his money and said it was for tithing. 
When we discussed it with him, he had thought he got to keep 10 cents and pay
the rest, instead of the other way around.  He was happy to learn that he got
to keep most of the money, but we thought it was neat that he had been willing
to give the 90 cents.</p>

align=left hspace=12>We got a beautiful dog - a white Spitz, named <b>Casper.</b> 
Sandy wanted a dog so bad.  She said she would even pay for it.  She was babysitting,
so earning some money.  Ken didn’t want one, but he finally made some
stipulations that if we could find a dog that was a female, had been spaded and
had the shots, was housebroken, a good dog and good with children, a good
watchdog, etc., etc.  He even said if it was white and didn’t cost much money -
then we could have it.  I went to a lady’s home in Clearfield sometimes to get
my hair done.  One day when I was over there, I saw her beautiful white dog and
commented on it.  She said “Do you know anyone who would like her?”  I asked
her why and she said they loved the dog and it was such a good dog, but they
lived by where the school kids passed on their way to school and the kids would
tease the dog and was making her mean.  She didn’t want that to happen so they
had talked about giving her away to a good family who would love her and take
good care of her.  The dog met all of Ken’s stipulations - so I told her we
would love to have her.  I did offer to pay $10 because they had paid a lot of
her and had her spaded, shots, etc.  I can’t remember whether Sandy paid the
$10 or me, but Sandy was so excited as were all of us.  Ken was really
surprised as he didn’t expect me to be able to find such a dog.  He grew to
love her too</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b> It is now July 1975 and we are
on vacation at Island Park in Idaho at Buttermilk Campground</b>.  It is so
beautiful &amp; peaceful here.  We have been here almost a week.  This weekend
we will enjoy being with relatives for the Robinson reunion here at Mac’s
lodge.   When we were setting up camp, David started calling me.  I looked
around and couldn’t see him.  He yelled “up here Mom, I’m up in the tree”.  I
looked up to where the sound was coming from and there he was up at the top of
a tall pine tree.  He was holding onto the top and swinging back and forth.  I
was really frightened as he was only about 3 or 4 years old.  I told him to get
back down and we went over to help him after he got almost to the bottom.  I
don’t know how he could have climbed that tree, but David was daring and loved
adventure.  Soon after that, he said he needed to go to the bathroom.  Shellie
was riding her bike and we asked her to take him to the bathroom.  Sometime
later, we couldn’t find David and asked Shellie where he was.  She said “I
don’t know”.  We found out she had taken him to the outhouse and then left him
there to go and keep riding her bike.  We became frightened as it was starting
to get dark.  We all went in different directions, calling him and frantically
looking for him.  Finally, a man came towards us holding David’s hand.  We were
so relieved to find him.  David said he came out and couldn’t find Shellie and
started walking to find us, but he had gotten lost.  He was frightened and
started to cry when the man had found him.  We were upset with Shellie for
leaving him, but so thankful he was alright</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>GRANDMA’S RASBERRIES (MY MOM’S)  (Put picture of her in
her raspberry patch)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My mother had a big raspberry patch and while we were living
here in Sunset, Mom asked if the children and I could come and help her pick
them.  I could have what I picked and she would pay the children for what they
picked, as she sold them in cases to her customers.  We would go early before
it got hot.  We also would eat as we picked.  We had a small bucket tied around
our waist with a small rope.  When the bucket was full, we would empty it into
baskets to form a case of raspberries.  Many times I would pick mine to make
jam and frozen raspberries for salads, but other times I would pick them to
help mom sell them to other people.  Mom would pay the children to pick them
for other people.  It was hard at times because the raspberries were so close
together and we would get scratched, sun burned, have spiders &amp; other
insects get on you, etc.  But it was also good to spend the time with
Mom/Grandma and visit with her as we picked.  They were delicious, big
raspberries so we sure enjoyed them too.  Dad picked them sometimes also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken was very discontent working for John
Howard at the Commercial Security Bank’s data processing center.</b>  John had
made several promises that he didn’t keep.  One, he told us that if we had any
trouble selling our home with having to move so quick, that the bank would
either make the payments for us, or buy it.  Well, they didn’t, and we did have
a hard time selling it.  Everything had tightened up in Mesa and Phoenix
as people were out of work and having to move (a big recession) so there were
so many homes for sale and people couldn’t afford to buy a new home.  Larry and
Tammy offered to try to sell it for us so they ran an add in two newspapers. 
Larry fixed up the yard after our other neighbor had let everything about die
out.  He was going to keep it up for us and then we would pay him, but I guess
he was too busy so it really ran down.  Larry suggested that we put up a nice
fence since so many of the people who looked at the home wanted a fence.  Ken
and I decided to go down and build the fence.  We enjoyed the visit with our
friends and the nice trip, but the fence cost us $700.00 which we really
couldn’t afford.  Time went on and the home still hadn’t sold.  We felt it was
really a burden on Larry and Tammy to have to keep up the yard when they lived
about five miles away, and to have to go back and forth to show people our home
- so we decided to list it with a realtor even though it meant that we would
lose more money because they would take out their commission.  We were having a
hard time financially since we were paying Mom and Dad $150.00 a month rent,
and still making $200.00 a month house payments on our home in Mesa. 
Ken talked to John to see if they wouldn’t make the payment or help us as he
had promised.  He finally got us what the interest payment would be on the home
for two months, but Ken practically had to beg him for that.  Time went on and
we didn’t know what we were going to do.  Finally the realtor called and made
an offer to buy it herself for rental property.  It meant that we would really
lose on the home.  In fact, the little bit that we would get would pay Larry
and Tammy for the money they had put into our home fixing it up and the ads in
the paper and the fence.  It also meant that we wouldn’t have a down payment to
put on another home for us here in Utah.  We were rally sick because we had
planned to have Ken build us a home on an acre of land.  We had even looked at
some land in Clinton.  With this Dilemma, Mom and Dad offered to let us buy the
home we were living in.  They had it appraised for $37,000.  That included the
apartments in back.  We really didn’t want the home because it was old and
would need new plumbing and wiring.  And the kitchen and bathroom needed to be
remodeled, and Ken had wanted a garage which this home didn’t have.  But, we
didn’t have a down payment and the folks would let us buy it for nothing down
and a lower interest that we could get on any other home, so we had about
decided to buy it.  Then Ken said one evening, “I just don’t want this home.” 
So, I said that we shouldn’t buy it then.  Mom and Dad were disappointed
because they wanted us to buy it for sentimental reasons and also that meant
that we would be living close to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken confronted John with breaking this promise
and also several others.  One was that Ken would only have to be the data
processing supervisor on graveyard shift for a few months or a year and then he
could move into the daytime programmers department.  Ken couldn’t sleep very
well during the day and it seemed to disrupt the whole family with his unusual
schedule.  I was always fixing meals it seemed.  I would fix breakfast for the
children, then Ken would come home from work and I’d fix breakfast for him. 
Then lunch for us, then Ken would wake up and I’d fix him lunch.  We’d be
hungry for supper and he wouldn’t. So we would stagger that or try to
compromise.  It was hard on my nerves trying to keep the children quiet while
he slept.  He couldn’t sleep very well, so he was cross a lot of the time.  Not
only from not getting enough sleep, but because he was unhappy at John.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Irven, Ken’s younger brother, was working for
Burrows company in Salt Lake and talked to <b>Gary Miles who owned a
programming company</b> and did work for the Burrows company, about Ken.  He
had Ken come down for an interview.  It went very well, and he said he’d let us
know.  On returning from our vacation at Island Park in Idaho, we found a message
that Gary had called and wanted Ken to return his call.  Ken did and got the
job.  We were really thrilled.  Ken commuted back and forth every day.  This
soon got tiresome as it was expensive for gas and it took away two extra hours
from the family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In July, just prior to our leaving for vacation
to Island Park, <b>Bishop Sid Sly</b> came to our home to talk with me.  He
said they were changing the primary presidency as Sister Holbrook had been in
for several years.  He asked if I would be the new <b>primary president</b>.  I
told him that Ken had changed jobs and was working in Salt Lake
now and we would probably be moving down to Salt Lake in the near future.  He
said he felt inspired to call me and that they would like me to hold that
position as long as I did live here.  I consented.  While on our vacation I
prayed and tried to decide on my counselors.  When I returned, I talked to Ben
Sisneros about my choices and he helped me decide.  (He was the counselor over
the primary).  I chose <b>Karen Bidwell as my first counselor and Kay Kendall
as my second counselor</b>.  Our secretary was sister Fern Beesley.  We visited
our teachers and decided on some others for classes without teachers.  We
decided to make cakes for the teacher’s birthdays and do some other projects. 
We held our presidency meetings the morning before primary.  I grew to love
these two counselors and I enjoyed working with them and the teachers.  We
bought our home in August, but had to wait until the last of October to have it
approved and the paper work done.  We moved the last of November.  My special
counselors and secretary bought me a darling <b>little ceramic doll.  It has a
green dress with pink flowers</b>.  I have it still today and cherish it.  I
have gotten many gifts from special friends, neighbors and those I served with
in the church and I keep them around my home to remind me of these special
people and they bring back special memories.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When the Bishop told <b>Sister Miskin</b> that I
would be released from the Relief Society to be President of the Primary, she
was very upset.  In fact, the Sunday that I was sustained, she walked out of
Sacrament Meeting at that time.  She told me afterwards that she felt that
anyone could be president of the primary, but only certain ones could be good
teachers in the Relief Society.  She said she told the Bishop that he might as
well release her if he was going to release me as I was one of the main ones
that kept the Relief Society going.  I don’t feel this way.  We are all
replaceable.   It was just that I enjoyed this position and I tried to do my
best as I try to in any position that I hold.  I know that if I do all I can,
the Lord will bless me and help me to magnify my callings.  I love the Lord and
love serving him and his children.  I had made posters and other visual aids
and handouts and I tried different methods such as panel discussions, handed
parts out or assigned things to other sisters and I did put a lot of time into
my lessons, which I guess some of the other teachers did not.  But, Sister
Miskin was overly dramatic about it.  I felt bad that she was resentful towards
the Bishopric for this change as there is always change and we have to trust in
the Lord that it is what he wants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was also the Sunday School Librarian in the
Sunset 2<sup>nd</sup> ward.  I enjoyed the ward and my friends and associations
there.  Judy Gebheim was in the Relief Society Presidency and also P.T.A.
President.  Judy and I have been good friends ever since she and Hendrick
(Ken’s best friend growing up) were married.  When Hendrick was killed in a
truck accident, she married Dennis Gebheim a year later.  He isn’t a very good
husband or father, but Judy still stays with him.  They moved to Sunset so I
was glad to be reunited with her.  She asked me to be the Safety Chairman in
the P.T.A.  President Petersen of our Stake Presidency was the principal of the
elementary school.  I enjoyed this position although it was a lot of work and
took a lot of time.  One of my responsibilities was to carry out Safety Week.
We had contests, showed films, had bike safety courses and I gave the teachers
several suggestions to do during that week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was released as Primary President, prior
to our moving, they put in Karen Bidwell, my lst counselor as the president. 
Her husband wasn’t very active, but he supported her.  Karen is a bubbly
talkative person.  We’d usually be on the phone for long periods of time when
I’d talk to her, but I enjoyed it.  Karen was also my Relief Society visiting
teaching partner.  She wasn’t afraid to go the extra mile either which also
made me want her for my counselor.  Soon after we moved to Taylorsville, the
Sunset 2<sup>nd</sup> ward bishopric was changed.  The new bishop was Mel
Wood.  He called and asked our family to come and speak in the ward.  We did so
and were happy to see everyone again.  Whenever we go back to a former ward,
the members always treat us so good and act so happy to see us.  We’re thankful
for these people and the things we have learned from them and the experiences
we have had.  When we moved, the Sunset Stake President, President Rock told us,
when we saw him at a wedding reception, that we weren’t supposed to move
because <b>they had Ken in mind for the new bishop</b>.  Also, President
Peterson had told me that, when I was at the elementary school.  Other members
of the ward also expressed that same thought.  I feel Ken would have been a
bishop by now if we hadn’t moved so many times.  He probably would have been in
the Mount Fort Ward because our stake president there, Pres. Wimmer had told us
about that same thing when we were moving from there.  He could have been in Clearfield also because he was serving as lst counselor when we moved to Mesa.  When
Bishop Rees was released and Bishop Opie was put in as Bishop of the Lehi 3<sup>rd</sup>
ward in Mesa, we were talking with him at his daughter’s wedding breakfast in
Salt Lake and he said he surely would have asked for Ken to be his counselor
had he still been in the ward, and that he had a hard time choosing his
counselors.  Ken feels that the Lord probably knows that he shouldn’t be a
bishop and that’s one reason why we keep moving.  I don’t feel that way; I feel
Ken would make a wonderful bishop.  He says he doesn’t have enough patience
with the members, but then maybe he would learn more patience.   Although, it’s
fine with me if he isn’t called to be a Bishop as it is a very demanding
position and it would be hard on Ken, me and the family (although I know the
Lord blesses you also).    Ken is a very wonderful and spiritual person and
whether or not he ever becomes a bishop, I feel he is worthy and I’m sure
thankful for him and for the example he sets for me and our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had lived in Arizona for three years before
moving back to Utah. While living in Sunset, <b><u>David had another problem
with his health</u>.</b>  He again didn't have much energy so I called Dr.
Swanstrom as I wondered if David was low on iron again.  It is interesting that
we have had David's blood tested by other doctors and they say his blood is
normal.  We know better because he isn't healthy and when we send a spernum (I
think that's what Dr. Swanstrom called it - the test by saliva) Dr. Swanstrom
would say he was low and would send more iron and magnesium up and he would get
well again.  This time Dr. Swanstrom told me that David had a film growing over
his white cells and he would send hydrochloric acid up and to follow his
directions carefully.  I asked him what the problem was and he said that David
could literally starve to death - that with this film over his white cells, he
couldn't assimilate the food.  He could eat wonderful food, but it wouldn't do
him any good.  I was worried and Dr. Swanstrom said he felt this would dissolve
the film and he would be ok.  He did tell me to send a spernum from David just
shortly before we finished giving him all of it.  It came in a bottle with a
dropper.  We were to put so many drops of it into half a glass of water each
day.  Dr. Swamstrom told us the seriousness of it as people had died of this. 
He said the spernum would tell whether the film was dissolved and if it wasn't,
he would send up another bottle, but all he could have David take was two
bottles.  If that didn't work, he didn't know what else to do.  We sent the
first spernum down and it hadn't dissolved the film so Dr. Swanstrom sent the
2nd bottle up.  I prayed constantly that this 2nd bottle of hydrochloric acid
would dissolve it.  When we sent the next spernum down, he called and said it
was dissolved and David should be fine.  Boy, were we ever grateful to him and
the Lord.</p>

align=left hspace=12>We began looking at home in the Salt Lake area.  It was
really discouraging because we couldn’t afford the size home that our family
needed.  And, they wanted so much for just “dumps.”  Ken’s parents said that
they would loan us the money we needed for the down payment.  Bob &amp; Carroll
went with us one Saturday.  We had looked all day and were tired and
discouraged.  We were ready to go home when Bob said “Let’s just look at this
one more home that we’ve circled in the paper.  As we were going there, we
passed a new housing division.  In the window of the model home it said 7 ½ %
interest.  Interest was now going for 8 ½ and 9 % so we decided to stop and
look.  The homes were really nice.  This one was a split level, carpeted
throughout except the kitchen.  The kitchen had build-ins, beautiful cupboards,
etc., a nice fireplace in the front room, a double garage.  When we asked the
price, he said “$30,800.”  We were so excited, as the other homes that were not
nearly this nice without garages and fireplaces, were a lot more.  We bought
one of these homes.  We had looked at a home the week before in Rose Park
(North West of Salt Lake) It was really too small for our family, but it had
been kept up nicely and was very clean.  It had a full basement unfinished and
it was fenced.  We didn’t like the area too well, but felt it was the best we
had looked at so far for the money.  We fasted and prayed about it over the weekend
and on Monday we decided to make an offer.  The realtor called us back later
and said the home had been sold over the weekend.  We were disappointed, but
felt like maybe it was meant to be because we had prayed about it.  <b>When we
found this home in Taylorsville, we knew the Lord had guided us to it.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>While in Taylorsville, David's foot
had kept turning in and so it was hard for him to walk, let alone run.  I
remember seeing him coming home from school one day with his head drooped
down.  Kids had been making fun of him because of the way he walked.  Kids can
be so cruel.  I again really got down on myself for not heeding the warning of
the Holy Ghost so that David had to go through all this.  It hurt me terribly. 
I thought why should this special child of mine have to suffer so much because
of me.  I kept praying that somehow we could find someone who could help David.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we were living in Erda, a good friend of
ours, Harvey Russell, told us to take him to a doctor in Midvale.  This doctor
wasn't a Chiropractor, but something like that.  Harvey told us that he had
helped him and that people came all over to him.  We got an appointment and I
drove David in.  This doctor worked on David's sciatic nerve and it was so
painful for David.  David is strong and can take a lot of pain, plus he doesn't
give in to pain, but I could see from the terrible expressions on his face and
the wrenching he was doing, that it was terrible.  When I took him to the next
appointment, David was begging me not to take him there.  I thought we should
try again if Harvey thought he was so good.  Well, that was the last time I
took him there.  It was even more painful than before and I could hardly stand
to watch him torture David, and that's what I felt he was doing.  This doctor could
see how tensed up I was - so he told me to sit on the table and he would limber
me up.  I did, and his fingers were so strong and powerful that he really hurt
me - and I didn't have anything wrong with me.  When the sciatic nerve is
damaged, it is so painful, and here this doctor was working on David's like it
was a piece of hamburger.  When we got in the car, I told David I wouldn't ever
bring him here again.  At home, I told Ken about it and I said &quot;if you
feel strongly enough that he should go there again, you'll have to take him as
I won't.&quot;  I told him that I couldn't stand to watch him being tortured
like that.  Ken told me he didn't think it was worth it to put David through
that either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike and David played on the &quot;T&quot; ball
team in Erda.  I remember at one game, David was up to bat, he hit the ball,
but not very far.  He ran for 1st base, but he couldn't run very fast because
of his club foot.  The 1st baseman missed the ball and David made it to first. 
Each time he would go to run, they would fumble the ball and David would make
it to the next base.  He ended up making it to Home.  A woman who was standing
next to us, but didn't know us, make the remark &quot;Someone up there (&amp;
pointed to Heaven) loves that little guy&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Soon after this incident, my mother heard about
a Dr. Coleman at the University of Utah Hospital who was the best orthopedic
surgeon in the western united states.  She heard that you have to have another
doctor make the appointment for you to get in to him.  We talked to our doctor
and asked if he would do this for us.  He agreed and soon we were in Dr.
Coleman's office.  He examined David and told us that there were only two
alternatives.  The first alternative would be to operate, and it would take two
operations.  The first would be to cut the tendons in his arch to release it so
his foot could straighten out (I'm not sure what all they had to do) and the
2nd operation, which would be after he recovered from the first operation,
would be to take the tendon out of his big toe and put it in his heel - so he
could move his foot up and down.  He told us David would have therapy and learn
how to walk with his foot this way, but it would correct the problem.  He said
the big toe would be straight and he wouldn't be able to bend it or move it up
and down, but that would be minor compared to the correction of his club foot. 
He said the other alternative would be to do nothing and he would soon be in a
wheelchair and remain in a wheelchair the rest of his life.  Of course, we did
not want this alternative so we agreed to the operations.  They were
successful, thanks to Dr. Coleman and the Lord.  I am so thankful to the Lord,
that we eventually were able to correct this problem so David could have a
normal healthy life.  When I would see him walking the wooden rail fence in
Erda, climbing trees, etc., I would be so grateful to the Lord for answering
our prayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I will share a couple of incidents relating to
these operations.  Ken and I would take turns staying at the hospital with
David.  I would stay during the day and Ken would stay at night and sleep in
the recliner they had in his room.  One night Ken told David that he would just
walk me out to the car and be right back in.  I guess David thought his dad was
taking too long and he was going to go find him - so he hobbled out of bed and
saw a wheelchair just outside his room.  He got in it and started going up and
down the halls looking for his dad.  When Ken came in and found that David was
not in his bed, he called to a nurse to ask about David.  She got excited (or
worried) and started frantically looking for him and asking other nurses.  They
soon found him in the wheelchair, and he got a talking to from the nurses and
doctor.  I don't think Ken said too much since David had already been chewed
out - except that he was really worried about him.  We laugh about it now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At home, David told Mike about how neat it was
at the hospital - that you could choose any meals and deserts you wanted and
you could choose frosted flakes for breakfast and it would come in tiny boxes. 
He also liked watching cartoons on TV from his bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken brought David home from the hospital after
his second operation.  I was at a neighbor's getting my hair done.  Ken was
managing the regional stake farm in Erda and we had a horse named Cocoa.  David
had missed ridding Cocoa and asked his dad if he could ride it.  Ken agreed and
took him out and put him on the horse.  Scott wanted to ride also, so Ken put
Scott on back behind David.  Ken told David to just ride around carefully and
he would come take them off in a few minutes.  Well, David is daring and he saw
a pile of dirt - that was a little hill and decided to ride up and down on it. 
As he did so, Scott started sliding off and since he had his arms around David,
he pulled David off with him.  Ken heard them crying and went to see what was
the matter.  David said his arm hurt really bad.  Ken looked carefully at it,
but didn't think it was broke so took them into the house.  David continued to
cry - so Ken decided he better take him back to Primary Children's Hospital. 
When he walked into the hospital, the same nurse who wheeled David out to the
car when they left a couple of hours earlier, asked what he was doing back
there with David.  He said he fell off our horse and might have broken his
arm.  She was surprised, but said she would have the doctor look at it.  He did
and said he didn't think it was broken, but they had better X-ray it to be
sure.  The x-ray showed it was cracked - so they put a cast on his arm.  Now he
had a cast on his leg and a cast on his arm.  When I came home from getting my
hair done and asked the children where Dad &amp; David were and they said dad
had to take David back to the hospital, I was really worried.  I wondered what
the teachers and parents thought when they saw David with casts on both his arm
and leg.  He had to learn to write with his left hand, but he did get lots of
attention and help as kids would run to open the doors for him since he was on
crutches.  David was in the second grade at this time.  His teacher came to the
house to tutor him some before he was able to go to school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The following year, when we went to David's
parent/teacher conference, his teacher talked to us about David and said he
seems really despondent - that he doesn't play with the kids or on the
playground at recess, he just sits on the steps and watches them.  She said he
seems like he is day dreaming as he doesn't get his work done and wasn't doing
very well in school.  She asked if he had had a physical lately and had his
blood tested.  That clued us in.  We called Dr. Swanstrom down in Scottsdale
and sent him a spernum from David.  He called us back saying his iron,
magnesium, etc., were really low again and he would send them up to us.  A few
weeks later, David's teacher called us and asked if I could stop by.  She told
me that never in her 28 years of teaching had she seen such a dramatic change
in a child.  He was now at the top of his class and seemed excited about
learning.  At recess he played with the kids and seemed to have lots of
vitality and energy.  She had asked David if he was taking medicine or
something and David told her he was taking iron and other vitamins.  She had
gone down and spoken with the school nurse and asked if it could be possible for
a child to change that much with just taking iron and vitamins.  The nurse told
her &quot;yes&quot; - that it could make a big change.  She has seen a child's
IQ go up a lot when they got on the proper nutrients.  She was really excited
to see the change in David.  I guess it had come on so gradually, that Ken
&amp; I hadn't noticed the problem.  We were surely glad she had brought it to
our attention.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            <b>Sandi and Shellie</b> were good friends
growing up.  Sandi was a good big sister to Shellie, Mike &amp; David.  She
would make things for them to play with, she would play school with them,
Barbies with them - Mike &amp; David thought this was great fun at times also. 
They thought Sandi was great.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The main problems Sandi &amp; Shellie had was
when Sandi got to be a teenager and wanted to be with her friends more. 
Shellie would tease Sandi - wanting attention, and Sandi would get out of
patience and they would start fighting.  Shellie was very stubborn and wouldn't
give up even though she was getting the worse of it since her big sister was 5
½ years older than her.  I would come in and break it up, but before I got out
the door, Shellie would be back to fighting as she wouldn't give up.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Sandi got married at the age of 17, Shellie
was devastated.  She only had one sister and now that sister was leaving her. 
She disliked Dave for taking her sister away from her.  I didn't realize how
hard it was on Shellie until years later.  Sandi didn't either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Shellie</b> was content as a child.  If she
had cousins, friends or her brothers or sister to play with, it was fine and
she had a good time, but she was also happy playing by herself.  When she was
between the ages of 2 and 4 years old, we lived in Clearfield.  The stairs
going down into the basement were by the back door of the kitchen.  Shellie
would play on the stairs with her toys for hours while I worked in the kitchen
cleaning or preparing meals.  She was that way as she continued through youth
and adolescence.  She loved to put puzzles together and read.  She read about
every Jack Wayland, Blain &amp; Brenton Yorgenson &amp; Gerald Lund
book their was.  (They are &quot;good&quot; books).  If I needed Shellie and
couldn't find her, I would go to her room and she was usually there reading or
putting puzzles together.  She also loved to listen to good music or play the
piano.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I've talked about Shellie being stubborn - or
strong willed.  Ken &amp; I were concerned that we might have problems with her
when she became a teenager - but we didn't have to worry.  She had gained a
testimony of the gospel and was very strong in choosing right from wrong.  She
has said many times since, that she always felt like she had to pull her
friends along and keep urging them to do the things they should be doing.  I
remember when she was in High School in Grantsville that some boys would go
behind the girls and pinch them.  It only happened once to Shellie.  Mike told
us that Shellie whirled around and smacked the kid so hard that he fell against
the lockers and hit his head.  He, nor any other boy, ever tried pinching her
again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             A boy, who had a crush on her, wanted to take
her to a school dance, but she wouldn't turn 16 for a couple of weeks.  Shellie
&amp; I were in the car and he came over and asked me if Shellie could go with
him to this dance.  I told him that Shellie wasn't 16 yet.  Some girls would
have been upset that their Mom wouldn't let them go when their birthday was
that close, but not Shellie.  She told me that she would have been upset with
me if I had told him she could, even though she liked the boy and would have
liked to have gone had she been 16.  I was very proud of her then and I always
have been. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another boy wanted to date her, but she wouldn't
consider going out with him because he would go on &quot;beer parties&quot;,
etc.    He told her one day that she didn't have any fun - that she wouldn't go
to parties and drink or smoke, that she wouldn't &quot;make out&quot; with guys
and that she wouldn't even watch &quot;R&quot; rated movies.  She said &quot;I
have more fun than you do and I don't have to wake up with a hangover the next
morning.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It has been fun going to the children's games,
activities, plays, recitals, etc. throughout the years.  Even though it took a
lot of my time to go to these events, I loved every minute of it.  I feel sorry
for parents who don't support their children in the things they do, they hurt
their children, but they hurt themselves as well - by missing out on all the
joy and happiness it brings and the closeness to their children.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            <b>Sandi</b> took <b>tap dancing lessons</b>
for four years (ages 4-8) when we lived in Ogden.  Our neighbor, Pat Wiggins,
was the teacher. <b>We started Sandi on the</b> <b>piano</b> soon after, and
found she really had a talent for music.  She took longer than the other
children because she enjoyed it and practiced without being told to.  We put
her with an advanced teacher when we lived in Sunset and she did really well. 
From the time she was 12 years old, she has been a Pianist or organist for most
organizations.  Sunday School, MIA, Primary and for Sacrament Meeting.  When we
lived in Erda, Connie King was over the Tooele County Beauty Pageant and had
Sandi play for it.  After she was married, Dave's grandmother was the organist
and had Sandi substitute for her several times.  She was also the pianist for
Relief Society in her ward.  I always enjoyed hearing Sandi practice the
piano.  She also played for us, as a family, while we sang at Family Home
Evenings, Family Christmas parties, etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            With her <b>talent of art,</b> she painted
scenery for road shows in MIA, made posters, etc., for other organizations. 
Both her and I felt they took advantage of her good nature many times - because
people would ask her at the last minute to do art projects for them, and hardly
say &quot;thank you&quot; afterwards.  I was proud of her for willingly giving
of her time and talents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sandi has many talents.  She won dance contests
in school. After her girls started taking dance lessons, their instructor asked
Sandi to help her teach.  She did, and eventually took over the dance school. 
She further developed her talent in dancing by making up dance steps &amp;
routines to teach her students, designing and sewing dance costumes, putting on
dance recitals and accepting invitations for her and her classes to dance at
church, community &amp; other functions.  She was very successful as a dance
teacher and later on, JaNae, her oldest daughter, taught also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dave encouraged her to take oil painting
lessons, which she did.  She paints beautiful scenery and animal pictures  She
has won awards at fairs.  She has given each of her brothers &amp; sister a
beautiful oil painting for their weddings.  She has given Ken &amp; I several
and we love them.  She has painted on canvas, saw blades, cupboard doors, etc. 
Friends and others have asked her to paint pictures for them or to give as
gifts, so she has sold several paintings.  I loved to go to her home in
Grantsville during the different holidays because she usually had painted a
cartoon holiday scene on her front window.  A restaurant owner in Grantsville
asked her to paint a &quot;50's&quot; mural on his walls and he would pay her. 
She did and it was really cute.  She painted a girl with pony tail, full felt
skirt complete with &quot;poodle&quot;, bobby socks &amp; penny loafer <img

align=left hspace=12>shoes sitting at a counter sipping a drink through straws
which her and her boy friend shared.  She painted a jute box, etc.  She has
painted a beautiful landscape picture for Ken &amp; I. (This is the picture) 
She also painted pictures for her grandparents, and her brother’s &amp; sister
as they get married.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            She also did a beautiful cross-stitch of a deer
jumping over a log.  She made it for her dad for Father's Day.  She had told
Dave she would make him one also, but it took so long - that this one was all
she made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Mike and David</b> were different
personalities, but, for the most part, they were &quot;best friends&quot;. 
Mike took more after the Brownings and was stockier like his dad &amp; grandpa
Browning.  David was thinner and took after the Porters.  Mike is red headed
and David, Brunette.  Mike was soft hearted and just a cross word from us, when
he was little, would bring him to tears. But, not David, even when David was
being spanked, he wouldn't cry, even though it hurt.  David was more stubborn
and more daring than Mike, and so it was interesting to watch them together. 
Since David would dive off the high diving board when very young, Mike didn't
want to be outdone by his little brother - so he would do it also even though
he probably would rather not have done it.  David would climb the highest
trees, walk fences, go cave exploring and hiking, etc., and Mike would follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike was more cunning than David, however, as he
would think of things to do that were sometimes dangerous - like making a bomb
at the farm in Grantsville and then telling David to light it.  Mike would run
and hide.  David did light the makeshift bomb and was blown against the shed
with his eye brows and eye lashes burned.  It was a wonder that he wasn't hurt
more seriously.  The shed was shaking and Mike saw us coming up the road - so
he said to David &quot;Here comes Dad &amp; Mom, help me hold the shed and try
to stop it from shaking&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In Grantsville, they made a tote goat together
from a lawn mower motor Mike &amp; David bought from Mike's friend, Larry. 
They had a ball with this tote goat.  I even had a few rides on it.  They built
a tree house together down the lane from our home in Grantsville.  They built a
&quot;hut&quot; on the farm.  I can't remember if it was a one story or two
story.  It seems like it was a two story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike &amp; David had their share of fighting -
like all brothers do.  When they would wrestle, it was fun to watch because
first Mike would be on top, as he was the biggest, but then David would be on
top because he was the fastest and because he was stubborn, he wouldn't give
up  So it was usually a tie - both getting so tired that they would both give
up.  However, sometimes, it turned out to be a fight and they would both be so
angry that Ken or I would have to break them up.  I didn’t like to see that
happen.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember soon after we moved to Grantsville,
taking Mike &amp; David to school and telling them we would pick them up after
school.  When we drove up, we saw a bigger, older boy beating on Mike.  I was
upset and ready to open the car door and run over to help Mike, but Ken saw
David coming out the school door and seeing what was going on with his
brother.  Ken stopped me and said &quot;watch David&quot;.  I did and David's
eyes got wild like a tigers and he ran as fast as he could over to the boy and
jumped on his back, kicking and clawing at him like a wildcat.  The older boy
didn't know what had happened to him, but as soon as he could get David off his
back, he ran for home.  It was neat to watch that.  Maybe David could fight
with Mike, but no one else better as he would defend his brother - like no one
I've seen before would, and Mike would do the same for David.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike had a temper and would sometimes have
temper tantrums.  When we lived in Arizona the first time and lived in our
first home, he was about 3 or 4.  When he would start yelling and screaming, I
would put him in his room and tell him he needed to stay there until he could
calm down.  He would scream even louder and kick the door.  I was afraid the
neighbors would think I was beating him.  I remember one time I was telling him
that Heavenly Father would be disappointed in the way he was acting and that he
was making Satan happy.  He yelled “I don’t care, I want to make Satan happy.” 
When we moved over into our newer home a couple of blocks away, I was in the
primary presidency and we were having our presidency meeting at my home.  Mike
had gotten himself in trouble and I had him sitting on a chair when they came. 
After a while one of the ladies said “How come your son is sitting so long and
so quietly on that chair, is he being disciplined?   I said “yes”.  She said
“How do you get him to sit there without trying to get off, my children won’t
do that.”  I said “He knows if he gets off, he will be in more trouble so he
knows he can’t get off until I say he can.”  Soon, I went over to Mike and
talked to him and we hugged and he got off and went off to play.  That was one
of the main ways I disciplined the children when they were young.  When Mike
&amp; David were about 9 &amp; 10, they were fighting so I had one sitting on
the couch and the other in the big stuffed chair.  I went in the kitchen to fix
supper and I heard them laughing.  I went in to see what they were doing, and
they were both mostly off their seats and were trying to touch each other with
their feet and still have part of their bodies on the seats.  I scolded them
and made them sit up again.  Wow! They were a challenge sometimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also counted to 5 when the children didn’t quickly obey. 
They knew they better be moving by the time I reached 5.  They jokingly tell me
now that as I got close to 5 and they were not moving, that I would say 3 ½, 4,
4 ½ , etc.  I DON’T THINK SO!  Another thing I tried was pinching them on the
shoulder blades.  I had read in a book (I read a lot of parenting books) that
if children don’t obey when you ask them once, don’t ask or tell them again,
just go to them and pinch in a certain spot (which they showed) and it brings
pain, but no damage to them.  They didn’t like that and I don’t think I used it
very often.  I also tried many positive methods – they could put marbles in
their jar when they did something good for someone else or obeyed quickly,
etc.  We had different reward systems.  What works for one child doesn’t always
work for another, so it was a challenge, but they were basically good kids and
I loved them and usually always enjoyed being with them.  Some mothers would be
so happy when the summer was over and the children had to go back to school,
but I was sad as I enjoyed having my children at home with me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I had <span style='font-size:14.0pt'>“<b>Their
day”</b></span> for each of the children where I would spend at least an hour
or more with them on a one-on-one doing what they wanted to do.  With my sons,
sometimes I would play marbles, or go insect exploring, bike riding, going to
get an ice cream, etc.  With the girls, I would play barbies, go bike riding, go
for ice cream, etc.  I enjoyed these times as much as the children did.  It was
relaxing and I could enjoy that child and we could visit and have fun
together.  I wanted them to know how much I loved them and that they were
special.  I would work it out so the others were playing together or one of
them tending the younger ones while I was with another.  I got this idea from a
lady in the Mt Fort Ward during Relief Society.  She was doing it with her
children and they loved it, so I wanted to incorporate it into our children’s
lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Mike would get upset with Ken or I, he
would say <b>“I’m going to run away”.</b>   When he was a little guy and we
lived in Arizona, we didn’t have a fence and there was a big field behind our
back yard.  About halfway in that field, they had a big tall sign. When Mike
wanted to run away, I would say to him:  “You can run as far as that sign, but
you can’t go any further.”  You can stay as long as you want and then come back
home.  He would run as fast as his little legs could carry him down to that
sign.  He would stand by that sign for a few minutes to cool off and then come
trudging back home.  He had learned to obey, so I was able to trust him as
there was a busy road on both the south and especially the west sides of that field. 
I would have been worried if he wouldn’t have stayed there.  If he had
disobeyed, I wouldn’t have let him go there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we lived in Grantsville, he again would get
mad as he felt we always blamed him when there were problems or him and the
other children were fighting.  He is such a good kid, but he was a tease and he
usually did start it.  He would want to run away again.  I told him he could go
as far as the corrals, which were at the north end of our property, so probably
a third or half mile away.  I was thankful he was obedient then also.  When we
lived in Firth, Idaho, I only remember him running away once.  He was 16 &amp;
17 when we lived there.  I realized he had gotten mad and had taken off through
the back of our property.  I was worried about him as I didn’t know where he
would go so I took off after him.  I met up with him and we talked and worked
it out as we walked back home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike has always loved “toys” and sometimes he
would talk David into going in with him to buy something “neat”.  It’s fun to
see the two different personalities, and yet to see how close they have been
throughout the years.  I guess that’s true of mine and Ken’s moms.  They are so
different in every way except for their love for their children and the Lord. 
And, yet, Ken and I are really compatible.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>            We have enjoyed our little <b>Scott.</b>  He
was such a cute little guy and very good natured.  He was his father’s shadow
in Erda.  The other kids were in school and Scott loved to be with his dad so
Ken would take him about everywhere that he could.  He would take him with him
to Salt Lake when they went for parts and they would stop for ice cream on the
way back.  One time when they went to the John Deer place for parts for Ken’s
tractor, they had a small tractor that children could ride.  Scott got on in
and loved it.  Ken wished he could afford to buy it for him – but he couldn’t. 
The man looked at Scott and said “I bet your dad calls you Scotty Skaboo.” 
Scott was so surprised and asked Ken when they got in the truck to go home “How
did he know that you call me that?”  Ken also took Scott with him when he used
the tractor to disk, plow, bail hay, etc., as it was a beautiful closed in cab
with air conditioning, etc.  Scott would ask his dad to tell him stories and he
would tell him the stories of  “Goldilocks and the Three Bears”, “Three Little
Pigs”, “Red Riding Hood”, etc.  Ken would, on purpose, tell them differently
some times, and Scott would say “Dad, it doesn’t go like that” and Ken would
laugh and ask him how it went.  Scott would follow Ken as he went to feed the
animals, etc.</p>

align=left hspace=12>School soon after<b>.  Irven &amp; Sandy (Ken’s younger
brother &amp; sister-in-law) were also looking for a home and when they saw
ours, they also bought one just around the corner from us.</b>  It was fun having
them so close.  The Sunday that Sandy was sustained as organist in the Jr.
Sunday School, Sandy (Irven’s wife) was sustained as Laurel teacher in the
M.I.A.  When he asked for Sandra Browning to stand up, both Sandy’s stood up. 
He looked confused and then realized that both of their names were Sandra
Browning, so he said for Sandra Lee Browning to remain standing.  Both remained
standing as both were Sandra Lee Browning.  He was really taken in and so were
the ward members.  We had to chuckle at it.  He finally asked for the oldest
Sandra Lee Browning to remain standing, so our Sandy sat down.  After he
sustained the older one, he asked our Sandy to stand and he sustained her.  I
am also a visiting teacher and district leader in the Relief Society.  We have
enjoyed these positions very much. Ken goes home teaching to the Bishopric’s
families and also loves this.  Our neighborhood is great, the area is great,
the ward and ward leaders are terrific and we really have enjoyed it here.  We
finished a room in the basement for Sandy and have started to make a room down
there for Mike and David.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our children have adjusted well here in Taylorsville, although Mike had a hard time at first.  I can remember taking him to school
and it was hard leaving him there as he was scared and shy.  I came over some
times at noon and found him sitting on the curb of the sidewalk by himself with
his head in his hands.  My heart would about break to see him so sad and
lonely.  I had a friend in the ward that had a son Mike’s age so we got them
together.  That helped some.  David has three little friends in this area,
Shellie has one and Sandy doesn’t have any in Harrisonwood, but there are two
other girls her age in the ward.  She enjoys them, but has had some problems
with them.  They tend to “use” her.  They’re friendly to her and do things with
her until someone more popular comes along, then they ignore her.  The one
girl’s name was <b>Sharon Larson</b>.  Her mother and I were good friends.  Sandy
is too sweet to get very upset with them or tell them off.  She did have some
good times with them.  Sandy has a great MIA teacher, and the adults in the
ward all want her to babysit for them because she is so responsible and loves
children.  She has plenty of opportunities here as it is a young ward.  Sandy received her patriarchal blessing in May.  It’s a beautiful blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            (1999 - Boy, was I wrong.  I said our children
adjusted well here in Taylorsville.  I really thought they had, but I have
found out years later that it was really hard on especially Sandi and Mike. 
David didn’t like it that much either.  Shellie hasn’t said much.  Guess
sometimes we don’t perceive how our children really feel.  I thought I talked
to my children and were close to them, but in later years I have found that it
wasn’t always that way.  It is so important to have good communication with our
children to be able to help them and let them know we understand.  Hope this
will benefit our children.  I think that’s one reason why the leaders of the
Church ask fathers to have “Priesthood Interviews” with their children and for
parents to take one-on-one time with them.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Some of our close friends in Taylorsville
include <b>Doris &amp; Dave Larsen.</b>  Doris was the counselor in the Relief
Society over me.  Doris is a wonderful person and she was closer to my age than
most of the other women.  Most of the sisters in our ward were just newly
married or young mothers.  Doris cried when I told her we were going to move. 
We were really good friends.  They gave us a beautiful church book when we
moved.  Her husband, Dave, was over Ken in the A.P.Y.M. program where Ken was
the Priest and Explorer advisor.  Dave was the president of the A.P.Y.M.  Doris
was also concerned about Sharon for she liked Sandy being Sharon’s friend.  
Dave &amp; Doris’s oldest daughter went on a mission and she returned soon
after we had moved to Erda and Ken was put in as 1<sup>st</sup> counselor to
Bishop Brown.  He called Dave and asked if he and his daughter could speak at
our ward in Sacrament meeting.  They accepted and came.  Their daughter spoke
first and then Dave.  While Dave was speaking, all I remember was him saying
“Isn’t that right, Ken?” and turned around to face Ken.  It was hot that day
and Ken has a hard time sitting very long without getting sleepy, so he had
fallen asleep.  Dave was so surprised that he could hardly continue his talk. 
He and Doris were so upset that Ken would fall asleep while Dave was speaking,
that they rushed out of the church and never spoke to us again.  Ken tried to
apologize, but they wouldn’t accept his apology.  We felt so bad about that and
I was really embarrassed that Ken had fallen asleep – but he couldn’t help it. 
He said he had tried to stay awake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Lorraine Anderton</b> was the Relief Society
President.  She was probably in her 40's.  She was such a sweet and wonderful
person also and a great Relief Society President.  She really went the extra
mile.  I really enjoyed her.  <b>Diane Stemmons</b> was also a good friend. 
She was younger than I, but we had a lot in common and we enjoyed visiting
together.  We used to talk for long periods of time on the phone and we’d go
places together sometimes.  We’d invite her and Jack over to our home and they
would invite us to their home.  Ken &amp; Louise Wilde were also good friends. 
Ken Wilde was also a high priest so Ken and Ken Wilde were home teaching
partners.  We also went to the temple with them a few times.  Paula Favor does
my hair for me.  She used to be a beauty operator so I would pay her $2.50 each
week to do my hair.  I would wash and set it and she would comb it out.  We
became good friends through this, and I would look forward to going so we could
visit.  Her son, Steven, was David’s best friend.  We invited them over for
Family Home Evening one time, and when we moved, they brought us a beautiful
large fern as a going away present.  I still go each week while the weather is
good to have her do my hair and then I do other errands that day also.  Our
neighbors next to us were good people and we enjoyed visiting with them, but
they were either non-Mormons or inactive.  We tried to fellowship them.  The
Filters on the East of us were non-Mormons and we gave them a Book of Mormon
with our testimonies written in the inside.  They had told the missionaries
that they were not interested at this time, but I hope they will be in the
future.  We enjoyed our other neighbors and people in the ward also, it was a
good ward.  Our Bishop was our age and we enjoyed them also.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            With <b>Irven and Sandy</b> living close by,
that was fun too.  They had moved in two weeks after we did.  They had come to
visit us and loved our home, the new neighborhood and the price of the homes in
that area, so they bought one soon after, just a couple of blocks away.  Sandy
and I would usually call each other at least once a day to see how each other
was doing and to ask favors or to borrow from each other. This was really
nice.  Also, in the evenings, we would walk over some times or they would come
over and we’d enjoy visiting.  Irven always brought out the ice cream when we’d
go over and usually he had root beer to go with it.  Irven had gone into a
jewelry business about the time Ken started working on the farm.  We were a
little leery about Irven going into it full time and so were his folks, but he
was really excited about it.  It fell through so they moved to Pocatello,
 Idaho just before we moved here to Erda.  The people in the ward said it was
bad enough to lose one of the Browning families, but it was terrible to lose
both of them.  Irven had been a Seventy and teaching the investigator class in
Sunday School and Sandy had been the Laurel teacher in A.P.Y.W.  They have
three children at this time: Douglas age 3, Andrea age 2 and Jennifer age 1 and
they’re expecting another baby this coming February - so they have their hands
full.  They were both 28 years old when they married, and they wanted a large
family, so they felt they had to have them close in order to have as many as
they wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter  31 – SCOTT’S
HEALTH PROBLEMS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In October of 1975, Scott got the Rubella measles. 
From that time on, he has been sick with one thing or another.  He got the red
measles and mumps, ear infection, tonsillitis and every flu or virus that came
along.  Finally in May, we took him to an eye, nose and throat specialist.  We
had taken him to a children’s doctor, but they just kept giving me
prescriptions for him.  We knew his tonsils were infected because when we’d
look into his throat, they were so swollen and his breathing was irregular. 
When I took him into the specialist, he said both his tonsils and adenoids
needed to come out.  They also took a test on his ears and found fluid in both
ears and a 20 to 30 percent hearing lost in the right ear and some in the
other, so tubes would also be needed.  That was the reason he had never slept
through the night.  All our other children, when they got a few months old,
began to sleep through the night, but Scott never did.  He would wake up
crying.  Neither he nor I had gotten a good night’s sleep since he was born. 
Ken also was up with him many times.  With the fluid in his ears, when he would
lie down and go to sleep, the pressure would build up and hurt his ears and he
would wake up.  He woke up several times most nights.  He was operated on the
28<sup>th</sup> of May in the Primary Children’s Hospital.  They found a growth
on his throat behind his tonsils that was 1½ inches long and as big around as a
man’s thumb.  Dr. Zobell had him put in intensive care because of precautionary
measures - swelling might occur and infection could set in easily.  That was
quite an ordeal for Scott.  (Also me)  They tied him down (his hands and feet
to the bed) because they had an IV in his arm to feed him through the veins. 
They also had the heart machine on him and he was in a mist tent.  He was
terrified, but they gave him shots to keep him asleep most of the time.  One
thing which really helped him was that he had become attached to a “kittie
pillow”.   Sandy and Shellie had become attached to a blanket, but I had made
Scott a pillow.  The material was a cat.  He loved this pillow and slept with
it and carried it around some times.  He always wanted to take it with him when
we went somewhere.  It was like a security blanket for him.  I made him a new
one before he went to the hospital because the other one was about gone.  They
did let us have that pillow in his bed with him in intensive care.  I guess
because it was new.  I’m sure they wouldn’t have let him have the old worn out
one.  I was thankful for that, but it was so hard not to be able to hold him
and rock him.  I stayed with him during the two days and Ken stayed with him
during the nights.  We brought him home and he recovered quickly.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken went to work on the stake farm about two
months ago and was told that the five stakes were purchasing 350 acres of land
in Tooele to raise the feed for the dairy farm that they already have</b>.  Ken
was excited because he knew they would need a full time farm manager for that
much land, so he asked the children and I how we would feel if he applied for
the job.  We were surprised after only living here six months and we still
didn’t have drapes on all the windows, but he was so excited and I didn’t feel
he would get the job since he didn’t have much farm experience - so I agreed to
have him apply.  To my surprise, he did get the job.  I had a hard time with
this.  We had this beautiful home and I really loved it.  I loved the ward,
neighbors, area, etc.  I hated to move the children again and so soon.  They
had hardly had time to get acquainted with friends, teachers, etc.  Moves are
harder on children than on parents.  <b>Ken had a good job back in the computer
field as a programmer for Gary Miles</b>.  He was enjoying it, but when this
came up, he was ready to quit and go.  <b>He had always wanted to be a farmer</b>. 
His mother had told me that.  I prayed, cried, moped, etc., but didn’t know
what to do now that he was given the job.  I felt maybe I was selfish asking
him not to take the job and move us again. It was one of the hardest moves I’ve
had to make.  We went out to Ken’s parents one day while this was going on. 
Bob &amp; Carroll were there and I remember as we talked, both Ken’s mom and
Bob told me that they felt that whoever was earning the living for the family
should be the one to make the decision of what occupation or job they wanted to
have.  I remember going outside and walking as I was really upset.  I decided I
might as well give in, that I guess there wasn’t any use fighting it.  They had
made me feel that it wasn’t my decision to make anyway - if Ken was earning the
living for our family, so I guess it was his decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Finally I felt some better and thought that
maybe it would be a good thing for the children to grow up on a farm and learn
the value of work.  They would also be able to have lots of animals, and I felt
it would be great for the boys especially. After we drove out to the land in
Erda where the farm would be, I got more excited.  It was so beautiful out
there - lots of good land and the wide open spaces instead of being confined to
a neighborhood.  It was a little valley surrounded by beautiful mountains.  We
could drive to the mountains for a picnic or camping in just a few minutes.  It
was a small town.  It turned out to be a great town.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were still living in Taylorsville and Ken was
commuting back and forth until they built us a home on the farm.  I still had
mixed feelings for awhile.  I hated to move again and I really loved it in Taylorsville.  The area was great.  We lived just a couple of blocks away from a shopping
center.  The big Valley Fair Mall was a few blocks away, also Grand Central and
Skaggs stores were close by, plus many other stores, drive-in’s, café’s, etc. 
But, we’re off to a new adventure and the thoughts of raising our children on a
farm where they can work with their dad, have animals to care for and enjoy,
was a good thought.  You can see how I went back and forth.  I was thrilled for
the fact that Ken would be doing what he’s always wanted to do.  Many men are
not able to do that.  I sure hope it is the wise decision to make.  My mother
is upset about it.  She feels Ken should settle down and stick with one job and
be happy - not keep moving us around the country.  I do hope the farm will be
our last move.  We’ve met many wonderful people and had many wonderful
experiences as we’ve moved around and I’m thankful for them, but I’m tired and
would like to get settled and get a nice garden, lawns, home, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>              When we moved to Taylorsville, the move was
hard on<b> Casper</b>.  She wouldn’t eat, etc., for a few days and we were
worried about her.  When Ken got the job with the farm and knew we would be
moving again and that another move would be hard on Casper, he decided to take
her out with him and get her used to being there before we actually moved.  She
loved to run beside the tractor as he worked on the farm.  One day he came home
without her.  I asked where she was and he had a sad expression on his face and
said that when he was driving the tractor, she got too close to the wheel and
got run over.  We were all devastated.  We all loved that beautiful dog.  Casper loved us too and was so protective of us.  I cried and cried as did the children.  I
hope we have that dog again in the next life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 32 – HOME IN ERDA  at
2448 W Erda Way – Aug 1976 to June 1979</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We moved to Erda the lst of September 1976.  We had sold our
home in Taylorsville to a young couple named Roger and Debbie Yetter.  Debbie
goes to church and would like to be active, but Roger smokes and isn’t active. 
We sold our home to them for just what we had put into it.  (Our down payment,
the extra money to get better carpeting and the cost of the materials when Ken
built the two extra bedrooms in the basement.)  Everyone thought we were crazy
to let it go for just that, and not make any money on the home because those homes
had gone up in value about $5,000. In just the 10 months that we had lived
there.  But, we had talked to the realtor prior to selling the home and asked
what it was worth.  He told us we should be able to get all the money we had
put into it out - so we thought that was a fair amount.  We were wrong.  No
wonder we had sold it so quickly.  It sold the day we put the sign up.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            They wanted to move in on the first of
September.  Our home in Erda was supposed to be finished and ready for us to
move into on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of August.  We were able to pick out the plans
for an Interstate prefab home.  It is 12 hundred 48 square feet.  It has three
large bedrooms upstairs, two baths, one being off the master bedroom.  It has
large closets with bileveled bifold doors - dark brown.  The trim all over the
home is dark wood.  The kitchen and bathrooms have walltex on the walls.  We
were able to pick out the patterns.  The kitchen has a U shape working area
with a long counter dividing the working area and the dining area.  We picked
white Formica for the counter tops.  We bought green sheers for the patio
window with green and white drapes and green sheer curtains above the window. 
We also bought us a new fridge so I really love my kitchen, in fact, the whole
house.  From the kitchen there’s little bar doors that separate the mud room
where my washer and dryer are and also the pantry.  Then there is the back door
going outside.  There’s an entrance from the front door to the rest of the
house.  We picked out mill block paneling for the one wall in the front room
and wall going downstairs.  The entrance way is done in it also.  The front
room has a beautiful rock fireplace on the same wall as the paneling.  We
picked out blue and green floral drapes that go to the ceiling with while
sheers.  Our carpet is green in the living room and two bedrooms and orange in
the master bedroom and down the hall.  The outside of the home is beautiful
also with a southern effect.  It has scalloped trim, brown shudders, yellow
brick with a while entrance and front door.  The windows have a criss cross
pattern in them.  We’re going to put up a white rail fence.  The farm committee
are really wonderful especially President Labrum and Bishop Steadman in wanting
us to have a nice home here and helping us to get it.  The farm is really
great.  The children have two dogs and several cats.  There are 81 head of
cattle on the farm also, so they have animals to care for.  We hope to get some
horses next spring.  There’s three hundred and 47 acres of land here.  Most of
it is in hay so it’s green and pretty all spring, summer and fall.  The
children can learn the value of work and be with their dad also.  Scott is 2 ½
years old now and he just loves being with his dad.  In the morning he’ll say
“wait for me, Dad”.  I’ll see the two of them outside in the mornings after the
other children have gone to school, and he’ll be following Ken everywhere. 
Sometimes they go hand in hand.  It sure looks cute and it makes me feel so
good that Ken is so good with the children and loves to have them with him. 
Scott loves to ride with his dad in the big tractor also.  It is a big John
Deer and has a cab.  Ken tells Scott story after story as they ride while
plowing, harrowing, disking, etc.  Scott sometimes catches his dad varying from
the story and corrects him.  Ken tries to trick Scott, but Scott catches him
every time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken sure is happy working on the farm.  It’s
what he’s always wanted</b>.  The farm committee <img width=242 height=1
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image130.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>bought two tractors for him.  One, the smaller, with a canopy
over it and the other is a beautiful big tractor with a cab, air conditioning,
heating, cushioned seat, adjustable steering wheel, etc.  Ken was talking to
his stepfather a while ago and they were comparing how he used to plow with his
horse and hand plow and now look at Ken’s big tractor and how he plows.  The
farm committee also bought Ken a nice pickup truck, a land plain, swather, and
everything he needs to do a first rate job of farming.  We never could farm
like this even if we could afford to buy our own farm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Some of the benefits of this job are: The home,
they pay our utilities, we get a beef a year, we get our milk at the dairy farm
free, and they also have good insurance and retirement benefits.  We feel
really good here and we are thankful to the Lord for guiding us here<b>.  </b>The
children are all happy, they have good friends.  <u>Sandy</u> is especially
happy that we moved and she was the one I was worried about because she was 14,
had her friends, had her classes in school already picked out, she was going to
be an office aid and in the school choir.  When she found out about the farm,
she cried and was unhappy because we had moved so often and it was hard for her
to adjust, although she makes friends easily usually.  She has been the
happiest, other than Ken and I, since the move.  This is a big ward with lots
of teenagers - so she has lots of friends and boys she likes.  She is in high
school since they have the four year high school - so she’s involved in
activities there.  She is also in concert choir which she enjoys.  I just made
her dress for it.  They sing in Sacrament meetings of other wards quite often
and also other churches.  She takes seminary and really loves it.  She has the
“neatest teacher” she says, and they voted her in as class secretary.  They
have lots of activities with the seminary also.  She plays the piano for APYW
activity nights and she also played for the roadshow along with doing a lot of
the art work for the scenery.  They put the roadshow on last night in Wendover
and they also put it on Tuesday and Wednesday nights in other wards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When Casper was killed by the
tractor, a neighbor in Taylorsville heard about it and they had a large dog,
which was too big for a sub division and asked if we would take her out to the
farm.  We did and we liked her, but she got running with other dogs in the
neighborhood and they were killing chickens and turkeys.  When a neighbor saw
our dog with the other dogs and said they had killed his chickens, we offered
to pay for the chickens and we had our dog put to sleep as once they start
doing that, they don’t stop.  We got another dog and we named it “<b>Spunky”.</b> 
That was such a cute dog.  It wasn’t Casper, but it was special also.  It had
black and white long hair.  It had such a cute personality.  When you talked to
it, it would cock its head back and forth as thought it understood everything
you said.  He would love to run and play with the children - I loved to play
with it too.  I remember starting to run with it - or when the children did,
and it would run so fast around and around you and we would be laughing so
hard.  Finally, it would stop and come over and lay it’s head on your lap.  I
was laughing so hard I couldn’t stand so would sit or lay on the grass.  We
loved that dog also. We had two ducks while on the Erda Farm and some cats. 
One of the ducks ate poison oats, which Ken had to kill the gophers in the
fields.  Ken’s farm helper had spilled the oats as he was filling the machine. 
Ken had warned him about this since we had several animals, so he felt bad when
the pet duck died.  The other duck was so distraught that she wouldn’t leave
her mate.  Ken had to force her off so he could bury the dead one.  This while
duck (don’t remember their names) wouldn’t eat so we thought we would lose it
too, but finally we noticed it following Spunky around and it was starting to
eat again.  One morning I went outside and found Spunky laying down in the
shade, the duck was laying by him with her head on his back and the cat was
snuggled up beside them.  It was so cute, I wish I had taken a picture of
them.  From then on, you would see Spunky walking with the duck behind and the
cat behind her.  What a sight to see.  They were great friends until the duck
got out in the front yard and close to the street and someone drove off the
street to hit the duck.  We were so sad and upset that someone would do that.  We
have been fortunate to have many special pets.  .</p>

Erda also.  <b>Vern and Diane Pancratz manage the Granger Stake Farm about one
mile up the road from us so they are also in our ward</b>.  They have 8
children.  They’re very special people.  Ken &amp; Vern help each other
sometimes on their farms.  We have a lot in common with them and enjoy being
with them.  We go to the temple with them and other places, and to each other’s
homes quite often.  They planted a large garden so they’ve given us a lot of
vegetables from it.  Also, several hundred pounds of potatoes for this winter. 
We’re very grateful for their generosity and friendship.  <b>Tom and Karen
Egglund</b> live close by us and they’ve been so good to us.  They helped us
move in, brought us vegetables and other food, invited us to their home for
homemade ice cream and cake, invited us to go square dancing with them and many
other places.  Tom and his son, Kent, helped Ken on the farm some this spring
and summer<u>.  (The picture above is of Tom &amp; Karen in the center and
Dianne and Vern on the outside.)</u>  I went to school with the <b>Bishop’s
wife, Colleen Gordon </b> She always had a sweet smile then and she still
does.  We’ve enjoyed going to the temple with them and other places.  Their
daughter, Ronna, is my class president of the lst year Beehives.  I enjoy
teaching this class.  The girls are reverent, yet they participate and are
enthusiastic about everything.  Ken teaches the 17 year olds in Sunday School
and loves it.  These youth are very respectful and reverent also.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            We have wonderful neighbors also.  <b>Tim and
Carol Smith</b> live across the street from us.  (I wish I had a picture of
them).   His mother, <b>Mary</b>, lives next to them and his brother, <b>Pete
and his wife, Gale </b>live next to Mary on the west side.  They are all very
wonderful.  Ken has had to borrow things from them and they are so willing. 
None of them, except the mother, <b>Mary,</b> are very active, but they would
give you the shirt off their back.  I especially love Carol.  She was bringing
food over when we were moving in.  I’ve visited a lot with her and think she is
really special.  She’s always doing nice things for me or giving me things. 
She painted a pumpkin for us and put a hat on it then gave it to us for
Halloween.  She has given me lots of clothes for Scott that her son, Chris, has
outgrown.  They’re almost like new.  She gave Scott a cowboy hat that he loves. 
A couple of days ago she brought over a beautiful bedspread that had just the
colors of my bedroom in it.  She was cleaning her linen closet and found it. 
It used to be her daughter’s.  It’s almost like new too.  She was wondering if
I might like it.   I had been using a blue and white one that was wearing out. 
Ken’s Mom had given it to me.  My colors in that bedroom are orange and green,
so that bedspread which she gave me makes the room look much better.  Carol is
so thoughtful and friendly.  I have given her a few things (food that I bake,
mainly), but I don’t feel I ever get caught up as she is always doing things
for me.  Carol doesn’t have many friends.  She is shy and maybe some of it has
to do with her being inactive in the church, because most of my other neighbors
and people out here are members of the church and are active.  They should
fellowship them more, - but anyway I sure enjoy her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Laura and Dennis Hanes</b> live up the
street.  They brought in a big dinner for us a couple of nights after we moved
in.  They are very friendly and great too.  In fact, all the people here in
this ward are just great and have really welcomed us in with open arms.  At
church, one of the men said to Ken “You’re just family.  You were meant to come
here”.  We have loved the area, neighbors, ward, etc., from the day we moved
in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            They asked me to teach the lst year Beehives.  I
have six girls - Lorene Brush, Ronna Gordon, Brenda Warr, Tammy Warr (they’re
cousins), Robin Lemmer and Genene Russell.  They’re all fairly active except
Genene.  She was put in as lst counselor in the class presidency in hopes it
would activitate her.  She promised Bro. Brown in the Bishopric that she would
come for at least six weeks.  She came most of those weeks, but now we can’t
get her to come out.  For her birthday I made her a cake and took over to her,
and I’ve been to see her several times and called her and also the girls have,
but to no avail.  Hope we can think of some way to help her want to come back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken is teaching the 17 &amp; 18 year old youth. 
They’re really a special group.  He has about 18 and they’re all reverent and
spiritual.  I really have grown to love my beehive girls also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>World conditions are looking bad.  The
economy is in sad shape.  Inflation is so high and keeps climbing.</b>  We are
having a drought (no moisture) here in the west, and in the East they are
having blizzards - so much snow that the schools are closed and many businesses
are closed.  The weather is way below freezing.  <b>The people are having to
pay $100. a month and higher for their fuel to heat their homes.  We are paying
around $34.00 a month</b>.  Many of the people can’t afford this so they are
keeping their children in bed to keep their warm, and of course, they still
aren’t very warm<b>.  If things don’t change neither the East or the West will
be able to plant crops and a famine will occur.</b>  <b>Both the stake

have their year’s supply of food and other necessities by now, they are on

should have our year’s supply by next April.  It is now February</b>.  We have
a lot of storage, but we don’t feel it will be enough.  We are still working to
get it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            They just put Ken in as a counselor in the High
Priest Quorum and a home teacher so he’s plenty busy and I’m also a visiting
teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Experience of Shellie falling from truck in Erda</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In September of 1978, Ken had asked Sandy to
take the truck and go into Salt Lake to get parts for him for the farm.  The
Dairy Farm had borrowed our truck and left us their old red truck.  Sandy asked
Shellie to go with her.  She didn’t want to go because I had told her that she
could go to her friend, Angie’s, after school to play.  Ken told her to go with
Sandy so she was unhappy.  She said she didn’t talk to Sandy very much as they
rode along, but on the way home, she felt better and they began to talk.  As
they were nearing the corner by the bottom of our field, Shellie leaned again
the door to look at Sandy as they talked.  Sandy turned the corner, and it
pushed Shellie harder against the door and it came open throwing Shellie out on
the road.  Sandy quickly stopped the truck and ran and picked up Shellie and
came on home.  When we saw Sandy carry Shellie into the house, we knew
something was wrong.  Shellie was scratched really badly from her ankles to her
neck, especially on the left side.  Sandy felt so bad, but it wasn’t her
fault.  We are thankful she was able to stop the truck  so that it didn’t run
over Shellie.  Shellie was wearing shorts so her poor little legs and stomach
were really bad.  She was in so much pain that I called the doctor.  He told me
to clean it out, and then put Neosporin ointment on it.  I asked him if there
was some spray that would numb it as the pain was so bad.  He said Americaine
was good for that.  I quickly went to Tooele to the drug store and got it.  The
spray had 25% alcohol in it, and she would scream and couldn’t stand for us to
put it on.  Ken had cleaned it while I was gone.  That night poor little
Shellie didn’t sleep hardly at all.  The next day wasn’t much better.  We kept
trying to put the Neosporin on, gave her aspirins and did what we could, but
finally in the afternoon, she got a fever and started shaking uncontrollably. 
I called the doctor and he said to take her into the Primary Children’s
Hospital.  We were supposed to have a party at our home that evening.  It was
for the Bishopric, clerks and their wives.  Ken felt we should still have it
even though I hadn’t been able to clean the house like I wanted to.  Everyone
was bringing pot luck and I had made salads for it, so Ken stayed here to host
the party while I took Shellie in.  It was a hot day and she was in a lot of
pain on the ride in.  I felt so bad for her.  I hate to see my children in pain
of any kind, and Shellie was in so much pain.  I had to take Jeff with me and
he was cross so I was really glad when we finally got there.  They looked at
Shellie and said the fever was brought on by infection that had started because
there was still dirt and gravel in the flesh.  They said they would have to
clean it out.  Both Shellie and I were worried because we knew it would hurt
terribly.  I asked if they could give her something for the pain and they said
“no, because she needed to be alert so they could tell by her reactions whether
they were cleaning too deep”.  I didn’t think I could stand to stay there and
see her go through that so I told her I would just be out in the waiting room,
but she said “No, Mom, stay here with me”.  I could understand that and I did
want to help her if I could.  I stood by her and held her hand.  They used a
toothbrush and hydrogen peroxide.  They really scrubbed, and poor little Shellie
screamed and twisted as she clutched my hand.  I wished I could go through it
for her and take the pain from her to me.  Tears rolled down my cheeks as I
knew it was torture for her.  I was afraid I would pass out, but I held on for
Shellie’s sake.  I’m not sure how I did as I pass out so easily.  Finally,
after what seemed an eternity, they were through.  They put Neosporin on and
bandaged her all over.  They took X rays and found no broken bones.  We got
home around 10:00 that night.  All the guests had gone and they had all had a
good time Ken said.  They played volley ball in the back yard, then cooked
their steaks on the barbecue and had lots of other good food.  I was a little
embarrassed that the house wasn’t as clean as I would have liked, but I was more
concerned about Shellie as she was far more important to me than that party or
a clean house.  Shellie got along fine after that and it healed rapidly.  We
are so thankful that it wasn’t any worse than it was because her little face
wasn’t hurt at all.  The main thing that we thought about, was if she had
leaned on that door while Sandy was turning a corner in a main intersection in
Salt Lake City or on the freeway, Shellie would probably have been killed as
there was so much traffic.  It was during the rush hours - people were getting
off work and heading home.  She probably would never had a chance.  We are so
thankful that she is alive.  We love her very much.  We don’t feel that it was
just a coincidence that she didn’t lean against that door earlier; we feel that
the Lord watched over her and we are very thankful to him.  I felt bad for
Sandy while this was all going on.  She loved her sister very much too and was
so scared and upset and worried.  It certainly wasn’t her fault in any way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our last child, Jeffrey Charles Browning was born January
20, 1978.  We had planned to name him Ryan, but on the way to the LDS
 Hospital in Salt Lake City, Ken said: “The name “Ryan” doesn’t fit with the
other names of our children.  Ryan is a more modern name where the other
children have names that are older names.   After I saw my baby and  was in the
recovery room, I thought of the name “Jeffrey”.  I had a cousin named Jeff,
Uncle Van’s son.  Jeff was such a good guy, and I thought our baby looked like
a “Jeff” so I talked to Ken about it.  He liked it and thought it went with the
names of our other children.  We decided to give him the middle name of
“Charles” after Ken’s father.  Jeff was our third “redhead”.  Sandi, Mike and
now Jeff.  I was happy, I love red hair.  I have a red cast to my hair and my
grandma Porter had red hair I am told.  Jeffrey had colic, but again not as bad
as Sandi had it.  He was a cute little guy, but demanded a lot of my
attention.   Ken and I have thought that these three take more after the
Brownings and Shellie, David and Scott take more after the Porter side of the
family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>I taught the Beehives until Jeff
was born</b>.  Actually, the President, Vida Bates, substituted for me from the
1<sup>st</sup> of January as David was to have his second operation on his left
foot the 1<sup>st</sup> part of January and I needed to be with him.  I thought
I would again teach the Beehives after Jeff was a few weeks old, but the ward
was divided the last of January and <b>Ken was put in as lst counselor to
Bishop LaDell Brown</b> so we decided it would be better if I get out of the
MIA since we are gone so much in the evenings and it is an involved program and
requires a lot of time.  I would need to support Ken and be home with the
children.  I enjoyed teaching the Beehives, and it was rewarding in many ways,
but with presidency meetings, extra activities that the girls wanted to go on,
service projects with our class and also with the APYW, firesides, doing extra
things for each of the girls birthdays, and when they were sick, etc., making
visual aids, handouts, etc., for the lessons and going to the stake and ward
meetings and then the regular APYW and also we put on a joint activity once a
month.  It was really a big job.  In my class, I had girls that didn’t get
along and there were several problems with that also.  Some pretty serious and
it was hard trying to get them to see the other person’s side of the problem,
and to be Christ like, instead of jealous and selfish.  I guess I was a little
relieved to leave this position.  I did grow to love the girls and it was
rewarding when they would come to visit me or come up to me at church and tell
me things.  <b>When I was released one of my girls came up to me and was very
sad and said “First you quit, and now Vida.  Now who is there that is really
good and cares about us?”  </b>That made me feel sad. </p>

align=left hspace=12>We don’t have a picture of Ken being in the Bishopric with
LaDell and Cordell ??.  This picture was taken years later when we were
visiting them in Tooele, as they had sold their place in Erda and moved to
Tooele for their health.  We became great friends with LaDell and Eleanor while
we lived in Erda.  On Friday nights, we would take turns going to each other’s
homes and playing games.  We had so much fun.  One time LaDell wanted to show
Ken something in their basement and while they were gone, Eleanor said to me:
“Let’s stack the deck”, so we did.  When they came back, we had dealt the cards
out for our game of Rook.  As they started to play, Ken said “I pass”, and
LaDell looked at him and said “You can’t pass, I have nothing”.  Eleanor and I
started to laugh as we had given each of us all the good cards and them the bad
ones.  They always teased us about that after that and said:”we don’t dare leave
you too together or you will “stack the deck”.  Eleanor drove a school bus to
earn some extra money for their family after their youngest went to school. 
She loved it and told me I should do that, but I told her “No, that’s not for
me as I don’t even feel too safe driving my car or truck, so I couldn’t drive a
school bus full of children or youth.”  I told her that if I went to work, I
would be a secretary as that is what I am good at and like to do.  It is
interesting that Ken became a school bus driver later in life.  Ken enjoyed
serving with LaDell in the bishopric.  Cordell Goff was the 2<sup>nd</sup>
counselor and Ken enjoyed Cordell also.  After we moved, LaDell was put in as
the stake president. </p>

align=left hspace=12>            Terry &amp; Sally Matthews were also good
friends when we lived in Erda.  Sally also drove a school bus and Terry was a
supervisor out at Tooele Army Depot.  We enjoyed being with them also.  We
didn’t do as much with them as we did with LaDel and Eleanor Brown, but we
enjoyed visiting with them at church and other activities.  We didn’t have a
lot of time to spend with friends since Ken was running this farm and also in
the Bishopric, and I was busy with my family and keeping everything running
smoothly – at least I tried to.  Several years later, Terry knew we had moved back
to Utah, from Arizona, and knew that Ken was very good in construction, so he
had his secretary call Ken to see if he would be interested in working in his
department at Tooele Army Depot.  That turned out to be a blessing also, but
Terry wasn’t Ken’s direct supervisor and the supervisor Ken had was not a good
man and didn’t know much about building.  We had heard that he got this
position because he let his wife sleep with one of the generals, and she was a
beautiful woman.  That might just be a rumor.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>Trials with Sandi and her marriage to David Nix</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This year, 1978/79, has been a trying one.  We love our
oldest child, Sandi, very much, but we have been having trouble communicating. 
Her attitude has changed a lot with regards to the gospel over the past 2 ½
years since we have been living in Erda.  Ken and I have been talking and
asking ourselves why? And how did this come about?  I think one incident, a
short time after she received her patriarchal blessing, had some influence. 
She had just turned 14 and was able to receive her blessing.  It was a
beautiful blessing.  We all shed tears and were proud of Sandy.  Sometime
later, our good friends, the Braithwaites, were visiting.  Lori, Sandy’s age
and good friend, read her blessing.  She said to Sandy, “Gosh, it sounds like
you’re going to do a lot of bad things”.  In her blessing, it gave her words of
warning like it did in mine and I suppose it does in all blessings, but since
that time, Sandy disliked her blessing and felt the same as Lori had and we
couldn’t talk her out of it.  I’ve heard people say that you shouldn’t let
everyone read your blessing, maybe this is why.  Whether this is true or not,
her attitude started to change.  She wanted to be popular and that was so
important to her.  I could understand more than her dad.  She was a sweet girl
and appreciated what I did for her.  Her dad didn’t have that desire to wear
the latest fashions when he was a kid.  The only thing that was important to
him was that he felt his clothes looked clean and neat and looked good on him. 
If our kids wanted something, they better not say - when Ken asked why “because
all the other kids have one”, or they wouldn’t get it unless I softened him
up.  If it was because they wanted it, that was different and he would try to
get it or help them find ways to earn the money.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Sandy was chairman of the youth conference
during her sophomore year.  Our Bishop’s son, Drake Brown was the co-chairman. 
With this responsibility, she had several fund raising projects to help the
youth raise money to go to youth conference.  They went to B.Y.U.  First, they
had car washes at the church, then they made mother’s day cakes.  They
decorated them at the church and delivered them to the homes when the father’s
or children had ordered them.  They also had a “Rock-a-Thon” where they brought
rocking chairs to the church recreation hall and they brought food, T.V.’s
stereos, records, games, books, etc., to entertain them while they rocked. 
First they got sponsors - people who would pay them so much an hour to rock. 
They had 10 minutes each hour to go to the rest room and walk around.  Some of
them rocked for 24 hours.  Sandy was the main one to organize and be in
charge.  I helped her with most of these projects.  They all turned out really
well, and I was proud of her.   Drake liked Sandi, but kids called him a “Goody
Goody” and Sandi didn’t want that label, so she didn’t have much to do with
Drake.  One time they were at a ward dance and Drake asked Sandi to dance with
him and while they were dancing, LaDell remarked to Ken, that they made a great
couple.  This didn’t sit well with Sandi when her dad told her this.  I’m sure
her life would have been much better and happier if she had liked Drake and
married him instead of David Nix, but we all have our free agency and make our
own choices, and the choices we make determine our destiny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sandy has had many friends; LuAnn Premack in Mesa
was a true friend.  Most of her other friends, since that time, have been two
faced.  They would treat her good and be her friend until someone more popular
came along and then they would drop her and go with them.  Girls especially are
that way.  It’s really sad.  My neighbor, Carol, has a daughter a year younger
than Sandy. Her name was also Sandy. They became friends, but she would make
fun of our Sandy in front of other kids and this would really hurt our
daughter.  Our Sandy finally quit being friends with her and I was glad.  Sandy
Smith didn’t have many values.  Sandy’s other friends in Erda were good girls,
but they still were not the<span style='font-size:10.0pt'> </span>best to Sandy
many times.  Sandy felt bad that she couldn’t find another close friend who
would be loyal and kind.  I felt so bad when Sandi would come home feeling bad,
I wanted to tell those girls off and make them realize how cruel they were.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It’s typical for many teenagers to want
popularity.  I remember wishing I was more popular.  We felt Sandi was
different and special, and we love the gospel so much, that we want our
children to feel this way.  I know we aren’t supposed to force them, and yet,
as parents, we sometimes put too much pressure on them to do things we think
are best for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We would have family home evening and many times
she would act bored and be glad when it was over.  We tried to make them interesting
and do different things and have activities.  When we read the scriptures in
the morning, she acted the same way and sometimes put her makeup on while we
were reading until we asked her to stop, and told her that either she would
have to get up earlier if she didn’t have enough time, or she would be late for
school.  She would take her turn for family prayer, but her attitude wasn’t
right.  After she started going with Dave, she would rather go places with him,
than with us.  It hurt our feelings, and her attitude annoyed us so I’m sure
part of the problems we had with her, wasn’t her fault.  We didn’t have enough
patience with her and weren’t as understanding maybe as we should have been.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have since learned that many teenagers have
trouble this way. I don’t remember feeling this way, but Hal did.  He resented
being expected to always go to church, participate in family prayer, etc.  I
think I was born with a testimony because I don’t remember questioning it. 
When Hal would tell me to be broad-minded and investigate other churches, to
not just believe everything our parents said - I told him “why should I investigate
other churches when I know our church is the true church.”  I wasn’t always a
perfect child, I know that for sure, but I have always loved the Lord and the
Gospel. From the way Ken talks, he was that way also.  But teenagers want to be
independent and be their “own self” and not have people telling them what to
do.  That’s why it is so important that parents teach their children values
while they are young.  Sandi’s brothers, as they got older, didn’t always enjoy
family home evenings, long family prayers and scripture study either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            To make a long story, short.  Sandi married Dave
on April the 13<sup>th</sup>.  She was a Junior in High School and we were
concerned as to whether she would finish school or not.  They both assured us
that she would.  Ken had a harder time accepting the fact that Sandi was
marrying Dave, and not being married in the temple, like we had always hoped
she would, and that she was so young.  We both had a hard time, but I resolved
to accept him as I didn’t want anything to come between my daughter and me.  I
always wanted us to be close.  It was hard many times to show love to Dave as
he didn’t treat me very well, but I kept trying and I am glad I did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I will tell about one incident that
was really hard on me.  We were having <b>Thanksgiving dinner</b> at our home
in Grantsville.  We had invited my parents, siblings and their families and, of
course, Sandi and Dave.  My parents have always eaten at 12:00
on Thanksgivings in the past and so we decided on that time for this year too. 
Sandi asked me if I would help her make rolls as they would be going to Dave’s
family later.  She was making roles for both dinners.  I did help her and she
asked what time we were eating.  I’m sure I told her 12:00,
but at 12:00 they were not here.  All my family was here and the kids were
hungry with smelling the turkey and all the other good food.  We had set up
tables down in our family room to eat as there was lots of room down there. 
The time wore on and they still didn’t come.  We hadn’t said the blessing, but
we finally were dishing up food on the Children’s plates, when I heard the
doorbell, so ran up and it was them.  I saw that they had started taking off
their coats and boots and were now putting them back on.  I said “What are you
doing? We are ready to eat.”  Dave said:  “Well, if you couldn’t wait until we
got here, then we are leaving.”  I said “ What! We haven’t started to eat, we
haven’t said the blessing, we were waiting for you, but you are late.”  Sandi
said “No, you said we were eating at 1:00 PM  I disagreed with her, but they
kept on getting the coats back on the girls.  I said “Don’t do this, it will
spoil our Thanksgiving.”  Dave said “ You should have thought of that before
you started without us.”  I again tried to tell them that we hadn’t started to
eat, but they left anyway.  I was so hurt and upset.  I went into the living
room and cried and cried.  Finally, some of the family came up to see why we
hadn’t come down and they saw I was crying and asked what happened.  It did
spoil my Thanksgiving and I had a hard time for many days, weeks and months
after that.  Even when I tried to apologize to Dave, (even though I knew I wasn’t
wrong, that he was) he wouldn’t accept it.  From that day on, he wouldn’t speak
to me.  If I called their home and he answered and heard my voice, he wouldn’t
say anything, just give the phone to Sandi and say “It’s your mom”.  When we
would invite them for meals, birthdays, outings, etc., sometimes Sandi and the
girls would come, but Dave never would.  When I would go there, he would stay
in the family room in the basement and not come up.  It was sooooooooooo hard. 
I prayed and prayed about it.  Dave seemed to like Ken more than me so he
slowly softened up to Ken. One night we were having a birthday dinner and I had
invited Mom &amp; Dad.  I called and invited Sandi, Dave and the girls and told
Sandi that Mom &amp; Dad were coming too.  To my surprise, Dave came with Sandi
and the girls.  He didn’t speak to me, but at least he was here<b>.  During the
meal, my special mom kept talking to him, asking him questions about his work
and hobbies and he softened up.  He talked with Ken and Dad too, but, of
course, not to me</b>.  <b>Little by little he softened and finally he was
talking to me a little</b>.  When we would go to their home, I would go down to
the family room and give him a hug and try to make some conversation.  He would
never ask how I was or what I had been doing or anything about me, but if I
asked him questions about him and what he had done and praised him, it got some
better.  I mainly did all this so I could keep a close relationship with my
daughter as I loved her very much and felt bad for her because Dave wasn’t a
good husband for her or good father for his daughters.  He belittled Sandi and
said bad things to her and was sure a controller.  He sure brought down her
self esteem</p>

align=left hspace=12>When little JaNae was born, we were living in Arizona and
so I took Jeff with me and flew up to help Sandi and her new baby daughter.  We
stayed over a week and I really enjoyed being with them.  Jeff was excited to
have a little niece.  He was two years old at the time.  Dave had been in a
serious accident where he almost lost his leg.  The doctor used a new procedure
by putting large pins in his leg.  Sandi had to dress his wounds night and
morning.  It was so awful that it made me sick looking at it.  I don’t know how
Sandi did it with being pregnant.   Sandi was in her senior year of high school
so after she was able to recover and go back to school, Dave put JaNae’s
bassinet by the couch and he took care of her while Sandi was at school.  Sandi
got everything ready for his lunch, JaNae’s bottles, etc.  We were very proud
of Sandi for graduating from High School.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Sandi had two special little daughters – JaNae &amp;
Chelci</b>.  JaNae is 5 years older than Chelci.  Sandi was a great mother to
her girls, but Dave wasn’t a very good father.  Sandi supported and helped them
with everything, while Dave didn’t.  Dave was more concerned with Dave, than
with his family.  He criticized <img width=242 height=1

align=left hspace=12>Sandi and belittled her a lot.  I’m sure he loved her in
his own way, but he was anything but a good husband.  He was a hard worker and
was talented in many ways.  He could fix most anything and did taxaduratry.  He
loved sports – baseball, hunting and fishing.  He was a good provider, but
that’s about all I can say.  He is a lot like his father and we didn’t care
much for him.  Dave was a controller, and when he came home from work, Sandi
had to have his dinner ready and then be at his beacon call.  He wouldn’t even
allow her to go walking with her friends, but that changed thank goodness when
she got a job.  Sandi wanted a car and Dave told her that she would have to get
a job and buy her one as he wasn’t buying her one.  She applied at the school
to work as a cook in the school lunch program and she was hired.  That worked
good for her and the girls as she was home when they were.   Sandi put her
girls in a “clogging” class and soon after the teacher asked Sandi to help her
teach.  Sandi has always been talented in dancing so she did.  Some time
afterwards, the teacher who was a young adult and wanted to go to college asked
Sandi if she would like to buy the business from her.  She was able to do this
and did great at this also.  She amazed me at how she could make up the dances,
design the costumes and even sew them.  She loved the girls and they loved
her.  She had a great business and she took her classes to different
competitions all over.  I went whenever I could as I enjoyed watching them. 
Every May she had a competition at Lagoon, so her, her daughters and other
girls in her classes coming for the competition, stayed the night at our home
in Layton and then I would go with them the next morning.  In between the
competitions, we would go on the rides at Lagoon.  It was a fun time.  I was
always proud of Sandi, JaNae &amp; Chelci.  JaNae &amp; Chelci took after their
mother and were very talented and did very well in the competitions and looked
so cute with their beautiful smiles.  My mother loved to watch them dance also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Sandi separated from Dave, after
being married for 16 years.  She has told me that she never loved him.  That is
sad to be married to a person you don’t love. Sandi is a “pleaser” and so she
tried to work at her marriage for many years and especially for the sake of her
girls.  She and Chelci stayed with us the summer of       ??.  Sandi and I
bonded more that summer than all the years of her marriage.  I am thankful for
that time we had together.  We walked each morning and had many good talks. 
She was able to get her feelings out, which was good.  She was so good to help
with the cooking, cleaning, etc.  I hated it when Dave would call her as she
was finally calm and enjoying life more, but when he would call, she would
start shaking all over and after she hung up, she would be so mad and upset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I enjoyed sweet little Chelci also, and wished
JaNae had come too, but she stayed with her dad as he convinced her that he
needed her, and she wanted to be with her friends, etc.  I could understand,
but would have liked to have her with us also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dave finally talked Sandi into going back to
him.  She stayed for a few months, but they ended up getting a divorce.    Sandi
was able to rent an apartment close to the school, Harris Elementary in Tooele,
where she was the head cook.  She fixed it up really cute.  Her and Chelci were
happy there for about two years.  Then she married Terry Thomas.  Sandi &amp;
Dave had joint custody with the girls.  JaNae stayed with her dad and Chelci
went with her mom.  It is hard splitting up a family and I felt really bad for
the girls, but I knew Sandi was at the point that she couldn’t take any more. 
When Sandi &amp; Terry married, they remodeled his duplex apartment which is in
Grantsville.  That made it easier for JaNae to be with her mom &amp; sister
more.  I’m very glad that she is close with her mom.  JaNae was in a beauty
pageant and when asked the question “Who is the person that has been the
biggest influence in your life?” JaNae answered “My Mom because she has always
been there for me.”  She said other special things about her mom and as I was
sitting by Sandi, she was crying.  We, as parents, need to hear those things at
times.  JaNae got in trouble from her other grandparents &amp; her Dad because
she said it was her Mom, instead of her Dad.  It surely hasn’t been easy for
JaNae as she was 16 at the time and that is a difficult time in a person’s life
anyway.  We have always kept her in our prayers.  We do pray for all of our
children, their spouses and our grandchildren.  They are all so wonderful and
we love them all so much.  Ken &amp; I have really been blessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             (<b>Back to Erda) </b>Ken went deer hunting
with our friend, Larry Braithwaite, in Manti.  Larry had called and invited Ken
to go with him.  While they were together Larry told Ken how good he was doing
in the construction business.  He told Ken he should come down and offered him
a good job.  Ken came home excited about it as he was getting discouraged on
the farm.  He loved the farm and the work, but he was discouraged with the farm
committee because it took them so long to make decisions and to get anything
done.  And on a farm, it needs to be done right now.  The work crews usually
didn’t show up or at least not nearly as many as were expected.  He had so much
work to do that he had to work such long hours and on Saturdays as well.  Ken
was lst counselor in the Bishopric so Sundays and week nights were tied up
also.  We didn’t have much time together as a family and Ken felt bad about
that.  Also, we were not making much money.  The church doesn’t pay high
wages.  We took a cut in wages when we quit programming for Gary Miles and came
to work for the church.  But Ken had always wanted to farm and he wanted this
so bad that he was willing to do this.  It was a hard decision for me, but I
finally agreed.  After they built us such a nice home, and I came to love the
ward and people in Erda, then I was glad we had moved.  But now he was asking
me to move again?  Farm life wasn’t a perfect life, there were certainly
disadvantages, but I was happy here.   I did wish Ken had more time for the
family and it would have been nice if we could make more money to be able to
save and get ahead.  Also, we had a big yard and big garden and since Ken was
so busy on the farm, these things were left up to the children and I.  It was
hard work keeping it up, but it was good for the children and I enjoyed it
(except for when the <b>nats </b>were out).  Sometimes, however, it was
overwhelming because I had a small baby who was really demanding, and I was
busy with church and civic responsibilities.  I taught the Beehives, they were
cute girls.  We lived in Erda three years.  I taught the Beehives the first two
years and was a den leader the 3<sup>rd</sup> year.  In those days, they didn’t
have separate young women’s presidency and class teachers.  We were the
presidency, but we also taught the classes.  The president was Hilda Cockrane
and she taught the Laurels, Connie King was the lst counselor and she taught
the Mia Maids, and I was the 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor and taught the Beehives. 
It seemed like we had lots of meetings - weekly presidency meetings plus our
individual class presidency meetings and monthly stake and ward meetings. 
Hilda and I became good friends.  They had a beautiful home in Stansberry
 Park.  Her husband was Ken’s counselor in the High Priest’s presidency and
Harvey Russell was his other counselor.  They released me when Ken was put in
the Bishopric <b>and asked me to be a den mother.   Mike and David were in my
den</b>.  I enjoyed doing this with my sons.  We had a great time.  We had a
magic show, a country fair, several plays where we would make the scenery and
costumes and perform in front of the parents, etc.  Ken made me a stand to
display the beads the boys earned.  There was a wolf head on one side of the
stand and a bear head on the other side.  I think he carved them, but I’m not
sure.  Ken helped me many times in my church callings, and I helped him in
his.  I sure appreciate all he does for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was also active in the Women’s Republican
Organization, so with all this plus housecleaning, laundry, meals, canning
fruits and vegetables, etc., it seemed almost more than I could do at times,
but I still loved it here in Erda.  It was work, but also fun when we canned
fruits and vegetables, especially corn, as we would make it a family affair and
Ken would help us.  Everyone had a job. With corn, some would shuck it while
other washed and cleaned it, others blanched it, another cut it off the corn
cob, someone else rinsed it in ice water while others drained and bagged it. 
We worked together really well.  I don’t remember the children arguing or
complaining much.  (Maybe they did, but I don’t remember it.  I have good
memories of doing this as a family).</p>

align=left hspace=12>            When Ken started talking about quitting the
farm and moving to Arizona again, I became discouraged as I didn’t want to move
again and uproot the family.  I told him that the Prophet said in one of the
Ensigns that you shouldn’t move your family unless it is really necessary. 
That it was hard on all the family and sometimes not profitable.  I thought he
had decided to stay, but every so often he would get discouraged with the farm
and think of moving again.  I kept talking him out of it as we have moved so
much and Ken is 40 years old now and I didn’t think we should go into building
again as we have tried it twice and it hasn’t worked out.  For one thing,
neither Ken nor I like the uncertainly of it.  Ken and the dairy farm manager
flew to Arizona on a business trip to look at a feeder system.  The company
flew them down.  They went in February.  Ken called Larry to say hello, and
they insisted he come spend the night.  Again, Larry tried to convince Ken to
come down and told him that he could make more money if he went into business
for himself, and that he would help set him up in business.  He told Ken that
if he wasn’t making $440,000. a year, he wasn’t doing anything.  Then Ron
Shumway took Ken to the airport on his way to work.  As they talked, Ron told
Ken he would love to have him come to work in computer programming for him, and
that if he had to, he would fire someone in order to get Ken on.  When Ken came
home he was again excited.  I explained my feelings again and that I felt so
secure on the farm since they provide the home, pay the utilities, we get all
the milk we want, we get a beef a year, plus the garden and we’re able to have
animals.  We had a pig, chickens, rabbits, dog, cat and horse which provided us
with eggs and lots of meat and good pets for the children.  We also had
insurance and the retirement was good.  Ken brought up the fact that we didn’t
make enough money to save for Christmas, vacations, school clothes, etc., and
this had always put us behind since we came to the farm, plus we had used up
most of our year’s supply and we owed money on the Visa Charge Card.  He asked
how we were ever going to save for the future - missions for the children,
wedding receptions, etc.  We discussed this back and forth.  When we learned of
Sandi’s forthcoming wedding, I asked him to forget the subject of moving for
awhile as I surely couldn’t have it on my mind at this time.  The day after the
wedding, he again brought up this subject.  I still didn’t feel good about it. 
In fact, I was making our bed at the time and I was so upset with Ken that I
threw the pillow as hard as I could at him.  I’m sure if I had been in the
kitchen and had a frying pan in my hand, I probably would have thrown it at
him.  After I threw it, I was surprised and embarrassed and we both started
laughing.  Anyway, I felt maybe I was being selfish because I didn’t want to
leave my beautiful home now that I had it just the way I wanted.  I had always
wanted a home just like this.  I got to pick out the design of the outside of
the house, the inside, decorate how I wanted, the carpeting, wall paper,
drapes, tile, etc.  Then I had always wanted a large yard with a white rail
fence around it, and now we had all this.  Both Ken and I designed the
basement.  Our boys room was a lovely big room.  We had three twin beds for
Mike, David and Scott.  It had 3 closets, one for each boy.  It had a part
bathroom with shower, and vanity with two sinks and two medicine cabinets with
mirrors for when they grew up and needed to shave.  The one wall had cork board
covered with panels of red and blue burlap.  This way the boys could have a
dart board and put up their posters and drawings, etc., to display them.  The
rest of the walls have a cute Tom Sawyer and friends with animals, etc., design
on the walltex.  It was really a cute room.  Many of my friends came to see it
and show their husbands so they might have something like it.  Shellie’s room
was pink with white closet doors, woodwork and white drawers and cupboards
built in.  She had a cute matching pink bedspread and curtains.  It was really
a darling room for her.  We had a nice storage room where we had lots of
shelves for my bottled fruit and vegetables.  The freezer was there and also
all my nice removable shelves that Ken built for our year’s supply of food.  In
the furnace room, there were also 4 nice large shelves to put our camping gear
and other boxes for storage.  This last winter, Ken built our family room.  It
was beautiful with also lots of storage.  He built a cupboard under the steps
and then the rest of the room under the steps he made into a coat closet to
store old coats and clothes.  He put a nice door on it.  One whole wall had
shelves across it, with levered bifold doors on them.  He also built me a bookcase. 
I wanted him to build a box effect up and across the wall where the fireplace
was and around the fireplace so it could also be carpeted and people could sit
on it, which he did.  Ken put white slump block on the wall above the fireplace
and built up the area where the fireplace was and put red bricks underneath the
place where our Heritage Stove sat.  The carpeting we picked out was lush and
beautiful.  We had the drapes made to match the carpeting.  It was really a
beautiful room.  The stakes felt good about it as they wanted us to have a
lovely home and they also wanted the home and farm to be a good example of how
our home, yards and property should be - for the rest of the church members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The main part of the house was beautiful also. 
We had a lovely entranceway from the front door.  The front room was off to the
right.  We had a beautiful fireplace, the carpet was lime green and the drapes
had blue flowers with lime green steams and leaves, it was on a white
background.  They hung from the ceiling with white shear drapes underneath. 
They were very pretty.  The wall where the fireplace was had a black effect in
the paneling.  We had seen this paneling in the model home and really liked
it.  It was also on both walls dividing the front room from the entrance way. 
On the left of the front door was the stairs leading to the basement.  It also
had this same paneling on the walls with the rod iron railing.  The kitchen and
dining room were beautiful.  I had white formic on the countertops and bar.  I
picked out white wall tex with lime green and yellow flowers.  It was really
cheery.  There was a window above the sink and I had sheer lime green curtains
on this window and also sheer drapes on the arcade doors in the dining area,
with beautiful green and white heavier drapes.  I pulled these heavier drapes
back to give a window effect.  Off from the kitchen was the mud room where the
washer and dryer were, also the pantry with bifold doors and the back outside
door.  I really appreciated the mud room; for in the spring, fall and winter,
it was literally a “mud” rom.  A hall led from the dining area to the three
bedrooms and bathrooms.   We had intended the one small bedroom to be my sewing
room combined with Ken’s den after we put the boys downstairs, but then we decided
to have another child, so it turned out to be a nursery for Jeff.  I fixed it
up really cute and put the rocking chair in there which made it really nice. 
Sandi’s room was done in yellow, and I made matching drapes and bedspread.  It
was really cute.  Our room was beautiful too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The main reason Ken told me he wanted to move
was because of the changes which had occurred when President Labrum was
released as the stake president over the farm.  President Labrum had been wonderful
to work with and had Bishop Steadman over the farm and Ken worked well with
him.  But, President Morrill replaced Pres. Labrum and he changed things
drastically.  <b>I wrote a letter to President Morrill before we left the
farm.  This is the letter.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dear President Morrill, since we haven’t really
talked with you recently, I felt I’d like to write to you and tell you our
feelings about quitting the farm.  We don’t want you to feel we’re ungrateful
for all you, Pres. Labrum and the farm committee have done for us and I hope
you don’t feel we are letting you down by leaving the farm.  We want to leave
with good feelings and no regrets.  We have loved it here.  It is beautiful –
the fields, the house, yard and everything about the farm.  In fact, as you know,
I have tried to persuade Ken not to leave, for I really love it here and we
have such good friends and a wonderful ward.  Of course, I realize there are
good people everywhere and I’m sure we will like it in Arizona.  We did
before.  I have been concerned about Ken going into business for himself in
these troubled times, but it is a good offer that Larry is giving us – to help
set Ken up in business and let Ken work off his license until he gets his own. 
Larry says they really need finish carpenters in the Phoenix area.  Larry does
framing, so he would refer his finish work to Ken.  I sure hope and pray it
works out for the best, but we have fasted and prayed about it and we are
trying to live righteously so I’m sure the Lord will bless us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I’m sure you and the farm committee have been
disappointed in your past farm managers and hired help – Clarence, Eldon, Tom,
Dan and several others.  With Clarence, we got so we didn’t like to be around
him as he had gotten so negative.  He was either complaining about his health,
the long hard hours he worked, that he didn’t feel he had the support of the
farm committee, the work crews not showing up, his wife’s health due to these
problems, etc.  After Clarence was let go, he came out here later and felt bad
that he had worked these several years and given his all to the farm and after
his health made it impossible to work like he had, he was replaced.  He said no
one thanked him or appreciated all that he had done before.  He also felt bad
that Eldon had taken over and was letting things get run down.  We had heard
that the dairy farm used to be a showplace and people from all over were
brought to the farm and shown around because the church was proud of it, so I’m
sure Clarence, at one time, was a good farm manager and took pride in his
work.  I can begin to see this happening to Ken and so I can start to realize
how Clarence became this way.  I certainly don’t want this to happen to Ken so
maybe it’s for the best that we leave.  We, too, were disappointed with Eldon
and upset that he would be dishonest like it appears he was.  We don’t know how
you feel about us, but we don’t want to leave with you thinking we are
ungrateful or letting you down, or that we are dishonest.  I would hope that we
can work out any problems or misunderstandings before we leave.  That is my
main reason for writing this letter to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken talked to Pres. Johnson, who is at the
Bishops storehouse, and over the farms; the other day at church.  He lives in
the Stansberry ward.  Ken wanted him to stop our savings program that we had
sent in previously.  He was shocked to hear we were quitting and he said he
felt that Ken and Vern (Vern runs the Granger Stake Farm) were the two best
farm managers the church had.  He said he knew they were in his district.  He
felt bad that we couldn’t work things out to stay.  Many who have been out here
on the work crews have made comments like “you must really love farming to work
like this at your salary.”  Even Dave Williams commented that he would like to
live and work on a beautiful farm like this, but they would have to pay him a
lot more to do it.  When LeRoy was hired, Dave said he was embarrassed to offer
him such a low wage, and he would like to hire Ken as a computer programmer
where he could make more money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I know you told us several times that you felt
Ken was doing a good job and you appreciated him, yet no one from the farm
committee have called to tell Ken, thanks or that they are sorry to see him
leave.  And, by letting Kay Petersen manage both farms, Ken felt that all of
you must not have thought he was very important out here since you were not
replacing him and thinking Kay could run both farms..  Maybe since Ken has
gotten the farm in this condition, it won’t be as hard for someone to do it.  I
told Ken I couldn’t understand how he could think of leaving after all he’s
gone through to get this farm to this point.  I can honestly say he has really
worked hard, and put in many long hours and done his very best to make it the
farm it is.  Many times I felt he was neglecting the family and that the farm
came first, but he felt he needed to take the time for the farm for there was
so much to do.  When we moved out here three years ago in September and moved
into the home before it was completed, it was quite an ordeal.  We cooked on a
camp stove for over a week, used a camp cooler, lantern, brought water from the
well, etc., because we didn’t have any utilities.  Then each day improvements
were made.  They poured the basement floor and put the windows in.  That really
helped because the flies were so bad.  Gradually we got the utilities, brick on
the home, fireplace, steps and driveway and sidewalks.  Then we started on the
landscaping.  The first two winters Ken built our two bedrooms downstairs in his
spare time and this last winter, he built our beautiful family room.  I guess
it’s harder for me to leave all this than him, because he said he couldn’t feel
good about leaving it if it wasn’t beautiful like this.  I’m glad he does feel
this way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The two main reasons we are leaving, which we’ve
already discussed with you are: we couldn’t feel we are building up anything
for the future.  We have not got a home that’s building up equity and we have
not been able to afford to buy any property or put much in savings because of
our low wage.  In fact, we sold our home in Taylorsville to pay off some bills
so we could afford to come to the farm at this low wage.  Ken has always wanted
to farm and he felt this would be so good for the family.  The children could
work with him and we’d be out in the country with animals, etc.  It hasn’t
worked out like he thought it would.  With Ken being a perfectionist, he put in
so many hours on the farm that he didn’t have much time for the family.  And
the children, with the exception of Sandi, were too young to help him much. 
They rode around on the tractor with him some, but then they would get bored
and get off. He was as busy on Saturdays as the rest of the week, and when he
was put in the Bishopric, that meant Sundays were really busy as well as
several evenings where he could squeeze them in.  One evening he came in and
said he didn’t know whether it was worth it or not as he wasn’t enjoying the
family like he thought he would and he didn’t know how we could afford wedding
receptions, missions, etc., at the rate we were going.  With this offer on his
mind, he felt maybe that was the answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are grateful that you let us get this nice
home and put up the fence, furnishings, finish the basement, etc.  I’m sure you
did this to make us happy and show your appreciation.  You have been good to us
in many ways and we appreciate it.  I will miss it and wish we could have
worked it out somehow to stay.  Ken feels that the problems with Dave aren’t
getting any better.  Dave told Ken he would get back with him about the wiring
and plumbing for the big building before the weekend, but he never called. 
With Ken being a perfectionist, he expects the same in others.  When they are
supposed to do something, he expects them to follow through.  I tried to tell
him he needs to learn patience, but he couldn’t seem to do it and was having
stomach problems because of nerves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another thing Ken was concerned about was Kay
Petersen.  When you hired Kay several months ago, you told Ken that Kay and his
family were so much like us – that they even looked a lot like us, and that Kay
had been a computer programmer before also.  We were thrilled and excited to
meet them.  We liked them right from the beginning and thought we had become
good friends.  When Bishop Rose told Ken that Kay would manage both farms and
that you said it was probably a good thing because there were problems between
the two managers, you could have knocked Ken over with a feather because he was
completely unaware that there had been any problems between them.  He liked Kay
and felt they had a good relationship.  He had voluntarily offered to help
remodel the one home on the dairy farm for Kay’s brother-in-law to move into
since they couldn’t get the men out from the stakes to do it.  Ken got behind
in his spring work by doing this, but he wanted to help them out.  He also
heard from another source that Kay was complaining about Ken and back biting
him.  When Ken asked Kay about this the other day, Kay said he was unaware that
there were any problems between them, that sometimes they didn’t always agree
on how to repair things or go about doing things, but that was normal because
they were two different men.  They are two different men, and I do hope that’s
all there is to it, because we have thought a lot of Kay and his family and
would be disappointed to learn that he has been politicking to get this
managers position.  Since Kay has taken over, his attitude has changed.  Both
LeRoy and Ken have noticed it.  One incident was the next day when Kay came
out.  When he got ready to leave, he hooked up the sprayer and was going to
drive off with it.  Ken asked him how long he would have it because he needed
to use it to spray the barley field in a day or so.  Kay said he didn’t know, so
consequently the barley was late being sprayed.  Another day Kay broke the
ogger and Ken tried to tell him how to fix it, but he wouldn’t listen so he
worked on it all morning and finally did it the way Ken had suggested.  We had
never seen this side of Kay before, and maybe it’s because he’s upset with us
that we’re leaving.  I hope that’s it.  But his attitude seems to reflect that
“I’m the manager now and I’ll make the decisions,” so Ken has let him make the
decisions and take over since that seems to be what he wants.  Both Kay and
L.B., especially L.B., have questioned Ken about the farm, equipment, how
everything works, etc.  Ken is telling them everything he knows, has learned,
his ideas and suggestions in order to help them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In order that there will not be any questions as
to our honesty, I’d like to tell you about Ken’s tools, the truck, telephone
bill, etc.  Ken had many tools when he came to the farm and when men came out
and didn’t bring tools with them, he let them use his.  Consequently, many have
been lost or broken.  He doesn’t feel he has the money to replace them himself
so he told Kay about it and he told Ken to let the farm buy them to replace
them.  He has done this, but he feels he is being honest about it.  We also
want to settle up on the telephone bill, if you feel it is too high, and it
could very well be, as we had to make several long distance calls with regards
to Sandi’s reception.  We have used the truck for personal use occasionally
when our car was broken down or transportation was critical.  We tried to
replace the gas, but I would like to pay $20.00 more to make sure.  I hope this
will be alright, for I know the truck was for farm use.  This last week Ken has
been fixing the motorcycle, fixing the car, as it wasn’t running right, and I
didn’t want him to leave me for a month and have the car go out on me.  He’s
also been getting his tools together and getting things ready to leave.  At
nights, neighbors, friends and family have wanted to get together with us
before we leave, so the evenings have been taken up pretty much.  Consequently,
Ken hasn’t worked as hard on the farm itself.  Since Kay is making the
decisions and L.B. is working out here with Bishop Rose, Ken has felt they
haven’t needed him as much and he needed to take care of these things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I want to leave the house and yard clean and
neat as I know it belongs to the stakes and to the Lord and I’m thankful for
the time we enjoyed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I would just like to say a word or two about
Bishop Rose.  He was disappointed that he wasn’t chosen to take over Ken’s
position here on the farm and move into our home.  He is a wonderful man and
good farmer and he loves farming so I hope things will work out for him so he
will stay.  I felt really good when he accepted the offer to work here with
Ken.  He’s worked really well with Ken and helped him so much.  I feel that
with the experience he’s gained in working here on the farm with Ken, and his
other farming experience, that he is really a valuable man for you.  He’s been
a Bishop and is now a High Counselor – so you can see that he is a spiritual
man also.  I don’t know how this will work with Kay managing the farm, and L.B.
and Bishop Rose working together, but I surely hope it will work out for the
best and that the farm will keep producing as well or better for you.  Ken used
to carry a notebook and pencil in his pocket and as he would see things that
needed to be done, he would write them down and see that they got done.  We’re
not resentful about Kay being over both farms, we were surprised, but we know
it was our decision to quit.  We want what’s best for the Lord’s farm and we
hope Kay has the farm knowledge and what it takes to make it work.  Probably
you’ve all prayed about it – so it will work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I didn’t get this mailed to you when I thought I
would, and Dave came out to talk with us last Sunday Evening.  He was really
sweet and after talking with him and his wife, we feel much better.  In fact, I
debated as to whether to send this letter to you now or not.  I asked Dave
whether he knew Kay had been complaining about Ken or not, and he said Kay
thought a lot of Ken and he was sure that was not true.  We feel better towards
Kay and we will believe that this other was probably rumor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I didn’t mean to write such a long letter.  I guess
when I got started, I didn’t know when to quit.  Thank you again for everything
and we hope everything turns out for the best for all of us.  Sincerely, Mae
Browning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P.S. Ken is unaware of me writing this letter and possibly
wouldn’t approve of me doing this.  So I would appreciate it if you would keep
this confidential or use it with wisdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ken came down first and started working with Larry and then
with other contractors doing the finish work.  He found us a nice new home to
rent in a good area off Southern and Gilbert.  It was a three bedroom home and
no basement.  (Not many homes in Arizona have basements.  Not sure why not.) 
We put Shellie and Jeff in one room, the three older boys in another and we had
the third bedroom.  Soon after, Jeff wanted to be with his brothers and Shellie
wanted her own room, so we put him in with the other boys.   We had bunk beds
and a twin bed for the three boys so we put Jeff’s crib mattress under the bunk
bed and at night, would pull it out and he would sleep on it on the floor.  He
thought that was great. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When we moved from Erda to Arizona
the 2<sup>nd</sup> time, we had to leave Spunky and our cat here with the new
farm manager.  We were sad to leave them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We really enjoy the ward here.  It
is the 40<sup>th</sup> ward.  We walk to church all the time as it is a block
and a half away.  Three weeks after we got here, they asked me to teach the
seven year olds in Jr. Sunday School.  Soon afterwards, they asked Ken to be
the Finance Chairman of the ward.  A few weeks later, the lst of August, they
called me in and asked if I would be the lst counselor to <b>Mary Ann Merrill</b>
in the Primary.  They were reorganizating the Primary Presidency and Mary Ann
had asked for me to be her counselor.  I really enjoyed working with Mary Ann. 
She is a beautiful young woman with a lot of confidence.  She is a hard worker
and very dedicated.  She is also very talented.  She has a wonderful husband
and two cute little children, a boy and a girl.  We became good friends right
from the start.  I can’t remember the other counselor that much, but I really
remember Mary Ann.  In fact, we wrote back and forth for some time after we
moved away.  I think it was my fault that we still don’t keep in touch.  Anyway,
I was just learning my job and getting to know the sisters and children, when
the first part of November<b>, the Bishopric called me in and said they were
making some changes - that they were changing Mary Ann to be the Laurel leader
in YWMIA and they wanted me to be the new president</b>.  I was very surprised
to say the least.  I had just found out shortly before this calling, that I was
pregnant again.  We hadn’t planned this pregnancy, in fact I was using birth
control as we felt six children was a good sized family and I was getting close
to 40 years old.  (I was 39).  When I called to tell Sandi, she said:  “Mom,
I’m supposed to be having the babies now, not you.”  I told her we hadn’t
planned to have another baby, in fact, I had the doctor insert a “coil” after
Jeff was born, but somehow I had gotten pregnant anyway.  I wasn’t happy when I
found out, at least at first. I wasn’t feeling good.  I didn’t have morning
sickness so much, but I was sick in the afternoons and evenings.  I didn’t have
any energy and didn’t feel like taking on this responsibility.  I told the
Bishop that I was pregnant, but he didn’t seem to think that was a concern.  He
practically said “so!”  I prayed about it and accepted.  I have enjoyed this
position and my counselors, secretaries and in-service leaders are terrific
women.  I think I mentioned earlier in my history that when we moved into the
40<sup>th</sup> ward, I was both surprised and excited to find that one of my Laurel girls from when we lived in Arizona the first time, had married, had a baby and was
living in this ward.  I learned that she had matured from those Laurel
days and was a neat young woman.  I asked for her to be one of my counselors. 
Her name was Sharla, and she did a great job and I grew to love her even more. 
I never had to worry whether these sisters were doing their jobs; they always
went the extra mile in everything they did.  Our teachers are also wonderful
and most of them are doing a splendid job.  That sure made my job a lot
easier.  My main challenge was keeping us staffed as so many moved out all the
time or were called to other positions.  They were just making the change to
the block program just as we were moving back to Utah, so we were in a lot of
meetings to begin implementing it, but the new president had the bulk of the
changes to make.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>This move to Arizona seemed more like a
vacation to me because we went swimming just about every day</b>.  We bought a
$10 swimming pass to the Jr High School and this entitled us to swimming
lessons for the children as well.  So we took advantage of it.  Ken started
work at 6:00 a.m. in the mornings in the summer because it was so hot - and
would get home soon after 2:00.  We would all change into our swimming suits
and take off to the pool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also enjoyed this time as I took more time to
read the scriptures.  I had been to a lecture by Bro. Covey who told us that we
should pray before studying the scriptures and this would help us to understand
the scriptures better and to gain more from them.  I did this and I enjoyed
reading and pondering the scriptures so much.  I would cry many times as I read
about the Savior and felt the spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I felt the children adjusted very well.  They
all had good friends and good teachers at school.  <b>Shellie </b>loved Jr.
High and Mutual.  Her Mutual teacher was Sister Jacks and always did such
special things for the girls and gave wonderful lessons.  In fact, Sister Jacks
gave a beautiful lesson one evening and Shellie really felt the spirit strong
and this really helped her testimony of the gospel grow.   Shellie was lst
counselor in her Beehive class<b>.   Mike &amp; David</b> got involved in
sports.  They were in Primary Softball soon after we moved here.  This is the
first place where they had Primary teams, instead of city teams.  They played
their games at 6:00 in the mornings, so needless to say we were early risers. 
They also played on the soccer team after <img width=286 height=1

align=left hspace=12>school began.  They loved to ride their bikes and go
fishing at Finch Park.  Since it was so close they were able to ride their bikes
there.  They loved to go swimming, play darts, sleep at friend’s homes, go
camping, etc. They had a paper route together which was once a week.  Gangs
were just coming about while we were there and there was a gang called the “8<sup>th</sup> Street Lobos”.  8<sup>th</sup> street wasn’t far from where we lived and so
there were a couple of incidents involving them.  One time a gang member chased
Mike &amp; David while they were doing their paper route.  I don’t recall the
other incident, but Mike, David &amp; Shellie could tell us as it was vivid in
their minds.  <b>Mike &amp; David won trophies at the cup scout pine wood derby</b>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b> Scott</b> had a little girl his age that
lived across the street.  They played together most of the time, which kept him
happy. <b> Jeff</b> was really a little go-getter.  He was always into things
or else he wanted to be held but he was so cute that I enjoyed holding him.  I
became pregnant the last of August.  After I adjusted to the idea of having
another baby, I became more excited.  I was worried, however, because we were
experiencing financial problems again.  Building had gone into a recession again. 
It seems Larry always talks us into coming into it when it was at a “High”, but
soon after we get started, it falls again and we don’t have the money to keep
us going.  I was worried how we would support another child.  We had been
praying and soon our prayers were answered as Vern Pankratz called to ask Ken
if he would be interested in coming up and running the Grantsville State Farm
because they were discharging the man and his son who had been running it.  We
were excited to move back to be around Sandi and her family and our parents,
brothers &amp; sisters again, and especially since this hadn’t worked out in
the construction business. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I was excited to move back to
Utah.  I like Arizona, but I missed being close to our daughter, Sandi, Dave
and our granddaughter, JaNae.  I also missed living close to our parents,
brothers, sister and their families. and able to visit them and go to the
family activities and holidays - Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc., and I was
excited to be back on a farm where the children could work with their dad and
learn the value of work and also have fun because there is lots to do on a farm
– not just work, but play too.  The farm had a nice home on it as well as a
chicken coop, place for a large garden, fruit trees, etc.  It was a mile up a
dirt road to the farm, but it was pretty with trees on both sides of the road
with a creek giving them water.  I had loved Erda and felt I would love
Grantsville also, and I hope Ken and the children would also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> <b>“Amy” -</b> I had gone to the
doctor several times when we lived in Mesa, Arizona and was concerned that this
baby wasn’t as active as my other’s had been.  The doctor always assured me
that this was probably a petite little girl and that she was fine.  When we
moved to Grantsville and I went to a doctor in Salt Lake, I found out that the
baby was not “fine”.  He couldn’t get a heart beat so he took an ultra sound
and found the baby was dead.  That was devastating to me and also to the rest
of the family.  He told me that I would probably just sluff it off in a few
days, but he wanted to see me every other day and take a blood test to make
sure I would be alright.  After about two weeks he decided to do a D &amp; C. 
Since the baby was dead, he felt it had shrunk so he didn’t give me anything
for the pain.  He just started the labor.  It was a little girl and she had water
on the brain so her head had grown very large and she came breach.  It was very
painful, in fact, the most pain I have ever been in and I went into shock.  I
was convulsing.  They kept piling on warm blankets, but I was shaking
uncontrollably.  I finally recovered, but was angry with the doctor that he
hadn’t given me anything for the pain even when I asked for it.  Since the baby
was dead, I didn’t know why they couldn’t give me a shot or something.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I went in for my six week’s checkup he said
I was in every good condition for a woman my age and that if we wanted a baby,
we should send for it right away.  We were so disappointed over losing “Amy”
that we decided to try again.  I did get pregnant, but lost it at 3 months.  I
went into such a depression that Ken was really worried.  When I went into him
again for my six week checkup, he again said it was a “fluke” and that I should
try again.  I told him that I would raise the 6 children I had because if I got
pregnant again and lost it, I was pretty sure they would lose me.  I was upset
that he would even suggest that again.  I didn’t realize it until later, but
Shellie &amp; Jeff grieved over losing Amy as they really wanted a little
sister.</p>

align=left hspace=12>When we were leaving Arizona the 2<sup>nd</sup> time and
were moving to Grantsville for Ken to manage the Grantsville Stake Farm, Larry
&amp; Tammy had a dog named <b>Naunoo.  </b>He was a black lab and since he was
large and black and it was hot in Arizona, they asked if we would take her with
us to Utah.  It was Lonnie’s dog and he hadn’t wanted to give her away, but his
dad convinced him that Naunoo would be much better off and much happier on the
farm, so Lonnie told us “Please don’t change her name – her name is Naunoo.  We
promised him we wouldn’t.   Naunoo did love the farm and our family and we
loved her.  She was so affectionate and fun to be with.  Jeff was just a little
guy only a year and a half old when we moved to Grantsville so he grew up with
her – at least for the first few years.  All of us loved Naunoo, but especially
Jeff.  We had a tom cat which we loved too and when the boys would take their
guns to go in the fields to kill Starlings, Naunoo and Tom would go with them. 
Ken allowed them to shoot these birds as they were a messy bird that would get
into the farm buildings and make messes all over everything.  When they would
shoot a bird, Tom was right there to get it and eat it.  One time the bird was
falling and then recovered and was about to fly away when Tom jumped so high
and grabbed the bird with its claws.  Sandi &amp; Dave lived not far from us in
Grantsville and they had a dog named <b>“Penny”.</b>  Dave brought it over to
Ken and asked Ken if he would kill it for him as it’s back was broke and it was
suffering.  Dave was a mighty hunter, but he wouldn’t shoot this dog.  We found
out later that he had been mad at the dog and kicked it with his boot and that
was the problem.  The children saw Penny and loved her right away and talked
their dad out of shooting her that night.  They doctored her, cared for her and
gave her lots of attention and she was much better the next day so they asked
if we could keep her.  Ken gave in and we did keep her.  She was such a cute
dog too.  Her and Naunoo became good friends.  Penny was black too, and you
would see the big black dog with the small black dog following her around.  Ken
used to go to Grantsville for equipment, supplies, materials, etc., when they
had them there rather than have to go to Salt Lake.  Many times he would be
going to a neighbors or to Vern Pankratz, who was the farm manager in Erda. 
Whenever he went out to the truck, Naunoo &amp; Penny would follow him.  Naunoo
would jump in the back, but Penny was too little, but wanted to go too so Ken
would lift her in.  One day, he was in a hurry and didn’t notice Penny.  Naunoo
had jumped in and Ken started the truck and started down the lane.  Penny stood
there looking surprised and then started off after them.  She ran &amp; ran,
but couldn’t catch them.  She stopped, looked around at me, then starting
running after the truck again.  Finally she realized that she couldn’t catch
them, so she turned back around and started trudging back up the road with her
head hanging down.  She was so sad.  It made me sad to see her like this. I
told Ken and he laughed, but felt bad too.  The next time, she tried jumping
into the truck and she tried several times and finally made it.  After that,
she always jumped into the truck herself..  She wasn’t going to be left behind
again.  There were skunks on the farm and Naunoo would kill them.  She would
corner it in the field and it would try to spray her, but she would run so
quickly around it that it could stand still long enough to spray her, finally
Naunoo would grab it by the neck, give it a quick, hard shake and toss it.  It
would break the skunk’s neck.  He did this many time, but one time she wasn’t
quick enough and the skunk got her.  She couldn’t understand why we wouldn’t
let her close to us and we would throw rocks at her to keep her away.  A few
days later when it was bearable to have her closer, we washed her with tomato
juice and that helped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I will attempt to give a <b>brief summary update
of the Kenneth H Browning family</b> from the time we lived in Grantsville, Utah on the Grantsville Stake Farm which was at the time I had the privilege
of complying the Byron Porter Family Descendants book.  The books were sold at
our Porter reunion on July 4, 1983.</p>

align=left hspace=12>The farm was great for our 4 sons.  <b>Shellie</b> wasn’t
so sure she liked it when we first moved there, but was happy to be close to
her sister, Sandi again.  At first Shellie had a hard time making friends, and
the friends who accepted her were not the best kind.  She didn’t feel
comfortable with them, but needed friends.  I was concerned and talked to
Jeanie Burgess, a friend in our ward, as she had a daughter, Becky, who was
Shellie’s age, about her and Shellie becoming friends.  It turned out that one
day when Shellie went to lunch, her friends were not there and she saw Becky
and some other girls sitting close by eating lunch so she went over and asked if
she could eat lunch with them.  She enjoyed them and they were friendly to
her.  When her other friends came in and asked her to come over with them, she
declined.  From that time on, she left the former friends and stayed with Becky
and the other girls.  She was much happier.  <b>Shellie soon enjoyed it as she
became a flag twirler for the band in high school and a cheerleader</b>.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One incident I will insert, was after Shellie
got her driver’s license and she had to drive our station wagon some times. 
One winter day, she took Jeff with her (Jeff was only 5 years old, but very
perceptive and had the spirit guide him, even as young as he was).  There were
two dirt roads coming up to the farm.  The main one we drove was tree lined and
beautiful, the other was further west and more barren, but some farm land. 
Shellie was starting to drive down the main one when <b>Jeff said excitedly
“No, don’t drive down this way, go the other way.</b>”  Shellie couldn’t see
why he should say this and she was in a hurry, so she brushed it aside, even
when he kept telling her to not go down this road.  It wasn’t long until she
saw a pickup truck coming up the road.  There wasn’t much room to pass,
especially since there was lots of snow.  She tried to put on the brake, but
the roads were slippery and she slip into the truck.  He had tried to stop
also.  Well, she totaled out the station wagon.  She told me later that she
thought her dad would be really angry and upset with her, but he was patient
and kind and she said she was sure thankful, but she wished she had listened to
Jeff.  I remember having Jeff with me one night as we were going down a dark,
lonely road.  Jeff said “Mom, don’t go down this road.” I knew to listen to
him, so we turned around.  I don’t know what would have happened, but probably
something bad as that were the only times he said that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mike and David</b> - they were a big help to their dad on
the farm.  One of their responsibilities was to change the water pipes to
irrigate the crops.  They had different experiences with moving the pipes. 
Sometimes they met up with snakes or mice or other critters.   When the barley
was high, all you could see was the sprinkler pipes moving as they walked along
to change them. They also helped with most of the farming; at least all Ken felt
they were capable of doing.  One incident with Mike was when he was on the
tractor baling hay.  Ken saw the tractor just sitting out in the field, so he
drove the three-wheeler over to see what the problem was.  Mike told him that
something was caught in it and so he shut off the tractor.  Ken chewed him out
and told him that he wasn’t to just sit there, but he was to get off and see
what the problem was and see if he could fix it himself.  Mike learned a good
lesson from that which served him the rest of his life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another experience with Mike was when he was
plowing and he was off the tractor getting a tool out of the toolbox which was
fastened to the tractor.  Mike felt something down by his leg and he saw a <b>gopher</b>
which was chewing on his pant leg.  He grabbed the hammer and hit it on the
head.  He thought he would take it home for Tom, our cat, to eat, so put it in
the tool box, but when he opened the tool box to give it to Tom, it was alive
and running around.  David was there with Mike, so said “Let’s keep it as a
pet..”  Mike agreed so they got a five gallon bucket, filled it with dirt and
put the gopher in it.  They checked it often to put food and water in the
bucket for the gopher, and they played with it.  Ken agreed that they could
keep it.  One day our phones wouldn’t work, so we called the repair man.  He
found that the line had been chewed through and that was the reason the phones
wouldn’t work.  The repairman asked if we had a dog or cat that might have done
this.  Mike &amp; David hadn’t seen the gopher for a few days, so asked if it
might have been it.  We assumed that it was as we didn’t have our dog and cats
in the house.  The repairman had fixed the cord and was filling out his report
and said “Well, I’m not going to put down that a gopher was a pet and had
chewed it, I will just put down that it was a pet.”  We all laughed about that. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I mentioned that our animals were farm animals
and not house pets, but one time we had a mouse in the house, so we brought Tom
in to catch and eat it, but he was so scared to be in the house that he
wouldn’t do it.  In Erda, we had a Tom there too (different Tom) and he was fat
and lazy because we had a mother cat who was skinny because she would go out in
the fields and catch mice and bring them back to feed Tom and her kittens.  One
day I was out hanging clothes on the clothes line and this cat was bringing in
a mouse for the other cats or Tom, but when she saw me, <b>she ran over to me
and dropped the mouse at my feet.</b>  It was still alive and ran over my foot
to try to get away.  I jumped and screamed.  The cat looked at me in surprise,
ran and got the mouse again and took it over to Tom.  I guess she was trying to
be good to me by giving me the mouse, and she was disgusted that I didn’t want
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The younger boys had chores and responsibilities
also. <b>One incident I’ll mention which involved Scott</b> still scares me
when I think of it.  Scott was with his dad up in the fields and his dad told
him <b>to drive the tractor down to the shop and park it there.  Scott was only
7 or 8 years old, as I remember</b>.  Ken showed him a little about the tractor
and sent him on his way.  Partway down the dirt road which had ruts in it, the
tractor tire fell into one of the ruts and threw the tractor off the road and
it was headed down into the field.  It scared Scott, but he had presence of
mind enough to shut the tractor off.  He then jumped down off the tractor and
came running as fast as he could to the house.  When I found out what had
happened, I was really upset with Ken that he would put such a young child on
that tractor and have him drive it.  Scott could have been really hurt.  Ken
tells me that his dad had him doing things like that at a young age, but I sure
don’t agree with it.  Ken had Jeff drive the 3 wheeler along as he worked on
the wheel lines.  I felt Jeff was too young, but Ken felt he could and needed
his help.  Jeff thought it was great.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            <b>Mike and David were in the school marching
band</b>.  They both played the trumpet, but after a while the band leader
asked Mike if he would play the sousaphone.  It was a big instrument, but Mike
was a fairly large boy so he was able to carry it and play it well. This band
teacher, Mr. Jarvin or something was that,  was excellent and so they had a
great band.  They had beautiful band uniforms and marched in parades, not just
in Grantsville, but other places as well.  I remember talking to Mr. Jarvin one
day and thanking him for what a great teacher he was and how Mike &amp; David
enjoyed being in the band.  I told him that they were both involved in sports
also.  He said “That’s good as music and sports work together and help the
student do well in academics also.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mike and David played “Little League baseball”.</b>  Ken
was usually too busy on the farm to go watch their games, but I think I went to
all of them.  Both boys were on separate teams and both played “pitch” on their
team.  I would go to both of their games, but when the two teams played each
other, I would sit and cheer for the one who was pitching, but when the brother
on the other team was at bat, I would run around to the other team’s fans and
cheer for him.  The people thought it was funny watching me run back and
forth.  One time Mike was pitching and David bating and Mike hit David with the
ball and David got to walk.  The crowds laughed about that.  We lived in
Grantsville for four years and so as the boys got older they played football
and basketball.  I remember David playing baseball for the church team.  He was
really good at it and I loved watching him.  Baseball or softball is one of my
favorite sports to watch, and it’s always much better if you have a son on the
team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>One incident I will tell is one day
when Ken and I went down to the Elementary School to pick up the kids.  We
parked in front and then we noticed that a <b>big kid was bullying Mike and
pushing him around, out on the lawn.  </b>I was about to jump out of the car
and stop the kid, but Ken saw David coming out of the school door and said
“Wait a minute,<b> let’s see what David does.”</b>  Well. When David saw the
kid pushing his brother around, he came running and like a wild cat, he jumped
on the kid’s back and started hitting, clawing and kicking him.  The kid had a
hard time getting David off his back, but when he did, he took off running.  That
was something to see.  David will sometimes get mad at Mike and they will fight
or wrestle, but nobody better hurt his brother.</p>

an operation to have his tonsils out when he was 16.</b>  There was another
girl, who was also 16 who was just before Mike.  When she was in recovery, she
was crying, she wouldn’t eat popsicles, or drink anything, while Mike got along
great and ate and drank the liquids they asked him to.  He then was able to get
up and go finish playing video games while he recovered.  He had been playing them
while he waited for his operation.  The girl’s mother asked me how Mike was
doing so well and her daughter was doing so bad and they were both the same
age.  I didn’t know, but I was proud of Mike.  </p>

good boys and helped their father on the farm too, as I have mentioned.  They
also helped me.  We had some fun family home evenings.  One I will insert is
when we held it on our roof.  Ken was trying to explain that we don’t just have
to sit on the chairs to have family home evening, but the one who is conducting
can visit with the one giving the lesson and work out where they want to have
it and how, as long as we are all together and enjoying being together.  Our
son, David, who was 10 years old asked: Then, can I have it up on our roof? 
Ken said “yes” and when it was time, he got out the ladder and I got a quilt
and we all climbed up on our roof and had a wonderful time with songs, prayers,
lessons, activity and refreshments.  Although, I have to tell you that we were
living on a farm at the time and our closest neighbor was ½ mile away.  (This
picture is of Scott &amp; David standing on their heads.)</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>My Uncle Dale, my dad’s youngest brother, called one
day to ask if I would be interested in putting together a “Porter” book</b>. 
Histories and genealogy of My Grandfather &amp; Grandmother Porter, Byron &amp;
Mary Elizabeth (May) and their descendants.  He said he knew I loved family
history work, and if I felt I could, he would pay for me to go to the Family
History Conference in Salt Lake that the church was sponsoring.  He felt it
would be helpful.  He said he would finance the book and then after the
completion, we would sell them at cost to family members.  I agreed and was
excited.  The conference was helpful.  It was a three-day conference.  I stayed
at our niece, Sheryl Bottom’s (Ken’s sister, Margaret’s daughter) home the two
nights rather than drive back &amp; forth.  I enjoyed visiting with them each
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I contacted all our relatives both by mail &amp;
phone and asked them to submit a brief history of their family along with a
family history sheet and family pictures.  I set a deadline for them to get
them in, but ended up setting several deadlines as everyone is so busy that it
took awhile to get them all in.  In the meantime, I wrote my grandparent’s
history and my Aunt Maurine and Uncle Royals who were deceased also.  Aunt
Maurine had written some of her history and also some about her parents.  I
also contacted each of the immediate family and asked them to write down things
about their parents, sister and brother.  Some felt that grandma had written a
history, but we couldn’t find it.  I prayed about it and before the book was
printed, Aunt Beth found it at her home.  I was very grateful.  I had already
put one together on her, but added hers.  Grandpa Porter had written some on
his life also - that I put in.  It took me three years to complete this book
and felt that was a long time, but when we took it to the printer (Stevenson’s
in Prove - he is a relative) he said for a book that size he takes 10 or more
years sometimes - so I felt better.  I got it all typed in rough draft, but
Verla, my cousin and Uncle Verle &amp; Aunt Beth’s daughter, retyped it on her
computer at work at BYU.  That was a lot of work also and I sure appreciated
her help.  This was a wonderful time putting this together and inserting the
pictures, family history sheets, pedigree charts, etc.  I had a lady do the calligraphy
which said “Byron Porter Family Descendants.  This was a spiritual time and a
joyous time.  I felt closer to my grandparents and all they went through in
this life, yet remained faithful.  I grew close to my aunts, uncles &amp;
cousins because of their histories and working with them on this endeavor. 
Everyone seemed pleased with the finished product.  We wanted the cost to be
affordable so everyone could have one who wanted one.  Uncle Dale gave me &amp;
Verla one and the family signed it at the reunion.  I wanted one for each of my
children and since the price was right, I was able to do it.  We were able to
only charge $4.00 a book because Uncle Dale paid a lot of the cost.  Uncle Dale
wanted to pay me for doing this from money he got when Uncle Royal died.  Uncle
Royal worked for Uncle Dale &amp; Uncle Dale had him in a profit sharing
trust.  Uncle Royal never married - so this money just came back to Uncle
Dale.  I told Uncle Dale to put that money towards the books also, as it was a
privilege to be able to put together this book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>In Grantsville, I was probably the most
involved in community and volunteer organizations than I have ever been</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            A good friend in the ward talked to me about
joining the “<b>Eagle Forum</b>” headed by Phillis Schaffley.  Phillis is a
lawyer and really concerned about the decaying morals and the evils in today’s
world.  She organized this organization that is now nationwide.  She has paid
lobbyists to lobby for the bills, etc., for the traditional family.  She sends
out a monthly letter informing us of the issues that she and the organization
are fighting.  She asks us to make others aware, send around petitions, speak
out, send money to help the cause, send for more pamphlets to send to people,
come to conventions, etc.  I really feel strongly that she is an honest,
inspired woman who cares about the constitution, children and the American family
and is doing all she can - speaks everywhere - college campus’s, congress,
organizations and other women’s clubs, etc., etc.  She is fighting for the
right.  She has a cause and at that time I did get involved and tried to do
what I could.  I still pay my dues each year and continue to get the
newsletters, but am so busy with work, family, elderly mothers, church, etc.,
that many months I don’t even take time to read them.  I wish I had more time
to do more with it now too.  It is a good cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also attended the <b>“Freeman Institute”taught
by Cleon Scousin </b>at Grantsville High.   I bought several books from Cleon
Scousin.  He was trying to educate all of us on the constitution and the
founding fathers, and what has happened to our constitution and what we can do
about it.  I felt that was a good cause also. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I wanted to insert a letter, but couldn’t find
it. (2/06/2013)  It was a great letter with Cleon Scowsen praising Phyllis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also joined the <b>Women’s Republican
Organization</b> and went to meetings in Salt Lake and local meetings.  I
volunteered to help at the County Conventions.  I was a voting registrar and
also a judge for the elections.  I did this three of the four years we lived in
Grantsville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Nancy Regan (First Lady) organized <b>“Chemical
People</b>”.  She was really concerned about the youth and the rising problem
of drug &amp; alcohol addition, and the denial of the parents.  She asked
neighborhoods to come together and form neighborhood or city &amp; town
committees.  We met at the city building.  We viewed the televised program
where she spoke and had other adults &amp; youth speak.  Then we were to elect
a president and vice president, set goals and then work to accomplish the task
before us.  They elected Ken as the president and me as the vice president.  We
had a pretty good crowd there.  We did set goals and formed a committee to meet
regularly with us.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>Michelle <u>Killian</u></b><u> was the Stake YWMIA
President.  She lived in our ward, and she asked for me for her 2<sup>nd</sup>
counselor</u>.  I don’t remember what positions I had served in the ward before
being called by the stake for this position.  Michelle is the one standing in
this picture.  <b>Karma Abernathy</b> was the first counselor and she was such
a sweet, beautiful, lady.  She had a son the age of Jeff and they had fun
playing together.  I loved working with Michael and Karma.  Karma is the one
sitting on the right.  Michelle was such a great leader and so efficient and so
spiritual, we became good friends and also good friends with Karma.  I remember
the first Leadership meeting we put on for the ward YWMIA leaders in our
stake.  I have been an stake activity counselor years before and I have always
tried to do my best at whatever I do, and so I had prayed, studied and spent
hours making visual aids, etc., but when the three of us met prior to our
meeting to set up, I was astonished at all they had done.  I felt inadequate
working with them.  It went well and I kept trying to do my best and the Lord
blessed me and helped me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had called Terry Linares to be
over youth conference and since I was over the activities, we worked closely
together and she was great!  Youth Conference was very successful, except for
the fact that we had a couple of boys who broke the rules and should have been
taken home.  The boys left the BYU campus and they were all given a list of the
rules and we discussed them with the youth.  One of the rules was that they
were not to leave the campus for any reason.  If they did, they would be taken
home.  The Stake Young Men’s President would not follow through and see that
they were taken home, even thought he had agreed to the rule in the meetings
when we made the rules.  Terry and I were upset with him.  What good are rules
if they can be broken and have no consequences?  I went to Girl’s Camp as a
stake leader and enjoyed being with the girls and their leaders.  I worked with
the camp director, Shirley Calder, and her and her committee did great too. 
Shellie was at camp that year and that made it even more special.  Shirley told
me that I had been such a great peacemaker and she appreciated that.  Shellie’s
tent was a little rowdy one night and I was asked to go settle them down.  It
turned out that I had lots of fun with them and I was one of the rowdy ones,
but we didn’t cause trouble, we just had fun laughing and talking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The time I spent with Michelle and Karma working
together in the stake YWMIA was great.  I loved our presidency meetings and the
spiritual thoughts we shared at our meetings.  We were busy, but loved working
together and visiting the wards and even speaking in their ward conferences. 
All of us love the youth and were trying to help their leaders help the girls
to be happy and successful by keeping the commandments of the Lord and
following His prophet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I don’t remember how long we served together,
but Michelle was going to be released and she talked with me and told me that
she felt I would be the new president.  I told her “No, that I had loved
serving with her and Karma, but I didn’t feel qualified to be the president.” 
She said she felt I was.  One day, I went for a walk on the farm and sat down
by a tree and prayed and meditated and did have the feeling that I would be
called to be the new stake YWMIA President.  When I wasn’t called and another
lady from Lake Point was called, I thought I must be wrong. and I was relieved
in a way.  But soon I received a call to meet with President Thorton, the
counselor over the YWMIA.  He called me to be a counselor to the new
president.  He said he had had the confirmation that I was to be the new
President, but he talked to our Bishop and our bishop told him that I had
already served in the stake and that they needed me in the ward now, and  since
he was very strong about it, he, President Thorton, told me he called this
other lady, but when she had asked for me to be her counselor, he knew then
that I was supposed to be in this presidency.  He said he talked to the stake
president about it and the stake president said: “We ask the bishops for their
approval, but if they don’t approve, we take them anyway.”  Our bishop was on
vacation when I was sustained as the counselor and when he returned and heard
about it, he was very upset and came over to talk to me about it..  I told him
what President Thorton had told me, and that I try to never turn a calling down
if I feel it is from the Lord, so I had accepted.  This new president, Shirley
Calder had been a friend of mine.  We had played volleyball together and gotten
acquainted, and then she had been the camp director who I had worked with.  We
worked together and had a great time with camp, but now she was different.  She
didn’t get along with the Stake Young Men’s Presidency at all.  I had been
upset with them about youth conference, but I had always respected their
position and we had had good YM/YW stake meetings.  I remember one combined
presidency meeting where President Thorton was with us and Shirley and the
Young Men’s President got to arguing and it was bad, and finally President
Thorton stopped them and told them that the spirit of the Lord had left the
meeting because of the way they were talking and acting.  I sure felt that way
too. I liked the other counselor, but one day after meeting together, we
decided to go out for lunch together.  While we were eating and visiting, the
subject of our husbands came up and both of them back mouthed their husbands so
bad that I was astonished and I told them how I had a great husband.  They said
I was lucky.  Anyway, this presidency was surely not like the presidency I had
been in with Michelle and Karma.  I was in this presidency until we moved to
Firth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Grantsville didn’t have a PTA, but
they did have a <b>Community Council</b> for both the elementary school and
high school.  I joined both and served on committees and in other positions. 
One of the hardest times I had was in 1983.  Planned Parenthood was going full
steam and a man in our community worked for them and was trying to get a “hot
line” into the high school which would enable the youth to call at any time of
the day or night.  They would be able to get contraceptives and counseling
without the permission of their parents.  He wanted to put posters up all over
the school advertising this, and the phone number they could call.  There were
other things too, but I don’t remember all of what I was fighting.  I just knew
we needed to teach the youth “abstinence” - to say “no”, not just give them
contraceptives and especially without their parents knowing anything about it. 
They also were promoting abortion, etc.  I was sick inside and knew I needed to
do whatever I could to stop it.  I talked to a lady in our community who was
really informed and fighting these issues too.  She gave me information to read,
and took time to explain many things to me and told me that since I was on the
community council of the high school, I could have equal time and should make a
stand to stop it.  I called and was put on the agenda.  That was a hard day.  I
was activity counselor in the Stake YWMIA.  The president was Michelle Killian
and the secretary was Pat ?  Michelle was the president of the high school
community council and I was the vice president at that time.  June Johnson was
also on the council.  I had expressed my feelings to Mishelle and Pat at our
YWMIA presidency meeting.  They didn’t share my concerns.  I was really
disappointed - in fact, disgusted with them that day.  Gary was a smooth talker
and presented his information for this program.  I had the floor and presented
my material against.  He rebuttled and then I gave my final statements.  We had
some discussion and I was disappointed in Michelle at the things she said.  We
took a vote and it passed.  To my knowledge only June Johnson (Mike’s best
friend, Bryan’s mother) and I had the courage to vote against it.  I was really
disheartened when I left for home, but I did feel I had given it my all.  I had
prayed and studied and felt I did all I could.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I did fight some issues along this same line in
the elementary school council and had more support there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Shellie asking me why I was gone so
much to all these meetings, etc.  I told her I was doing it for her - for all
my children and for the youth growing up.  I felt Satan was really corrupting
the youth and it was the evil and designing men who were doing it for money,
power, etc.  I had read the book “An Enemy Hath Done This” by Ezra Taft Benson
(who later became our prophet), and I had gone to “Know Your Religion” classes
and BYU Education classes, “Book of Mormon” classes taught by Allen Burgess,
and other seminary teachers in Arizona, etc.  I had gone to many Woman’s
conferences, firesides, etc., where these issues were addressed and we have
been admonished to get involved in community and help elect good people - so I
felt I was doing what I needed to be doing.  I also met with Colleen Gordon (a
good friend who I had gone to school with.  Her husband was our Bishop in Erda)
and others who also felt this way and we were also looking into Home Schooling
our children.  Ken wasn’t in favor of this because he felt it would be too hard
one me.  I also talked to Allen Burgess and he said “Mae, if you take all the
good kids out of the schools to home teach them, what will become of the other
kids?”  He said our kids need to be in the public schools to set a good example
and help these other kids.  I had to agree there.  Allen was the principal of
the seminary in Grantsville.  He had been the Bishop, but was now on the high
council and teaching the Gospel Doctrine class.  He’s the best Gospel Doctrine
teacher I have ever had.  He made the scriptures come alive.  I learned so much
in his classes.  He &amp; Jeannie became our good friends and we did a lot with
them, (and still do).  He had a special day each year where he would ask outside
speakers to come teach his classes for the day.  He asked me to do it that year. 
I was nervous, but fasted and prayed and ended up enjoying doing it.</p>

align=left hspace=12>They elected me as <b>president of the Grantsville High
School Community Council</b> the next year.  I had a good vice president,
secretary and other members on the council.  We accomplished a lot.  One of the
main things was the “AWARENESS DAY” for the school.  A lot of work went into
it.  We sent a survey around the school to find out what types of workshops the
students wanted.  We came up with the following topics: FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS -
LaDell Brown, Counselor for Tooele County,  STRESS - Erick Krenz, a professor
at the University of Utah, STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS - Loretta Giebrink, Tooele
County, SUCCESS, BYU athletes, CAREER’S - Elaine Jones, Professional Job
Counselor, OVERCOMING HANDICAPS, ?, JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE POSITIVE”, Excellent
movie, COMPUTORS, Hands on demonstration of Apple Computer.  These workshops
were repeated so that students could choose and take 2 of them.  We then had a
dating panel - a group from East High.  After lunch the students could choose 2
of the following workshops: TEEN RECOVERED ALCOHOLIC - Brandon Creer, ODYSSEY
HOUSE RESIDENTS, UTAH STATE PRISON INMATES AND SELF-INCOROPORTED, a teen
improvisational theater troupe.  They sent a prison inmate who shouldn’t  have
come.  He told the students that he had embezzled $500,000 and hid it.  He
liked prison as they could eat wonderful food, play video games, pool, etc. 
There was a question and answer period and a student asked him if he would do
it again if he had the chance and he told them “yes, wouldn’t you do it?  I had
a good vacation here in prison and when I get out I will get the money I hid
and start my own business.”  I didn’t hear this information directly as I was
with the group “Odyssey House Residents” and the principal was with the inmate
and that group in the auditorium, but members of the council, who had been in
the auditorium with the prison inmate came to find me and told me what had
happened and what was said.  I was shocked and upset and asked if the principal
didn’t stop it or do something about it - or the person who brought the
inmate.  She told me “no”.  I ran to the auditorium to do something about it
myself, but it had just gotten over and the students were leaving.  I found the
principal and asked him about it and why he hadn’t stopped it or said something
to the students.  He didn’t explain.  I was so upset because he had left the
impression that CRIME DOES PAY.  I wrote a letter to the warden at the prison
with a copy to go to the governor and to the principal.  I received a letter of
apology back from the warden, but I felt the damage had already been done.  I
was upset that the principal never did anything to try to undo the damage.  I
felt he was a WHIMP and I didn’t have much respect for him after that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>The High School caught fire in February of
that year and practically burned to the ground</b>.  In most areas, it would be
devastating if the high school burned down, but in our community, the building
was a community center as well so it was really devastating for everyone.  It
happened at night.  A boy was upset with his girlfriend who accepted a date for
the school dance with another boy, so he started the garbage container on
fire.  He didn’t intend to burn the building down, but it was close to the
school and it did catch fire.  We woke up to the sound of sirens and the phone
ringing.  It was the principal.  Since I was the High School Community Council
President, he had called me.  I quickly dressed and Ken &amp; I drove down to
the school.  There wasn’t anything anyone could do.  </p>

and Shellie and pick them up later.  They had football practice and
cheerleading practice and games so it was crazy trying to get them to everything
and get them picked up.  Sometimes their friends would bring them home.  Trying
to keep meals going for everyone was crazy also.  One day Mom called and said
her and dad were coming out to spend the day.  I told her that I wouldn’t see
them much because of my schedule for taking the children to and from school and
activities.  She said you can help me quit and dad can run the children back
and forth.  We did this and I had a relaxing day for a change.  Dad would come
in the house and say “who’s next and when do I take them?”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>With being Community Council President I was also trying
to do fund raisers with the council and community to raise money to buy new
uniforms for the band.</b> We made a quilt and raffled it off, we had a dinner
and sold tickets, etc.  We did raise the money and the new band uniforms were
beautiful.  We were busy with other things also and by the end of that year, I
was ready to move to Firth as I think I would have had a nervous breakdown if I
had to go through another year like the last few months had been.  And it did
take another year to rebuild the high school.  Shellie hated to leave her
senior year, but didn’t feel it was so important since she would be going to
the middle school again if she stayed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One Sunday at Sacrament Meeting they announced
that they needed <b>volunteers to usher at the Pioneer Memorial Theater in Salt
Lake City.</b>  I thought that sounded fun.  Ken was busy with being in the
Bishopric so he didn’t feel he could take another night a week and go so I
talked to a friend, <b>Betty Williams.</b>  She liked the idea, so we called
in.  We took turns driving our car and the two of us had fun visiting on the
way to and from Salt Lake.  We really enjoyed ushering and after the play
started, we could find a seat and watch it.  That was great.  My favorite play
was “Annie”.  I loved it all, but especially the songs.  I can’t even remember
the other plays.  We ushered for the one season and it was great.  We even saw
some General Authorities.  President Monson, who was at that time an apostle,
came in with his wife.  I was wishing I could have been their usher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            South Willow Canyon</b> - When Sandi was
still married to Dave Nix, we used to take the rest of our children and go
camping with Sandi, Dave and the girls up South Willow Canyon which is south of
Grantsville.  It has some beautiful campgrounds.  Dave wasn’t a very good
husband or father, but he could cook great “Dutch Oven” meals, which we had up
there.  We usually just put down tarps then quilts and blankets and made a family
bed for all of us.  That was fun.  Dave could be fun, but it was usually about
Dave as he is a self-centered guy.  He was always putting down Sandi, which was
very hard on her self-esteem and hard on us to see him treat our beautiful and
special daughter that way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Farmington Canyon</b> - We also camped with
our children, including Sandi, Dave and their girls up Farmington Canyon.  I
can remember getting in a big water fight up there.  Shellie loves water fights
and she and Dave got into one.  I’m not sure who got the worst of it, but most
of us joined in too as it was a hot day.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>            SPOTLIGHT ON SCOTT BROWNING FOR PRIMARY
NOV. 7, 1982</b>  (Scott was 8 years old)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scott Leon Browning was born in Mesa, Arizona on the 29<sup>th</sup>
of January 1974.  He was a husky little baby.  In fact, the nurse who took care
of him, said she would be very surprised if he didn’t turn out to be a good
football player when he gets in high school because he had such strong muscles
already.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            His family moved back to Utah in 1976 so they
could be near grandparents and other relatives as they had missed them.  Scott
and his family moved into the home in Sunset where his mother grew up so she
had fun showing the children the places where her friends used to live, the
schools which she attended, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Scott is a happy child most of the time, but he
has a temper like his great grandfather, so when he gets mad – look out.  He
does laugh a lot.  Sometimes when he gets to laughing, he can’t stop and he
laughs so hard that he rolls on the ground or floor and he gets everyone around
him laughing hard also as they’re laughing at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Scott was nine months old and he and his
family were at Sacrament meeting, he started whistling.  He just suddenly
started to whistle.  His parents were shocked and started stuffing crackers and
other things into his mouth to keep him from disturbing the other people.  But,
whenever his mouth was empty, he began whistling again.  The teenagers were
pointing at him and smiling or laughing and lots of people came up after the
meeting to see him and hear him whistle.  From then on, he whistled a lot and
we called him the “Happy Little Whistler.”  Maybe he got that talent from his
father and also his Grandmother Porter.  They both whistled a lot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Scott has a talent for gymnastics and he can
turn a perfect cartwheel, stand on his head, do flips like stunt men do, etc. 
He also has a talent for music.  Before he started taking piano lessons he made
up songs or could pick out the songs on the piano by ear.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Scott is a good student in school, he enjoys
baseball and other sports and horseback riding.  He is a good help to his
father on the farm.  His parents are proud of him and love him very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I had some <b>good friends</b> in
Grantsville, especially <b>Allen &amp; Jeanie Burgess</b>.  We got together at
each other’s homes and played games or we would go out to eat together.  When
we moved, we stayed in touch, but we couldn’t do much together as we moved to
Firth, Idaho for two years and then back to Arizona for 9 months, then we moved
back to Utah and moved in with Ken’s mom.  We were there for almost four years,
but when we bought our home in Layton, the four of us did more together again. 
We would take turns going to each other’s homes to play games, but we would go
out to eat first.  We loved being with them, they were such great friends and
good people.  Allen had been a Bishop, stake counselor, and the best Gospel
Doctrine Teacher that I have ever had.  He made the lessons come alive.  Part
of it was because he was a seminary teacher and the seminary principal.  He
asked me to teach his classes one day and gave me the subject.  He was going to
be there, but he wanted his students to be taught by me.  I was really nervous,
but I accepted.  I studied hard and had good visual aids.  I fasted and prayed
and the Lord surely blessed me.  It turned out really good and Allen praised me
for the great job I had done.  Allen taught “Know Your Religion” classes at the
seminary building on Thursday nights, and I went to as many of the classes he
taught as I was able to.  I loved them.  Allen died at a young age – in his
60s.  Jeanie had gone in to wake him up as we hadn’t heard him in the shower. 
She tried to wake him, but he was dead.  He must have died of an aneurism.  He
had had brain cancer and been operated on earlier and it seemed that he was
fine again, but guess not.  Jeanie was too scared to live alone, so she sold
her beautiful home in Grantsville and moved in with her daughter, Becky and her
husband.  They ended up selling their home and building a new home for all of
them.  It worked out well and Jeanie loved being with her family.  She kept
busy making quilts for the church humanitarian service and later she became a
missionary helping members with Family History.   Jeanie had been a Relief
Society President as well as many other positions.  I taught their two oldest
sons in Primary and then in Sunday school.  I made small birthday cakes for the
kids on their birthdays and took it to them.  I taught the oldest Primary class
before they went into scouting and YM &amp; YW.  I had to work with the boys on
a one-to-one at our home to make sure they were caught up on all they needed
before they turned twelve.  I got to know their two sons, as well as the other
boys, really well this way and I enjoyed it.  Jeanie and Ken and I have stayed
in touch, especially with Christmas letters and pictures.  She invited us to
her youngest son’s wedding reception last summer (2016).  He was in his 30s,
but married a beautiful girl in the temple. It was so good to visit with
Jeanie, Becky &amp; her husband and the two other sons.  Brian, the younger son
who I taught in Primary, came and visited with us while we ate and it was fun
reminiscing<span lang=EN style='font-size:12.5pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Some ladies were thinking of “home schooling”
their children because of the language, bullying, etc., at the schools.  I was
thinking about it too, but Ken thought it would be too much for me with
everything else I was doing.  He asked Allen what he thought and he said “If
all the good kids were taken out of the public schools, what would happen to
the other kids.  They need the influence and example of good kids.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Shellie had a hard time moving again and trying
to make friends here in Grantsville.  Some girls befriended her, but it was the
wrong crowd.  I knew Jeanie &amp; Allen had a daughter who was Shellie’s age so
I told Jeanie about Shellie and she told Becky.  Becky saw Shellie in the
cafeteria at school and asked her to come eat lunch with her, and they became
good friends.  The other friends saw her with Becky and told her to come with
them, but she refused and I’m sure glad she did.  She wasn’t happy with these
other girls anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Four Corners (Utah, Colorado,
Arizona &amp; New Mexico) </b>– Sandi, Dave &amp; their girls went with our
family.  We borrowed Mom &amp; Dad’s RV.  We saw Indian Ruins, Went into
Durango &amp; Telluride and camped in the beautiful forest in Colorado.  We had
a great time.  A deer tried to climb into the RV. (We have a DVD with the deer
doing that).  One funny thing was that Chelci climbed a tree and when our son,
David, saw her, he was afraid for her and hurried over and helped her down.  We
laughed about that as when David was four years old, he wasn’t afraid of
anything and he climbed a high pine tree when we were setting up camp at Island
Park and called down to us to see him as he was swinging the top of the tree
back and forth.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were there in Grantsville for four years when
the <b>church consolidated the farms</b> and had one farm manager over all the
farms, and the other farm managers were just farm help.  Vern Pankratz had been
a farm manager 6 months longer than Ken so he was chosen to be the farm
manager.  Since we were not making much money, and now there was no incentive
for Ken, and I was burned out from all the work and problems of this past year,
and Irven had talked us into coming to Idaho and going into business with him
in the A L Williams Insurance Company, we moved to Firth, Idaho.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>36 – HOME IN FIRTH IDAHO
at 447 River Road – June 1984 to June 1986</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken’s younger brother, <b>Irven</b> &amp; his
family, lived in Goshen, Idaho and wanted Ken to move up and go into business
with him in the <b>A.L. Williams Company</b>.  It is a life insurance company. 
Since Ken didn’t want to stay with the farm any longer and we didn’t have any
other plans, after praying about it, we told him we would try it.   Irven knew
that it would take some time to build up our clientele so he had some good
friends and neighbors, Brent and Rosemary Palmer who needed some remodeling
work done on their home.  Irven told them about Ken and they agreed to hire him
to do their work.  Since we didn’t have to worry about selling our home – Ken
just gave notice to the Church Farm Committee that he was quitting and they
understood why, then we were able to start looking for a home in the area where
Irven and Sandy lived.  Sandy had found different homes for rent (we couldn’t
buy a home as we didn’t have the money for a down payment, and besides we
didn’t know for sure if it would work out here in Idaho financially for us.) so
we went looking.  We got discouraged as we had looked at several homes and
either they wanted too much money or it wasn’t something we wanted.  <u>Finally,
Sandy or Irv mentioned that maybe we should call the bishops in the surrounding
stakes and see if they knew of any homes for rent.  One bishop told us of a
family who were moving to Texas, but their parents were here and they hoped to
come back some day so they didn’t want to sell it, just rent it, but they
hadn’t put it in the paper yet.  We called them and they said we could come and
look at it.  We fell in love with it at first sight.  It was a nice, large home
on 5 acres of land down River Road which was close to the Snake River.  It was
in the farming town of Firth.  The lady’s name was Darlene Tew.  The family was
wonderful and after they showed us the home and yard, we asked them how much
they wanted for rent.  They said they had been praying about the right family
to rent their home as they wanted an LDS family and one with several children,
but a family who would love their home and take good care of it.  <b>They said
they felt good about us and thought the Lord was answering their prayers to
send us to them.  We felt the same way as we had been praying about finding a
good home for our family.</b></u>  We found out that his parents owned the land
all around and gave him and his brother (Kurt &amp; his wife, Karla) a plot of
land to build their homes.  <b>Kurt and Karla</b> were our neighbors and we
lived down in a little valley from the highway.  The parents<b>, Rodney and
Noma Tew</b> lived just across the road.  They were all such wonderful people. 
We fell in love with all of them right away.  Rodney and Noma were our second
parents.  They treated us like their children.  They were so good to us.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=250 height=1

align=left hspace=12>            When we were moving up, I got a terrible
headache.  Ken’s mother came up with us to help us move in.  She always took <b>Excedrin</b>
as she had headaches frequently.  I didn’t have any aspirin or Tylenol so just
before we got to Firth, she gave me two Excedrin.  By the time we got to the
home, I was feeling a little dizzy.  I mentioned it to Ken and he helped me
into the house and had me lay down on the carpet.  I started feeling like I was
sinking into a black hole.  I found I had no strength to lift any of my limbs,
I couldn’t speak and I felt like I was dying.  Ken and his mom became really
worried and were about to call 911 when suddenly the strength started coming
back and I could speak and told them I thought I would be alright now.  Soon I
was feeling much better.  The only thing we can think is that I am highly allergic
to Excedrin.  I resolved never to take that again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>All the neighbors and ward members
were so friendly and kind.  While we were moving in, they came to help us, they
brought us food and were excited to have us in the ward and neighborhood.  Some
small towns are not like this.  Grantsville had not been this friendly as they
didn’t want outsiders moving in.  We eventually did fit in and grew to love
most of the people in Grantsville, however.  At least I did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ken didn’t enjoy selling insurance</b>; he is just not a
salesman.  He can do most anything else, but he doesn’t have the patience to
sell.  Irven does, but not Ken.  By this time Ken had finished the Palmer’s
home and others saw him doing that home and either asked the Palmers about him
or talked to Ken about doing work for them.  Ken kept really busy.  In fact,
our former Bishop, who was the seminary president and in the stake presidency,
talked to Ken and <b>said “There are contractors all around and none of them
are as busy as you are.  I see your truck everywhere”.</b>   Ken is a
perfectionist and very good at what he does, so word of mouth spread and Ken
kept busy building homes and remodeling, at least for two years.  He also
worked for the Jolly Lumber Company in Shellie, Idaho, putting storm windows in
homes to save money on their power bills.  The owner was President Jolly, our
Stake President.  At that time many of the farmers went out of business since
they had three consecutive bad years with crops.  Ken had been really busy and
had lots of work lined up, but it all came to a screeching halt at that time. 
Other contractors were leaving the area and that is when Larry, our building
contractor friend in Arizona, invited Ken to come down and go into partnership
with him again.  We had enjoyed Idaho.  The people were wonderful, our
neighbors and ward were great.  It was a time of relaxation and recuperating
for me as I had been so involved in Grantsville.  That first winter in Firth,
while the children were in school, I worked on photo albums, scrapbooks,
histories, etc.  I was able to relax and get my mind and body healthy again.  It
was wonderful.  Ken had told the bishop that I had been under a lot of pressure
and stress in Grantsville so he didn’t want me called to a position in the ward
until I had recuperated.  After a couple of months, I was called to serve in
the Relief Society doing a spotlight in opening exercises.  It was a 5 minute
spotlight on a doctrine or principal of the gospel.  I enjoyed this calling and
then was called to teach in Relief Society.  The second year I was called to
serve in the presidency of the primary.  Deon Cloff was the president, and she
was very efficient and I enjoyed working with her.  (This is a picture of our
presidency – Deon, Sister Levett, (can’t remember her first name), me, and Dorothy
Levett, who was the secretary and mother-in-law to the other sister Levett.  David
stayed with Dorothy, Jack and their son, Jared, who was David’s best friend
there for his senior year, so he could graduate from Firth High, like Mike did.)
The neighbors were wonderful, the ward was great.</p>

align=left hspace=12>We loved the home and 5 acres of land, the river close by
and being out in the country.  The boys loved it there - they were accepted
right away.  <b><u>Mike &amp; David</u></b> became involved in sports –
Football and Basketball, and made friends right away.  Firth was a small town
with a small high school, so they had lots of opportunities there.   David was
so friendly to everyone and everyone liked him because of that.  Sometimes
older kids look down on younger kids and think they are too good to speak to
them, but David wasn’t this way, he was friendly with everyone.  That is a
great quality of David’s.  Since Mike and David came from a farm and had
experience in moving hand lines, the farmers up here wanted to hire them, so
they got jobs in the summers easily.  They each bought a motorcycle so they
could ride to their jobs and back and then have fun riding in the river
bottoms, etc.  They did have lots of fun riding them, but I think they spent
most of what they made on their jobs for parts to keep fixing their
motorcycles.  Mike’s friend from Grantsville came to stay a couple of weeks and
he worked with them and had fun riding their motorcycles in the river bottom.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We had brought our cow, which we had in Grantsville, up to
Firth with us.  <b>Mike and David milked the cow,</b> but if they and their dad
were gone on a Father-Son outing, <b>Shellie and I got the privilege of milking
Bessie, when Ken and the boys were on scouting trips or father &amp; son
outings, and we were not very good at it.  She was a patient cow, thank
goodness because it took us a long time to milk her.</b>  I got impatient with
her, however, when she would get out and Ken wasn’t there and the children were
in school and I had to go and chase her back into the corral.  One time I
remember, it was winter and we had lots of snow and Bessie got out.  I saw her
in the front yard.  I got on my boots and winter coat and went out to get her. 
I would almost get to her and she would run the other way.  I did this several
times until I went into the house and asked Scott to help me.  He had stayed
home from school because he had the flu.  I hated to have him go out in the
cold, but I couldn’t do it by myself.  Between the two of us, we finally got
her back into the corral.  Ken had her bred so we could raise a calf for beef
and so we could continue to have milk from Bessie.  He thought she had been
bred, but it didn’t take and so we had to butcher her.  She had already dried
up and even if we had her bred again, it would be another 9 months without milk
and we couldn’t afford to feed her all that time and not get any milk.  I felt
bad, however, as I had grown attached to her.  I remember crying and talking to
her the day they were coming to kill and butcher her</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had a little<b> blue Dotson </b>and
another bigger car for the family car, plus Ken had a truck for his
construction business.  We let Mike and David drive the Dotson.  Mike was so
particular and he would wash and clean the car until it looked so nice, but
David wasn’t so particular and didn’t take care of it like Mike did, so they
had some arguments about that.  That was also the case when they shared a
bedroom.  Mike wanted the room kept clean and orderly and David could care
less.  Finally, I remember Mike drawing a line on the floor and he told David
that he was not to throw anything on Mike’s side of the line, he had to keep
his mess on his own side.  In Firth, however, we had several bedrooms so they
each had their own bedroom.  I remember David asking me if I would help him
clean his room.  It would be a disaster.   I asked him why he couldn’t clean
his own bedroom and he would say “I don’t know where to start, I’m
overwhelmed.  If you will help me clean it, I’ll try to keep it clean.”  So I
would and he would – for a while and after a while, he would come to me again
with the same plea.  I didn’t mind, I liked to help him and I was glad he did
want it clean sometimes.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b><u>Shellie</u></b> was elected secretary of her senior
class even though she was new at the school.  She met Stacy Hobbs and they
became best friends.  Stacy was a cute blond with a bubbly personality.   Shellie
dated a nice boy named, Ralph. He really liked Shellie.  She liked him some. 
Shellie loved to read and when I couldn’t find her, I would look in her room
and she was either reading a good book, or putting a puzzle together.  She
loved putting puzzles together until her sister, Sandi, kept giving her harder
and harder puzzles for her birthday or Christmas.  Finally, she gave her one
that was 1000 pieces and the puzzle was all black.  That was it, she didn’t do
puzzles after that.  I was sad about that as she took after my mom in enjoying
putting puzzles together.  I was never good at that and didn’t have the patience
for it.  When I would go to Mom’s and find her putting one together, she would
ask me to help her.  She would put 10 pieces in to my one.  Shellie did read
good books and one day she was telling me about a book titled “One In Thy Hand”
by Gerald Lund.  She had read it and wanted me to read it.  I told her I would
like to, but I didn’t have the time – so she read it to me while I did other
things.  I did love it.  It was about Jerusalem and the Jews and Arabs.  From
that point on, she had an intense desire to go to the Holy Land.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One incident I would like to insert was when <b>Ken
and I were hosting a High Priest party at our home</b>.  I had so much to do,
so I asked Shellie if she would help me.  She told me that she couldn’t because
she had a date.  I told her that he wasn’t picking her up for three hours and
she told me it would take her that long to get ready.  I practically begged her
to help me as I didn’t know how I would get it all done without her help.  She
didn’t help, and I became really upset.  I guess with getting upset, I worked
harder and faster as the party turned out fine and everyone had a good time,
but after they had all left, I sat down and wrote a long note to Shellie
expressing how I felt.  I told her of all the things I did for her, and that I
couldn’t believe that she would be so selfish and inconsiderate as to not help
me when I asked and really needed her help.  She was still out on her date, so
I left it on her bed.  She acted cold to me the next morning and after she had
gone to school, I looked in her room and she had torn the note up in hundreds
of tiny pieces.  I knew the note had upset her, but I felt she had it coming. 
A couple of years later when she was working at Max Inn and was asked to be the
maid of honor at her friend, Stacy’s wedding reception, I drove up to pick her
up and take her to the reception.  We had plenty of time, so decided to drive
on in to Yellowstone Park.  As we were sitting admiring the beauty, we got
talking and she told me how angry she had gotten when she came home from her
date that night and read my note.  She said she felt like running away from
home.  Thankfully, she didn’t.  I expressed my love for her, but also how she
made me feel.  I was glad we could talk it out.</p>

the following year.</b>  It was even harder than I thought to have her leave. 
The last weeks before she left, I would find myself thinking that I wouldn’t be
able to hear her playing the piano, playing her music on the stereo, seeing her
reading good books in her room, having her around to help me and run errors,
staying up late and having wonderful talks with her, etc., etc.  I would find
myself becoming sad and crying.  After she left, it was the same thing.  I had
a hard time adjusting to having her gone.  We had tried to talk her into going
to Rick’s college or a smaller college for the first two years, but all she
wanted was BYU.  She did have a hard freshman year as they try to weed out all
the weaker freshman they could because they have so many from all around the
United States wanting to go there.  She also had troubles with her room mates,
and they put her in as activity chairman for their ward and she worked hard at
it, but couldn’t get many to come, not even her <b>good friend, Becky Burgess,
from Grantsville, who was her roommate. </b> She had problems with Becky in
more than one way while she was there.  Shellie would come home at Thanksgiving
and Christmas and cry and tell me how hard it was.  I felt bad for her.  She
did stick it out and her Sophomore year was much, much better.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Another incident I would like to
relate was when she came home from BYU for Thanksgiving and she mentioned that
she would like to find a job, so that when school was out in December, she
could work before and after Christmas.  Stores always need extra people at this
time of year, so I told her I would take her to Idaho Falls and she could put
in her resumes.  The Idaho roads are always so slippery, as it snows a lot and
they don’t salt the roads to melt the snow after the snow plows go through. 
The roads were really slippery this day and it was snowing too.  When we
finally got there, I parked near a strip mall so she could go into several
stores and fill out applications.  Shellie looked at me and said she had
decided that she didn’t want to go look for work today.  I told her that we had
driven on these bad roads and I had taken my time to bring her there, so she
needed to go do it now.  She just sat there, so I got out my book and started
reading it.  Finally, she got out of the car and went into the stores and got
applications.  <b>Shellie told me on the way home, that I was even more
stubborn than she was, and when she saw me start to read my book, she knew I
wouldn’t leave until she did what we came for. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie is a beautiful girl and so
she dated quite a bit in high school and college.  She has a strong testimony
of the gospel; we called her our “straight arrow”.  We could trust her and
didn’t worry about her as she was very careful about whom she dated and where
they went and what they did.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b><u>Mike</u></b> was going with a girl named Lisa.  They
were going steadily and Ken and I were a little worried.  Mike’s best friends
were Mike Mecham and Travis Dye.  Mike was good at football and it was fun to
watch him play.  I didn’t understand all the rules of football, but I knew his
number and would just strain to see and watch him.  He did very well the first
year, but at the first season game, of the 2<sup>nd</sup> year we were there, a
boy on the other team ran into him or tripped him (I can’t remember) but Mike
was down and they had to call 911 and take him off the field on a stretcher and
to the hospital.  That was an “away game” and about the only game we missed. 
We got a call that Mike was being taken to the hospital in Idaho Falls and we
were to meet him there.  They had to operate on his knee (scope it).  Well,
that was the end of his football season.  He tried to play basketball after it
healed, but it bothered him.  He hasn’t been able to play many sports since then.  
<b>Mike and Bo double dated for their Junior Prom.  They looked great in their
tuxedos.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><u>David</u></b> is a natural
leader and very friendly so he had lots of friends.  His best friend was Scott
Adams.  Scott wasn’t a member of the church, but a neat young man.  His parents
were great also.  His dad was the principal of the elementary school.  After we
moved back to Utah and David was married, he found out that Scott had been
killed in a plane accident.  David, as well as us, were sad to hear that news.  
We had David’s 16<sup>th</sup> birthday party at our home in Firth.  It was a
surprise party.  I always tried to have a surprise 16<sup>th</sup> birthday
party, but not sure now how much they would have been surprised since I did
that with each one.  David &amp; his friends played volleyball in the back yard
and played on the trampoline.  They played lots of game in the house, ate pizza
and root beer floats, etc.  They had a good time.  Lots of girls and guys came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><u>Scott</u></b> went to the
elementary the first year and then to the middle school.  Scott has always been
a very good looking boy so he has had girl friends since he was in
kindergarten.  Not that he liked girls that much, but because they liked him. 
One girl his age, <b>Danette</b>, was boy crazy in middle school, and started
chasing Scott.  She called him at home all the time.  We got pretty annoyed
with her.  Many times she would come down to our house to see him.  At one of
the basketball games, I pointed Danette out to Ken.  Ken said “No”, that’s not
Scott’s girlfriend, that must be David’s girlfriend.  Danette was taller and
very matured for a girl her age, so she looked more like 16 than twelve.  I
said “No”, that’s the girl who is chasing Scott and she is his age.  That was
one reason I was happy to move is to get Scott away from her.  I don’t think he
liked her that much, but I think he liked the attention.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When we were living in Idaho, Mike
and David used to help Ken with building homes or doing remodeling, when he
needed their help and one or the other was not busy.  They were both busy one
time when Ken needed some help with building a home, so he took Scott.  Scott
was only ten or eleven years old at that time<b>.  Scott worked so hard and did
such a good job that when they were eating their lunch, Ken told Scott that he
was going to pay him as much as he paid Mike and David.  When Scott acted
surprised, Ken told him that he worked as hard and did such a good job that he
deserved that much pay</b>.  Ken said that when they went back to work, after
eating their lunch, that Scott seemed to have even more energy and worked even
harder. </p>

align=left hspace=12><b><u> Jeff</u></b> was in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
grade in Firth.  He was a shy little boy, but very sweet.  He grew up with our
dog, <b>Naunoo</b>, as Larry and Tammy gave us Naunoo when we were moving from
Arizona to Grantsville.  They felt Naunoo would do better and be happier on a
farm where he could run and be free, rather than in a small yard in hot summers
in Arizona.  Jeff was only a year old when we got her, so they grew up together
and Jeff loved Naunoo and Naunoo loved him as well as all the family.  We all
loved her.  When we moved to Firth, we took Naunoo with us, of course, as we
had five acres of land there for her to run in.  But when we moved from Firth
to Arizona, we left we needed to leave her there with the family who bought the
home as she was too old and had arthritis and wouldn’t have done well in the
hot summers in a small yard where we were going.  It was a sad day for everyone
when we left Naunoo and Penny (our other small dog), but especially for Jeff. 
I was sad for Jeff and it broke my heart when he hugged Naunoo and said goodbye
to her with tears in his eyes..</p>

align=left hspace=12>I had a friend who was a case worker for <b>foreign
exchange students</b>.  She called me one day and said she had a young man from
  Spain who wanted to come over as an exchange student and immediately she
thought of us.  He was 16 and a junior in high school.  She knew our son, Mike,
was also 16 and she thought we would be the ideal family for <b>Borha.  (We
called him “Bo”</b> for short).  I told her that we were not financially able
to support a student at this time.  She talked me into letting her come and
show us his portfolio.  We were impressed and Mike and David became really
excited and tried to talk us into letting him come.  My friend said that we
didn’t have to worry about the money other than food as his parents were
wealthy and he would have the money to buy all his clothes, pay for his school
supplies, expenses, etc., etc.  We talked it over as a family and decided to
have him come.  It was fun at the airport.  We had a sign saying “Welcome
Borha”.  A Spanish looking boy got off the plane and came towards us.  Mike
thought it was him, even though his picture didn’t look like this boy, but we
started walking off with him.  He couldn’t speak much English, but soon after
another man came up to us and this boy was coming to his family.  We were
embarrassed and ran back up to look for Borha.  He was there looking for us. 
Bo was a tall, handsome young man.  He was very polite (they are taught that in
  Spain).  Bo brought me a beautiful Yadrow statue, which his mother sent for
me.  It was of a girl sitting on a log feeding a bird.  Yadrows are very
expensive.  I have treasured it.   It took us a while to be able to communicate
well with Bo.  He had had several years of English, but it is different
learning it in a classroom and speaking it to Americans.  However, it didn’t
take him very long until we could understand each other.  While we were in the
process, Mike said to me “Mom, you don’t need to shout!  Bo isn’t deaf.”  I
would find myself talking slow, but also loud.  The family took to Bo and he
liked us.  Even though he wasn’t a member of our church, he would go to church
with us.  He always opened the door for me, if Ken wasn’t around to do it, and
he insisted on carrying my books until some of the men made fun of him for
doing it.  That upset me.  I heard him talking to a friend, on the phone who
came with him and was staying with a family in Shelly Idaho, saying Americans
are not polite and most don’t want us to be polite, so maybe we shouldn’t do it
any more while we’re here.  I felt bad as I knew their mothers had taught them
well.  I had a Polaroid camera so I took lots of pictures and I made a
scrapbook for Bo and each of the children.  I wanted Bo to have the book to
remember us by.  He was excited.  Bo was very athletic and very smart.  He got
straight A’s in school, and once we taught him a game – tennis, ping pong,
board or card games, etc., he was good at him<b>.  He and Mike tried out for
the basketball team, and both made the varsity team.</b>  David played on the
Sophomore basketball team, but the coach played mainly the younger boys –
Freshman, even though David and some of the other Sophomores were better – at
least we thought so.  The coach wanted to build a great team for the following
year we think so he let the sophomores sit on the bench.  The coach was also a
seminary teacher, so we were surprised that he would do that.  Guess we’re all
human.  Mike played on the varsity football team also.  David played church
basketball after that and was really good.  We really enjoyed watching those
games more than the school basketball games.  The varsity coach was a loud
mouth, swearing, harsh coach and not many liked him, including Mike and Bo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>We enjoyed living close to Irven and Sandy</b>,
although at times we would get upset with Irven as he was a salesman in about
every way – a high pressured salesman.  He would try to pressure us into doing
things, but Ken isn’t one to be pressured so they would go the rounds.  Irven
is a good guy though.  We got together fairly often to play games and that was
always fun.  We would eat at each other’s homes different times too.  Sandy and
I enjoyed each other; we felt more like sisters than sister-in-laws.  Sometimes
we would get to laughing and laugh so hard we could hardly stop.  One time we
decided to sell Fuller Brush Products together to earn some extra money for our
families.  She had a man in their ward who was a supervisor in it, so we set
out together.  We would come to our area and she would go to one side of the
street and I would go on the other side.  We had fun doing this, but didn’t
make much money.  We would stop and get ice cream cones after sometimes.  Sandy
was always looking for ways to make money so a couple of months before
Christmas she told me about her idea to make a Christmas book with all kinds of
Christmas activities and ideas in and we would advertise and sell them.  We
spent a lot of time making them.  They were pretty good ideas, but I don’t think
we sold hardly any.  Oh well, we had fun doing them together. I think we made
enough to pay for our expenses – hope so anyway.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            I had several good friends in Firth – <b>June
Mecham</b> was a very sweet beautiful lady and I loved her.  We still keep in
touch especially at Christmas.  Her husband was Sherm and he was a coach &amp;
school teacher.  They came to visit us when we were living in Clinton, I fixed
lunch for us and we had a good visit.   June was the mother of Mike’s best
friend who name was also “Mike” – Mike Mecham.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Doris Gentillan</b> was a special friend too,
we had lots of good talks and did things together.  Doris had two married
daughters who lived in the ward.  They were cute girls with cute families.  (Doris
is the lady on the left in the picture.)  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Kurt and his wife Karla</b> <b>Tew</b> had a
son, Cody, a year or two younger than Jeff and they played together and had
fun.  Kurt and Karla were good to Jeff, and actually to all our kids and to
us.  They were great neighbors.  I think all of us hated to leave Firth. 
Darlene and her husband (can’t think of his name) lost their lumber business in
Firth, and later lost their home.  The bank called us since we were renting
their home and offered to let us buy it for $35,000. with low interest.   Wow!
What a great deal that was, but that was the time when many potato farmers (and
that was mainly what the people in Firth and surrounding area, did for a
living.) went bankrupt and the ones who didn’t couldn’t hire Ken to build a new
home or do remodeling like they had planned, so Ken had no work and thus no
money to buy this home.  We were sad about this, but that is when we moved to
Arizona to go into partnership with Larry Braithwaite and Ron Shumway in
construction.  Ken had called Larry to see if there was work in Arizona
as he had no work here in Idaho.  He had called other contractors to see if he
could work for them, but they had no work either.  Larry told him “yes” and to
come down.  He stayed with them and worked for Larry and Larry was trying to
talk him into going into business with him again.  I didn’t know at the time,
but Ken really didn’t want to.  He just wanted to work there until he hoped
things would go better in Idaho and he could come back and we wouldn’t have to
move again.  I guess we didn’t communicate well enough because I didn’t
understand that and since we couldn’t buy the home, and since there was no work
here, I figured we would have to move to Arizona again since there was work
there.  Larry called me and convinced me that Ken should go into business with
him and told me to talk Ken into doing so.  I did, but wish we had communicated
better.  Don’t know if it would have made a difference or not, but this move
was not good for any of us except Shellie as this is when she met him. 
Actually, I liked it there as Larry &amp; Tammy had helped us buy a home (they
talked us into getting a nice one and helped with the down payment I think).  I
loved the home.  We had lots of good times with Larry &amp; Tammy until towards
the end.  We went water skiing, to their cabin, family dinners together or at
the park, etc.  I had met many good neighbors and made friends in the ward and
I was in the R.S. Presidency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We, of course, had brought <b>Naunoo
and Penny</b> with us to Firth.  They loved it there too and so did we.  I would
sit on the front steps of the house and Naunoo would come by me and put her
head under my arm so I would pet her.  She was so cute.  We lived in
Grantsville for four years and only two years in Firth, when we moved to
Arizona the third and last time.  Penny had been run over by a car as she had
gotten up on the highway and we were sad about that.  <b>We couldn’t take
Naunoo with us to Arizona</b> as it would again be too hot for her there and we
would be living in a sub division and it would be too confined for her, so we
asked the people who bought the home if they would keep her and they were glad
to have her.  The day that we left, we were all sad to leave her.  I still
remember the picture in my mind of Jeff kneeling down by Naunoo with his arms
around her neck and he was crying, it still makes me sad to think of it.</p>

align=left hspace=12>We have three boys in basketball this year, and they each
play one to three games a week, and since they are all on different teams, we
are going to be at the High School watching a lot of games for the next two or
three months.  You might wonder how we have three boys playing; its because we
have a foreign exchange student this year from Spain.  He’s 16 and his name is
Borja Sanchez-Blanco.  He is very good at basketball since he played a lot in
Spain so he is playing on the Varsity team, Mike is playing Junior Varsity, and
David is playing on the C Team.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Borja is tall, dark, and handsome, intelligent,
good at about everything he does, very polite, helpful, and friendly.  We are
really enjoying him, and learning a lot about the beautiful country of Spain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had moved to Firth, Idaho the summer of 1984,
this is a beautiful, friendly place to live and a good place to raise
children.  But it sure gets cold in the winter, and we have lots and lots of
snow.  Oh well, I guess there’s not a perfect place to live.  We do enjoy it
here, and the children have good friends and really enjoy living here in Firth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken is a contractor, and has been really busy
this past summer.  We hope it continues.  He is a good builder so he hasn’t had
to advertize, he has gotten work through word of mouth.  He keeps really busy,
and teaches the Deacons in the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I’m in the Primary Presidency and involved in
School and Community.  My family sure keeps me going too.  This is really a
busy life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Shellie is going to the Brigham Young
University.  It was a little overwhelming for her to go there after coming from
small schools like Grantsville High and Firth High.  She is doing good, but is
looking forward to the Christmas Semester break with three whole weeks without
homework.  She is a special girl and we are very proud of her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike is 16 and a junior in High School.  He is
involved in all sports; in fact, he injured his knee during football season,
and is recovering from an operation on it.  He is upset that he has to miss the
first few games in basketball because of it.  David is 15 and in the 10<sup>th</sup>
grade.  He also is involved in sports.  Both boys get good grades.  They are both
involved in church.  Mike is the Priest quorum assistant, and David is the
president of the Teacher’s Quorum.  Mike is also on the Seminary Council. 
Scott is in the 6<sup>th</sup> grade, and Jeff is in the second.  We are a
family with all boys now that Sandi is married and Shellie is away at college. 
Sandi has two daughters and we sure enjoy them, but we don’t see them as often
as we’d like since they live in Grantsville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We enjoy this time of year, but wish it wasn’t
quite so busy.  I’m over the Ward Christmas party, and we also are having a
party for our teachers and their spouses in Primary next week.</p>

align=left hspace=12>Well, we decided to take Larry up on his offer, and we
moved to Arizona.  This was our third move to Mesa.  The short, nine months we
were there were hard, yet good.  Good, because we lived in a lovely home in a
nice neighborhood.  We paid association dues and this included the use of the
swimming pools, hot tubs, racket ball courts, volleyball pit and playground. 
It was a beautiful area where these were located.  The boys and Ken loved to
play racquetball, Shellie did too, and all of us loved the pools and hot tubs. 
  We enjoyed the neighbors and our good ward.  We had many opportunities to
serve in the ward - Ken in the Bishopric again and I in Relief Society as a
teacher and then as a counselor.  We made lots of friends there too.  One
friend,<b> Lark</b>, was a neighbor.  (Can’t remember her last name).  She
lived a block or two away.  She was a cute lady and we had lots of good talks
and enjoyed being together.  We would go places together, and with our husbands
sometimes too.  They had a son about Jeff’s age and they became good friends
too.   A nice single mom lived about a block away and she had two sons.  One
was about Scotts age and the other about Jeff’s age.  The four of them played
together quite a lot.  They were not members of the church, but very nice
people.  The mother made crafts in her spare time and around Easter, Jeff came
home with the prettiest little Easter basket I had seen.  It had lace and silk
flowers on it and little plastic bunnies and Easter eggs in the basket.  Jeff
had seen it and wanted to buy it for me.  He had some money saved so he bought
it from her to give to me.  I loved it.  Jeff was so sweet to buy it for me.  I
still have it and enjoy putting it out as a decoration at Easter time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We also enjoyed going to either the
mountains with <b>Larry &amp; Tammy</b> as they had a cabin there, or to the
Lake with them as they had a boat and jet skis.   Mom &amp; Dad came down to
spend a month or so with us and it was great having them with us.  They both
loved getting out of the cold winter and loved the warmth in Arizona.  Dad
would go on walks each morning and he really enjoyed doing that.  Mom helped
with the children, the meals, housework, etc.  She was great!  I enjoyed
visiting and being with her and also with dad.  They both were and are
wonderful and we loved having them there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The hard part of this move was because it didn’t
work out with Ken and Larry being in business together.  It did at first, but
after a while Ron started questioning whether Larry was taking more out of the
business than he should because he didn’t work much and he, Tammy and their
family vacationed quite a bit and he always seemed to have plenty of money
where Ron and Ken were working a lot and tight with money.   When they first
started out, they had their office in Larry’s nice new home and Tammy did the
books.  Larry, without talking to Ken or Ron, rented a nice office and hired a
secretary.  The business didn’t make that kind of money since a recession was
on, so Ron and Ken were upset about that.  Ron talked to Ken about his concerns
and Ken told him he felt Larry was honest, but told Ron that, since they were
all partners, he should just ask Larry if he could look at the books.  He
didn’t ask, he just came into the office early one day and was going over the
books when Ken came in to get something before he started his day.  The
secretary wasn’t in when Ken came in, but was when he went out.  We found out a
few years later, in talking with Larry, that Carine had told him that Ken and
Ron were looking at the books.   Larry felt they didn’t trust him and so he was
very upset, called a meeting with them and told them they were on their own as
of the first of the following month.  When they asked why, he told them that
since the business wasn’t bringing in enough money, the bank wasn’t going to
keep backing them (something like that).  Ken was devastated because that meant
he and Ron would have to get someone to bond them and Ken didn’t have his own
contractor’s license, he was working off Larry’s, so wouldn’t be able to get
the bond company to bond him until he got his license.  Larry hadn’t told the
truth because he wanted them out since he was offended thinking that they
didn’t trust him.  Well, Ken kept trying to get work, but he was so discouraged
that it turned to depression.  That has been our hardest move, financially, and
the feelings Ken and Larry had towards each other were not good as we moved
back to Utah..   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken became so depressed because of
the way Larry handled things that we had a terrible feeling in our home.  The
children didn’t like it.  Mike &amp; David even told me that maybe they should
move out so it wouldn’t be so expensive.  I told them that if they moved out,
it would be much worse as I would be so sad and depressed too.  I got a call
from our bank telling me that the IRS had come in and cleaned out our account
because of money we owed them for back taxes while living in Idaho.   We had
saved the money for taxes in Idaho and then had to use it when Ken was out of
work for so long because of the farmers having those 3 bad years in
succession.  We had contacted the IRS and they had agreed to work with us and
we would pay them so much every month - well, they didn’t work with us.  I was
really upset.  Mom, dad were down visiting us, and the three of us were going
to Dr. Swanstrom for a treatment, but while they were in getting their
treatments, I went to a store and bought a newspaper so I could look in the
Help adds to see about getting a job as I knew I needed to work now and try to
get us out of this mess.    I didn’t want to get a treatment as I didn’t have
the money now.  Dad insisted I get one and he would pay for it.  There wasn’t
anything much in the newspaper so I came home and prayed.  I knew I couldn’t go
to work for minimum wage, we needed more money than that.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I thought of Irven and how he was
making good money working for <b><u>NFIB</u></b>.  I called him to see if he
thought I could do that.  He said “Yes”, that I had the personality and the
motivation to do it.  He set up an appointment for me with his manager.  I went
in, had the interview, took the tests, passed with high scores and they hired
me.  It was hard memorizing all the issues and the information I needed, to
give to the owners and presidents of companies and businesses.  Mom fixed the
meals, and did what she could and had me go out in the camp mobile, where it
was quiet, and study.  She was wonderful and a big help, so was dad.  They
insisted I use their small car, while they were there, as it got much better
gas millage.  I was really nervous the first day of work, but my trainer was
very good and after watching him for about 3 times, he told me he would <img

sale.  I had prayed hard and the Lord blessed me, as it went well and I made
the sale.  My manager was excited.  I made several sales during the next two
days so he left me on my own.  Dave, my manager, called me his <b>“Super Star”.</b> 
It was hard as I had to go all over – Mesa, Tempe, Chandler, Phoenix, Globe,
etc.   At night I had to do lots of paperwork and get prepared for the next
day.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>NFIB – working and what
happened one day March 19, 1987</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was really hoping to do good today.  I didn’t get any
sales yesterday, part of the day was spent with Dave Young, my manager.  He is
here meeting with all his people.  He is a good boss, and a good person.  He is
my brother, Bryce’s friend, also a friend of Ken’s brother, Irven.  Well –
anyway, the morning wasn’t good.  I drove all over – couldn’t find owners,
couldn’t find addresses, roads were tore up, etc.  I finally did new business,
gave a couple of presentations, almost got one closed, then he changed his mind
for the time.  I went to sell another that we had already given the
presentation to, but they want to wait for a month.  I was pretty discouraged
and upset because of the pressure.  Dave had asked me to call him around noon
so we could meet and he could give me some more cards he was getting from
another representative.  I finally got a hold of him and we met.  He gave me
lots of cards and supplies he had gotten from Norm Thompson, the Mesa representative who just went into another business because he needed more money to
support his family.  Dave invited me to go to lunch with him and even though I
trust him (he loves his wife, is strong in the church, good friend to Bryce
&amp; Irven, etc.) and even though I hadn’t eaten lunch, I declined as I wanted
to get to work and make some sales for the day.  I drove to a shaded area,
sorted the cards, drove off to Mesa to begin work again.  I reached for my kit
as I got out of the car and it wasn’t there.  I looked all over the car and no
kit.  I started to panic because it had the checks in from the sales I had made
this week.  I got out and frantically looked through the boxes that Dave had
given me, that were in the trunk.  It was nowhere to be found.  I was so upset
and scared.  I drove to a phone booth and called Dave.  He was there, thank
goodness.  I asked him if I could have left my kit in his car.  He ran out to
check, but no, it wasn’t there.  He asked if my kit had checks in it and I said
“yes.”  He could tell that I was really upset and worried, so he tried to
console me by telling me how others had done similar things, tried to tell me
funny things to get me to laugh, and told me not to take it personally – that
things like that happen to lots of people and some things are lots worse.  He
was so understanding, I could hardly believe it.  I told him at the first
(after he told me it wasn’t in his car) that he should fire me.  He said “I
can’t, you’re one of my very best people.”  He is always complimenting me and
encouraging me.  He’s a great boss – all his people think so.  He told me to
drive back to where we were parked – that maybe I had sat it on the trunk or
the top of the car and forgot and driven off.  That it might be there.  I did. 
It was ½ mile away, but I drove fast.  It wasn’t there.  I went into businesses
close by and asked if anyone had turned in a brown binder, but no one had.  I
wondered if I could have put it on the trunk when I sorted my cards, so I drove
there.  It wasn’t there.  That was the same place (shopping center) where I had
called Dave before, so I decided to go over and call him to tell him the bad
news.  He had told me that I could go back to the businesses who had given me
checks and get them to stop payment on the checks and write me out new ones.  I
hated the thought of doing that, but I knew I would have to – but there was
another problem.  I couldn’t remember all the businesses that had given me
checks – and I had no way of finding out as the receipt was with the person,
and the membership card was with the checks in the kit.  As I came up to the
phone booth, it dawned on me (the Holy Ghost) that the last time I remember
having my kit was when I gave a presentation to a jeweler in that shopping
center so I might have laid it on top of the phone booth while I made the call
four hours earlier.  That maybe someone had turned it in to one of the stores,
so I checked and no one had.  I went back and called Dave.  We discussed it
some more and he again tried to console me.  He told me that he had another
copy of the membership list and Craig in Phoenix would make me up another kit
and get it to me early the next morning.  He said he wished he could help more,
but he had so much to do.  He had already helped so much and I sure appreciated
it.  He told me to cheer up and go sit in the car and think and let the Holy
Ghost prompt me, that maybe I could still find it.  If not, to go home and have
a good evening and tomorrow would be a better day.  As I went to leave the
phone booth, I remembered that I better call home so the family wouldn’t
worry.  I noticed a man waiting to use the phone so I asked if I could make one
more quick call.  I told him something devastating had just happened.  <b>He
looked at me funny and said “You look familiar.”  He had a business card in his
hand.  He said “You aren’t Mae Browning, are you?”  I said “yes, do you have my
brown book?”  He did.</b>  We walked to his big rig (he was a trucker) and he
explained how he had found my book, and going through it, he saw the checks,
etc., and knew the person who owned it might loose their job if they didn’t
find it (most bosses would fire their people for this reason), so he found my
business card and called our home.  Scott answered, and this man left his name
and number in California.  But then he knew that if I called California, his
brother-in-law (his partner wouldn’t know anything about it and wouldn’t be
able to help me.  He also knew that he couldn’t just leave my book at a store,
etc., nearby as they might be dishonest and cash the checks.  He knew he
wouldn’t be back in Tempe for another week, and that I’d need it now.  He
waited around trying to figure out what to do.  He looked on his map for my
address, to take it there, but knew he couldn’t fit his rig down the roads in a
housing division.  He was to pick up a load at a certain time, but didn’t, as
he felt he had to work something out for me.  Four hours later, at the same
phone booth, he was waiting to use the phone to call my home again to see if I
was home by now and to see if I could meet him somewhere to get my book. 
Wow!!! I knew the Lord had used him as an instrument in answering my prayers. 
Here he, a good, honest, man (he didn’t look like one and a lot of truckers
might not be) and he really went the extra mile to help me.  I wanted to repay
him somehow so gave him four dollars I had in my purse and asked him to give me
his name and address and I would send him more money.  I explained that we were
having financial problems and that’s why I had gotten this job, but I didn’t
tell him that to get out of paying him a reward or something, I was just upset
and grateful and blurted it out.  He said “no, I’m just glad I could help
you.”  I told him that I didn’t know if he was a Christian or not, but I was
and I knew the Lord had used him – a good, honest man to answer my prayers.  I
also told him that if I couldn’t repay him for his extreme kindness, that I
would help other people.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It really makes me realize that
lately I haven’t taken time to help others or show love like I used to and
should.  I’ve felt so pressured lately that I haven’t.  I will do better in the
future</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Finally, Mom &amp; Dad decided they
better go home.  From that point on, the children had to help out as I didn’t
have the time to do the laundry, clean the house, fix the meals, etc.  Shellie
would start supper, then have to go to work, so Scott had to finish it as Mike
was working also and David was in school and worked part time at the same place
as Shellie &amp; Mike.  Shellie had found the job.  It was at an Assisted
Living Center so they had a nice lunch room where these seniors were served 3
nice meals a day.  Shellie was the waitress.  They needed someone to wash
dishes so she had Mike come apply for the job.  He was hired and the managers
really liked Shellie &amp; Mike as they were hard workers and dependable. 
Later, when the cook resigned, they offered Mike that job and asked if they had
another brother or sister who would like to work part-time doing dishes.  Well,
David got the job.   When they saw how dependable and hard working David was
also, they asked if they had any other family members they could hire.  This
was quite a compliment.  When we moved, the managers were really sad and they
couldn’t say enough good about our special children. </p>

align=left hspace=12><b><u>Mike </u></b>- It was the summer before Mike’s
senior year that we moved down to Arizona.  He wanted to graduate from Firth
High, not a new school, so Mike Mecham’s parents talked to us about letting
Mike stay with them for the school year and graduate with their son, Mike. 
They were such good people and strong in the church that we felt Mike would be
fine staying with them, however, Mike was steady dating with Lisa and even
though I felt I could trust Mike, I didn’t trust the devil and worried about this. 
I talked to the seminary principal and he felt we shouldn’t do it.  He said
Mike and Lisa were both good kids, but if it were him, he wouldn’t do it.  I
told Ken this, but he said we had to trust Mike.  He talked to Mike and told
him that if anything happened, that he (Ken) would never hear the last of it
from me.  Mike promised him that everything would be ok, and it was because
shortly after Mike started school, he and Lisa broke up and he dated Mishael
and others.  Mike had moved down with us for the summer and then went back in
the fall.  <b><u>Bo</u></b> moved down with us too and then left to go back to Spain
from there.  One incident happened with Bo when we were moving things into the
home.  I had brought all my beautiful plants down and they were in one vehicle. 
Ken had asked Bo to bring them into the home.  He got side tracked and forgot
about them.  We were all busy and when we realized they were still out in the
“hot” car as it was during the summer and with the windows all up, all but one
of the plants died.  I was sick about it as I loved my plants, but I didn’t say
much to Bo as he felt really bad as it was.  Bo enjoyed part of the summer with
us until he had to fly back home.  The morning that we took him to the airport
was quite a traumatic time too.   He left his plane ticket on top on the piano
when we left the house.  We had plenty of time to make the flight, but not much
extra.  On the way I asked him something about his ticket and he gasped.  I
asked him what was the matter and he said he forgot to pick them up from the
piano.  He put them there as he thought he would see them as he left the
house.  We had to turn around and go get them.  It was about 4 am in the
morning so there wasn’t much traffic and Ken ran red lights – just slowing down
to see if anyone was coming from the other roads and if there were any
policemen around.  We did make it in time, thank goodness.  We enjoyed that
year with Bo, he was a special young man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>David </b> This move was hard on
David for several reasons.  One reason was because Mike went back to Firth to
go to school his senior year and Mike &amp; David had been so close.  But David
became close to Scott &amp; Jeff and was cute with them.  Another reason was
David went to the biggest high school in Mesa.  That was tough coming from such
a small high school in Firth where he knew everyone and was popular.  Here at
this high school the kids came from wealthy homes and so most of them had their
own cars, etc.  David took Spanish and his Spanish teacher was from Spain and
was a great teacher.  David liked this class more than the others.  Mike
finished up his credits about half way through the year and so came home to Mesa
to be with us and find work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Scott</b>  This move was hard on
Scott too.  He was in a big Jr High by himself.  He didn’t like the school.  He
did make friends with a couple of neighbor boys who were brothers and they all
played together.  Their mother was a single mom, but very nice.  They were not
members of the church, but good people.  Scott’s scout leader was very good,
but strict.  He made Scott his Sr. Patrol Leader.  Scott was good, but it was
hard for him with the leader being so strict. Scott took band and played the
trumpet.  His teacher said he was very good and that he would give him private
lessons if we consented.  I was going to do this, but we moved too soon.  I
don’t remember if he had any private lessons or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Jeff </b> This move wasn’t as
hard on Jeff, at least I don’t think so as he was younger.  He went to the
elementary school and had a good teacher.  He made friends with a cute boy in
our neighborhood and ward.  His mother and I were friends.  Her name was Lark,
but I can’t remember the boy’s name.  Jeff was a good boy and he loved playing
with Naunoo and Penny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Shellie</b> had gone down with
Ken so she could find work before going back to BYU.  They stayed with <img
width=226 height=1

align=left hspace=12>Larry &amp; Tammy, and Tammy was very good with her.  At
this time, Larry &amp; Tammy were going to some classes “Love” classes that
were supposed to teach you more love so you could have better relationships
with your spouse and others.  It wasn’t a good thing.  They tried to talk Ken
and Shellie into going, but they didn’t feel good about it.  The classes caused
problems for Larry &amp; Tammy and so they struggled with their marriage.  They
had made Tammy one of their assistant leaders.  At one time, the main person
called Tammy, while their family was having Family Home Evening and discussing
the problems they were having since going to and being involved with these
classes and people.  He said “What is going on at your house?”  It scared Tammy
as she felt this was coming from the devil.  Tammy said that the man would
never look into her eyes, so she forced him to and she said it was like looking
into the eyes of the devil.  It scared her so bad that she quit and they left
that atmosphere.  I’m not sure what else happened there.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie worked at McDonalds and
then waitressed at an Assisted Living Center.  Mike and David ended up working
there too.  Two weeks before we were to move back to Utah, Shellie met Roy at a
single adult dance.  He had just returned from his mission and was staying with
his sister, Carolyn, and her family who lived in Mesa.  She introduced herself
to him and introduced him to others.  They started dancing and he asked to take
her home.  She had come with a friend, so the friend was ok with it and drove
home alone.  From that time on, Shellie and Roy were together as much as
possible.  Even while we were packing to move, Shellie was water skiing with
Roy and his family.  Mike &amp; David didn’t think it was fair that she didn’t
have to be home helping us pack.  It probably wasn’t fair, but life isn’t fair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken hated the idea of me working,
he had never wanted me to work outside the home, but I had no choice at that
time - so this contributed to<b> his depression</b>.  Other things added to his
depression - Ken had been called to be a counselor in the Bishopric in our ward
and Larry had had a fit because he told Ken he needed to spend all his time
getting the business to work, and shouldn’t have accepted the call to be in the
Bishopric.  Ken told him that he had covenanted to give his time, talents,
etc., to the Lord and he would do it when he was asked.  Larry was upset about
this and even talked to me about it.  I agreed with Ken and I told Larry so. 
Ken finally did talk to the Bishop about it and was released.  That was really
hard for Ken as he didn’t feel right about it.  Another problem was it was dog
eat dog in the construction business in Arizona.  Guys were coming from all
other states because the word was out that building was doing great in Arizona.  Many didn’t have a license or insurance and would just work out of their trucks -
so would underbid Ken and get the jobs.  Even when he did the jobs, many
wouldn’t pay him or their checks would bounce.  It was really hard, so I could
understand why Ken was so depressed - but it was really hard on me with him
that way.  I fasted and prayed, I talked to the Bishop, our home teachers, and
finally <b>Scott </b>came home from school really excited about a lady who had
come and gave a presentation to them on positive thinking.  I got her name and
address from the school and found out she lived in Mesa.  I called her and also
found out that she did counseling sessions.  She was a member of the church,
her husband had cancer and she had turned to the Lord for help and she felt he
had really blessed her.  She wrote two books and had tapes made.  I purchased
them and had Ken come to counseling sessions.  He went, but didn’t get much out
of them because of his attitude.  I went with him and thought they were great. 
I have used the books and tapes several times to help other people - I have
loaned them out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b> I finally was beside myself and told Ken he
had to snap out of it because I couldn’t take much more of it.  He asked me if
I would be willing to move in with his mother in Utah</b>.  His mother was a
widow and had a fairly large home because it had a finished basement.  It had
five bedrooms.  Ken had suggested that before, but I would never agree to it
because I didn’t feel I could live with his mother.  She was a good person, but
completely opposite from my mother and how I had been raised.  She wasn’t
loving and caring to our children like my mother was, she did love her
children, in fact, she thinks they are about perfect.  That’s how most mothers
are I guess, but I’m sure she thinks she loves her grandchildren, but she
doesn’t show it.  She is critical of them and expects way too much from them. 
She doesn’t act how I feel a grandmother should act to her grandchildren.   She
is an emulate housekeeper, and so having a clean house was what was most
important to her.  She told me that I should clean above my doors and the
mopboards every time I mop the floor and that I should mop the floor 2 or 3
times a week.  Well, I wipe up the floor when something is spilled or when it
needs it, and I mop it on Saturdays, but I don’t clean the mopboards and above
the doors that often.  I do it when I see it needs it and when I have the
time.  Having a immaculately clean house is not my mom’s priority, her family
and other people are.   Mom isn’t a good housekeeper.  She liked a clean house
so I cleaned it for her a lot, but she couldn’t seem to keep it clean.  She
would hardly ever put things away after she had used them.  I have tried to
have a balance.  I like a clean house too, but it isn’t my number one
priority.  My family, the church, and friends come above it - at least most of
the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I would rather have wanted to move
in with my Mom &amp; Dad, but in talking to Mom, she was excited about having
us do that, but when I talked about her getting rid of some of her things to
make room for ours, she couldn’t do it.  I was sure that would be the case as
Mom is a horter, and she can’t get rid of anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I was so desperate at this time that after
Ken asked if I would at least fast and pray about it, I did.  I received a good
feeling that we should do it and so I trusted in the Lord, we called his mom,
she agreed and we moved up</b>.  It was hard to leave my beautiful home, area
and friends, however.  I had decorated the house, had my friend, Molly, help me
make drapes for the windows in the family room, dining room and large living
room.  Ken made boxes and we covered them with the same material and trimmed
them with the gold cord we used as tiebacks.  He fastened them to the walls
above the windows.  They looked beautiful.  I was able to buy this material in
bulk at a factory outlet store.  It looked like linen.  They looked beautiful. 
We bought sheers to put behind them.  I made curtains, drapes, bedspreads, etc.
for our bedroom and the other bedrooms.  When the realtors took perspective
buyers through our home, they told them that we had “custom drapes”.  I guess
we did.  The realtors said these were a big selling point.  It was a beautiful
home, the nicest I have had and all our homes have been nice.   Ken asked Larry
if he wanted the house as he had helped us with the down payment.  He said no,
so we talked to a realtor in our ward that listed it and sold it.  We made
enough to pay for the big moving truck and the gas to move us up.  It seems
like we even borrowed some from the children.  It was a caravan moving up.  We
had mom &amp; dad’s camp mobile, the big truck, and 2 cars.  Ken drove the big
truck, Mike, David &amp; Shellie each drove a vehicle.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had two cats here in this home
in Mesa, and we couldn’t take them with us to Ken’s mother’s house so Ken had
Shellie take them to the pound when we moved.  They were so upset and one got
under the car seat and Shellie had to drag it out.  It was really an ordeal for
Shellie.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>1986 Christmas letter</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This past June, we made another
move.  We had lived in Firth, Idaho for two years and loved it there (except
for the long, cold winters.)  We lived near the Snake River, and it was so
beautiful with all the trees, bushes, and freshly plowed fields in the spring
or late fall, or potatoes, hay, or grain growing in them during the spring and
summer months.  We had wonderful neighbors that we grew to love – so it was
very heard to leave them.  Also, a great ward where we had lots of
opportunities to grow and serve.  Our children sure hated to leave their good
friends, and the great life in the country.  They went to small schools so had
opportunities in sports and all other areas which they desired.  During the
summer and after school, the boys could get part-time jobs working for the
farmers.  They liked to ride their motorcycles, or go fishing and hunting
during their free time, while Shellie would be dating, doing things with her
friends, or just curling up with a good book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken went from farming (managing the
Grantsville Stake Welfare Farm) in Grantsville, Utah to back into the building
profession when we moved to Idaho.  He also sold insurance part time.  The
harvest in 1985 wasn’t good for the farmers, and since the economy revolves
around the farming, the area became depressed.  Actually, this was their 3<sup>rd</sup>
bad year so many were really struggling or going under.  People couldn’t afford
to build new homes or do remodeling, so Ken looked for work elsewhere.  Our
good friends, Larry &amp; Tammy Braithwaite, whom Ken has been in business with
before, live in Mesa, Arizona.  They had visited us a few months earlier, and
told us that building was really booming in Arizona, and Larry was doing really
well as a contractor.  Ken left in February to stay with the Braithwaites and
work down there until school was out.  During this time Larry offered Ken to go
into partnership with him.  Not knowing what else to do, and since it was such
a good offer, we moved down in June.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The summer was hot (as you can
imagine here in Arizona), but our homes and all the businesses are
air-conditioned, and everyone swims a lot.  We bought a nice home, and live in
a good ward and neighborhood, so we’re happy here too.  We had a good summer. 
Larry &amp; Tammy have a boat, jet skis’ and a cabin in the mountains so they
took us with them where our families could renew their friendships and have a
good time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>People have been coming here from
all over the country to find work, so there is a lot of competition for the
jobs.  So far the work is still coming in and they have kept fairly busy.  We
hope and pray it will continue to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The growth here in Mesa is almost
unbelievable.  Our ward had almost a thousand members by the time we divided
three weeks ago.  Ken is now in the Bishopric of our new ward, and I am in the
Relief Society Presidency.  David isn’t too happy about the division because he
is now the only active priest in our ward.  We have a fairly young ward so we
have a big primary and small M.I.A.  It seems to be a great ward, however, the
members are excited to be divided and able to hold positions.  In our old ward,
there were too many people and not enough positions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Mike is staying with some good
friends of ours in Firth as he wanted to remain there for his senior year of
high school, and be able to play football</b>.  He didn’t feel he’d have a
chance here at Mountain View High with the student body of 3,000 compared to
300 in Firth.  Mountain View is a great high school, though, and <b>David </b>has
adjusted and really likes it. <b> Scott</b> goes to Poston Jr. High, and <b>Jeff</b>
to a new elementary school just blocks from our home.  He rides his bike and
enjoys the school.  He’s in the third grade.  <b>Shellie</b> had a tough time
adjusting to BYU last year.  It was overwhelming coming from such small high
schools as Grantsville and Firth, but this 2<sup>nd</sup> year, she has
adjusted and loves everything about it – well, maybe not all the homework.  She
had several boyfriends and opportunities for marriage, but she has a goal of
going to Israel with BYU on the Travel Abroad Program so if she earns enough
money, she plans to go with them next year.  We’re excited for her and hope she
can.  Her major in college is Elementary Education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Our oldest daughter, <b>Sandi</b>,
her husband, Dave, and their two little daughters, JaNae and Chelci, still live
in Grantsville and we miss not being able to see and be with them often.  We
went up to Utah for Thanksgiving so we could have our family all together and
be with our parents and loved ones, and we had a wonderful time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken’s Mom, Sandi and the little
girls were here for a visit during the summer, also my brother Terry and his
family from Alaska came.  My parents came down during October and will come
again after Christmas to stay awhile and get out of the cold in Utah.  We are
looking forward to them coming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and I were talking the other
day about our many moves and the experiences we’ve had and the great people
we’ve met, so even though our life thus far, hasn’t been too profitable
financially, we have enjoyed a good life and we decided we wouldn’t trade it if
we had the chance to do it over again.  (I read this to Ken, and he said “Well,
maybe I would change some of it.)  Our life has been exciting, (most of the
time) and we’ve had lots of wonderful opportunities and experiences.  Ken and I
love each other, our special children, the gospel, our Heavenly Father, and his
son Jesus Christ, our wonderful parents and brothers and sisters, and all our
friends.</p>

TO LAYTON, UTAH – KEN’S MOTHER’S HOME AT 419 W PAUL – APRIL 1987 TO DEC. 1990</span></b></p>

align=left hspace=12>We ended up living at Ken’s Mother’s home longer than we
had anticipated.  It was mainly because Shellie got married, and Mike and David
went on missions while we were there and our money went for those things rather
than for a home.  I know this was a blessing, however, as I always wanted to
give our children a nice reception when they got married and I always wanted
our sons to go on missions.  We couldn’t have afforded it if we had stayed in Arizona, and if we had rented a home, we probably wouldn’t have had the money. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Shellie</b> had come down to Arizona with her dad so she could get a job and earn money to go to the Study Abroad with
BYU to Israel.  They would be the first class to stay in the new
  Jerusalem Center.  She had read the book “One in Thine Hand by Gerald Lund,
when she was a teenager and she loved that book.  She wanted me to read it, but
I didn’t feel I had the time so she read it to me as I did other things.  I
loved it too.  It was about the Jews and Arabs.  She had the desire to go to Israel
from that time on.  When she was at BYU her Sophmore year and heard about this
travel abroad semester in Israel, she called and said she wanted to drop out of
school for now to work and earn money to go with them.  She said she knew we
didn’t have the money to help her go, and she didn’t want us to anyway – she
wanted to do it herself.  We approved of her decision.  After we moved to Ken’s
mother’s house in Layton, I was talking to a friend in Firth and they were
going up to Island Park to manage a gift shop in Max’s Inn.  She knew Shellie
and wondered if she would like to come work for them and if she wanted more
money, they were sure she could be a waitress there for the restaurant at Max’s
 Inn.  Shellie was excited with the offer.  Her board &amp; room would be
furnished.  She went and did make good money, but as she neared the end of the
summer she was worried that she didn’t have enough money to be able to go.  Her
dad told her not to give up, to keep praying and trying to do her best and if
she was supposed to go, it would happen.  He said “Don’t give up until the
plane leaves without you.”  She didn’t give up.  She had sent in her papers. 
One of the questions asked something like “Where will the money come from to go
on this semester abroad?”  She answered that she was working to earn the
money.  She received a letter with a check made out to her for $1,000. (I don’t
remember for sure how much it was) but it was the difference she needed to be
able to go to Israel.  She was so excited and so were we.  They said in the
letter that they were proud of her for earning the money herself, that the
parents, of most of the kids who were going, were paying the entire amount, and
so they were giving her this money to help her finance this semester abroad. 
Wow! What an answer to her (and our) prayers.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>While she was at Island Park, <b>Roy
Seymore</b>, who she had met and dated in Arizona and they had communicated
back and forth by phone and letters, <b>came to Island Park and proposed marriage
to her</b>.  She told him that she would, but that she had been working and
saving to go to Israel on the semester abroad which left in September and
returned in December.  She told him that this had been her goal for a long time
and she was going to go.  He understood and gave her the ring.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie finished her jobs at Island
 Park and got home just a week before she was to leave for Israel. 
  Roy came up and stayed with us as he wanted to be with her as much as
possible before she left.  They had set the date of their marriage for the 18<sup>th</sup>
of December, so that meant that we had this week to get most of her wedding and
reception planned and do as much as we could.  With Roy there, it wasn’t quite
as easy, but we did get a beautiful wedding dress &amp; veil rented for her for
that day, we talked to a caterer and decided on the refreshments, we talked to
a company who decorates for receptions and Shellie picked out what she wanted. 
We tried to be frugal, but we wanted it to be nice also, and it was.  We picked
out the material and patterns for the dresses for her maid of honor (Sandi) and
her brides maids (her friends) and her flower girls (her nieces, JaNae &amp;
Chelci). We got the engagement picture taken and the photographer lined up.  Wow! 
We accomplished a lot and I did the rest while she was gone – invitations,
etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The night before she was to leave,
she came out of her room all frantic saying she couldn’t find her passport. 
She was to leave early the next morning and this was about 10:00 pm, if I
remember right.  Roy, Ken and I all started helping her look and she was
getting more and more worried and upset.  Finally, she asked us all to leave
her room.  A few minutes later she came out with her passport and a smile on
her face.  She said she knew she needed to pray and ask Heavenly Father to help
her find it, as she knew that He knew where it was.  Right after she arose from
her prayer, she went right to her journal and there it was.  Then she
remembered that she had put it there as she knew she would be taking her
journal with her.  We were all relieved and thankful she had thought to pray.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Not long after she had gone, we
received a letter from her telling us that she wasn’t sure she wanted to marry Roy. 
She felt she didn’t know him well enough and wasn’t sure she loved him enough
to marry him.  Her dad wrote back and told her not to marry him if she wasn’t
sure, and that we would hold up the wedding plans until we heard back from
her.  He said I don’t want Mom spending the money if you’re not sure.  Shellie
fasted and prayed and we did too and she wrote back telling us to move on with
the wedding plans as she had received an answer that she was to marry him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie had a wonderful experience in
  Jerusalem, learned a lot and loved being there.  She determined that someday
she would take her husband and go back, and she did.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>When Shellie returned from Israel, she only had a week
before her wedding</b>.  Roy came up to spend the week with her.  All was going
well until one night when Ken &amp; I returned from a meeting.  Shellie was
sitting on the couch crying.  I asked her what the matter was, and she said she
didn’t know if she could marry Roy.  They had been talking and both became
upset.  Roy was downstairs.  As we talked, she said she didn’t know if she
would be a good wife and mother as she didn’t like to cook, etc.  I calmed her
down and she felt better and then I went to talk to Roy.  He was very upset as
he didn’t think she wanted to marry him.  When I explained how she felt, he said
“I’m not marrying her to be a slave for me, I will help her cook and clean
house.  I’m marrying her because I love her.”  I told him to go back up and
talk to her and he did and they worked things out.  </p>

align=left hspace=12><b>The wedding was at the Salt Lake Temple</b> and Ken and
I were so happy that she was worthy and had chosen to be married in the house
of the Lord for time and all eternity.  We were so proud of her.  I beamed with
pride as I sat by her during the endowment and the wedding.  The wedding was
wonderful and Shellie looked so beautiful in her wedding dress.  We had pictures
taken afterward and then went to their wedding breakfast at the banquet room at
Chuck-A-Rama in Salt Lake.  The reception was held at the church and it was
decorated so beautifully and everything went perfect.  There were lots of
people who attended, even more than I even hoped for.  Sandi and her daughters
looked so beautiful too.  Roy, the fathers and brothers looked so nice in their
tuxedos.  The flowers were beautiful – everything was wonderful and the best
part was that Shellie thought so too.  Roy’s parents were having an Open House
for Roy and Shellie at their church in Taylor, Arizona.  The rest of our family
couldn’t go, so Ken and I rode down with Rich &amp; Lois in their motor home. 
We paid the gas and they used their motor home.  We went on over to Disneyland
too before coming back home.  The Open House was not formal and there wasn’t a
line so the bride and groom just milled around and talked with the people who
came.  It was nice and we appreciated the hospitality that Veldon and Patsy
showed us. They are good people.  She told me that she had prayed that Heavenly
Father would find a beautiful, righteous girl for Roy to marry, and her prayers
were answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Disneyland </b>–.  Ken and I went
with Rich &amp; Lois in their motor home.  We stopped at Disneyland on the way
to Taylor, Arizona for Shellie &amp; Roy’s Wedding Open House held at Roy’s
church.  This was after Shellie’s reception in Layton.  We paid the gas for the
motor home.  This was in December of 1987.  The first time we went to
Disneyland, we took our young family and went with Larry &amp; Tammy, it was
probably 1972.  We had a great time</p>

with our family, for Mike’s graduation from Firth High School.  It is a small
high school, so a small graduating class, but it was a nice graduation
exercises held in their school gymnasium. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Mike</b> told us soon after we
had moved to Arizona, and before he went back in the fall to Firth for his
Senior year, that he wasn’t going on a mission.  He had always wanted to go on
a mission so we were devastated.  Ken talked to him and found out that he knew
we didn’t have the money to send him on a mission – so he wasn’t going.  Ken
told him that things would work out, but he wasn’t convinced.  While he was
staying with the Mechams, Mike Mecham’s grandfather, who lived close by and was
a patriarch, asked Mike if he would like him to give him a patriarchal
blessing.  Mike did.  (I can’t remember whether we were there or not)  Anyway,
that changed Mike’s mind about going on a mission because in the blessing it
told him that he would go on a mission and that he would be able to convert
people that others couldn’t.  (Something like that).  Ken and I were grateful
for that blessing and we knew that he was supposed to go and that things would
work out for him to fulfill that mission.  We know if we trust in the Lord, and
keep his commandments; He can make things happen for our good.           </p>

align=left hspace=12><b> We appreciated Ken’s mom for her love and hospitality,
but it was still hard to live with her</b>.  It was both hard and yet good for
her too.  She had been alone for several years and all of a sudden we move in
with five of our six children,.  We did pay the utilities and buy the food, and
since her home was paid for, she was able to use this money for other things. 
I did most of the cooking and cleaning. Both of us cleaned thoroughly on Saturdays. 
The boys mowed the lawns in the summer and shoveled the snow in the winter - so
we were a help to her, and it would have been hard on us without her
willingness to let us move in with her.  It was definitely a blessing, and I
think to her as well.  She told us afterwards, how lonely she was without us.

align=left hspace=12>and appreciate their grandmother better.  <b>Jeff had it
the hardest because he was only nine years old and grandma didn’t have much
patience with him.  In fact, many times she was mean to him</b>.  The main
reason I decided I needed to work was because Mike wanted to go on a mission
and what Ken was making as a temporary employee out at Tooele Army Depot wasn’t
enough.  This was before the “equalized system”, so foreign missions were
expensive.  When our Bishop asked Ken &amp; I how much we could put down that
we would pay for Mike’s mission, we said $300. or less.  He said “Oh, Mike
wants to go abroad so let’s put $300. or above.”  We said we could not afford
more than $300, and he said “Well, the Elder’s Quorum can help out if needed.” 
So, we let it go at that and <b>Mike received his mission call to Norway.</b> 
We were all excited, but it was expensive - $500. and it went up to $525.  The
ward didn’t help pay and it was a struggle, but we made it and were blessed in
many ways.  Later, David wanted to go on his mission when he turned 19, which
was before Mike came home.  Again we met with the same bishop and the same
senero occurred.  David was called to the France/Belgium Mission, which started
out at $525 and went to $550. Again, the ward didn’t help out, but both Ken and
I had better paying jobs, so finances were better.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>KEN’S WORK</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When my Mom heard we were moving back to Utah
again, she told Ken about a contracting superintendent she knew that was hiring
workers.  Ken called, interviewed and was hired.  When Ken started work for
him, he found out the general contractor was a high councilman in the
Clearfield Stake when Ken was in the Bishopric with Kent Murdock.  That was
years earlier so he doubted if the contractor remembered him.  <b>Ken was able
to have Mike work with him</b> and they first framed a home in Roy. 
The material was delivered on the job and they started laying out the plates
for the walls.  That was about as much as they got done the first day, but
because the bunks of 2x4s had the shipping bands broke on them, before leaving
the job site, Ken took a can of red spray paint and sprayed two stripes across
the bunk.  The next morning when they came, it was obvious that someone had
taken quite a few boards.  Ken called the superintendent who called the Roy
police department.  A police officer soon arrived on the job site and asked if
they could identify any of the material to which Ken told them that part of the
2x4s would have 2 red stripes on them and he showed the officer how he had
marked the outside boards of the bunk.  A little later, the superintendent came
over to the job site and said that the officer had driven down through the
neighborhood a ways and saw a new garage being constructed.  He went inside the
garage and inspected the walls and there were several of the studs in the wall
that had the two red stripes on them.  The superintendent told Ken that the
officer called him and told him that he had found where our material was.  He
met the police officer at the address and told the police officer what he would
take for selling the material to the man, which was double the price he could
have bought it out of the store for, but because of the inconvenience and delay
in work, he added that to it.  The officer told the man that he could pay it
and there would be nothing more done, but if you don’t pay it, I will arrest
you and take you into jail.  The man paid it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Snowbird </b>– Bryce &amp;
Deanna have a condo at Snowbird.  They let us use their condo a couple of times
when they were not able to use it.  One time Ken &amp; Mike couldn’t go as they
were working on a house, so I took David, Scott &amp; Jeff.  Scott &amp; I got
up early Sat. morning and hiked to the top of the mountain and rode down on the
tram.  Jeff and David wanted to sleep in, so didn’t go.  Scott likes to hike
and I wanted to go, but halfway up the mountain, Scott got tired and wanted to
go back.  I told him we were halfway so we needed to go the rest of the way so
we could ride the tram free, which we did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>The second home that Ken and Mike built</b>
was in a new subdivision just south of the Hill Air Force Base runway.  As they
were framing the interior basement walls, several times during the day, jet
planes would leave the runway and would immediately climb in altitude which put
the roar of the jet going right down into the basement and almost deafening
them with each jet that took off.  Towards quitting time, the lady for which
they were building the house for stopped by to see how they were doing.  Ken
mentioned to her the deafening of the jet roar.  She kind of laughed and said “Do
you know the reason for them taking off that way?”  Ken said he didn’t.  She
worked for Hill Air Force Base so explained that those jets that come off and
then climb like that is the first flight that the plane has made since the
engine was overhauled.  The pilots of those planes receive extra pay for flying
those planes the first time.  When the pilot takes off, as soon as the tail of
the plane will clear the runway, he immediately drops it into a straight climb
up so that he can gain as much height as he possibly can and then he rolls the
plane to the west and flies over the Great Salt Lake.  By doing this, should
the plane have a flame out, the pilot should be able to have enough altitude
and speed so that he can either come back around and land on the runway or
ditch the plane in the Great Salt Lake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike and Ken finished the framing of the
stairwell from the main floor to the upstairs floor and then began laying out
the floor joists.  They had about half of the floor framed before quitting
time.  That evening, the superintendent called Ken at home and told him that he
had put the wall between the front room and the kitchen wall three feet off. 
Ken told him that it was exactly where the plans called for it, to which the
superintendent said “Well, let’s not argue about it on the telephone, but I’ll
meet you in the morning at the job site and we will try to figure out what
happened.”  The next morning as they met, the superintendent pulled out his
plans and pointed out where the wall was supposed to be.  Ken just opened up
his set of plans and told him that that’s not where my plans says it is to be. 
The superintendent took the plans from Ken and turned to the front page and
exclaimed: “Oh no, I gave you the wrong set of plans.”  They determined there
was nothing they could do but to move the wall three feet.  Ken explained to
the superintendent that half of the floor joists had already been cut and
nailed in place for the second floor.  As they looked over the plans, they
determined that the joists that had been cut, that would now be too short,
could be used on the second half of the second floor and cut more for the first
half.  Ken told him that that would take at least a day’s worth of work, plus
he would go through a good many Sawsall blades.  The superintendent said he
would figure out a way to make it up to Ken, but would prefer that the general
contractor didn’t know the mistake.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>About this same period of time, Ken
got a call from the personnel dept at Tooele Army Depot asking if he could come
and apply for a position.  Terry Matthews, who is over the maintenance and
grounds division, wanted to have him come to work for them.  Terry was a
personal friend of ours and we had gone out to a Erda Ward Reunion, where he
had talked with Terry and told him that we had just moved up from Arizona.  Ken asked the person from the personnel dept, that had called him, how soon they
would need him to start work?  He told Ken that Mr. Matthews would like him
just as quickly as possible.  Ken told him that he had at least two more weeks
of work on the house that he was presently framing and he wouldn’t leave it in
the middle of the job.  The person told Ken that they needed him before that,
so Ken told him that he wouldn’t be able to accept it.  The next evening, the personnel
dept called Ken back and said that Mr. Matthews said that that would be ok and
they asked Ken if he could find time to come out and take a physical and turn
in an application, to which Ken said he would.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>As Ken and Mike finished up the
house, the superintendent talked to Ken about the extra money that he would owe
him for the mistake in the plans and so he wanted to have Ken &amp; Mike work
on a Saturday, when the house was all but completed and add a red wood patio
deck, which Ken agreed to do.  A little later the superintendent got a hold of
Ken and said they were ready to put the patio on, so he would order the
materials for the following Saturday.  Ken told him to not have it delivered
until Saturday morning.  The following Saturday morning, Ken and Mike went over
to frame the patio and the material had been delivered Friday night but all
that was left was just the steel strapping bands and a set of truck tire
tracks.  Ken called the superintendent to let him know what had happened.  The
superintendent told him that he would see what he could get worked out, but a
couple of weeks later, Ken happened to meet him at a gas station and he talked
with him.  He apologized that he hadn’t been able to get him any money.  He
said that the general contractor had fired him using the loss of that material
as an excuse.  In reality, the superintendent hadn’t received pay for over two
months, nor did he get paid for any other outstanding expenses for any of the
jobs he had been running.  Because of this, he had to sell his back hoe to
clear several of the bills in which the company had refused to pay.  The
superintendent said he would pay it out of his own money, but he was now on the
verge of bankruptcy himself.  When Ken had first signed up with the
construction company, one of the conditions was that he put a certain percent
of his wage into a company profit sharing.  None of the employees of the
company received that money back because the owner took out bankruptcy on the
company. Boy, that contractor was a crook.  There are too many crooks in the
contracting industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Another incident with this house is
after they had framed the second floor exterior walls, they put a glue lamb
beam from the north peak of the roof to the south peak of the roof.  That beam
would be the baring beam to hold all of the roof joists.  <b>While Ken was
studying the plans, Mike was just standing there and saw a bird land upon this
beam.</b>  He removed a 16 penny nail from his apron and much to his surprise,
hit the bird some 16 feet above and the bird fell directly down to the floor
and just laid there.  Mike kind of stammered in disbelief saying: “I didn’t
think I would come close enough to even scare it, let alone hit it in the head
and knock it out.”  The bird lay on the floor for a minute or so and then began
to shake, stood up and flew away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> Ken was called to start work<b>
for Tooele Army Depot in the maintenance dept.  Ken later became a
planner/estimator. </b> After three years they had a large reduction due to
most of the depot closing down, and Ken was one of those to go.  He then went
to work for <b>Fieldcrest Cabinets as a salesman</b> for a few months and even
though he feels they are the best cabinets built, and continues to recommend
them to people today, he had to quit because they didn’t give their salespeople
a large enough percentage to make a living.  About that time, <b>my brother,
Kim Byron, talked Ken into selling for Beneficial Life Insurance with him</b>. 
Kim likes selling insurance and does very well, but Ken, after trying it for a
few months, decided that wasn’t for him either.  Soon after that he applied for
the <b>Maintenance Director position at the Five Points Mall in Bountiful,
 Utah</b>.  He was hired, and enjoyed working there.  He oversaw the cleaning
people and the gardener and he made repairs on the mall, etc.  Russ was the
manager and did not have the back bone to stand up to the man who lived in Boise,
 Idaho and was the Owner’s middleman between them and Russ.  This man didn’t
want to spend any money.  At first they did do some renovation, but towards the
end, he wouldn’t even pay to have the roof repaired and it got so bad that Ken
just had to take buckets to the shop owners when it rained.  Ken had a helper
working with him, John.  He was a good worker too and he knew karate.  They had
gang members spray painting graffiti on the outside walls of the mall.  Ken or
John had to sand it off and repaint it.  Finally, John, found out the name and
address of the leader of the gang and went to visit him.  He told him that if
they ever found graffiti on the walls of the mall again, he would personally
come and clean the walls with his body.  This was a large Samoan youth and he
knew John was good at karate, so it never happened again.  John loved his wife
and 2 daughters, but later his wife told him that she was a lesbian and wanted
her girlfriend to move in with them.  Of course, John was devastated and told
her “no” and they got a divorce.  Anyway, Ken finally got fed up with the mall
and quit.  He found a job with <b>Cape Construction</b> and he gained lots more
experience there as he built a large commercial building in Clearfield, among
many jobs and they also had him over their commercial Center in Clinton doing
all the underground cables, etc., for electricity, water, sewer, phones, etc. 
That was quite a project.  They were to put in an Albertson’s store and many
others.  The owner of Cape Construction fired Ken, because he didn’t want to
pay him the $28,000., he owed him for bonuses.  Ken didn’t make a big salary,
but was promised big bonuses.  Two weeks earlier he had told Ken that he was
his most valuable employee.  Why would you fire your most valuable employee? –
Because of money.  That was hard for both Ken and I.  Utah is one of the states
where you can fire a person without cause..  Ken took a job with <b>Recon
Construction</b> and worked there until he retired at age 62.  He then did <b>handyman
jobs for family, extended family, friends and others</b>.  He didn’t make much
money, but it sure kept him busy<b>.  </b>Ken’s last job, and one which he
still works at (2013), is a <b>school bus driver.</b>  He had driven past a K
Mart store in Bountiful and there was a school bus parked in the parking lot
with a big sign on that said “Sub school bus drivers needed”.  Ken decided this
would be much easier than doing handyman and a construction job so he applied,
was hired and they wanted him to be trained immediately.  Ken is good at
whatever he does, and this was no exception.  He has told me some of his
experiences and I have said “No way could I ever do that.”  I had two friends
in Erda – Eleanor Brown and Sally Matthews, who were school bus drivers and
they told me I should do that.  I said “No thanks, if I go to work it will be a
secretarial job because I love that, but I am not a good driver and certainly
don’t want to be responsible for the children on the school buses.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>34 – SOS
Temporary Services and Lincoln Elementary</span></b>           </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could see a need to bring in some additional income with
our boys planning to go on missions and Mike would be leaving soon and also as
I said before, that I couldn’t stand to be with Ken’s mom all the time. So <b>I
got a job at S.O.S. Temporary Service</b> doing receptionist and secretarial
work.  That was good experience for me and I was able to learn many programs on
the computer which helped me get my job as Head Secretary at Lincoln Elementary
in Layton.  The first place SOS sent me to was to <b>Layton City.  I was to
fill in for the Administrative Secretary</b> who just had her first baby.  I
was to work six weeks.  I was the secretary to the mayor and city manager.  I
had a beautiful desk and work area and made many friends there and really
enjoyed the work.  Joan decided not to return to work so they offered me her
job.  I talked to Ken and he didn’t want me to work fulltime, so I turned it
down.  They asked me to stay on until they hired someone.  It was a long
process and finally they thought they hired the “perfect” secretary.  (At least
that’s what I thought they must be looking for, with all the tests and
interviews they put those women through.)  The Chief of Police asked me to
substitute for his secretary who would be gone for a while.  One day as I was
working there, he came in with the City Manager.  Bruce, the City Manager,
asked if I would come back to the main office as they needed me more there as their
“perfect secretary” had quit.  I asked why she quit and he said: “She told us
it was too stressful, that we needed to hire another person just to answer the
phones, as she wasn’t able to get anything done with the phones ringing so
much, and the stress was too much for her.”  It was funny because every so
often Bruce would stick his head out of his office and say <b>“Mae, is the
stress getting to you, are you too stressed?” and we would laugh.</b>  It was
stressful, but I could handle it.  When they finally hired another secretary,
the legal office asked me to fill in for their secretary who was also having a
baby.  This was more stressful than the administrative secretary.  I was
secretary for the city attorney and the city lawyer (not sure what the
difference was, but two different lawyers.)  They talked in a Dictaphone and I
was to type it up.  They used such big words and I had trouble spelling them. 
I ran the office while they were away, I took papers to the court, made
appointments, etc., etc.  It was very busy and it was stressful, but I enjoyed
it also.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>SOS then sent me to <b>JetWay Systems</b> where I filled
in for the receptionist – Wow! They had lots of lines that I had to connect
people to.  I had to memorize lots of numbers and people’s names.  Lots of people
came in and I directed them to different offices.  It was beautiful there too
and I enjoyed making friends there.  I also substituted for different
secretaries there.  I had a 9 month contract with another office of JetWay
Systems in a different building.  I didn’t like it there as well, as the other
secretary was Hispanic and for some reason she didn’t like me and was rude and
ornery.  I liked the boss, but he swore a lot and used bad language.  He could
tell I didn’t like it as I would cringe with some of the things he said.  He
tried harder not to use that language around me, but I could hear him in his
office as he talked to other people and on the phone.  One day he called me in
and gave me some other projects and then said “Did you know I was a Mormon?”  I
was shocked and said “No.”  He started asking me questions about my family,
background, etc., and found out that my maiden name was Porter and that I grew
up in Sunset.  He said “Porter! I live close to Verle Porter, is he any
relative?  I told him he was my uncle.  He said Oh, I work with him in the High
Priests and we do temple work together sometimes”.  I was dumbfounded.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After that assignment, SOS sent me to <b>Kimberly
Clark</b>.  I filled in for several secretaries there also and ended up working
there for several months.  Just before Mike was to come home from his mission,
they offered me a full-time job there.  I enjoyed the work and had learned a
lot and gained a lot of experience and made many friends.  The facilities were
beautiful, but I didn’t enjoy having to go so far to go to work, especially in
the winter.  I had a couple of frightening experiences skidding on the icy
roads.  I also wanted to have some time with Mike before he went off to
college.  With working for SOS, if I didn’t want to work all the time in the
summer, I didn’t have to as they hired college students who were home for the
summers.  I talked to Ken and we decided to turn down this offer also.  I was
glad I did because I had always wanted to be an “Elementary school secretary”. </p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'>Lincoln Elementary</span></b><span style='font-size:

home.  She told me that the head secretary at Lincoln was going to the District
Office and they were taking applications for that position now.  I applied, was
called in to interview with the <b>Principal, Sandy Petersen</b>, and the night
before Mike and Becky’s wedding, Sandy called me to offer me the job.  I hadn’t
thought I would get the job as there were several who applied.  I had gotten
letters of recommendation from Joy, my boss at SOS, Dixie, the secretary over
Human Services at Layton City, and a couple of secretaries at JetWay and
Kimberly Clark.  They were great letters so I’m sure that helped.  Darlene, the
previous secretary trained me for a couple of days and then she had to leave. 
She showed me two huge binders full of instructions that I could refer to.  I
felt overwhelmed as I looked through them.  She told me I could call her when I
had questions.  The first week was awful.  I was swamped with trying to help
the teachers, the children, parents, the district office, the principal and
vice principal and trying to learn my job.  I came early, worked through my
lunch hour, and stayed late.  But it didn’t seem to help as there were always
teachers in my office asking me for help before school and after school, and
children, parents and teachers in during my lunch hour, so I finally decided I
had to take some time to eat, so sometimes I went home just to have a break. 
Ken’s mom was cute to fix me a sandwich before I got there so I could have time
to relax a little as she could see how stressful it was for me.  One of the
male teachers, who was older and about ready to retire, said to me one day “It
looks like you have bit off more than you can chew.”  Sandy had asked me in the
interview if I could handle stress because it would be very stressful out in
the front office.  I told her I liked a challenge and I could handle stress and
I told her about my jobs with SOS.  Well, I thought I knew what stress was, but
guess not.  After a week or so, I was so overwhelmed that I talked to Ken and
we decided that I should quit.  <b>That morning when I went to school and was
going to talk to Sandy and tell her I would be quitting, there was a beautiful
floral arrangement on my desk with a card from Sandy saying she appreciated all
I was doing and she was very thankful she had me for her secretary.  She said
how kind, friendly and helpful I was to all who came into the school and into
our office.  Well, how could I quit now?</b>  I didn’t and I was happy I
hadn’t.  I learned line upon line and with the help of my three assistants
(playground and office assistants) we were able to get the work done.  I
learned to love the teachers, parents, children and especially Sandy.  Sandy
was an exceptional boss and friend.  I was so blessed to have her as my
principal.  Lincoln Elementary was a year-round school with 1000 students. 
Lincoln Elementary was located on Antelope and just below Hill Field Road.  I
worked there from October 1990 to August 1995.  Maybe I should have taken the
job with Layton City as their Administrative Secretary as it would have been a
great job and I would have made good money.  But I had always wanted to be an
Elementary School Secretary - so I was able to do that and I did love the
children, principal, vice principle, teachers and most of the parents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I had three great assistant
secretaries.  They did the playground duty during recess and the lunch break, <img

align=left hspace=12>but otherwise they were in the office helping me and
helping those who came into the office and helping me answer the phones.  <b>Gail
Revett</b> was one assistant.  She was a tiny little petite lady.  (She is on
the left side, second roll up in the picture.) She was married and lived in a
nearby trailer court and had one son.  She was very good at her job, but her and
<b>Luanne Macfarlane</b> didn’t get along.  They tried to compete for work in
the office.  Instead of one or the other being lazy, they were both very hard
workers and very efficient, so that was great, but they didn’t get along.  They
were always coming to me about something the other was doing that they felt
should be their job.  They were jealous of each other, I think and very
competitive.  I thought a lot of each of them, but it was a headache for me to
try to keep them happy.  Luanne was our Bishop’s wife. (She is on the right,
second row up, third one from the end, in the picture).  <b>Lorraine Rirey</b>
was the other assistant and she was a neat lady.  I became friends with most of
the teachers, and I liked all of them. (Lorraine wasn’t in this picture) <b>Nancy
Mecham</b>, a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade teacher and I were walking buddies.  (Nancy
is sitting on the front row on the left in front of Gail Revett). Nancy and I
would walk together each morning before school started.  In the spring, summer
and fall, we would walk outdoors and in the winter, we would walk fast around
the halls.  She was a neat lady and as we talked, we got to know each other
very well. (Nancy is on the first row, first on the left side in the picture.)  A
6<sup>th</sup> grade teacher, Joan ?? and I enjoyed visiting together.  <b>Claudia
Thompson</b> was a 2<sup>nd</sup> grade teacher and a good friend, we were
friends at Lincoln, and we lived in the same stake, so were counselors to Marge
Beardall in the Stake Relief Society Presidency.  Then when Ken &amp; I moved
to Clinton after our mission to the Philippines, Claudia &amp; Wayne had moved
to Clinton and “what a surprise”, there were in our ward.  (She is on the 2<sup>nd</sup>
row u and the 5<sup>th</sup> from the left side.)  There were many I really
admired and enjoyed being with.  I don’t know any I didn’t like – I just liked
some more than others.  Val, Sandy’s husband was always coming into the school
bringing flowers to Sandy or bringing her something for lunch.  He was a neat
guy.  He and Sandy had bought a beautiful condo in St. George and Val suggested
to Sandy that they let Ken and I stay in it for a get-a-way weekend vacation
some time.  She asked me if we would like to do that and when I asked Ken, he
was excited.  We really enjoyed it.  They let us use it two different times. 
Val would bring me a drink sometimes when he would bring Sandy one.  Sandy had
flowers delivered to me many times and she gave me wonderful gifts for
Christmas, my birthdays and Secretary Days, and took me and my assistants to
lunch sometimes.  She was always praising me, so of course, I tried to do my
best and I loved working with her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>            Sandy always gave me
wonderful reviews each year and she nominated me to receive the secretary of
the year award in 1992.   The superintendent presented these awards at the
school board meeting.  He said some nice things about me and then presented me
with a plaque which read: “Davis County Schools extends honor and recognition
to Iva Mae Browning, Secretary at Lincoln Elementary School for dedicated and
outstanding service for the children of the Davis County Schools for 1992.  It
was signed by Dr. Richard Kendell, Superintendent of Schools and Lynn
Summerhays, President of the Board of Education</p>

align=left hspace=12>            After two years, the people over Job Core
talked Sandy into coming to work for them, being over their educational dept. 
She talked to the superintendent about it and they ask her to be on a “leave of
absence” so if the job didn’t work out or she didn’t enjoy it, she could come
back and work for the district again.  We were all sad that she would be
leaving Lincoln Elementary as we all loved her.  She worked for a year and even
though the pay was great, she wanted to come back to the district.  She got a
principal position at Layton Elementary.  Her principal position at Lincoln had,
of course, been filled by Richard Baird. He was an “ok” principal, but he sure
wasn’t near as good as Sandy.  The faculty, parents and children knew that as
well as I.  I was there three years with him.  <b>Jody Schaap </b>was the first
assistant principal to Sandy and she was great too, and then she got a position
as principal at another elementary school.   (Jody is in this picture with Ken
&amp; I).  Another vice principal was hired at Lincoln.  She was a different
lady, but I liked her too. (I can’t remember her name now.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Another reason for going to work was I couldn’t stand to
be home with Ken’s mother all day</b>.  She is a wonderful person, but very
negative.  She complained a lot and was also strict in many ways.  I hated to
not be home when Jeff &amp; Scott got home from school, but thought at that
time, that Grandma would be ok with them until I got home, but tragically she
wasn’t.  If I had known then what I know now, I probably wouldn’t have gone to
work, although I don’t know how we would have made it financially and with me
working, we were able to qualify for a loan to get our home later.  Ken’s mom
was also an emulate housekeeper and so she didn’t like Jeff playing anywhere
except his room and she wanted all the children to keep their rooms clean.  <img

align=left hspace=12>She didn’t want Jeff to bring his friends over.  (Ken said
he was never allowed to bring his friends over when he was growing up. They
could go over to friend’s homes sometimes or else play outside, but not in her
house because she didn’t want them to mess it up.  I had a hard time with that
and stood up to her - so Jeff did have his one friend over a few times.  I had
to stand up for Jeff a lot, and it was her, not Jeff that was the problem. 
Many times when I would come home from work, I would see “fire” in her eyes and
I knew she was upset about something.  I would like to have avoided the
confrontation, but I had to work it out with her since it was her home.  We had
brought the children’s dog with us when we moved up.  She had consented to it,
but soon she was upset because of the dog mess.  Ken &amp; I instructed the
children that they were to gather it up each day.  She was also upset that it
dug in the dirt a little - so it wasn’t worth it and we had Shellie take the
dog up to Island Park where she was working.  After Shellie was married she
gave the dog to Roy’s parents.  One Saturday Ken’s mom was really upset and had
lit into Jeff.  When I found out what it was (it seems like she was missing
some spoons and accused Jeff of playing with them outside and losing them.) 
Jeff didn’t play with spoons.  I went outside and found her working in the
yard.  After she got through spouting off, I just said to her <b>“It’s too bad
that you care more about</b> <b>things</b> <b>than you care about people,
especially your own grandson</b>”, and I walked back inside the house.  She was
nicer after that - at least for awhile.  She had told us when we moved in that
it was not just her home, but it was to be our home as well.  We appreciated
that, but she never let anyone else think that.  She always made it absolutely
clear to the neighbors, ward members, family, etc., that it was “her home”, not
ours, and we were living with <img width=229 height=1

align=left hspace=12>her.  After we had moved into our home in Layton,
I found out from either Scott or Jeff (can’t remember which) that Jeff had used
some of our notebook paper to make paper airplanes or use at targets, etc. 
They said that grandma became so upset with Jeff and said “why are you wasting
your parent’s good paper?  Don’t you know that they don’t have much money?  In
fact, if it wasn’t for me letting all of you come live with me, you would be
out on the streets.”  When they told me that, I was furious.  We would not have
been out on the streets.  We were not that poor, and Ken is a good provided, he
would have done whatever it took to get us either a home or apartment and I was
working too and we could have made it.  It would have been a struggle, but we
would have been alright.  It just made it easier for us since we had had
financial problems in Arizona, to move in with her to get back on our feet.  I
was shocked that she would say such things to our children<b>....  Scott was
older and she wasn’t so hard on him, in fact, he stood up to her several times
for Jeff when we weren’t there.  I am thankful he did and Jeff felt that Scott
was his “hero” for doing so.  One incident which Jeff wrote in his journal was
a particularly hard day for Jeff with Grandma.  Grandma had been yelling at
Jeff and Jeff was crying.  Scott was downstairs and heard it all and came
running up the stairs and lit into his Grandmother for doing that, and told her
that Jeff was a good kid and that she better never talk like that or act like
that to him again.  Jeff said that meant so much to him for Scott to stand up
for him, and his love and admiration for Scott grew so much that day.</b></p>

his mom and dad came up to us and said “You let Mike come back for his senior
year and live with the Mechams, will you let David come back for his senior
year and live with us?”  David was excited as he really wanted to do that.  The
Leavetts were good people too, and we had felt bad for David, so we agreed.  I
had paid $50.00 a month to the Mechams to help with Mike’s groceries so I
insisted on paying that to the Leavetts also.  We went back home and David got
a job at the Safeway Grocery Store which was only a few blocks away.  It was by
the Layton Hills Mall.  I think he worked in the produce dept, but I’m not
sure.  He was a hard worker, dependable and they liked him. In the fall, he did
go back to Firth.  Jared had a girl friend so was with her most of the time, so
David &amp; his friend, Scott, did a lot together.  That caused some problems
with Sister Leavett so it wasn’t as enjoyable a year as it was for Mike.  David
really liked Brother Leavett as he was kind and understanding.  David didn’t go
to the Junior Prom there as he said he couldn’t afford it.  I wish I had sent
him the money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Our family went up to Firth for <b>David’s

me to have our sons get these Eagle awards, even though her sons didn’t get
theirs.  I guess Mike &amp; David wouldn’t have gotten their Eagle Scout awards
if I hadn’t done this as they were not motivated to do it on their own.  They
didn’t have great experiences in the scouting program and didn’t have great
scout masters, like some do.  They put Ken in at one time, while Mike &amp;
David were in Scouting in Grantsville, and I was excited as I knew Ken would do
a great job, but soon after we moved again – this time to Firth, Idaho.  <b>Mike
received his Eagle Scout award in Firth and David got his when we were living
in Layton with Ken’s mom</b>.  Because Mike &amp; David didn’t like scouting,
they turned Scott and Jeff off, so they didn’t finish theirs.  Scott only
needed his Eagle project and one other merit badge to get his.  His scout
committee chairman was Brother Cottle, and he wanted Scott to finish it and was
trying to help him and had a project all arranged for him, but he wouldn’t do
it.  I tried to convince him to do it, especially since he was this close, but
he became upset and said “I don’t want it”, so I told him that if he didn’t
want it, I wouldn’t say another word about it, but I told him he might regret
it.  I started working with Jeff early and took him to his merit badge classes
and he was doing great, but then he quit and I couldn’t get him to keep working
on it.  A few months before his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, he asked me about it
and said maybe he would finish it, but you have to wait a certain amount of
time to go from one level to another and he didn’t have enough time.  I felt
bad about it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>All our sons haven’t encouraged
their sons to do much with scouting, since they didn’t like it, and so our

and he could pay for his mission until Mike got home and then we could take it
over.  We had Mike earn enough money to buy his clothes, luggage and what he
needed to leave on his mission and we paid from then on, so we wanted each of
our sons to do that.  David did that plus paid 2 or 3 months of his mission.  I
found out later, that Ken had told David that we would pay him back after he
returned from his mission as David was planning to use that money to go to
college.  I didn’t know about that – at least I sure don’t remember either of
them talking to me about it.  We didn’t pay David back, Ken told him we
couldn’t afford to pay him back.  David has resented that and I don’t blame
him, but I didn’t find out until years later and it made me sad to find it out.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> <b>David mission call was to
Belgium and France.</b>  It was hard for him to learn French at the mission
home, but when he got out on his mission, he did great with learning the
language.  It was a hard mission as far as baptisms.  It was also a hard
mission for David since his mission president wanted baptismal numbers, so
David’s zone leaders told him that when he was teaching investigators, that if
they were not living the law of chastity, then they told him not to teach that
lesson, and if they were not living the Word of Wisdom, then don’t teach them that
lesson.  David told them that he couldn’t do that, that he knew that’s not what
the Lord would have him do.  They said “You better or you will never be a zone
leader.”  David told them that he wasn’t worried about that, but that the
investigators needed to know the truth and be fully converted.  David said it
was hard to bring investigators to church as there were drug addicts there and
all sorts of undesirable people so he felt the investigators wouldn’t want to
belong to this kind of a church.  (David might correct me on some of this, but
this is how I remember it when he told us after getting home from his
mission.)  David’s first mission president’s time to go home came up while
David was still there, and his second mission president was much better and did
want the investigators to be taught all the lessons.  He was a good example and
we wish he had been David’s mission president the entire time David was there.</p>

a good job working for a company who harvested the brine shrimp from the Great
Salt Lake.  Their grandma Porter had told him about this.  When David came home
from his mission, he was able to work with Mike harvesting the brine shrimp
too.  It was hard work, but they made good money.  Mike &amp; Becky spent their
first Christmas holidays out on the Salt Flat watching over the equipment there
and staying in a house trailer.  They said they enjoyed it, even though they
missed out on being with family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mike met Rebecca Stewart (Becky) while on his mission in
Norway.</b>  She was a sister missionary there.  Her mission ended sooner than
Mike’s, so they corresponded through letters until he arrived home.  They dated
and were married in three months.  It was neat that both of their patriarchal
blessings told them that they had chosen their eternal companion in the pre-existence. 
Becky is a wonderful girl and a great addition to our family.  Her and mike
have a great marriage.  They were married in the Manti Temple.  (I had lots
more on Mike, but when I was copying and pasting, I got distracted and somehow
deleted it- I hope to remember it and will try to write more)</p>

Park and camped at the Buttermilk Campground when Shellie was working at Max
Inn at Island Park</u></b>.  We came up to spend her birthday on the 21<sup>st</sup>
of June with her.  I had made a cake and brought it up, plus presents.  We ate
at Max Inn at least once and Shellie was so busy waitressing that she didn’t
have much time to sit and visit with us, but I was proud of her.  She was a
great waitress.  We enjoyed spending time with her and listening to her tell
about her experiences while working here.  She also worked in our friend’s gift
shop there at Max Inn.  In fact, they contacted Shellie to see if she would
like to work in their gift shop and then told her she could probably also work
as a waitress in the restaurant.  This was a blessing for Shellie as she was
trying to work and save money to go on the “Travel Abroad to Israel” with BYU
for a semester.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Scott has always been good on
the trampoline</b>.  Ken bought our children a trampoline for Christmas when we
lived in Grantsville.  He had worked in Alaska for three months and had made
good money finishing homes for the Indians up there.  It was a government
contract and our high councilman over the farm had the contract and knew Ken
had been a contractor and he had seen the beautiful basement Ken had finished
for our home. He knew Ken wasn’t busy on the farm during the winter so asked if
he would go.  He did so Christmas morning we put up the trampoline and the
children were so excited.  All of the children loved the trampoline, but Scott
is quite a gymnast and learned to do forward flips, backward flips, etc.  When
we moved to Layton, we set it up in Ken’s mother’s back yard and Scott &amp;
his friend, David, would play on their trampolines as David had one also and
they got really good at doing tricks.  They were in an assembly and their dad’s
took both trampolines to the Junior High and set them up at the back of the gymnasium
and where it was their turn, they did tricks jumping from one trampoline to the
other and passing each other doing all kinds of flips.  Everyone loved it.  I
don’t remember if Ken was there, but I went and thought they were great!</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>Scott</b> had several friends in Layton Phil, Rory, and
Matt lived in our neighbor so they were together a lot.  One time we found out
that while Phil’s parents were away, they went over there and took out a
mattress and put it by the back fence.  They then climbed upon the roof and
would take turns jumping off as high as they could and landing on the
mattress.  They thought that was great fun.  We are so thankful that none of
them were hurt as if they had missed the mattress, they could have done great
damage to their bodies.. They would get together at one of their homes (I don’t
think they every did at Grandma’s house, but they did after we bought our home
in Layton).  They loved to play “Risk” and other fun games.  They all were good
friends.  Scott still gets together with them once in a while, usually just the
guys.  Phil &amp; his wife live in Virginia as he is in the FBI.  Matt is
divorced and Rory &amp; his wife live in Orem.  When they went to Layton High,
they met a couple of other friends, Lane and RJ (something like that) and they
were good guys too.</p>

good kid, but his mom was a single mom and had to work fulltime so would come
home tired and didn’t do much after that.  He had older brothers that were lazy
and could go and come as they pleased, so we felt sorry for this boy.  Grandma
didn’t want Jeff to have him in her house, so Jeff mainly went to his home.  I
didn’t like that, so I explained to Mom Jensen that he needed to have his
friend come here some too.  That happened some, but not often and they had to
mind their “Ps” &amp; “Qs” there.  There was only one other boy in our
neighborhood and ward and he was African American and had been adopted.  He was
a big kid and kind of a bully so Jeff didn’t like to be with him much.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>In November of 1991, we were able to buy our home here in
Layton.  It’s a nice home in a young ward.  They are the ages of our older children. 
We are definitely the grandparents, but we love being grandparents - so it’s
great.  <b>We enjoy it here, and it has been a good move for Jeff.</b>  He
found wonderful friends, especially <b>Trent Teeples and later Anna</b>.  They
helped him become very involved in music, drama and seminary council.  Ken and
I loved to go watch the plays Jeff was in when he was at Layton High.  We took
our mothers with us and they enjoyed them too.  Jeff was not in Latones, which
was a mixed choir, but was in the male choir, Lyrics.  I loved to go to the
school when they performed or other places during the Christmas holidays as
they put on a great Christmas program.  They didn’t just stand and sing, they
had a choreographer who taught them special dance moves.  It was fun to watch
them.   Jeff was first at Central Davis Jr. High and Scott was at Layton High. 
Jeff had a friend (can’t remember his name) and we took him with us when Ken,
Jeff &amp; I went to visit Shellie, Roy &amp; family in Mesa, Arizona.  We
stopped at the sand dunes on the way home and he and Jeff had a great time
playing on them.  We had a little Sprint which Scott drove until he went on his
mission and when Jeff turned 16 he drove it.  I’ll tell a couple of experiences
of him with the sprint.  Jeff and his friend were up in East Layton and the
friend wanted to drive.  Jeff let him and he didn’t make a turn and did some
damage to the car.  <b>(Ask Jeff if I have this story correct) </b> Another
time Jeff &amp; Trent went driving up in the mountains and we got a call late
at night that they were stranded. I don’t remember how they got a hold of us as
there were no cell phones then.  Anyway, Ken called Rodney Stevenson, who was a
mechanic and a close neighbor and they drove up and brought the boys home and I
think it was the next day that Ken and Rodney went back to get the car with
Rodney’s truck.  Rodney told Jeff “This isn’t even a place that Jeeps should
go, let alone the Sprint.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Scott made friends here too</b>,
although the friends he made, while living with Grandma, are still his good
friends and since they all drive and go to Layton High, it’s easy for them to
still do things together.  Scott learned to swim and dive while living in Arizona
so he got on the Layton High Diving team.  He is really good, so went to state
competition.  I love to watch him dive.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Scott</b> had dated several girls in Layton and the
surrounding area.  The first one he went steady with was Rachel.  She was a
nice girl, but she liked Scott too much and I was glad when they broke up.  He
dated another girl and she really worried me as she always wanted to be with
him and she would call him all the time and after David returned from his
mission and he and Scott shared the basement bedroom, she knocked on their
window late one night and told him she had baked him some cookies.  I was glad
when he started dating <b>Mishelle</b>.  After just a few dates with her, they
were talking and she told him that she would never marry any boy who hadn’t
gone on a mission.  Scott decided that maybe other good girls would feel this
way, so he made an appointment with the Bishop to see what he needed to do to
prepare for his mission.  At this time he was working at <b>Golden Corral in Clearfield.</b>  He was hired on as a dishwasher and then they moved him up to a cook.  We
were excited that he had this good job, but didn’t realize that the manager and
others played hard rock music back there and Scott liked it, got hooked on it
and started buying those CDs.  When we first started hearing him play that
music, we were upset.  The bishop told him he would need to get rid of those
CDs, read the Book of Mormon, etc.  He was great!  He came home and did get rid
of all those hard rock music CDs and did what the bishop asked him to do and
did prepare himself for his mission.  He continued to date Mishelle and they
fell in love and she told him she wanted to wait for him.  He told her she
could date while he was gone as he didn’t think it was fair for her to stay
home, but she wouldn’t date others.  She had plenty of chances, but she loved
Scott and wanted him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I would like to insert a <b>spiritual
experience</b> I had while living with Ken’s Mom in Layton, and <b>Scott</b>
was working at the Golden Corral in Clearfield.  Like I said before, Scott got
hooked on hard rock music at the Golden Corral as it was played there.  He
liked this music and bought CDs.  I had a hysterectomy and bladder surgery and
was home recuperating.  Scott and his friends wanted to go to a concert at Park
 City.  He would be driving the Sprint.  I wasn’t excited about him going, let
alone driving, as many at those concerts were drunk or stoned and would still
drive, so I was worried that Scott might be in an accident or have other
problems with the people there.  I trusted Scott, but I didn’t trust many of
those who would be at the concert.  Anyway he went.  Ken, his mother and Jeff
were asleep and it was late, but I couldn’t sleep because of worrying about
Scott and also the discomfort I was in.  I began to imagine all sorts of bad
things and I had so much anxiety.  Finally, I realized I needed to pray
sincerely for Scott’s safety.  As soon as I asked the Lord to protect him, I
had a warm, peaceful feeling come over me, the anxiety and worry left, and I
knew Scott was alright.  I was so thankful to my Heavenly Father at this time
for his love and concern for me, for Scott and all of us.  Scott returned home
soon after, but he had come close to an accident and as we talked, I shared my
concerns and feelings with him and how Heavenly Father had answered my prayers.</p>

because they have to turn in their caps and gowns right after the graduation. 
It didn’t work out to get picture before, so I’m thankful I have this one of
him receiving his diploma.  The graduation exercises were held out on the

sweet girl she was.  The funny thing was that he introduced her as Shauna Jones
(another girl he was going with)  Shauna didn’t think too much about it, she
just thought it was a slip of the tongue, but when he introduced her to Georgia
&amp; Rick as Shauna Jones, she knew he must be dating another Shauna – Shauna
Jones.  They had a talk about it later.  He hadn’t dated either for awhile as
he was busy with his studies, but a special event came up and he wanted to go,
but needed a date.  He asked me about it and I said: “Why don’t you take Shauna
Howard, she’s a beautiful and sweet girl.”  He called and she accepted.  They
started dating steadily after that.  He decided to go into the medical field. 
He lived with us two years until he and Shauna got married.  I enjoyed having
him come home and tell me about the things he learned at college and the
experiences he had.  Shauna is another beautiful daughter-in-law and we are

would come to visit.  We asked her about it and she said that she has been to
the doctor several times, but he just keeps giving her antibodies, but they
don’t seem to be helping.  I told her she should go to a specialist as her cold
and cough sounded awful.  Her mother took her to a specialist and they
determined that she had Hodgkin’s Cancer and it was in the 4<sup>th</sup>

had to postpone their wedding date.  She needed Scott at this time so he put
off his education and was with her at all her Chemo treatments.  Jackie,
Mishelle’s mother, talked to me and asked: “Scott won’t leave her, will he.  I

Elk, Geese, etc.  It is beautiful there.  Ken &amp; Rich would go to Lion Head,
but it was too dangerous for Lois &amp; I.  We would ride up past the continental
divide and go up on top of a mountain called “Two Top” where the wind and snow
had made beautiful formations on the trees.  It was so beautiful and you could
see all over.  I was nervous going up and back down, however.  The last time we
did this, Rich &amp; Lois didn’t go with us so both Ken and I had our own
snowmobiles.  The snow and wind had made deep hills and gullies and it was so
frightening (at least for me)  Ken kept waving for me to come up, but I finally
went up one so steep that it flipped me and the snowmobile over and down we
came and landed by a pine tree.  If I had hit the pine tree, I could have been
seriously hurt.  The snowmobile was buried and Ken and some other riders got
the snowmobile out.  I wouldn’t go up any further and I was really frightened
to go back down – but I made it.  Other times, all of us went in their motor
home to Yellowstone Park, then unloaded the snowmobiles and road the
snowmobiles through the Park.  It was really cold, but we dressed warm in
snowmobile suits and helmets and would stop at the “warming shacks” to get
warm, drink hot chocolate and eat our lunch.  It was so beautiful.  We saw lots
of buffalo, Elk, Fox, Geese, Swans, etc.  We also run into a herd of buffalo a
couple of times.  You would pass other riders, as many like to snowmobile
there.  There is a clubhouse close to the condo where we would go and sit in
hot tubes, swim, play ping pong, etc<b>.  </b>Lois &amp; I would help each
other cook meals &amp; clean.  We would read, visit, play games, especially
“Mormon Bridge” as that is Rich’s favorite.  We would also watch videos, etc.,

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our Country Creek Ward was divided and they made
the Country View Ward, which put our home in that new ward.  Bishop Rudd was
the Bishop of the Country Creek Ward and had been since our family bought our
home there.  A family had just bought a home in our neighborhood, but their
stay was supposed to be only temporary while they built their new home in Fruit
Heights.  They were a steward, faithful family, so he was called to be our new
bishop.  When he was sustained as Bishop, he spoke and told the ward members
that if they were called to positions, they shouldn’t decline saying that it
wasn’t a convenient time as it surely wasn’t a convenient time for him.  He
wanted to spend most of his spare time overseeing the building of his home and
with being called to be Bishop, he wouldn’t have much spare time.  Well, he called
me in and asked me to be the Relief Society President.  When he asked if I
would accept the calling, I told him “How can I refuse after you gave your
talk.”  I fasted and prayed about my counselors and secretary and the Lord did
bless me with a wonderful presidency.   My first counselor was Jolynn Stevenson
and she was great – so dependable, had great ideas and was always there to do
her part and go visiting the sisters with me.  She was energetic and
enthusiastic.  My other counselor, secretary and teachers were wonderful too.  When
I asked to be released due to not having enough time to fulfill my calling like
I needed to, as I was having to help my mom and Ken’s mom lots more because of
their age and health, our son, David, was going to be married so I had things
to do for that, and I was still working full time at Davis School District and
it was a stressful job, especially at this time.  When I told my counselors
that I was going to be released, they were disappointed as they had enjoyed
serving with me and as a presidency.  Jolynn was expecting their last baby and
when the baby was born, her and Rodney named her Libby Mae.  She gave her the
name of “Mae” after me.  I was honored to have them do that, and Libby Mae has
always been close to me.  Jolynn would make a special effort to invite me to
special occasions for Libby, or to stop over, call, etc.  She, Rodney and Libby
Mae just stopped in to see me on Monday (July 3, 2017 – just rewriting and
adding to this history) to let me know that Libby Mae was leaving for her
mission to the state of Washington the following day.  She had lost our phone
number, so hadn’t been able to let me know that she was speaking in church
prior to leaving on her mission.  We had a good visit and several hugs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          <b>I am the
secretary at Staff Development at Davis School District</b>.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I was talking to Sandy
Petersen and asked how she liked her job at Davis School District.  She told me
she really liked it and liked the people she worked with.  She told me that I
should come to the district also.  I told her that I would if I could be her
secretary again.  She told me that the secretary of Staff Development was
quitting and I should apply for it.  Sandy worked in Staff Development.  She
was the liaison between the district and the University of Utah.  I loved
working at Lincoln Elementary, but felt I needed a change, especially if I
could work with Sandy.  I applied and was called in for an interview.  When I
arrived, I was surprised and intimated to see that there were 8 people around
the large table in the conference room who would be interviewing me.  Claudia
Seeley, the Staff Development Director, the director of Curriculum, Sandy
Petersen, and others (I don’t remember their names) They asked me all kinds of
questions and even though I was nervous, I must have done okay as then they had
me go in another office and take both a written and computer test.  They told
me they would call and let me know after they had finished the interviews. 
They called and I was hired, but then I had mixed emotions as I was nervous
about starting another job and I would have to travel further and I did feel
bad about leaving Lincoln.  </span></p>

align=left hspace=12><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          When I started
working, I had a desk, with several other secretaries who worked for the
Curriculum department.  I was told that we should not let the phones keep
ringing, that if the other secretaries were on their phones or away from their
desk, that I should answer their phones and take messages.  This was hard as
many calls for Staff Development kept coming in, so between helping principals,
vice principals, teachers and other people from the district, who needed my
help or needed to talk to <b>Claudia, Sandi or Peggy</b>, I had to answer their
calls and take messages.  I also found out that the reason the former secretary
quit was because she felt this job was too stressful, so she applied for a job
in another department.  I found out from the other secretaries and later from
Claudia, that this secretary didn’t do her work that she just visited with the
other secretaries and took time off work.  I called her to ask her if she would
come and train me and I had a hard time pinning her down to a day and time, but
finally she came.  She didn’t stay long as she said it was just too stressful
for her and gave her anxiety.  She wasn’t any help, so I just had to learn by
reading information and asking Claudia and others.  I felt like I had jumped
from the frying pan into the fire.  It was hard at Lincoln, but at least
Darlene had trained me for a couple of days and I could call her at the
district when I had questions.  I got lots of calls from angry teachers who
were supposed to get their “lane changes” ( raises) and they hadn’t gotten them
because the classes they had taken were not recorded.  I saw a box of receipts
on top of the filing cabinet.  These were to be recorded and filed, but they
were not.  I was frustrated that I didn’t have the time to get out information
to the schools and teachers by mail so I asked Claudia if I could get a
neighbor of mine to do this for me and if the district could pay her.  Claudia
understood how hard it was for me, so she agreed and I found a neighbor to do
this and this helped.  There was a small room next to Claudia’s office and
close to Sandi &amp; Peggy’s office that had been used for a copy room.  There
was a copier in there, paper, boxes, file cabinets, etc.  The district
remodeled and made a larger copy room for both Staff Development and Curriculum
to use, so they discontinued using this small room.  I had a good idea and
approached Claudia about moving my desk &amp; file cabinet to this room when I
would just answer our phones and could have more time to do my work.  She
agreed and I was moved.  I had a chair sat by my desk where when teachers or
others came, they could sit there and I could help them.  This worked so much
better.  There wasn’t a window in this room, but that was better for me as it
was more private and I could keep my door open and the office across from me
had a window and Greg was gone a lot, but would leave his door open for me.  </span></p>

align=left hspace=12><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          I would come
early, work through my lunch hour and work late to try to get the work caught
up from how the former secretary left it to me.  Claudia told me that when she
quit getting angry phone calls, she would go out and celebrate.  I think she
was about ready to fire that girl (can’t remember her name) and the girl knew
it, so quit.  She wanted to anyway as she had let the work go so long that she
was getting angry phone calls too.  Ken was concerned as he was afraid the
stress would cause health problems for me, so he tried to think of ways to help
me and simplify my work.  He did really help me.  He came up with an excellent
filing system and helped me get it set up.  That was a big help.  Also Claudia
was able to get funding from the district to hire a part-time assistant
secretary for me.  Patti was working part-time for the Curriculum Dept and she
wanted full time work, so she applied for this position and was hired.  I
thought she would be a great help, but actually she was another frustration for
me.    She was so social that she kept visiting with the other secretaries and
other staff that she wasn’t a lot of help.  But I was finally able to get the
work caught up and able to help the teachers as they called or came in. 
Claudia was really happy, and her and I had a great relationship.  <b>Claudia
was getting close to retirement and the district was building another beautiful
building just adjacent to the main building, and Claudia was in on the planning
of it.  She planned out a beautiful area for Staff Development and had a
wonderful area for me with a beautiful desk and everything I needed.  We were
on the second floor.  Claudia retired and Sandy applied for this position and
got it.  I was excited as I knew she would be wonderful and I loved working for
her.</b>  Patti wanted to work full time for just one department so she applied
and got the secretary position at the planning department, which was also in
this building.  I was happy that she was gone.  We hired another girl to take
Patti’s place and she was good, but soon applied for full time at the
transportation dept and got that job.  We had the funds now to hire a full-time
Receptionist/assistant secretary and we hired another girl.  She was great at
technology, but not so great at doing the work she needed to do, so she was
another frustration.  She was always calling in sick at the last minute and I
would have to do her work as well as mine.  This happened so often, that one
day as I was sitting at her desk and crying because it was too much, Sandy came
out of her office and when she saw me crying, she was very concerned and asked
me what the problem was. When I told her, she was angry and said she would take
care of it.  I told her “no” that I would work with her a little longer.  Her
husband was usually the one who called to say she was sick.  This girl knew
that she was on the brink of getting fired, so she quit. </span></p>

align=left hspace=12><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>           Sandy and I were
mainly the ones to interview and hire another Receptionist/Secretary and we had
many applicants.  We interviewed about 6 and we narrowed it down to two.  Sandy
kind of leaned to the one as she was younger than Billie, had more experience, and
was more social.  Billie was a little shy, but I felt good about her.  Sandy
had to go out of town and she said she would leave it up to me and I could hire
the one I wanted.  I was excited about that and hired <b>Billie Ririe.</b>  <u>She
turned out to be fantastic</u>!  She was so dependable, efficient, kind and
courteous on the phone and when people came into our department.  She was
always on top of everything and she came early to work and would stay later if
it was needed.  She was a widow, who was living in the basement with her
daughter, in Billie’s son’s home.  Her daughter was single and worked as a
custodian for the school district.  The Lord really blessed me to have Billie
as my assistant – now I loved my job and everyone I worked with in this
department.  When we were not busy, we visited, laughed and helped each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          One of my
responsibilities was to put out a monthly catalogue with all the classes which
Staff Development was offering.  This took a lot of time, but I enjoyed doing
this too.  The teachers took these classes as requirements to get their lane
changes.  I also ordered food for many of our meetings.  Sometime I had them
catered by Food Services, sometimes other restaurants and sometimes I would go
get food and get it ready, I especially did this for continental breakfasts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          When Sandy became
the Staff Development Manager, they hired <b>Betty Spencer</b> to take her
place as the liaison between the district and the University of Utah.  <b>Peggy
Saunders</b> was the liaison between the district and Weber State University.  Marilyn
Junk worked part time for Curriculum and part-time for Staff Development, but
her office was in the Curriculum Dept.  Peggy was let go (I can’t remember why
but she was unhappy about that.  I was sad too as we had become good friends. –
probably politics in the District)  <b>Christy Blanch,</b> the former principal

died soon after. (<u>Back row, left to right, in this picture is: Marilyn Junk,

assistant secretary and part time for Curriculum.  Her desk was in the
Curriculum Dept.)  <b>Jackie Thompson</b> was hired to take Christy’s place. 
Jackie is African American and also very smart, but also very sweet.  I was not
only Sandy’s secretary, but the secretary for Betty and Jackie as well.  Jackie
and I became great friends, even though she was one of my bosses, and we would
go walking and talking on our lunch hours when she didn’t have trainings,
meetings, etc.  Afterwards we would eat our lunches together in the break
room.  Jackie is very spiritual and has great family values so we enjoyed
visiting as we walked and ate our lunch.  We had such good talks that after I
retired and returned home from our mission to the Philippines, I would call her
and we would set up a day each month to get together on her lunch hour and
again walk, talk and go to lunch.  She scheduled an extra long lunch hour for
herself so we had plenty of time.  We did this until Ken and I went on our
California mission and when we returned, Jackie and I again met monthly for our
walk, talk &amp; lunch.  I haven’t called her since we moved to Roy as Ken can’t
drive school busses anymore, so we don’t have extra money for gas and lunch,
but I did call her on April 20, 2017 and we will do it again before she retires
in July.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sandy always gave me wonderful reviews each year and
she nominated me to receive the secretary of the year award again, this time as
her secretary of Staff Development in 1998.   The superintendent presented
these awards at the school board meeting.  He said some nice things about me
and then presented me with a plaque which read: “Davis County Schools Board
Honors to Mae Browning, Staff Development Secretary for dedicated and
outstanding service for children in Davis County Schools.  Presented October 6,
1998.  It was signed by Dr. Darrell K. White, Superintendent of Schools and Barbara

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>June 10, 1996</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          At this time, I
would like to summarize the past proceedings of the last six weeks. On April 13<sup>th</sup>,
Ken and I drove down to Chandler, Arizona to be with Shellie, Roy and their
family since Shellie had her baby on the 12<sup>th</sup>.  We enjoyed the trip
down and back and really enjoyed being with the family and taking care of
little “Kevis” and Shellie.  While we were there, we went with Roy &amp;
Garrett to two of Garrett’s “T” ball games.  It was fun watching him play
ball.  It doesn’t seem that long ago that we were watching our own sons play
ball.  We came home and were busy with sending out wedding invitations for
Scott &amp; Mishelle’s wedding which was on June 1<sup>st</sup>.  Sandi, Shauna
and I gave Mishelle a bridal shower, for the family, on the 16<sup>th</sup> at
our home.  It turned out really nice and she was excited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          Tuesday night, the
21<sup>st</sup>, Ken and I went out to Tooele to watch Chelci play softball. 
She plays 1<sup>st</sup> base and is really good.  I had called JaNae to see if
she could come to the game also so we could see her.  She did, but so did her
dad, which made it a little uncomfortable since Terry met Sandi there.  Dave
stayed out by the edge of the field, but we felt we should go speak to him
since he had been our son-in-law for 16 years and since JaNae was living with
him and we wanted to keep relations good because of her.  Ken went over and
talked with him.  I think I would have enjoyed it more, had Dave not come this
time.  Sandi said he had only been to one other game, and she was sure he came
this time just because we were coming.  It was Chelci’s birthday the next day
so we took her birthday present out to her this night.  We got her a journal
and some black Levi’s.  She opened it and was excited, especially with the
journal as she had wanted one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          <b>Jeff graduated
from seminary on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.</b>  It was held at the Stake Regional
Center in Bountiful.  We took Ken’s mom and my mom with us.  It was really nice
and we were very proud of Jeff.  He also sang in the seminary choir which sang
during the program.  Trent, Jeff’s best friend, is the president of the
seminary council and Jeff was over scripture mastery on the council.  Trent
spoke and gave an outstanding talk.  We were very impressed, but Trent is an
outstanding young man as also Jeff is.  We went to get ice cream after.  Jeff had
ridden his motorcycle.  He had to be there early and even though there was
another vehicle for him to take, he decided to ride the motorcycle.  As we were
coming home, it started to rain, it rained really hard and so I was really
worried about Jeff.  Upon arriving home, after taking our mother’s home, Jeff’s
motorcycle was there and I was really relieved.  Upon entering the house, Jeff
came out of the bathroom after having taken a hot shower.  He said it wasn’t a
good experience, to say the least, but he thought, while he was driving through
the pouring rain and he was getting soaked and freezing and the roads were
terrible to drive on – that he was thankful for a good helmet so he could see
and keep his head warm, for leather gloves to keep his hands warmer, for a
leather jacket to keep him warmer than he would have been, and for a motorcycle
and not a horse or covered wagon like the pioneers had.  He was also grateful
for a warm home to come to and a hot shower to be in and dry clothes to put
on.  *I thought – Wow! What a special son we have, to not complain, but to
realize his blessings and thank the Lord for them.  I’m not so sure I would
have thought those things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          I had Stake Relief
Society Leadership Meeting on May 23<sup>rd</sup> and I had been so busy with everything
else, I hadn’t had as much time as I would have liked to prepare, but it as a
little different, thank goodness.  We held it at Marge’s home, had a luncheon
and at my table (Homemaking counselors), we just shared homemaking meeting
ideas, board meeting ideas, etc.  I had sent them a letter asking that they
come prepared to share these ideas.  I put together some ideas and other
materials to give to them.  (I did a lot of this at work during my lunch hours
since I didn’t have tie at home.)  It went really well, and all but two of the
wards were represented.  One had to leave town to take care of a new grandchild
and the other was ill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          On the 24<sup>th</sup>,
we went to the high school to watch Jeff perform in the Extravanza which the
LaTones, Lerics &amp; Lace present at the end of the year.  Jeff is in the
Lerics.  It was wonderful and I especially liked watching Jeff as he is dramic
an a very good dancer as well as singer.  Not that I’m prejudiced, of course.  They
dance as they sing on many of the numbers.  We took the grandmothers and Aunt
Vida.  Scott &amp; Mishelle went also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          We went on the 29<sup>th</sup>
with Scott &amp; Mishelle and her family to the Bountiful Temple for Mishelle
to take out her endowments.  It was wonderful to be there.  We saw some old
friends, Wayne &amp; Carol Hickenlooper there.  They have a son who was getting
his endowments prior to going on a mission.</span></p>

align=left hspace=12><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          <b>Jeff’s
graduation from Layton High School</b> was the following night, May 30<sup>th</sup>
at the high school.  It was in the gym and we had to sit on the bleachers so we
didn’t take the grandmothers.  We could only have 3 or 4 tickets anyway.  Scott
wanted to go, but Mishelle needed his help with things she had to do for the
wedding.  It was a wonderful graduation, but we were tired and our backs
hurting by the time the last of the seniors received their diplomas.  We went
with Jeff to the Country Club where we ate a delicious dinner.  Trent’s parents
paid for our tickets since when they asked Trent what he wanted for graduation,
he said to have his two bet friends with him – Jeff and Anna and their parents
to sit at the same table with him and his parents at the graduation dinner.  We
had a good time.  Jeff, Trent, and Anna and most of the seniors went to the
Senior Bash afterwards where they spent the entire night at the high school
having wonderful activities.  They had a great tie.  Lori, Trent’s mom, was in
charge of the dinner and the senior bash.  (Picture with Jeff and his best
friends – Trent &amp; Anna.  Trent &amp; Anna got married soon after Trent
returned home from his mission.  It is 2017 and they still get together – Jeff
&amp; Gail and Trent &amp; Anna.  They get together sometimes with their
families and sometimes just the four of them.  It’s great to have such good
friends.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          On the 31<sup>st</sup>,
we had a family dinner since Shellie and her family had come in late Thursday
night and Mike and his family had come up on Wednesday (they were staying with
her family in Provo.)  It was to celebrate Jeff’s graduation and Scott’s
wedding and since we could all be together.  We cooked a turkey and had the
trimmings.  We visited and played games afterwards. Sandi and her girls came
also.  Candace, our neighbor, went on a trip so let us use her home again, so
Sandi and the girls slept there plus Scott &amp; Jeff.  Mike &amp; Becky slept
in Jeff’s room with David &amp; Taylor on the hide-a-bed in the family room. 
Shellie, Roy &amp; baby slept in Scott’s room with Garrett &amp; Quint in a
make-shift bed on the floor in the computer room.  It was great being together
again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          Saturday morning,
June 1<sup>st</sup>, we were up early getting ready to go to the temple.  Scott
went to pick up Mishelle and they went together.  Ken &amp; I drove alone
because we had to be there early with Scott.  We hired Mindy Craven to tend
Garrett &amp; Quint, David &amp; Taylor while Shellie &amp; Roy and Mike &amp;
Becky went to the temple.  Sandi offered to go early with Shellie &amp; Roy to
tend the baby in the lobby of the temple while Shellie &amp; Roy were at the
wedding.  I was so thrilled that Sandi offered to do this.  It has been so hard
for Sandi when her sister and brothers got married in the temple, because of
her life, that she didn’t even go to Shellie’s wedding breakfast, let alone the
temple grounds for pictures, and didn’t go to the temple for pictures at either
Mike or David’s wedding.  This is a big step for Sandi and all of us were
excited that she would be there.  Jeff took JaNae and Chelci with him to be
there for pictures.  He later told me that it was very hard for him to be
there.  He felt all alone.  The last of his brothers &amp; sisters had been married
and now he was alone in the family. JaNae &amp; Chelci were there, but he still
felt alone and had a hard time.  He left right after the family pictures and
went driving around.  I guess it’s pretty hard for the last child.  I never
felt that as I was the first child to leave home to get married, in my family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          <b>Anyway, Scott
&amp; Mishelle’s marriage was wonderful.</b>  </span><img width=199 height=1

align=left hspace=12><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The sealer was a wonderful
man and gave special advice to them.  Scott &amp; Mishelle looked so happy and
it brought tears to my eyes to think of the past year – how hard it has been
with her having cancer and going through chemotherapy together.  Scott was with
her each time, since he worked 4 ten hour days and had Fridays off.  I’ve had
many, many people tell me what a special young man he is to take on such a
responsibility – to stand by her even though they weren’t engaged when she
found out she had cancer.  But he loved her and wanted her for his eternal
companion. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          It was a beautiful
day and the pictures turned out great.  We went to the wedding breakfast at the
Red Flame in Bountiful.  The food was wonderful and we had a grand tie.  It
cost over $600.00, but it was worth it.  It cost $8.50 per person and that
included the tax and tip.  We had chicken breasts, baked potatoes, drink,
desert and salad bar. Everyone enjoyed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          We had family
pictures taken at Olan Mills studio in Layton, since David couldn’t be to the
reception that night where pictures would be taken.  He was receiving an award
at Weber University and, of course, needed to be there.  Ken and I went to look
at the proofs two weeks later and they were wonderful.  We are so thankful for
our beautiful and wonderful family.  We have such good children and they chose
wonderful companions, and our grandchildren are the best.  We are so fortunate,
and I am so happy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          We all love
Mishelle and are thankful for her and how she went through so much pain,
sickness, anxiety, etc.  She tried to be positive and have faith that she would
get well – and she has.  We grew to love Mishelle more and more as her and
Scott dated and then after he left on is mission, we invited her over each
Sunday for dinner ad to spend the evening.  We would play games or watch church
videos or just visit.  Most of the time we invited Ken’s mom or my mom, or both
plus David &amp; Shauna or any family members so we enjoyed the evenings.  Jeff
enjoyed having Mishelle there too and the two of them would play the piano
together some evenings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          The next day,
Sunday, Shellie, Roy &amp; family headed back home to Arizona.  They left about
the time we were going to church for Sacrament Meeting.  It was hard to see
them leave, sure wish they lived closer.  We miss out on so much of their
children’s lives.  I hope someday we can live close by each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          After meeting, Ken
&amp; I left for Montana with Mike.  We took our good car as it is cheaper to
drive than Mike’s truck.  We went with him to help him finish packing up the
house and clean it as they are moving down, and we are excited about that. 
Becky and the two children stayed in Provo with her parents.  It was wonderful
trip.  The scenery was so beautiful.  I had never been up that way and I loved
it.  I had taken books &amp; Ensigns to read (which I usually do o trips – I
read out loud to Ken), but it was so beautiful and nice to just visit with Mike
and Ken and enjoy the scenery.  We arrived in Inverness that evening and went
to bed.  The next day we started packing when the guy came with his moving
truck to move Mike.  We hadn’t expected him until the following day.  He said
he got through early from his last moving job and decided to come and see if we
were ready.  We hurried to finish packing which he and his son packed the
truck.  I then started cleaning.  It wasn’t bad as Becky is a good
housekeeper.  After we were finished and the truck had left, Mike showed us
around Inverness and we saw the High School and Elementary School where he
taught at and coached.  It’s a cute little town.  We met his good neighbor and
others in the neighborhood.  We had a good time.  Because we didn’t have a bed
to sleep in that night, we decided to go part way and sleep in a motel.  We
did, but none of us slept much.  Ken and I didn’t sleep because the bed was so
hard and Mike didn’t sleep because when Ken did sleep, he snored too loud.  We
started out tired the next morning, but still had a good trip.  The scenery was
beautiful and it was relaxing for me to just enjoy the scenery and again visit
with Mike &amp; Ken.  We took Mike to his home in Provo.  His father-in-law
helped Mike &amp; Becky get into it.  It is an older home, but very nice and
has a nice yard with lots of shrubbery and trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          This summer has
gone by really fast.  With going to Arizona in April to help out when Kevis was
born, Scott’s wedding and helping Mike move down from Montana, we didn’t feel
we had the time or money to go on other vacations, but we did get together up
to Camperworld a couple of times.  Once with the family at Coleville and once,
just Ken &amp; I at Woodland up by Heber.  (Scott &amp; Mishelle came up on
Friday afternoon and stayed the night with us.)  We took Irven’s 4 wheeler and
had a great time in the mountains with it.  Ken &amp; I just relaxed and had a
great week.  Ken went fishing part of the time while I worked on scrapbooks. 
It was so quiet nd beautiful up there.  We also have the children and their
families to our home for Sunday dinners quite regularly.  Scott &amp; Mishelle
and David &amp; Shauna come almost every other week as they live close by, ad
Sandi ad her girls and Mike, Becky and their family come as often as they ca. 
We really enjoy having our family with us.  They are great kids, have married
great spouses and have wonderful children.  We just wish Shellie, Roy &amp;
family lived close by so they could be with us also.  They were here in June
for Scott &amp; Mishelle’s wedding, but we only get to see them two or three
times a year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          David graduated
from Weber University and he graduated with honors.  We are proud of him.  He
worked hard for it and got straight A’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          Ken’s younger
brother, Irven, wife, Sandy, and their family moved to Arizona from
Washington.  A friend introduced him to a dream that was going to make them
rich, but it worked out for them like it did for us when we went down there the
last time.  It didn’t work out, and they had a rough time financially, like we
did.  Since Mom Jensen let us live with her for a while, we decided we should
return the favor to Irven &amp; his family – <b>so Irven, Sandy and their
family moved in with us the first of August</b>.  It has worked out really well
for the most part.  Since Scott had moved out, we had an extra bedroom so Irven
&amp; Sandy took that, and we moved our computer into our bedroom, turning the
computer and exercise room into a bedroom for Mark.  Actually, Christine &amp;
Jennifer stayed in that room until they left for college in September.  We are
adding an extra bathroom in the basement so we have the extra needed shower.  I
think it would be really hard to do this with most couples, but we really enjoy
Irven &amp; Sandy.  Sandy and I have always gotten along really well.  We
giggle like young girls.  Her &amp; I share the housecleaning and we take turns
every other week buying the groceries and fixing the meals.  That is wonderful
to be able to do that, and whoever is cooking, their husband &amp; family help
with the dishes and cleanup.  This leaves the other family time to do other
things the week they aren’t cooking – which is great!  Mark is a sweet kid and
he was no problem.  Jeff must have been on his mission at this time.  Well,
fast forward, and it did get harder.  The one thing for me was that with them
here, our children and families didn’t feel like there was room for them to
come visit, come for Sunday dinners, etc.  Christmas was good, but harder. 
Some of our children did come and so did their children, except Doug, who was
married and living in Arizona.   We were crowded together in our family room to
open gifts.  It was a different Christmas, but their children are great, so it
was okay.   After they had been there for nine months, Irven talked to Ken and
said “This is working out great, so we should make it permanent. With sharing
expenses, it is easier financially on all of us.”  Irven had been getting on
Ken’s nerves and this didn’t set well with him, he was ready to have them go,
so he said “Irven, if I wanted to live with you, I would have married you.” 
That is a crazy thing to say, but Irven got the message and he and Sandy
started looking for another home.  There were some difficult feelings at first,
but when they found a home in Clearfield and moved in, they were fine and it
was better for all of us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          For October
conference, our family got together.  We had been together the previous Sunday
for dinner and decided we needed to go up the canyon once more together before
the bad weather set in, so we met at our home on Saturday, the 5<sup>th</sup>, at
noon and went up Farmington Canyon.  We had taken fried chicken, salads,
Sandi’s good rolls and desert.  We ate, went for walks (I enjoyed going around
with little David.  He would say “come on Grandma, let’s go take this
shortcut.”) We listed to the afternoon session of conference on the radio in
Mike’s truck.  Ken took a nap in Mike’s truck also.  It was a nice day.  Mike,
Becky &amp; family, Sandi and Chelci stayed over and slept in the tent
trailer.  Sunday morning, Ken fixed biscuits and gravy for breakfast and David
&amp; Shauna and Scott &amp; Mishelle came over.  After breakfast, some of them
had to leave and the rest of us watched conference.  We invited Mom Jensen and
Aunt Vida over for supper and to watch the afternoon session of conference. 
Conference was sure wonderful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 42</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> – <b>UPDATE ON CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES 1996:
Christmas letter</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As this year has swiftly passed by, it has
brought some good experiences and some not so good.   This life is full of ups
and downs, but it is for our experience and we are to learn from the hard times
and enjoy the good.  Over the years, I’ve come to realize that our attitude
plays a big part on our happiness.  Some people have very little and major
health or other problems and yet they are happy and make others happy.  And
there are others who are miserable, and it seems they have everything that
should make them happy.  Our wish, for this coming year for you, is that you
will have health and happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Scott</b> came home from his mission to
Venezuela in May.  We were excited to have him return and so was his
girlfriend, Mishelle Dillingham, who is now his fiancé.  They received some sad
news soon after his return.  She had been coughing for several months, the
doctor finally took an x-ray and found cancer.  She is undergoing chemotherapy
treatments at the present.  They hope to be able to marry soon after the
treatments are over.  She is in our prayers constantly, and hope you will pray
for her also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            .<b> Sandi</b> is our oldest.  She has two
daughters, JaNae, age 16 who has been a cheerleader both her sophomore and now
her junior years at Grantsville High, and Chelci, Age 12.  Chelci goes to the
Middle School in Grantsville.  She excels in softball and has a pretty voice so
enjoys singing.  Sandi is the head cook at Harris Elementary.  She taught
clogging dance lessons for a few years, mainly for the benefit of her girls. 
She enjoys oil pointing in her spare time and is secretary of the Young Women. 
<b>Sandi</b> <b>divorced her husband, Dave, a few months</b> ago.  She hasn’t
been happy in her marriage.  We hope the future will be brighter for her.  They
have joint custody of their daughters, JaNae and Chelci, but JaNae lives with
her dad and Chelci with her mom.  We pray for them also as divorce is never
easy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Old Folk’s Sociable </b>– each
March in Grantsville.  Sandi &amp; girls usually performed in the programs –
dancing (clogging) &amp; Chelci singing<b>.  </b>They have great programs,
dinners, dances &amp; great decorations throughout the high school.  Sandi
usually had her art work displayed.  They also had car shows.  We love to go to
these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Shellie</b> and Roy live in
Chandler, Arizona.  They have three sons - Garrett, age 7, Quint, age 4 and
Kevis age 5 months.  Roy did an apprenticeship, training as an Integrated
Circuit Mask Designer.  He works at Motorola designing computer chips.  We wish
they lived closer, but he likes his work, makes good money, and there is not a
Motorola plant to transfer to here in Utah, so guess we’ll spend our winter
vacations in sunny Arizona.  Roy is in the Sunday School Presidency and Shellie
has served mainly in the Young Women’s organization, but is now in Relief
Society.  Shellie, like Sandi, is also gifted in art, and is taking oil
painting lessons.  Roy enjoys water skiing and camping, in fact, their entire
family does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple of weeks ago, I flew down to Arizona to visit
Shellie and her family.  <b>With changing jobs this summer, (in case you have
not heard, I left Lincoln Elementary to be the secretary for Staff Development
at the district office.</b>)  Anyway, with learning a new job, I didn’t take my
vacation at that time so I took part of my vacation enjoying Shellie’s two
little boys, and of course, Shellie &amp; Roy.  With them living in Arizona, we
don’t get to see them as often as we’d like.  I had a wonderful time; the only
thing that could have made it better was if Ken could have been there.  He
spent his vacation building an apartment for his mother in his brother, Bob’s
basement.  With overworking on this apartment and long hours at his job, he is
having health problems again – so back on his strict diet.  Not fun at this
time of year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Mike, Becky and their two little ones, David
&amp; Taylor are doing great in Inverness, Montana</b>.  Mike is teaching
special education and doing some coaching so they were able to spend last
summer in Utah.  We enjoyed being with them for most of the weekends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>David &amp; Shauna are living in Clearfield</b>. 
We are thankful they live close to us.  David will graduate with his four year
degree this summer, but with him being in the medical field, he still has lots
of schooling ahead.  Shauna just changed jobs recently.  She is a nurse and
changed from Davis South Hospital in Bountiful to McKay Dee in Ogden.  David
still works at the FHP lab part-time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Jeff, our youngest, is a senior
at Layton High</b>.  He is enjoying his high school years and is really
involved in music and drama and on the seminary council, so we don’t see much
of him especially at this season of the year, but we are glad he is developing
his talents and sharing with others.  Ken &amp; I enjoy going to the plays, Lyrics
performances, etc.  Jeff has lots of friends and they double date or come to
our home and have Video parties in our family room.  They are all great kids so
we welcome them here.  For their Junior Prom one of the friend’s father had a
moving van and he let them put couches and chairs in the back and he drove them
to where they ate before the dance, and to the dance and then came and got them
to take them home.  They had a blast and that was sure different
transportation.  Another of Jeff’s good friends is “<b>Ben</b>”.  For some
reason, Ben and his dad had problems and Jeff asked if Ben could come live with
us for a while.  Ben was great and we enjoyed having him in our home.  He and
Jeff had a great time together.  Now in 2012, Ben is married, has a family and
is living back East.   Jeff was able to go visit them when he was on a business
trip.  Two of the girls Jeff hung out with were Jenny and Meresha.  They were
cute girls too and I think both had a crush on Jeff.  They were always here for
video parties and games.  I remember one time when Jeff &amp; Ben and Jenny
&amp; Meresha were going to a costume party.  Jeff was dressed like the 1920s. 
He even had shiny black &amp; white pat-n-leather shoes, silver gray tux and
great hat.  He looked great!  Jeff would come home from a date, Lyrics
performance or a play, etc., and he and I would stay up late talking.  We
enjoyed those late night visits.  There are Daddy-Daughter dates, but I had a
Mother-Son date.  I think it was for my birthday that Jeff took me to
Abrovenell Hall to a symphony.  This was the first time I had been to
Abrovenell Hall and I think the first time to a symphony.  I really enjoyed the
symphony and really enjoyed being with Jeff. He is a great son and we enjoy him
very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken &amp; I are thankful for each
of our wonderful children and feel we have been greatly blessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>UPDATE FOR KENNETH BROWNING FAMILY 1994 (For Bushnell Reunion)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken is working as the Maintenance Director of
the 5 points Mall in Bountiful.  He keeps really busy but enjoys it.  He also
does remodeling and sells part-time for Beneficial Insurance Company.  He is a
High Counselor in our Holmes Creek Stake.  When Ken has any free time, he
enjoys being with his family.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mae is the secretary at Lincoln
Elementary in Layton where she keeps busy with a faculty and staff of over 70
and almost 1,000 students.  Thank goodness for 3 great assistants; it’s a good
place to work.  She’d rather be home enjoying her family and grandkids, but the
money helps support their missionary sons.  She was just released as the Relief
Society President and is now a counselor in the Stake Relief Society.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and Mae have 6 wonderful
children – Sandi, Shellie, Mike, David, Scott, and Jeff.  The four oldest are
married.  Sandi and Dave have 2 girls – JaNae and Chelci.  Shellie and Roy have
2 boys, Garrett and Quint.  Mike and Becky have a son, David, and a daughter to
be born the latter part of August.  David and Shauna were just married in the Manti
 Temple on June 24<sup>th</sup>.  Scott is on a mission to Venezuela and enjoys it although he says it’s a never ending summer.  He has a darling
girlfriend, Mishelle, waiting for him.  Jeff, our youngest, is 16 – dating,
driving, working part-time, plays the piano, and gets involved in
extra-curricular activities at Layton High.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Hopefully the 3 oldest children
will fill this sheet out telling about them and their families. Since David
just got married, I’ll tell a little about him and Shauna.  She just graduated
as an R.N. in nursing and is now working full time in Bountiful.  David met her
at Weber State about two years ago soon after he returned from his mission to Brussels,
 Belgium &amp; France.  David is going into medicine and is planning to be a
Physician’s Assistant.  He still has several years ahead of him.  He has been
at the top of his class so his scholarships help.  He works at the FHP clinic
in Ogden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Shellie &amp; Roy - Dear Bushnell
Family:  We’ve been planning on and looking forward to this reunion for the
last several years but as things turn out, we won’t be able to make it.  We’re
really disappointed to be missing reuniting with you and all the fun.  Anyway,
we’ll give you an update on our life.  We’re still living in Arizona and
although its getting hot, we’re really enjoying it.  After years of renting,
we’ve finally bought a new home in South Chandler where for a little while
anyway we still have fields around us and can smell the cows at night.  We love
our home, neighbors and ward.  Two years ago Roy quit the construction field
forever and now does I.C. Design layout (designs computer chips).  He’s been
working for Clark I.C. Design and contracting to Motorola which is exciting to
us because of their great benefits package.  June
 26<sup>th</sup> 1994 Motorola is sending us to Geneva, Switzerland
for 3-4 months.  We’re ecstatic!  We’ve rented movies about Europe from the
library and even Garrett (4) is really excited.  Our one real concern is Quint
who’s one and can be quite a handful.  Roy’s parents are thinking about going
over with us for a month or so to help out.  I’m sure we’ll love it.  Hope your
families are doing great.  Miss ya, The Seymores – Roy, Shellie, Garrett, and
Quint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mike and Becky Browning – Mike and
I are expecting our second child August 22 (99% sure it’s a girl).  Mike will
be graduating from BYU with a degree in Psychology and Special Education on
August 12<sup>th</sup>.  We have found a job in Joplin, Montana and will be
moving up there the 22<sup>nd</sup> of August.  Mike for sure, me if the baby
is born early.  We are really excited to move and get away from the stress of
school and enter the stess of reality.  We are also excited because I have been
working full time for the past year and now I will be able to be home to raise
our children.  Mike is doing his student teaching right now and enjoys being able
to teach!  That’s about it for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>BUSHNELL REUNION UPDATE FOR KENNETH BROWNING FAMILY 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken was working at the Five Point Mall in Bountiful as the Maintenance director up until several months ago when he decided to go
back into building &amp; remodeling homes.  He is working with my cousin's
husband, Dwaine Mattison, at least for the next two years.  Ken enjoys building
and is very good at it. He has taken classes at the Davis Vocational School in
Kaysville and is now starting to draw house plans on the computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had worked as the head secretary at Lincoln
Elementary in Layton for five years and had the opportunity to go to work at
the school district as the secretary for the Staff Development Department.  My
former school principal at Lincoln and a good friend, Sandy Petersen, is one of
my bosses at the Davis School District.  I also enjoy working for the Director,
Claudia Seeley.  I enjoy my work, but I do miss the children at Lincoln.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken is a High Counselor in our stake and I am
the Homemaking Counselor in the Stake Relief Society, so between work, church
&amp; family we keep busy - sometimes a little too busy, but we enjoy our life
and have been really blessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            (Sandi will write her own update and send in
with their information.  Hers will probably already be in before mine reaches
you.  I will write Shellie, Mike, David, &amp; Scott's update so in case they
don't get theirs in.) <u>This was an update for the Bushnell Reunion – find
that and type Sandi’s info in here.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Shellie,</b> <b>Roy</b><b> and their three
sons</b> live in Chandler, Arizona.  They like it there, but wish some of the
family would move down.  Roy works at Motorola designing computer chips.  He is
the YMMIA Secretary.  Shellie is the YWMIA President in their ward - between
that and all the other responsibilities of a wife and mother, she keeps really
busy.  Shellie &amp; Roy have been asked to be Pa &amp; Ma on the Pioneer Trek
for their stake this summer.  That will be a neat experience.  Garrett is 7 and
doing really well in school, Quint is 4 and their youngest, Kevis, will be a
year on the 12th of April.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Mike, Becky &amp; their family</b> moved back
to Utah, from Montana where Mike had been teaching Special Education for two
years after graduating from BYU.  A previous boss, where he had worked
part-time while going to BYU, called and asked if he would come and teach at
their school, an Alternate High School in Provo.  He only taught for a couple
of months when Greg asked Mike if he would be the director of a new truancy
program they were initiating at the school.  Mike has had several good
experiences resulting from that position.  He has presented this program before
city and community leaders, has been interviewed by newspapers, and recently he
presented in St.George before all the school superintendents in Utah. 
Mike is in the Elder's Quorum Presidency in their ward. Becky teaches the 15
&amp; 16 year olds in Sunday School.  Besides being a wonderful wife &amp;
mother, she also works part-time.  Mike takes care of the children when he gets
home from work while Becky works for a few hours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            David is 5 and Taylor is two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our son, <b>David, and his wife, Shauna,</b>
live in Clearfield.  David graduated from Weber University - Summa Cum Laude,
last June with a Medical Laboratory Technologist's degree.  He has just been
accepted at both a college in Connecticut and also Pocatello, Idaho to attend
graduate school to be a Physician's Assistant.  At present they are trying to
decide which one to accept.  The cost of living is much higher in Connecticut he would also receive a Masters degree where in Idaho it would just be another
Bachelor's degree.  We hope it will be Idaho as Connecticut is far away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Shauna is a nurse (RN) at McKay Dee
 Hospital in Ogden.  Shauna is the YWMIA secretary and David is YMMIA
secretary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Michelle Dillingham waited for our son, Scott</b>,
while he was on his mission to Venezuela.  When he returned Michele found out
that she had Cancer and had to undergo Chemotherapy for 8 months.  She &amp;
Scott had faith that she would get better.  She had priesthood blessings and many
family &amp; ward members fasted and prayed for her and at the end of the Kemo,
the tests showed negative for which we were all so thankful.  They were married
in June of 1996.  Scott teaches in the Elder's Quorum and Michele is a
counselor in YWMIA - so her &amp; Shauna both serve in their ward presidency.  Scott
&amp; Michele also live in Clearfield.  In fact, they just live three houses
away from David &amp; Shauna.  Scott &amp; Michele are renting my Uncle Verle
&amp; Aunt Beth's home while they are on their 3rd mission.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our Youngest son, <b>Jeff,</b> just left for his
mission to Mexico City North in March.  His district was the first in over 10
months to go directly from the MTC to Mexico City, as previously they had to go
stateside for a few months until the visa's came in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken is on the High Council in
our Stake</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b> I am the Homemaking Counselor
in the Holmes Stake Relief Society Presidency.  </b>I have been in this
position for about two years.  Marge Beardall is the president.  She is a
widow.  Her husband died of leukemia while serving as a stake president in
California.  He left her well off and she had a good feeling about selling
their home and moving to Utah.  She has a beautiful hoe in the Summerhaze
Ward.  She has two married children and one son who attends college and doesn’t
live at home.<b>  </b>Claudia Thompson is the Education Counselor.  I knew
Claudia from when I was the secretary at Lincoln Elementary.  She is an
excellent teacher and a wonderful person and friend.  Jola Craven is the
secretary also my neighbor.  She just lives three houses down from me.  Her
husband, Brent, is our home teacher and also serves as a high counselman with
Ken.  He is a seminary teacher.  His father is a general authority.  They are a
special family and a good example to everyone in the ward and elsewhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I am the secretary at Staff
Development at Davis School District.  I was the secretary at Lincoln
Elementary from October 1990 to August 1995.  I enjoyed it there, but it was
very busy and stressful.  Lincoln is a year round school with over 1000
students.  Sandy Petersen was the Principal at Lincoln Elementary who hired
me.  I had been working for S.O.S. Temporary Services for three years previous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>DAVIS SCHOOL DISTRICT – STAFF DEVELOPMENT DEPT (**Put
picture here of the district office)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I talked to Sandy Petersen and she told me she loved it at
the <b>school</b> <b>district</b>, and that I should come there.  I told her I
would if I could be her secretary again.  She said “Yes, the secretary here at <b>Staff
Development</b> is leaving, come put in an application.  <b>Claudia Seeley</b>
was the Staff Development Director and Sandy was a liaison between the University of Utah and the district.  She was in the Staff Development Dept.  I applied and
was interviewed by 8 people.  I also had to take a computer and other test.  Claudia
called me to offer me the job.  Sandy was one of the people who interviewed me
and I wondered if she had been a big influence in that decision, but she told
me later that she wanted them to say what they thought first, as she didn’t
want to sway them, and they all choose me.  I still wonder.  When I was given
the offer to come work for Staff Development, I wondered if I was making the
right decision as I did love it there at Lincoln and I would miss the children,
teachers, my assistants and the parents.  I finally decided it was time for a
change and I would make more money and be with Sandy again.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It was a mess when I took over. 
The other secretary went upstairs in payroll and she wouldn’t come down and
train me.  She said it was too stressful.  Finally, I convinced her to come
down, but she was only there for a little over an hour – so not much help.  She
kept shaking and acting so nervous that it was hard getting anything out of
her.  She was fairly young, I think in her middle or late 20’s.  I heard from
the other secretaries that she didn’t do her work or help the teachers and
those who called her; she was too busy visiting with the other secretaries and
talking personally on the phone.  Claudia said she was ready to fire her as she
got many nasty calls regarding this secretary.  I worked hard again trying to
keep up with the phone calls, trying to learn my job and trying to catch up on
all that this girl hadn’t done, and keep up on all that needed to be done
now.   I thought to myself that I had left the “frying pan and got into the
fire”.  It seemed like I was working around the clock.  Finally, Ken had a good
idea of how to keep tract of everything and he worked on a filing system for
me.  It was wonderful when we got it organized and working.  Claudia told me
she was going to go out on the town and celebrate when I got things caught up
and she didn’t receive nasty phone calls from teachers and administrators, and
people from the state office anymore.  It was still too much for me and I talked
to Claudia about seeing if I could have a neighbor do my filing for me and make
my files and send out mailers.  She said “Yes, do what you need to do and we
will be happy to pay them.”  That helped, but it was still overwhelming so
Claudia asked the superintendent if we could hire a part-time assistant to help
me.  It was approved and we hired Patty Woodward.  She had been the
receptionist.  She was a cute, vivacious lady about 10 years younger than me. 
The problem with Patty is that she liked to visit with the other secretaries
too much too, and didn’t help as much as I thought she would.  Finally, when
the new building was completed and we moved over there, Patty applied for a
full time job with the planning dept and got that.  I wasn’t too broken up about
it.  We hired another girl and she was pretty good, but then went to the
transportation dept so she could work full time.  Finally, we had grown so much
and there was so much work that we got permission to hire a full time secretary
to help me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Claudia had retired just before we
moved into the new building.  Sandy applied and got the job.  I was delighted
about that.  <b>I loved Claudia, but I really loved Sandy</b>.  We interviewed
and hired a young woman, but that turned out to be a disaster.  She was really
good on the computer and loved to make new forms, etc., but she didn’t like
researching for the teacher’s credits and doing all the other work that she
needed to do.  She was also sick a lot – at least her husband called in sick
for her.  They didn’t have a phone and he would call from his work.  Sometimes
she would be gone a day, two days, a week or more.  And when she was gone, I
got lots of calls from unhappy teachers who didn’t get their lane changes
(raises) because this girl hadn’t followed through on checking on the classes
for the teachers or getting it recorded through the state, etc., etc.  One time
I was so upset because I had gotten so many calls and I had to do so much of
her work, that when Sandy came into the office, after her lunch hour, she saw
that I was upset and asked me about it.  When I told her, she was really upset
and said she would talk to her when she came in and give her a warning.  I told
her I didn’t want to burden her with this as she already had so much to worry
about, so I would handle it.  It was part of my job anyway as the head
secretary.  I did talk to her and thought she was doing better, until her
husband called again and said she was sick.  She was pregnant and so he called
in sick for her quite often.  I asked how long she would be out and he said he
didn’t know.  Well, again I started getting those nasty phone calls saying they
didn’t get their lane changes that this hadn’t been done and that hadn’t been
done, etc.  I was fit to be tied.  When Sandy came by my desk, she saw that I
was crying.  She was always very protective of me and asked if it was Joan
again.  I said “yes”.  She said “That’s it, she is out of here and we will
replace her immediately.  Well, I guess Joan knew we would be upset, so she
called in and said she was resigning, that with being pregnant she didn’t feel
well enough to work.  I don’t know how bad she felt, but I worked until just
before I had Sandy and many women have to do this.  Oh well, I was glad she
resigned, that made it easier.  Sandy and I were really careful when we
interviewed again for this position.  I prayed that we would find the right
person, and my prayers were answered.  We hired <b>Billie Ririe</b> and she was
an incredible receptionist/secretary.   She was so dependable; she always came
early and stayed late if she didn’t get all her work done.  She was so
efficient and kind and friendly to the teachers and those who came into our
office.  It was wonderful working with Billie.  She made my life so much
easier.  She is a shy and very reserved lady, but we became good friends. 
Since we have both retired, we still keep in touch by e-mail, phone and mail. 
I have gone to visit her couple of times too.  She is special.  I worked for
the district seven years so my total years were twelve.  Later, as the work and
department continued to grow, we were able to hire another part-time assistant,
<b>Linda Duffin</b>, who worked part time for Staff Development and part-time
for the Curriculum Dept.  Her office was in the Curriculum Dept.  Linda was
wonderful too and very dependable.  She was a friendly, happy person and I
loved her too.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had three other bosses besides Sandy. <b> Peggy</b> was
the Liaison between the district and Weber University and <b>Betty Spencer</b>
took Sandy’s position of Liaison between the district and the University
 of Utah when Sandy became director of Staff Development.  <b>Marilyn Junk</b>
had her office in Curriculum, but she worked part time for the Curriculum Dept
and part time for our dept.  These three ladies were great too.   We had just a
great department.  Everyone did their work well and enjoyed being with each
other.  Since I was the head secretary, I was Sandy’s secretary, but also
Peggy, Betty and Marilyn’s secretary too so I kept busy with doing things for
them and keeping up with my own responsibilities and helping the teachers at
the schools.  I also taught a few classes, in our large PEC room, to the school
secretaries.  I was also asked to give orientation presentations to the new
teachers after they were hired.  It was a two day orientation and was held at
the district office in the PEC.  Most of the departments were represented. 
Most of the departments had their directors tell about their departments, but
since I knew more about the state lane changes, and registering for classes,
etc., than Sandy, she asked me to do it.  Sandy also had me attend meetings for
her when she wasn’t able to attend.  I gained lots of experience working there,
and enjoyed serving the principals, teachers, and state employees, district
people and especially Sandy and the others in Staff Development.    Later,
Peggy left to go teach at the college in Cedar City and <b>Christy Blanch</b>
who had been the principal at Fair Field Jr. was hired.  She was very
intelligent and very good at what she did.  She developed a brain tumor and
passed away.  That was really sad.  <b>Jackie Thompson</b> took her place. 
Jackie is African American.  She was a former Mrs. Utah.  She is a special
lady.  She really cares about people and she is a happy, positive person.  She
and I became good friends too and we started walking together during our lunch
hour.  We had lots of good talks.  Now that I have retired, I still go over
once a month and we walk and have lunch together and catch up on what we have
been doing.  Jackie is the director of a new Equity Department now.  She called
and asked if I would be willing to come out of retirement and be her
secretary.  This was after we came home from our mission.  Ken didn’t want me
to and I didn’t want to either, even though I would have enjoyed working with
her and we could use the money, I wanted to be able to enjoy our grandchildren
and families more, do more family history and temple work and enjoy life, so I
declined.  She understood and hired Patty Woodward.  Patty had left the
Planning Dept and was hired in Staff Development to take Billie’s place after
she retired.  Elizabeth, the secretary at the Computer Dept, took my job.  I
knew Elizabeth and knew she wanted to come to Staff Development, and I knew she
would be so good, so I was happy when she got the job.  She wasn’t hard to
train.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>I was able to retire in January 2003, just prior to Ken
and I going on our mission to the Philippines.</b>  Sandy and my assistants
planned a retirement open house for me.  They went all out and it was really
nice.  They sent invitations out to all the schools and district offices and to
our family.  Most of our children and grandchildren were there and many of my
friends from the schools and district office.  Sandy and my assistants gave me
a beautiful corsage to wear.  The school catering dept catered the food and it
was really nice.  Nancy Fleming the assistant superintendent over Staff
Development made a speech and presented me with a beautiful gold bell.  Sandy
made a speech and gave me gifts.  They had me say a few words.  I received many
cards and gifts.  I was afraid that not many would attend and I had kind of
wanted to not have an open house, but just slip quietly away – maybe do a lunch
with the ladies in our dept., but that didn’t happen, however, my former boss,
Claudia Seeley, gave me a going away party at her home in Salt Lake and invited
our Staff Development Dept - Sandy, Marilyn, Betty, Jackie, Billie, Linda and
myself.  Claudia had a nice lunch for us and they all went in on a gift for
me.  It was a Christmas Angel.  We had a great time.  My other secretary
friends also took me out to lunch one day before I left.  (This isn’t a good
picture, the original is in my occupational scrape book).</p>

align=left hspace=12>After quitting working at the Bountiful Mall, Ken worked
for Dwaine Mattison, my cousin Eve’s husband.  Dwaine hired Ken to work with
him to build homes.  It didn’t work well for Ken, as it was always a “Dwaine
Deal”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ken bought a used ambulance and converted it to his work
van</b>.  When he first brought it home, the neighbors called thinking the
ambulance was there for one of our family.  Ken took off the flashing lights,
etc<b>.  We took a fun vacation in it, to Shellie &amp; Roy’s home in Arizona.</b> 
We took Jeff and his girlfriend, Nicki, and Sandi and her girls with us.  While
on this trip, <b>Scott called to tell Jeff that his mission call had come.</b> 
This was great as many of us were together and Jeff didn’t want to wait until
we got home to open it, so he had Scott open it and read it to us.  It stated
that he would be going to <b>the Mexico City Mission</b>.  I think he was a
little disappointed at that because he had a prejudice toward Mexicans.  It
turned out to not be the greatest mission for him.  Not sure why he was called
there unless the Lord wanted him to love everyone, including the Mexican
people.  He did love some of the people, but he had native companions and he
was the zone leader and his companion and other missionaries were Mexican and
didn’t obey mission rules.  He told the mission president, but he was native also
and just told Jeff that he couldn’t send them home as it would not only ruin
their lives, but their families as well.  We were sad when Jeff told us this
after he had returned home, as the mission president should have done something
about this problem.  It was a hard mission for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dwaine wanted to buy the ambulance/work van from Ken, and
Ken did end up selling it to him.  .  </p>

align=left hspace=12>Mom loved her family and she and dad were extra good to
Jean and Cindi, after Hal’s death and Mom always invited them to all our family
parties or activities.  I was glad she did.  After Cindi had Samantha, her life
was happier.  Cindi had gotten on drugs as a teen ager and got pregnant from
another drug addict.  Cindi &amp; Jean loved Samantha, and this gave Cindi a
purpose to life now.  But, the drugs got in the way and she had to go in rehab
several times.  They put Samantha with foster parents.  Brian Dugan and his
wife (can’t remember her name) took her in as their foster daughter.  They
didn’t have other children and they loved Samantha.  They told the case worker
that if in some future time, Cindi wouldn’t be able to raise Samantha, that
they wanted to adopt her.  They were really good to her.  Cindi tried hard and
went for three years without using drugs.  She even had a great boyfriend,
John, who was the owner of a great company, who wanted to marry her if she
could give up her drugs.  She was on the hard stuff by now and try as she may,
she finally took it again and lost Samantha.  This was devastating for her. 
The Dugans let her visit Samantha, but she couldn’t take her out of their
house.  (This picture of Samantha “Sam” was taken shortly before Cindi’s
death.  I have written about Cindi’s death later on.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mom’s sister, Elaine (she was Aunt “Joy” to us) lived in
Fillmore when her and Uncle John were raising their family.  After Uncle John
died of a heart attack, she remarried Jack Harper and they moved to St.
George.  Mom &amp; Dad used to go stay with them for a couple weeks at a time
and Mom and Aunt Joy would have a ball together.  They would stay up late at
night crocheting, visiting and laughing.  After Dad died, Mom would still go
down and she would sometimes stay a month or two at a time because both Aunt
Joy and Jack loved to have her come.  Mom was so much fun to be around.  Jack
would call her “Mims” and he would say to Aunt Joy “When is Mims coming again,
I miss her.”  When Aunt Marilyn died of cancer, Uncle June (George Jr. was his
name, but he was Uncle June to us nieces &amp; Nephews) and his new wife,
Banida moved to Star Valley, Wyoming.  He loved it there and wanted Mom to come
visit him as he and Mom had been close too, especially after Dad and Aunt
Marilyn passed away.  They would call each other about every night and talk. 
Mom did go up and stayed for a week or two, and they loved her too.  They would
play games, which Mom loved to do, and laugh and visit.  Uncle June didn’t want
her to leave and made her promise she would come again soon.  She had been
there several times and when she passed away, both Uncle June and Banida and
Aunt Joy and Jack were so sad as Mom was scheduled to go to both of their homes
soon and they were looking forward to it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to record my feelings about the last few
weeks.  <b>Today is Sunday Aug. 31, 1997.</b>  August has been a busy month, as
most of the months are.  Our immediate family planned a vacation prior to our
large Bushnell Reunion at the college lodge in Cedar City Canyon.  We reserved
campsites at Ta-Hi campgrounds near <b>Navajo Lake.  Navajo Lake is close to
Cedar Canyon.  </b>Prior to going to the Bushnell Reunion at the Lodge in Cedar
Canyon, we went to Navajo Lake with our family and had a great time, fishing,
boating, sharing food and eating together, playing games, etc.  We always love
to be with our children.  One thing I remember about that trip was that one day
when I was fishing, the reel wasn’t working right (or I wasn’t doing it
correctly), anyway I caught a fish, but I was reeling out instead of in and
someone noticed it.  It was a wonder the fish didn’t get off the hook, but I
was able to bring it in.  We then all went to the reunion and had a great time
there as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oct 10, 1997</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had yesterday &amp; today off work.  It is UEA for the
teachers, but the district people had to work.  My boss, Sandy Petersen told me
to take them off since I have a lot of comp time and have been working through
my lunch hours and come early &amp; stayed late since Patty went to work for
another dept. and I haven't had much help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I called Aunt Joy today to get her great
granddaughter's address for our granddaughter, Chelci.  They met at the reunion
and she wants to write to her.  While I was talking to Aunt Joy, she expressed
her concern for Mom, and mentioned that Mom had told her that she doesn't think
her children realize how sick she is.  She told Aunt Joy that she went down the
steps &amp; outside to get her mail and could hardly make it back up the steps
as she was so out of breath.  I told Aunt Joy that we are worried too, but
don't know what to do as she won't come live with any of us.  Georgia &amp;
Rick had their basement fixed into an apartment mainly thinking that Mom &amp;
Dad - now Mom would come &amp; live there so they could look out for her and
take care of her, but she won't leave all her &quot;stuff&quot; or get rid of
any of it so she can.  Plus she doesn't want to leave her home.  We were
worried and so I talked with Bryce, Kim &amp; Georgia and we decided we needed
to clean out her basement and have someone live there to look out for her. We
decided to do it on Labor Day since we all had that holiday off.  I was
somewhat apprehensive about doing this because several year ago, dad had
suggested that while he &amp; Mom were on a vacation, maybe us kids could clean
out their home.  It got on dad's nerves that mom didn't keep the house clean
and wouldn't throw anything out.  Our family was living in Idaho at the time,
so I came down and stayed at Mom &amp; Dads and cleaned all day every day for
several days.  Bryce &amp; Deanna, Georgia &amp; I think Kim came &amp; helped
whenever they could.  Bryce &amp; I had problems when one night he &amp; Deanna
&amp; I were working and it was late and I made the comment that &quot;I felt
sorry for Mom&quot;.  Bryce got in a rage and said &quot;feel sorry, feel
sorry&quot; and he blew up.  I had meant that I feel sorry for her that she has
this phobia that she can't throw anything away.  He thought I meant that I felt
sorry for her because we were going to throw her things away.  (Actually we
weren't throwing anything away, except spoiled food in her storage room and
just garbage.  We made sure that it wasn't anything of value or anything she
wouldn't want thrown away because we knew it would really upset her.  All we
were trying to do was organize her things so she could see what she had and be
able to get to it and use it) Anyway, Bryce was ranting &amp; raving so I told
him he better go home if he was that upset as he was making me upset.  That
upset him more, and Deanna had to practically drag him out of the house as he
was yelling at me.  After they left, I started crying and could hardly sleep that
night.  Bryce had never acted like that to me before.  The next morning he
called to apologize and wanted to take me to lunch to make up for it.  Deanna
later told me that when stress starts to get to Bryce, his eyebrows start
twitching and she knows to get him away from the stress, change the subject,
etc., as he's about ready to blow.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Anyway, when Mom &amp; Dad came home we expected
Mom to be happy to have the house cleaned and organized, but she was really
upset because she felt we had thrown things away, and now she didn't know where
things were.  For weeks, she would call and ask what we had done with such
&amp; such.  Ken was upset that I had worked so hard and this was the
appreciation I got.  I guess even with the mess, she knew where things were -
anyway, it caused us all a lot of grief - so I determined I would never do that
again.  Dad even felt bad that he had suggested it, even though he liked how it
looked.  It didn't stay looking that way very long anyway because Mom doesn't
keep it up and put things away.  Dad said &quot;she has so many other good
qualities that I will just have to put up with this and try not to let it
bother me&quot;.  I am thankful for such a wonderful dad to realize that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Back to our recent dilemma, Scott &amp; Mishelle
were willing to live there and look out after Mom and fix food part of the time
for her.  Georgia talked to mom about us doing it and Mom was upset as she
didn't want us to get rid of any of her things.  She wanted us to come and
clean for her - wash windows, clean her house, etc.  Georgia told her that we
would come wash her windows and clean her house in the morning and then in the
afternoon we needed to clean out the basement.  Georgia said Mom agreed.  It
turned out that Georgia wasn't able to come and so I ended up cleaning her
house and washing her curtains and Kim and his son washed her windows.  Kim
&amp; I  started cleaning out her basement and soon Bryce came, but she was
right there to make sure we didn't get rid of anything.  I put a couple of
things in the garbage, that was garbage, and I saw her take them out.  It is so
frustrating that she wants us to clean, but will not let us throw anything
away.  Her house is bulging with junk of all kinds and she keeps going to yard
sales every weekend and buys more.  She can't get into her rooms because there
is so much stuff.  We can't clean because there is no place to put the stuff
which is on her table, counters, etc.  Bryce ended up making Mom upset when he
tried to show her all the boxes of yarn that she has and how she should get rid
of some of it because she can't possibly use all of it.  I think there was 14
boxes of yarn and 25 boxes of material.  I stacked toys, etc. that she can give
to her grandchildren &amp; great grandchildren for Christmas &amp; Birthday
present in one area of the downstairs bedroom.  I stacks wedding &amp; shower
gifts in the other area - almost to the ceiling.  She started to cry as Bryce
was getting upset with her - so I told Bryce to &quot;stop&quot; - that it
wasn't worth it - that we loved her and can't upset her like this.  - Then he
was upset with me.  There is no way we can get rid of her things - so there is
no way anyone can come and live with her.  After Dad's death, she said she
couldn't live alone - so I asked Ken if we could sell our home and go live with
her and take care of her.  We were willing to do it, but she wasn't willing to
get rid of anything - so I came home and told Ken we couldn't live with her as
there is <u>no</u> room.  I'm glad we didn't try as I think it would have been
way too hard on all of us, and we needed to not move Jeff another time.  She
has gotten along all right.  But at the present her health is deteriorating and
we don't know what to do.  We got her a medical alert necklace, but she won't
wear it.  If she should fall and couldn't get up, or if she had other problems,
and was wearing the necklace - all she would have to do is push the button and
it would ring at her neighbors and then 911.  If the neighbor wasn't home, it
would right at another close neighbor, if she wasn't home, it would ring at
Bryces home.  She won't wear it as she resents it - so don't know what to do. I
told Aunt Joy this and she said &quot;Yes, that's foolish, that's like having a
life preserver in the boat, but not wearing it and if you should fall
overboard, you wouldn't have it on and so it wouldn't help you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Aunt Joy said that she has told Mom how lucky
she is to have her children around her (Aunt Joys children all live a long ways
away) and Mom told her, &quot;Oh I don't know, they don't come to see me very
often or call, etc., they are all too busy.&quot;  That upset me as we are all
trying the best we can.  I invite her for dinner most Sundays, and I go over
and visit and do things for her nearly every Thursday night after I get my hair
done which is about 6:00 p.m.  Sometimes I go visit Ken's mom, but usually I at
least stop over for a few minutes even when I spend the night with Ken's Mom. 
I usually either take food from home for her or I stop and buy her something to
eat.  She has a list of things she wants me to do when I go on Thursday nights,
and I try to do them for her even though I am so tired from working all day.  We
went to Jean's grave side service at Morgan last Friday.  Bryce took her up
since he lives close by, but Ken &amp; I were going for a ride after to see the
fall leaves so we took her with us.  Two days ago, on Wednesday, was Georgia's son, Bryan's wedding.  Bryce again took her, but he left to go home after the
wedding and Ken had to go exchange a part - so Deanna &amp; I took her in her
wheelchair to Scott's car where we rode over with them to the wedding
breakfast.  Ken met us there and after the wedding breakfast, we took Mom with
us to see Legacy at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building and then Ken wheeled her
to the reception which was at an older home near the temple.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Georgia tries to go over on Fridays and vacuum,
dust, etc.  We both call her about every day to see how she is.  Bryce calls
her almost every night to check on her and comes to work on his cars at her
home - so while there does things for her.  I got my hair done on Monday
afternoon this week and I brought her some sausage casserole &amp; visited
while she ate.  I asked if she wanted me to do something for her and she did -
I cleaned her linen closet and washed her north bedroom curtains.  Georgia
&amp; I have always cleaned mom's house for her, and done thorough cleaning
when she would have Daughter's of the Pioneer's Meetings at her home or Club,
or company was coming to stay overnight with her.  I remember Ken getting upset
with me when we lived in Ogden and I would go out to visit with Mom and come
home tired as I had spend the entire time cleaning Mom's house.  I don't mind
helping her, but it is frustrating because she expects it and she doesn't try
to keep it up.  All of us kids and our families go over usually twice a year to
work in her yard.  Georgia takes Mom shopping for clothes and sometimes
groceries - although Mom still drives some, so she goes to the Canned Food
Store often by herself.  Deanna takes her to the doctors a lot or Georgia.  I
have taken off work some to do it.  Aunt Esther stopped by Mom's one day when Georgia
was there cleaning and Mom had gone to get her hair done.  Aunt Esther told Georgia that Mom was lucky to have two daughters who have always cleaned and done things for
her - that her kids (Aunt Esthers) don't do things for her - that she does things
for them.  We love Mom and she has been a good mom and a great example of faith
and love of the Lord.  We know she loves us and she is always giving us fruit
&amp; vegetables which Uncle Dale or someone gives her - she shares.  Plus she
gives us things she gets at yard sales, etc.  But it is upsetting to have her
tell other people that her kids don't do much for her or seem to care about
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I see how she is and how Ken's mom is - it
makes me worry about how I will be when I get old.  Hope I don't have to live
that long to cause problems for my children.  I'm sure part of the reason for
the way they act is because of their age.  I guess that is one of our trials in
this life.  Don't know if I'm passing the test or not - sure hope so.  I do try
to show love and respect and concern, but I do get upset with them too often.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- With them being widows, they're lonely and want us with
them more.  With being as busy as I am, I guess I can't understand that,
although I do feel sad if our children don't call or come around very often and
I'm sure it would be much worse not to have a husband to talk with and be with.
And with mom's bad back, it is hard for her.  I can understand that a little as
my back gives me problems too, but with going to the chiropractor once a week,
it helps a lot - and my back isn't anything like my mom's - so I can't
complain.  She doesn't complain a lot either. When I ask her how she is, she
just says <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>“I’m a doin”.</span></b>   Lately
she is having problems with fluid in her lungs and around her heart.  Her legs
&amp; feet swell and the doctor is having her take a pill that makes her go to
the bathroom a lot to get rid of the water - and that is a problem for her. 
She has stomach problems sometimes also, but most of the time she doesn't let
it get her down.  She keeps going to club, Daughters of the Pioneers, meetings,
wedding receptions, funerals, etc., etc.  Usually one of the ladies pick her up
and take her.  Ken's mom is usually in good spirits when I visit her, and if
she isn't I change the subject.  I play rummy with her, cut her hair, and take
her to the store or just visit.  Bob says she is ornery a lot and negative. 
I'm sure she is, but we will just have to have patience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I'm sure I have no idea of their loneliness,
pain and problems of old age, and maybe fear of death.  I have no right to
judge them.  I just hope and pray I can have more patience and show them the
love I need to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Dec. 29, 1997</b>  I will insert a little
more of my frustration about mom here.  Ken, being such a wonderful son-in-law,
suggested that we have mom come live with us and we would make our family room
her bedroom.  We would bring over her bed, TV, her books, knitting &amp; other
things she likes to do.  We have a bathroom just off the family room - so it
would be easy for her as she has blatter and kidney problems and has a hard
time making it to the bathroom.  She wears &quot;Depends&quot; (like diapers
for the elderly)  Ken said that she could talk to her friends on the phone, we
could fix her meals and be with her in the evenings (we both work during the
day)and be here to help her more.  I thought she might appreciate this offer as
she hates being alone and is worried about her health, etc.  Instead she tried
to give me reasons why she couldn't come.  None were valid.  I know it is hard
for her to leave her home, but she is 81 and her health is not good and she
shouldn't be alone.   We suggested this several months ago and have tried to
talk to her about it many times, but she is stubborn and won't do it.  She says
I am too busy.  I told her I would even ask to be released from stake relief
society counselor to take care of her if I needed to.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Today her and Bryce were arguing because her
back is hurting and she wanted him to take her to Dr. Bennetts.  I was planning
to, but our car, which Ken drives to work, - wouldn't start so he had to take
our other car.  Bryce told her that he would take her today, but asked if she
wouldn't consider going to Dr. Cordova from now on.  Dr. Cordova used to work
with Dr. Bennett and now has an office in Clearfield - close by Bryce so Bryce
switched and now goes to Dr. Cordova as he is good too and a lot closer.  Bryce
had talked to Dr. Cordova about Mom and he agreed to take her at the cost she
was paying Dr. Bennett - which is $50.00 a month for all the treatments she
needs.  Most treatments are $35.00 a treatment.  Mom got upset and said Dr.
Bennett is better and she doesn't want to change.  They were arguing and upset
with each other and Mom finally said &quot;don't worry about it, I'll have
Charlene take me&quot;.  Charlene is her visiting teacher.  She then called me
to tell me about her argument with Bryce.  I told her it would be a lot easier
for Bryce to take her to Dr. Cordova and that he was good too.  She imposed on
Charlene as she told me that Charlene told her she had planned on taking their
Christmas tree down, doing laundry and cleaning house and her husband was
home.  I don't know what else was said, but Charlene did take Mom.  The people
in her ward think we don't do enough for Mom, but it is because she expects so
much of us and uses and manipulates us.  She wants us to do things for her at
her convenience, not ours.  I guess it is her age.  Mike said that many of the
elderly turn back to childish ways and are stubborn and selfish.  I guess
that’s it. She called me the other day and said she was supposed to have
&quot;Daughters of the Pioneer&quot; meeting at her home on the 7th of January,
but that she guessed she would have to drop out of it.  I thought she was
meaning because she didn't feel good.  Her health has been terrible lately. 
She hasn't gone to church for several weeks because she hasn't felt good enough
to go.  (A neighbor stops by to take her when she feels she can go.)  I said
well, maybe she should because of her health.  She went on to tell me that her
house was so dirty, and she didn't feel good enough to clean it and that Verda
would have to have it if she didn't and Verda had already taken her turn.  I
said why does Verda have to have it?  Just start over on the list of members. 
She was playing a game with me, trying to get me to say I would clean her house
so she could have the meeting there.  I would also have to fix the refreshments
- either me or Georgia.  Georgia &amp; I have cleaned her house &amp; helped
her make the refreshments for several years when it would be her turn to have
club or Daughters of the Pioneers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I called to talk to Bryce, but Deanna answered,
and we talked about the frustrations of coping with Mom.  Deanna is a wonderful
daughter-in-law.  She does a lot for Mom, but she feels used also and gets
upset and frustrated with Mom.  Bryce called me later and we talked.  We
decided we needed to get together with Kim and Georgia and brain storm and decide
what we can do - so we can help and care for Mom and at the same time be able
to cope better so we can eliminate some of these frustrations.  We'll meet
tomorrow night, Dec. 30, 1997.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mom had always had a big raspberry
patch, since shortly after they bought the home, and she loved it.  Dad would
help mom pick them and mom had customers who bought a case or more from her
every year.  When we moved to Sunset, the kids and I would go help her pick the
raspberries and she gave the kids so much for every case they picked.  They
were happy about the money, but didn’t enjoy picking them so much as they were
so close together that you had scratched, and you would find spiders in them
sometimes.  Ken tried to talk mom into letting him cultivate between the rows,
so you could get through them easier.  He told her that they would grow better,
and they would be easier to pick, but she wouldn’t let him as she thought he
would take too many of her raspberries plants out.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>MY NIECE, HAL
&amp; JEAN’S DAUGHTER, CINDI PORTER</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I were on our way to Heber City, just
going up Weber Canyon when we received a phone call.  It was from the Police
Chief at Clinton City.  He asked if I was Mae Browning and if I knew a Cindi
Porter.  When I responded that she was my niece, he said I was to call a Sharon
at Boulder Colorado and gave me the number.  I tried to question him as to what
it was about and finally he said Sharon was from the coroner’s office in
Boulder.  At that I started to cry and he said he hated to be the one to tell
me and that I should call her right away.  As soon as I got some control of
myself, I did.  Sharon was very kind and told me they had been trying to reach
Cindi’s next of kin since Friday.  Cindi took her life on Thursday afternoon. 
They found a recent call to Aunt Mae on her phone, but the number didn’t have
the prefix, so they didn’t know where Aunt Mae was.  They finally found out
that Cindi’s parents were both deceased and were buried in Utah, so they called
the Utah prefixes and found me.  She said they found some credit cards in the
apartment and took them so they wouldn’t be found by others and possibly used. 
When I asked her what we should do, she said to take what time we needed, but
then get a trusted funeral home and the funeral home could make the
arrangements for Cindi’s body to be sent here to Utah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I asked Sharon if Cindi’s daughter, Samantha,
had been notified or her foster parents.  She said “Yes, Cindi’s caseworker had
taken care of that”, but said that the caseworker wouldn’t give her their
telephone number or any information, so that was another reason why it was so
hard to reach any of us.  Georgia called Dugans and left a message for them to
call ---------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>CINDI’S BISHOP</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I mentioned to Terry about wanting to get a
hold of Cindi’s Bishop, Terry said he would get on the internet and find him
and have him call me.  Bishop Michael Rayback called about 4 pm of Jan. 9<sup>th</sup>,
the day we found out about Cindi’s death.  I could tell from his voice what a
caring and loving Bishop Cindi had.  As I talked with him, I felt such peace
and joy knowing that members of his ward as well as himself loved Cindi and
took good care of her.  He said he called her as much as 3 times a week.  He
said that when he called and couldn’t even reach the voice message, he knew
that message center was full and that probably she was using again, so he would
go check on her and work with her to get her back on track again.  He said he
felt Cindi had mental illness and that the mental illness is what brought on the
drugs – not the other way around.  He said he felt it was the same as her
father had.  I shared with him about Hal’s insomia and getting on sleeping
pills in the service and getting addicted and how frustrating it was for Jean
and also for his brothers who took him hiking to get the pills out of his
system.  I shared with him Hal’s good qualities.  He said Cindi had real
depression problems as well as the drugs and other health problems because of
the drugs and she had been going down hill for some time and he was worried
about how he and the ward could take care of her as she was getting worse and
worse.  But they loved her and wanted too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The friend, who had been staying with her, found
her and called the Bishop.  The Bishop called the missionaries who had been
teaching her and asked if they could go over.  They did and found the police
there.  The police wouldn’t tell them anything or let them look at anything
until Cindi’s next of kin was notified.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The friend was a recent employer of Cindi’s.  He
had a marketing business and Cindi was working for him by phone and internet. 
He and his wife separated and he had no place to go, so Cindi invited him to
stay with her.  He assured me that there was nothing morally wrong going on
between them.  He was in contact with this man too, and the man had moved out
prior to Cindi’s suicide.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When the Bishop notified the ward leaders and it
spread from there, everyone was heard saying “Oh, if I had just called her
again, or gone to see her, or been there for her, maybe it wouldn’t have
happened.”  He said I’m sure you are all saying and thinking the same thing,
but I don’t think any of us could have stopped it – the mental illness had
taken over.”  He said “When I told her visiting teacher, she just cryed and cryed
and said “How can I take care of my two children today, I am so distraught by
this as I loved Cindi dearly.”  He counciled her to pray to the Lord and he
would comfort her.  He said she bore her a sweet testimony on Sunday and said
how as she prayed the Lord spoke to her and said “Cindi is ok, don’t greeve for
her, I love her and am taking care of her.”  She said that brought such peace
and joy to her soul.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bishop Rayback said that he had been paying
Cindi’s rent for the past two years from ward welfare funds.  They had just
paid it again for this month last week.  He said that Cindi was very good with
money and very careful.  If ever she went overdrawn or asked him for small
loans, he knew she was using drugs again and he could meet and council with her. 
He said Cindi would get jobs, but couldn’t keep them long the past few years
because of the drugs, her health and the depression.  She told him:  “No one
knows how hard my depression is unless they go through it themselves”.  He told
her he knew that was true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bishop Rayback said that Cindi had wrecked her
car by running into a curb and blowing out the tire.  Bishop said he knew she
was using drugs again and that was the cause of the accident.  Her home teacher
had come to get her and tow the car to a garage.  Upon checking the car, it was
found that the transmission was about gone and it would cost about $1,500.00 to
$2,000. to be fixed.  Cindi had told the Bishop that it wouldn’t help to fix
the tire, but that she didn’t know what she would do now without a car.  (I’m
sure that added to her depression).  She had told the Bishop about how her
uncle gave her the car, and she also told him about all of us – her Porter
family in Utah and the love she had for us, and the wonderful time she had when
she came to Utah.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bishop Rayback said that Cindi came to church on
Christmas Day with her visiting teacher and she looked so beautiful.  He told
her “Cindi, I am so glad to see you, this is where you belong.” And she said
“Yes Bishop, I know that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I mentioned to Bishop Rayback that we had talked
with a couple of funeral homes and that the one said it could cost 8 or 9
thousand dollars by the time we pay the coroner in Boulder, had her body flown
over, paid for the services of the funeral home and the casket, vault, burial
plot and opening and closing of grave.  Mark at Walker’s in Morgan suggested we
cremate her body and get permission from the cemetery to lay the ashes in
either her father or mother’s grave.  It would only be $1,500. to $2,000. 
Bishop Rayback said “yes”, I would agree, I think that it what Cindi would
want.  She wouldn’t want you to spend a lot on her, especially when she knows
all of you will have to pay it and none of you are wealthy.  He said his father
wanted to be cremated, and so they honored his wishes, since his mother and
father were divorced and there was no one, other than him and his father’s
sister to pay for it.  He said he ended up paying the $2,000.  He said the
ashes were put in an urn and later when it was convenient to have a gravesite
service, they did.  He said there is no hurry when a cremation takes place.  He
said the church doesn’t frown on it either, they feel it is up to the family to
decide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bishop Rayback said Cindi really struggled with
her father’s suicide, and that the year she became the age he was when he died
(36) she had a really hard time and they talked about it.  She showed him a
treasured birthday card she had received from her father when she was a child
and it said “To the most beautiful little girl in the world.”  It made her
depressed, but he told her “No, Cindi, you should realize from that how much
your father loved you, and it should make you happy, not sad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bishop Rayback said since the ward members all
loved her, they would like to have a service where the members could say
“goodbye” to her.  I told him that would be wonderful.  He said the members
loved her and knew that she loved them and appreciated all they did for her. 
He said Cindi had wonderful home teachers and visiting teachers, plus many,
many other friends in the ward and also many friends not in the ward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bishop Rayback asked what they could do and I
said if they could take care of the apartment – give the furniture and clothes
to needy families and close the apartment. He said Cindi had some personal
belongings and if someone came to pick them up, they could get the urn with the
ashes at that time, if that is what we decided to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bishop Rayback gave me his phone number and
e-mail address and I gave him mine.  He said we would keep in touch until it is
all settled.  He said if there is anything else he or his ward could do, they
would be happy to do it </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 44 -  LARRY &amp;
TAMMY BRAITHWAITE - Oct 4, 1997</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken &amp; I have been emotional a lot lately as
we have experienced several hard things in our life over the past few weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>- The hardest was to learn of our best friends<b>, Larry
&amp; Tammy Braithwaite's apostasy from the church</b> and their
excommunication.  It has really been hard dealing with that.  Just about
everything we hear, read or see that has anything to do with the church, family
or even life makes us think of them and what they have given up and what they
are doing.  We love them.  They have been a big part of our life.  We have many
fond memories of them.  Our last move to Arizona ended in bad feelings from Ken
towards Larry and that was hard because Tammy was my best friend and I felt so
close to her and I loved Larry also.  I didn't agree with all he said or did
either, but was willing to forgive him - but Ken wasn't.  He has now, thank
goodness.  They got involved in anti-Mormon literature, they had let down their
guard.  We don't think they were reading the scriptures, etc., they began to
criticize the leaders and find fault - and went downhill from there.  We are so
sad.  We have sent letters and articles, etc., to try to get them to
reconsider, and have born our testimonies to them, but it didn't do any good. 
Finally Larry sent a long letter telling us not to send any more testimonies -
that he would never come back in the church.  He also sent anti-Mormon
literature and a copy of the letter he sent his kids.  I threw them away as I
didn't want to read them.  He said he does love us and wants to stay friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I haven't heard from Tammy.  Larry
has always been the one to talk to us on the phone or write the letters.  I
wish I knew how she felt.  I had called two weeks before we got the terrible
letter and had a good visit on the phone with both of them.  They never
mentioned anything about their leaving the church.  I had invited them to come
up where we would be camping - up Cedar Canyon with our family on the 8th of
August and to invite their family to come also.  We hadn't been together with
our families since we moved from Arizona the last time.  They talked like they
would love to come, but when we got the letter they explained that they would
love to come and be with us, but maybe we had better do it another time.  When
we talked with Larry after getting the letter, we asked about his children.  He
said some are OK with it and had doubts too, that Lonnie &amp; his wife were
upset at first, but now had confessed that they have doubts too, but since her
family are strong active members that they won't leave the church as it would
be too hard on her parents.  He said Jody is having the hardest time - that she
said &quot;Dad, why have you spent all my life teaching me the gospel and
telling me it was true and now you tell me it isn't&quot;.  Ken &amp; I really
feel bad for their children.  I'm sure it is tearing them apart, and if he is
successful in turning his children away from the church, he will have a lot to
answer for.  Satan has really gotten a hold of him (and I guess Tammy too). 
Ken &amp; I feel so bad and they are always in our thoughts and prayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>2017 – update on Tammy &amp;
Larry</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had heard from Shellie that
Larry &amp; Tammy’s son, Lonnie and his wife &amp; children live in their stake
in Queen Creek, Arizona.  She saw him &amp; his wife at the temple and they
were excited to see each other and catch up on our families.  Lonnie told
Shellie that he and his family can’t have contact with his parents as Larry is
so anti Mormon that he tried to get Lonnie to leave the church.  Lonnie
wouldn’t do it and so Larry wouldn’t let him talk to his mom.  He told Shellie
that his mom is a wonderful grandmother, but she can’t be a grandmother to his
kids because every time he would go to their house, his dad would keep telling
him anti Mormon stuff and so they haven’t been able to go there.  Lonnie was in
the High Council, in the Bishopric and works in the temple.  Lonnie’s wife has
always been strong in the church and they are raising their children in the
gospel.  As far as we know Jody is still active too, however, she divorced her
husband.  He is a good man and they have had leadership positions also, but Tammy
told us lately that they just were not compatible.  She is dating a guy she
dated in high school, who is also divorced.  Lori and her husband are messed
up, and Lonnie said Holly is Holly.  She was always scatter brained.  She has
been married and divorced two or three times and her husband was unfaithful to
her, so she was unfaithful to him.</p>

align=left hspace=12>Our son, David, had Lonnie’s married son, who lives in
this area, come to him as a patient and David found out that he was Larry’s
grandson.  This grandson recently called David to let him know that Larry had
passed away.  On our way to Shellie &amp; Roy’s home in March, we stopped at
Maggie &amp; Bill Klass’s home to visit and spend the night with them.  They
were good friend from when we had our home in Layton and they recently moved to
St. George.  We had <b>Tammy’</b>s home address, so we decided to go see if she
was home to visit her for a few minutes, the next morning before we went on our
way to Shellie and Roy’s home.  She was home and when she opened the door and
saw us, she was so surprised and then gave me a big hug and we cried as we
hugged.  She hugged Ken also and then invited us in.  We visited for a while
and she told us about the “Celebration of Life” they had for Larry and how she
was so thrilled that over 80 people came.  She said lots of neighbors and
friends loved Larry.  We loved him also as he was a good and generous man –
just wish he hadn’t listened to Satan and left the church.  Anyway, she showed
us the beautiful sunroom he made for them and a couple of beautiful chests he
made and she painted.  They were beautiful.  Larry was a special craftsman, he
was really talented.  Larry died of Rumatoid Arthritis.  He came down with it
soon after we met them and it kept progressing.  He really suffered with it, but
he didn’t let it stop him, until it finally got him in the end.  Tammy said the
last year or so he showed her all the things she needed to know to take care of
their home and yard – so that was great.  I have always loved Tammy like a
sister and it was so good to see her again.  I don’t know if we will ever be
close again like we were, but I was thankful to see her again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This is really getting to be the last days where
the sheep will be separated from the lambs, I think.  <b>Claudia Thompson</b>
is the lst counselor in the Stake Relief Presidency - who I work with.  She is
such a stalwart, wonderful person.  We went as a presidency to Salt
  Lake City to the General Relief Society Workshops on Sept
 25, 1997.  She confided to Marge &amp; I, while we were eating lunch after the
workshops, that her husband has gone inactive.  He has been really active all
his life, they were married in the temple and have practically raised their
four daughters.  He was High Priest Group Leader when last January he told
Claudia that he wasn't going to church that day and he hasn't gone since.  She
asked him if there is a problem they can work out and he says &quot;no&quot;
that he is just tired and wants to do what he wants to do.  In other words, he
has given up.  He is not enduring to the end.  She is so upset and worried. 
She was crying when she told us.  She said she has talked to their bishop and
home teachers, has prayed continually and doesn't know what to do next.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Several months ago, <b>Ken's brother, Roy,
called us to tell us about his son, Steve</b>.  Roy was angry and very upset. 
Steve had been wild in his teenage years, gotten in with the wrong crowd and
got on drugs.  He straightened out mainly when Roy &amp; Linda had Julianna. 
They had adopted Steve &amp; Barbie, but Linda was promised in her patriarchal
blessing that she would have children of her own.  Since it had been 20 years,
they had given up and felt the blessing meant in the millennium or something. 
Well, she did conceive and had Julianna.  The people in their ward called Linda
&quot;Sarah&quot;.  This did a lot for Steve as he loved Julianna and would
stay home to be with her rather than go with his friends.  This gave Roy &amp;
Linda a chance to talk &amp; reason with him.  He went on a mission to Hawaii
and was assistant to the president of the mission who was Elder Kakuchi.  He
loved this time with him.  He came home &amp; went to Rich's college where he
met a special girl and they were married.  A short time afterward on a Saturday
morning, he had gone to a business meeting, and when he returned he found her
dead in the bathtub.  She was taking a bath when she had an epileptic seizure
and drowned.  He was so devastated.  Roy called Elder Kakuchi and he came to
speak at the funeral.  He gave Steve a blessing and had a good talk with him. 
He moved to Provo and went to BYU where he met another darling girl and married
her.  They had two little girls, but the problem was he compared the second
wife to the first wife - who he said was much prettier and better.  He finally
told the second wife that she was a good roommate, but he didn't have romantic
interests in her.  I can't imagine how this would have hurt her.  She went to
visit her parents in Texas and when she returned, Steve had moved out to live
with his druggie friend from high school who was living in Salt
 Lake.  She went back to live with her parents.  Steve thought he could live a
wonderful life.  He had been making big money, bought a BMW, had a hair
transplant (since he was becoming bald), worked out at a gym and really thought
he was a lady's man.  He started going out with his so-called &quot;society
friends&quot;, but found them to be shallow.  He realized &quot;too late&quot;
that he really did love his wife and what a wonderful woman she was, and he
missed his darling children - so called her to see if she would take him back. 
She said &quot;no way, I'm happier now than I have ever been since I married
you.  I don't want to go through anymore of that&quot;.  He begged her and
promised that he would change, but it did no good.  He has really gone through
&quot;Hell&quot; - trying to repent.  He moved down to Texas so he could be
good to his children and help with them.  I sure hope it works out for him.  He
said Satan just gradually lead him down to Hell and he didn't even realize how
it happened.  He let down his guard and probably quit studying the scriptures
and praying like he should.  I will pray continually that I, Ken or none of our
children, their spouses and our grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc, will

<p class=MsoNormal>            I pray that we will be faithful all the days of
our lives - that we may be together forever.  My parents, grandparents,

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 45 – EXPERIENCES
OF NOT GIVING UP:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>&quot;Don't quit or give up&quot;.</b>  That
has been my feelings since I was young.  I hope I will always be strong in this
especially with regards to the church.  I will relate a few incidents in hopes
that when my family reads this, they will realize the importance of &quot;not
giving up&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first was when we moved to Clearfield in
1968, I was asked to teach the <b>Trekker boys in Primary</b> - 10 year olds. 
They had had a wonderful teacher whom they loved, but she was asked to be the
chorister in MIA.  She was sad because she loved the boys and wanted to stay
with them, but hated to turn the Bishopric down so she accepted.  The boys were
really upset and when I came to be their teacher, they wouldn't accept me.  I
tried to sit next to them in opening exercises and they would scoot away from me
and give me terrible looks and say &quot;leave me alone&quot;.  When we went to
the classroom, I really had problems.  They were running all over the room,
yelling, and causing all sorts of disturbance.  The Primary President had to
come in a couple of times and talk to them.  I went home crying more than
once.  But, I wasn't going to let them get to me.  I kept trying, praying and
fasting.  Finally two or three months later, the lesson was on knot tying.  I
had been stake activity counselor in the Farr West stake in Ogden and been over
camp for the young women, and also camp director 2 or 3 years later for three
years - so was good at tying knots.  When the boys saw that I could tie knots,
they decided I wasn't all bad - and it went uphill from then on.  I had one boy,
Lane Adams, who was my biggest challenge.  I really worked to get him to accept
me, and we became close.  It seems the ones you work hardest with become the
closest to you.  His mother became my first counselor in the primary presidency
a few months later when they asked me to be the Primary President.  Carolyn Cue
was my second counselor.  We had a wonderful presidency - thanks to inspiration
and the spirituality of Kent Murdock who was the counselor in the Bishopric
over the primary.  He later became Bishop and Ken was his first counselor. 
(That's another story)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Another challenge of teaching a
class was when we moved down to <b>Arizona</b><b> the first time</b> - in the
Lehi ward.  I was asked <b>to teach the Laurels</b>.  I was really excited
because I had taught the Mia Maids in the Mount Fort Ward in Ogden and loved
them.  Deanna Green (now my sister-in-law, Bryce's wife, was one of the girls
in my class) and I had been ward MIA counselor, president and stake activity
counselor (now YWMIA) since Ken &amp; I were married.  I had loved working in
the MIA.  When we moved from Ogden to Clearfield, I had been in the primary and
in Relief Society.  I loved the children, but I missed the young women.  I felt
the Laurels would be the best age to teach as they were past the giggling stage
and were more mature.  The Laurels in the other two wards were great examples
to the younger girls.  But, I was in for a rude awakening with these girls -
they were not a good example to the younger girls, in fact, they were awful. 
The first week (this was before the block schedule and we met each Tuesday
night for lessons and activities) I sat in opening exercises with them and was
horrified as one of the Laurels made fun of one of the Mia Maid girls.  The Mia
Maid was one of 14 children of the lst counselor in the Bishopric.  I'm not
sure if this Laurel felt this family wasn't as good as hers or what - but she
was saying to her &quot;mice, mice are running up and down you&quot;.  She kept
it up and the other Laurels were snickering.  I finally took all I could and
told her to stop.  During class they were doing everything except trying to
listen to the lesson.  I felt I was well prepared and I have always tried to
put a lot into my lessons so they would not be boring.  They were visiting
among themselves, doing their nails, two were combing each other's hair, etc. 
I was really disgusted.  I went home crying.  Ken asked me after several
classes such as this, why I didn't quit and I said because I don't
&quot;quit&quot;.  The Lord will help me again.  I remember one terrible joint
activity where the boys were supposed to teach the girls how to change tires,
etc., and the girls were going to teach the boys how to bake cookies, iron
their shirts, etc.  It turned out terrible.  Even in the planning, the girls
just wanted to go out and &quot;neck&quot; with the boys - that was their idea
of an fun activity.  One girl, during the time we were in the kitchen teaching
the boys how to bake,  found some matches in the cupboard and started lighting
them and acting like she was going to start a fire.  Another dance activity,
one girl brought her boyfriend and then wanted to go off with him.  We had set
some strict rules because of the way these boys &amp; girls were - so we ended
up calling her father, who came and got her.  I really had problems with her
for awhile after that.  I fasted and prayed and about half-way through the
year, they came around.  I think they finally realized that I cared about them
as I had done extra things for them, but one night they were at my home baking
cookies to send to the missionaries from our ward.  We had a good time and from
then on, it got better and better.  They invited me to their temple marriages
and the one girl who had made fun of the Mia Maid my first night there (Sharla)
later became my counselor in the Primary presidency when we moved back to Arizona
in the 40th ward in Mesa about six years later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Still another example was when I was asked to
teach the <b>10 year old boys in Primary soon after we moved to Grantsville in
1980</b>.  After I was sustained in that position, I had people coming up to me
and offering me condolences as they said that was the hardest class in primary
- that they had run several teachers out.  It was a hard class.  My son, David,
was in the class, but he was wonderful, especially compared to the other 10
boys.  Each boy was unique in his misbehavior, but all of them misbehaved.  One
made noises like he was an airplane (Greg Burgess), one tried to make the
others laugh by making funny antics, etc. (Judd ), one was a smart allec, one
couldn't sit still, etc., etc.  That class was really a challenge, but I
determined they were not going to run me out.  I fasted and prayed and tried
different approaches, etc.  But they finally came around when they realized I
really cared about them.  I had heard the quote several years earlier &quot;I
don't care how much you know, until I know how much you care&quot;.  I baked
and decorated birthday cakes, and took to them on their birthdays.  I had them
come to my house and worked with them so they would be prepared to go into the
Blazer class when they turned 11 years old, we had parties, I bore my testimony
to them, etc.  I really did care about them.  I really grew to love each of
them and was sad when they did turn 11 and went to the next class.</p>

them to Camperworld since Ken &amp; I haven't been able to get up there this
summer, but the weather turned off cold and rained down here, but snowed in the
mountains - so we changed our plans.  I was glad Ken went with me to be with
the children as I don't like driving in the rain and Ken doesn't mind it - plus
I love being with Ken. We had lots of fun with them as they are such good and
cute grandchildren.  David was five years old and Taylor was three.  I took
them for rides around the block in their wagon, and sometimes David would ride
his tricycle, while I pulled Taylor in the wagon.  We played with Lego blocks
and other games, and enjoyed these little ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chapter 46 - EXCERPS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN TO JEFF WHILE ON
HIS MISSION.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jan. 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> I was in the Stake Relief Society Presidency and had been
asked by Pres. Larkin to speak in Stake Conference.  The following is what I
wrote: I had cleaned house &amp; done laundry in the morning besides talking
with Shellie &amp; Sandi.  They had both called.  David &amp; Shauna came over
in the afternoon.  I hadn't had much time to prepare for my talk that I was to
give at the Saturday night session of Conference.  I really felt the help of
the Lord with regards to that talk.  I felt inspired when I put it together, it
went together easier than most any other talk I have given.  I didn't worry
very much about it, and that is a surprise since speaking in Stake Conference
is such a responsibility, and the Lord really blessed me when I gave the talk. 
Boy, I don't think I could give a talk if I didn't know the Lord would help me,
and he always does.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This morning I cleaned your room (Jeff) It was
hard because just being in your room, and looking at your clothing, pictures
and all your things sure made me homesick for you. I'd cry for a few minutes
and then go on.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Scott said he was listening to your tapes and
Christophersons Dream came on, it reminded him of you playing it and was
missing you.  I think it's so neat that you &amp; Scott have such a good
relationship.  In fact, all of your sisters &amp; brothers love you and respect
you.  Shellie asked me yesterday for your address so she could write to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>February 9, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Elder Jeffrey C. Browning,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             I will start this letter by telling you a
little of our vacation week.  We had a wonderful week in Island Park. 
The snow was so deep that when we drove into the lodge area we could not see
the condominiums and drove around looking for Uncle Rich's.  We finally had to
go to the office and get directions.  We had driven right past it twice.  It
was about 1 PM on Saturday February the 1st when we got there.  We did go for a
ride on the snowmobiles and went over to the sight of a cabin that had blown up
the previous Sunday.  The cabin had just been completed about 3 months ago.  It
was owned by a Dr. and his family.  They had left the cabin about 8
 PM and it blew up about 9 PM.  It is thought that there may have been a
propane leak in the furnace, but whatever the cause, it left nothing except a
hole in the ground and pieces strung all over the area.  It did some damage to
surrounding cabins also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            David and Shauna also came up and joined us
Sunday evening and stayed until Wednesday afternoon.  During the week we went
into Yellowstone Park, where we saw bison, elk, Canadian geese and swan.  At
one stop at Junction, birds, I know them as Camp Robbers, ate nuts and cookies
right out of our hand.  It was fun and we couldn't help thinking how you would
have enjoyed being there with us.  Mom and I talked about doing this again when
you come home.  Every day we went out on the snowmobiles and just had a great
time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we got home Friday evening, we sure enjoyed
your letter you had sent.  Then your letter came to me on Saturday and I sure
appreciated it.  You will never know the joy that such a letter can give until
you have a son of your own, that is as neat as my son!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Just after I started this letter, Nicky came. 
We sure enjoyed having her here with us.  She showed us the pictures of your
hair cut, and let us read your letters.  She is a very special girl and we sure
enjoyed having her come.  She had dinner with us and visited for a while before
she had to leave to drive back to Snow College.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>February 23, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A typical Sunday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike, Becky, little David, Taylor, David,
Shauna, Scott &amp; Mishelle all came over for dinner and spent the rest of the
day.  It was sure fun having them here.  Mom fixed a nice dinner as normal,
then we set around and visited for a while.  We ended up playing pass word for
the last little while they were here.  We sure enjoyed having them all here. 
Right now mom is talking to Shellie on the phone.  Sandi was going to come out
yesterday, but JaNae wanted her to go shopping with her to find a dress for the
Jr. Prom.  She will probably come out next week end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Work is keeping us very busy and then last week
I spent a day in bed sick.  I guess some kind of flu.  Mom also took off part
of one day sick.  However you know your Mom and even while she was home sick,
she still did some house work and washing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom and I went to a dance at Weber last Saturday
evening and really had a good time.  Other than that, we just seem to keep busy
with work and church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>March 9, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Sandi, Chelci, Terry, Mike, Becky, David, Taylor, David, Shauna, Scott, Mishelle and Grandma Porter all came over for dinner and to
visit.  You were really missed by all of us, the comment was made several times
that it seemed odd that you were not here with us.  At Chad’s farewell David said, &quot;Were is Jeff?  I wouldn't think Jeff would miss
this!&quot;  He then remembered where you were and felt a little embarrassed. 
We sure enjoyed having all of them here.  Sandi had forgotten my Birthday and
hadn't sent me a card, so she left me a letter on my pillow before she left
this evening.  It is really touching and special.  She is sure a special
daughter and is trying so hard to do what is right.  We have such a neat family
and are so happy with all of you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            David and Shauna flew to Connecticut last week
end for a interview for P.A. school.  There were 750 qualified applicants that
applied and 96 were interviewed for 35 positions.  Well David was accepted and
they will probably be going back there for school the first of May for two
years.  We were excited to hear of his interview and offer, but sad to realize
they will be gone for two years.  That will be two of our sons that will be
away for two years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We talked to Shellie this morning by phone.  She
is busy with the Young Woman program.  They have had a lot of sickness this
year, so that has really worn on her.  They have also had a lot of car and
truck mechanical problems.  She really needs our prayers and love.  Maybe you
could drop her a short line, and I know it would really cheer her.  Her address
is 1361 S. Cholla Place, Chandler Arizona 85248.  Dad finished his first house
on Friday.  He took me to see it and it is beautiful.  He sure did a good job
(as always).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                                                                                                            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>March 25, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am so proud of you.  Everyone thinks so highly
of you.  You have helped so many with their testimonies because of your
testimony, and I know that will be the case also in Mexico City.  We convert
through the spirit, and by bearing our testimonies.  You felt that when you
were asked to bear your testimony so often there in the MTC, huh?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Guess what?  David just called us.  He &amp;
Shauna went to Idaho this morning for him to interview up there.  He said it
went really well.  He doesn't know if he will be accepted or not until at least
the end of this week, but they are leaning toward  going there if he is
accepted.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>March 30, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Today is the day we celebrate Easter or the
Resurrection of Our Lord And Savior Jesus Christ.  It is a beautiful spring day
here.  The weather is warm and the sky is clear.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are busy here as normal.  Mom did have Friday
off for Spring Break, so last week was a short week for her.  She also gets
Monday off, isn't she lucky?  We went out with our friends last night and sure
enjoyed it.  They are some good friends, Maggie and Mom has known each other
all their lives and Eleanor and Pat sense grade school.  Not many friendships
go back that far.  This past week Mark finished up his Eagle Scout award.  Not
any too soon though, he finished his Eagle Project Saturday and Saturday was
his 18th Birthday.  That is cutting it right to the end.  Uncle Irven and Aunt
Sandy has been out looking at houses the past couple of weeks, but haven't
found any thing yet.  (They moved in with us Aug. 1, 1996 and moved out May 30,
1997.)     Next weekend all our family are going to meet at Mike and Becky's,
so we are excited about that.  David has been accepted at Idaho State
and they are about 90% decided to accept it.  We are hoping that is where they
go, but we are a little selfish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>April 6, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went down to Mike &amp; Becky's yesterday
afternoon right after the afternoon session of conference.  When Mike talked to
David, he told him that we were going down to spend the night and invited them
to come too.  They decided they could do that.  David had called Scott to tell
him he wouldn't be going to the Priesthood session of conference with him as
they were going to Mike's.  I think Scott felt left out so when Mike called
Scott to tell him what time we were eating on Sunday, Scott said &quot;I
understand that David &amp; Shauna are coming down tonight&quot;.  Mike said
&quot;Yes, would you like to come too?  Scott said &quot;sure&quot; - so we had
a family sleep over down there.  It was great.  Mike tried to get ahold of
Sandi, but she was at her friend, Julie's.  She brought Julie and her daughter
with her and Chelci.  JaNae had to work again so couldn't go. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad was excited to go to the Priesthood session
of conference with his sons (all except you this time).  Becky, Shauna, Michele
&amp; I visited and played with the lagos with David &amp; Taylor.  When the
guys returned, we played Clue &amp; another fun game.  We went onto Daylight
Savings time again - so we lost an hour.  We went to bed at l:00 a.m. but
actually it was 2:00.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We sure enjoyed conference.  Dad took notes
since he is to give a talk on it in two weeks - so I'll tell you who spoke and
what they spoke about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>April 13, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are doing well and busy as normal.  In High
Council this morning we held a Disciplinary Council,  However, this was on a
reinstatement.  In fact this person was one that was excommunicated on the first
Disciplinary Council I set on, when I was called to the High Council.  It was
great to see the change in this Brothers Life and attitude.  His wife and
family has stuck it out with him and it was a great experience to see someone
return to our Heavenly Father.  I was so impressed with his wife's complete
forgiveness of his failings and her support to him.  I am sure that is one of
the reasons he was able to go through this experience and return.  I also had
to give a Priesthood lesson in the Kimball Ward to the combined Melchizedek
Priesthood.  The assignment came through the Stake Presidency with the subject
being &quot;How to Boaster Your Family In These Trouble Times.&quot;  It was a
challenge but went fairly well.  </p>

sweetheart.  He's a neat guy.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Dad is still on his diet, but eating a little
fruit now and a few other things.  Hope it will keep getting better.  Don't
know if he should ever add sugar back thought, but not sure if he will be that
strong if he can add it back and it won't hurt him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  We enjoyed going out to dinner for Grandma Porters
Birthday on the 22nd.  David, Shauna, Scott, Mishelle, Aunt Georgia, Aunt
Deanna, Mom and I took Grandma to dinner at the Home Town Buffet.  Grandma is
now 81 years old.  She is in pretty good health, at least for her age. 
Yesterday she fell and broke a rib, but is doing ok.  We do worry about her
living alone, so tomorrow Mom is going to order her an emergency calling devise
that if she should need someone, she can just push it and it will just ring
three people.  If none of them answer, it will ring 911 and give the location
for emergency help.  She doesn't feel she needs it, but we will feel better
with her having it.   Uncle Irven and Aunt Sandy have found them a home in
Clearfield that they are sure they will buy.  They may be moving into it in two
or three weeks.  Mark is excited about it.  He only has five more weeks of
school and he will graduate.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>May 19, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mike and Becky went to Montana this last weekend
and we tended David and Taylor.  They are sure cute kids.  I went down to pick
them up Saturday morning as Martha had tended them on Friday and Friday night
at their home.  I took them to the park, played games, read stories, etc.  It
was fun.  Irven &amp; Sandy tended them Saturday night while we went to Nicky's
pageant.   Dad and I are going out to Chelci's ball game tonight.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>May 26, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It has been a great weekend.  Shelly, Roy, Garrett, Quint and Kevis came up on Thursday evening.  Mom &amp; I therefore took
Friday off.  Well I just about did, I went over to Grandma Porter's and converted
her lawn sprinkler system over to culinary water.  At 3 PM Mom, Shellie, Roy ,
the boys and I went out to Antelope Island.  It was windy and cold so we didn't
stay our there very long.  Mom and I then tended the boys while Roy and Shelly
went out for the evening.  They don't do that very often because it costs them
too much to get a baby tender.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On Saturday we received a letter from our
favorite Missionary and sure enjoyed it and the pictures that came with it.  I
got quite a laugh with you with your arms full of puppies and two birds on your
shoulders.  That was quite normal.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Also on Saturday, Mike and his family came up,
they stopped and got Chelci on the way and Scott &amp; Mishelle came over. 
Although it rained most of the weekend, we still enjoyed it.  We took all the
family and went bowling.  With the gutter guards, the kids had a lot of fun. 
We then went over to the Layton park and took supper.  As I said on Sunday
after meetings we went down to Mike's.  Shelly and her family stayed down to Mike's
and left there this morning for home.  Mom called Shellie on Monday to make
sure they got home safely and she said they stayed up until 3
 a.m. talking with Mike &amp; Becky and had a wonderful time.  They talked the
next morning so didn't leave until noon as they enjoyed each other so much.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In your last letter you asked how we were
doing.  &quot;Busy&quot; but well.  I am doing ok with my health, although I
have lost a lot of weight.  I weigh 159 lb now but seem to be staying at that
weight.  Work is going steady.  John and I just finished installing siding on a
shed and installed facier and soffit on one of Dwayne's rentals.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(This is Mom - Dad had to leave for work and I have to also,
but I'll try to finish this so I can get it off in the mail)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            You asked about dad's health.  It is much better
since he left the mall.  Even Dr. Bennett has mentioned that.  He is still on
the diet and can't seem to get off it, although he does eat more fruit and
drinks whey.  He likes it and it doesn't seem to bother him.  I'm glad he can
drink something else besides water.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We aren’t planning to move anymore - at least
not for quite awhile.  I hope not until you are married or at least off to
college.  It won't work for us to move in with Grandma Porter as she won't let
us get rid of anything.  I didn't feel good about it anyway - as I would pray I
had a bad feeling about it.  I am excited to stay in our beautiful home and
relax a little.  I wasn't anxious to build or move or anything - just stay and
relax.  Grandma Porter thought we should also.  Dad does worry that we should
do something to get better prepared for the future, but I didn't want him to
build after he has worked all day at his job and work on Saturdays.  His health
can't take that anymore, and I want him for along time.  I'm not ready to have
him die and leave me - so I'm pretty protective of him.  He still keeps plenty
busy as my mom &amp; Uncle Bob and others always need him to do something for
them.  Oh well.  He does enjoy helping others.  He also does enjoy relaxing
some and I think he will be able to soon as Uncle Irven and Aunt Sandy and
their family just moved out this week.  I told dad I feel like a little kid
with a new toy.  It seems so good to have more room and be able to keep my
house like I like to.  They were a wonderful family and I enjoyed them in many
ways - but it will be better that they have their own home.  It is a beautiful
home and just in Clearfield - so not far away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>June 29, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This week has been a busy one for dad,
especially.  The stake presidency asked him to do a presentation at stake
priesthood leadership meeting this morning on the Family History Program.  They
didn't just want a talk, they wanted a presentation.  They asked him about a
week and a half ago.  He has put in about 30 hours on it, and has really
stressed.  When dad told Mike what he was asked to do, Mike volunteered to help
him.  Mike just bought a special camera which takes pictures for presentations
- slide, video, etc.  The camera cost him $300.  but is regularly over $500. 
He came up last Tuesday evening.  I tended the children (Becky was working)
while they went all over taking the pictures.  Then dad wrote the scrip the
next few evenings and he and I went down to Mike's Saturday morning.  Mike had
plans for the dad so he asked us to be there early (6
 a.m.) - so we left here at 4:30 a.m.  Dad had been frantically working on it
Friday night and went to Sis. Mckreaken's home at 10
 p.m. for her to give him some information he needed.  He came home at midnight and typed it up on the computer and got to bed at 2
 a.m.  Of course I drove down to Mike's, but dad wasn't sleeping, he was still
making corrections to his script.  He has really stressed over it and was about
to chuck it and just do a talk because everything was going wrong and wasn't
working out.  I told him that Satan was working on him because it would be a
big help for our stake to have this presentation so Satan was trying to stop
him.  I'm glad he kept going with it because it turned out really great.  Dad &amp;
Mike worked on it yesterday from 6 a.m. until about 11:00
 a.m.  We were supposed to be through by 10:00 as Becky was taking Mike
somewhere as a surprise for his father's day gift.  I guess they were meeting
others.  We were concerned about the time, but Mike said &quot;it's ok, we'll
make it&quot;.  Dad was sure grateful for Mike's help - he couldn't have done
it without him.  Dad said he needed a month and a half, but he only had a week
and a half, but they got it done, thank goodness.  Dad said Satan was still at
work this morning.  Dad met John (who takes care of the video's for the stake -
runs them, etc.)  He couldn't be there this morning so he had dad come up last
night to show him what to do and make sure it would work well.  Dad said when
Pres. Winegar turned it over to him for the presentation, the video recorder
wouldn't work.  Dad said it was working last night and all they did was push it
out of the way and turn it off.  This morning Dad pushed it back and turned it
on and the picture was going horizontally, etc.  He asked someone in the
audience to help him and they tried and couldn't get it to work either, so
Pres. Winegar excused the men to go to their departments and said &quot;We want
you to see this so we will have you come back in at 8:15,
and hopefully we'll get it working by then.  Thank goodness they were able to
get it working.  Dad said he about had a heart attack when he turned it on and
it wouldn't work - after all he had gone through to make it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Last Monday evening we had a neighborhood party
in our yard to say &quot;goodbye&quot; to Candace.  She has sure been a good
neighbor.  I think I told you that she wanted to sell her home and move to Bountiful because that's where both hers and Bill's family live and she has friends in Salt
 Lake where she goes to the single ward, and she works in Bountiful.  She was
really sad when she said &quot;Goodbye&quot; to me however, and kept hugging me
and crying and saying she had loved it here and would sure miss us and all the
wonderful neighbors.  We will miss her too.  She has been great. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Did I tell you that Sandy is getting married to
Terry on the 26th of July.  They just want a small wedding since it is their
2nd - so they are only inviting Dad &amp; I, Terry's mom and both Sandi's girls
and Terry's sons and their families.  They are having the wedding at his one
son's home in Salt Lake and the son's bishop is marrying them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            JaNae is in the Miss Grantsville pageant next
Thursday night so Dad &amp; I will go out to it.  Nicky is helping her some
with it - at least giving her some pointers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Saturday July 5, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I decided if I am to get your letter off this
week I had better get started today.  Mom is still asleep because we were up
late last night.  It has been busy and fun the past couple of days so I will
tell you what’s been going on.  Thursday evening Mom, Scott, Mishelle, Anna,
Nicky and I went out to Grantsville to watch the Miss Grantsville Beauty
Pageant.  JaNae participated in it.  Although she didn't place in it she did
very well and it was fun to be with her.  Mike, Becky, little David and Taylor
were here when we got home.  They came out so Mom and I could tend the kids
tomorrow evening while they went to &quot;The Stadium Of Fire&quot; Friday
evening.  With yesterday being the July 4th, we had breakfast of biscuits and
grave.  David, Scott and Mishelle also came over for breakfast.  Shauna had
just got home from work so she stayed home and slept.  We had a fun morning
being together, they all left about noon.  At 6
 PM we took the kids to see Layton's Parade, then over to the Park where they
played on the toys for a while.  We then went to the Concert and ended the with
watching the Fireworks, they were great.  After getting the children to bed Mom
and I watched a show on video before going to bed.  Today being Saturday we
will relax a little.  Mike and Becky will be here before to long to get the
kids.  Mom is going to go with Sandi and the girls to pick out dresses for
Sandi's wedding.  I guess we have told you that Terry and Sandi are getting
married the 26th of this month.  They are not having a very big wedding with
just their children and parents there.   I am going to go out to Terry's this
afternoon to help him set a door and install a cabinet top.  Tomorrow all the
family will get together at Terry's for dinner, so tomorrow will be a busy day
also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>July 13, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Yesterday you told about the man who came to
your door looking for a neighbor and when he saw your badge started asking you
questions about why you are there and about the church.  Tears were running
down dad's and my face as we read about how our special son was able to change
this man's heart by answering his questions, explaining the gospel - backed up
by scripture and bearing your testimony.  We're so proud of you.  And when he
called you friend and gave you a firm handshake.  I'll bet you were sad in a
way to be transferred and not to able to teach this man.  I'm sure he will be
sad also.  I hope the missionaries that teach him will have the spirit like you
do and be able to finish what you planted.  I hope Dad &amp; I can go on a
mission also someday.  The experiences you are having are so great and do bring
such joy when you bring souls unto Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Guess what Dad &amp; I did for our
date this week?  We went to &quot;Fiddler On The Roof&quot;  at the ampha
theater at the Layton Park.  We went Friday night, but got rained out so they
told everyone to save our ticket stubs and come another night.  We went last
night as the weather was good.  Dennis Ferrin directed it and also did the set
design - so you know it was great.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Yesterday, dad and I sure enjoyed being
together.  We were both busy, but we were together - so it was great.  We slept
in until 7:00 a.m., then dad fixed breakfast while I started cleaning the
house.  After breakfast, dad started working at the computer on his letters to
get out to the members of our stake who are fulfilling temple assignments on
July the 17th.  He finally got all the reports from the wards on who are going
from their ward - so he could compile it and then get letters out to all of
them.  I think we explained to you before about how the Ogden Temple
has changed from doing assignments various times during the year from various
wards and stake - to just having two stake temple days a year and on those days
we are to have 95 men &amp; women in the morning and 95 in the afternoon.  They
do sealings, baptisms &amp; confirmations, initiatory and endowments - all in
the same day.  Dad &amp; I went last time and it was great.  We really felt the
spirit and enjoyed doing it all.  It's a great experience.  We had so many comments
about how everyone loved it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Anyway, back to what we did on Saturday - dad
spent all day doing that, except for when he needed to get stake letterhead
paper and envelopes from the stake and I went with him.  I had papers to take
to all of the ward relief society presidents - so he drove while I ran them in
to these presidents, we then went to the stake house to get his paper &amp;
envelopes and then went grocery shopping together.  It was great.  He is so
neat.  He kept telling me how pretty I was and how he enjoyed being with me.  A
woman always likes to hear those things, and, of course, I love being with him
and told him so.  We came back and got something to eat, then he went back to
the computer and I went back to cleaning house and doing laundry.  I did have
time to finish getting my pictures organized in the spare bedroom.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I don't know if I told you or not, but you have
inspired me to have family pictures up all throughout the house.  Remember I
had each of the married families represented in Dad &amp; my bedroom on the
different walls.  Well, after Irven &amp; Sandy moved, I decided to extend that
- so in the computer room I have the daughter's pictures and their families.  I
got white frames for Sandi and her family and got more mauve frames for Shellie
and her family.  I have all of their family pictures on the walls plus I took
apart my photo albums and the pictures I had in the large picture frames which
hold multiple pictures of various sizes in - and I bought more of those frames
which hold various sized pictures and have one for each family.  In the spare
bedroom (next to the computer room) are the son’s pictures.  Mike &amp; his
family are on one wall, they have blue frames.  David &amp; Shauna on another,
they have brown frames.  Scott &amp; Michelle on another with gold frames and
you on the 4th wall.  When you get married, I'll get a different colored frame
for you - probably green (if I can find them. - I'll probably start looking and
get them before then)  It looks neat.  I decorated with something they made or
gave me.  In Dad's &amp; my bedroom are all the family pictures  - since we
started having family pictures taken.  I love my family and love to be able to
see all the pictures of them on our walls. I think you will like them too - I'm
sure you will, since you love pictures so much.  All of us wish you had left
the family pictures &amp; others on the wall in front of your bed.  We have
left the others there.  At this point we think we will still be in this house
when you return.  I hope so.  I really love this house, and it would be nice
for you to return to the home you left from.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Uncle Roy &amp; Aunt Linda are up - so Uncle
Bob decided we should all get together so he invited Uncle Irven &amp; Aunt
Bernice, Aunt Wilma &amp; Uncle Lee &amp; their families, Uncle Rich &amp; Aunt
Lois &amp; their family, Aunt Margaret's daughters - Cheryl &amp; Terry &amp;
their families and all of us and our families.  Only Sandi, Scott &amp;
Michelle are coming from our family, but that's OK as we were all together last
weekend.  David &amp; Shauna are on vacation in Montana. We had a great time
visiting with family members and the weather was great - it was a beautiful
day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>July 22, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am sorry that I am so late getting this letter
written.  Sunday started with preparing a talk, attending a Ward Correlation
meeting at 9 A.M., attending the Chapel Park Ward at 11
 A.M. and giving my talk, although I only had 5 or 6 minutes to talk, then we
had dinner at 1 P.M..  Mom had invited Nicky and Anna over to eat with us. 
Mike, Becky, David and Taylor came up just to visit.  At 4
 P.M. I had a priesthood ordination to conduct.  David came over in the evening
and with all the company, we never got to bed until after mid-night.  It was
great though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Last Friday morning Uncle Bob, Uncle Roy, David,
Scott and I went fishing.  We went up to Woodland where we camped at the Camper
World located there.  We fished most of that day catching about 8 nice fish. 
Saturday morning we went up to the Uinta's and tried there.  We caught a few
small ones and let them lose.  Finally quit shortly after noon
and came home.  We had a good time being together anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Monday evening I was late getting home from
work, which wasn't good for Mom had invited our new neighbors over for supper. 
They bought Candices's home.  Their last name is Beare and his name is Bobby,
but I don't remember her's.  They are a young couple, expecting their first
baby in two weeks.  They are not members of the Church, so we have some work
there to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This evening we tried to drive down to a
wholesale place where Nicky's father said we could buy Sandi and Terry some
canning equipment for their wedding gift.  I left work at 3
 P.M., coming home and taking a quick shower.  Picked Mom up at </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4 P.M. from work and started for 11660 S. State.  We hit the
  Salt Lake traffic and at 5 P.M., at which time the place closes, due to
traffic we were at 7200 South State.  We stopped and ate at Denny's then came
home.  We are not sure what to do now about the gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Other that busy as you see, we are doing ok.  I
had to have a root canal done on one of my front teeth last week, but that is
ok now.  I had some spots froze on my face the same afternoon, that the Dr.
felt needed to be removed for fear that they could turn to skin cancer.  Mom is
well and after we got back from our wild goose chase, went over to see Grandma
Porter.  Grandma just returned from a trip up to Alaska to see Uncle Terry's
family today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>July 27, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We've had a busy week, as usual, but a <u>great
week</u>.  I only worked Monday &amp; Tuesday because they were moving Data Processing
out into the new building - so there wouldn't be power in our building and they
told us we had the day off.  We also had the 24th &amp; 25th off (holiday). 
Sandi was moving the first part of the week.  We couldn't go out to help her as
neither dad nor I felt we could take Monday or Tuesday off - dad has had to
take several days off - fishing trip, when he was down with his back etc.  So
David is off work now - laid off because the center is closing.  (He's getting
paid severance pay - &amp; it will pay up until the time he needs to start
school at ISU in Pocatello - so he's glad)  Anyway, I mentioned to him that
Sandi could use some help, so he went out Monday &amp; they got most of it
done.  She had to stay at Terry's house on Tuesday as they had people coming,
so Wednesday I went out and finished helping her move and then clean her
apartment.  I left shortly after 8:00 a.m. and didn't get home until after 7:00
- so I was tired, but glad I could help her and I enjoyed visiting &amp; being
with her.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            On Thursday I had planned to go down to Grandma
Porter's and watch the parade on TV with her, and watch for Nicky's float and
then help Grandma with housework, weeding, etc., but dad needed me to do some
typing for him, so I turned on the TV in our bedroom and tried to listen to
when Taylorsville's float would come.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Friday morning, I quickly did a hit &amp; miss
job of cleaning house and doing laundry so I could go down to Grandma Porter's
to do some weeding and straighten her house.  She is leaving on a cruise with Uncle
Kim &amp; Aunt Jeanenne on Sunday.  I took dad's lunch to him and saw the house
he is just completing.  It is really nice (of course - dad wouldn't do anything
but the best).  Friday afternoon I spent getting games ready, prizes wrapped,
baking &amp; cooking to get ready for the shower I gave Kristy on Saturday
morning and the potato salad I made to take to Sandi's wedding Saturday
afternoon.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left about 4:00
 p.m. to go to Becky's parents where they had invited us to come to a barbecue
before going to the sesquicentennial celebration at cougar stadium.  They had
given Mike &amp; Becky 2 extra tickets two months ago and said they could
invite who they wanted.  They invited us.  It was so fantastic.  The First
Presidency were there and, of course, they honored them.  They had youth, in
white pants and either pink, blue, or yellow tee shirts, run in carrying a huge
garland.  There were two groups of them, one on each side of a large pathway
from one entrance of the stadium to a huge platform in the middle of the stadium. 
Then the tabernacle choir started singing &quot;We Thank Thee Oh God For A
Prophet&quot; and Pres. Hinckley holding on to two young children's hands
walked along the pathway.  On the huge screen, it showed his great grandfather,
and told about how he lost his wife and one child with cholera and buried them
along the plains.  Of course, everyone was on their feet, singing and
applauding.  It was so powerful, so electrifying.  I am so thankful for this
great man - our prophet. They reenacted the restoration, the pioneers crossing
the plains and the trials they had, they had the BYU Folk Dancers dance native
dances from most of the country's of the world.  They had 4 platforms (one
facing each of the bleachers in the stadium)  The groups would perform on one platform
and then run to the next, and they kept doing that until each group had
performed on each platform.  They were in the original costumes.  It was
great.  At the end, they had all of the missionaries from the MTC run in
singing &quot;Called to Serve&quot; and carrying flags from the countries they
were going to.  They were 10 deep all around the stadium.  Everyone immediately
stood and started singing with them and applauding.  It was so incredible.  I
sure thought of you.  Mike leaned over and said &quot;Just think, if we had all
the missionaries who are serving throughout the world, they would almost fill
this entire stadium.&quot; (The stadium holds 65 thousand.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We stayed the night at Mike &amp; Becky's, and
the next morning, Mike left at 5:00 a.m. to go up to our place where he met
David and they went golfing.  We brought Becky &amp; the children up when we
came at 7:30.  I quickly finished getting things ready for Kristy's shower
while dad made breakfast.  Becky took Taylor and went over early with me to Georgia's where we had the shower.  It was fun and turned out good.  Kristy got a lot of
nice things. Robert was there and helped me put the food on the plates.  He
seems really nice and he and Kristy are sure in love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Since Shauna &amp; Michelle went to the shower
also, David &amp; Scott were at our home with Dad, Mike &amp; little David. 
Dad helped Mike make a bed for his truck so they can pack items underneath it
and put a mattress on top of it, for when they go camping, etc..  David, little
David &amp; Scott watched a John Wayne video.  We all went over to get a Big
Ben hamburger &amp; shake for lunch and took it to Layton park to eat.  Dad
&amp; I got ready &amp; left to go to Sandi's wedding &amp; left the rest of
the family playing cards.  Scott &amp; Michelle left to go home as she had
cleaning &amp; laundry to do while Scott studied for a Priesthood lesson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Wedding was great.  The only thing better
would be a &quot;Temple Wedding&quot; and I'll still hope &amp; pray for that. 
Terry's sons &amp; their wives are great.  They are really active in the church
&amp; neat couples - they would fit in with our family.  They each have a
little girl and are expecting another child shortly.  Terry's mother is really
special too.  We had a good visit with her.  The Bishop gave them some good
advice.  Troy, Terry's one son cooked steak and chicken breasts, and we had
salads and Sandi's good rolls, and then wedding cake.  The weather was great. 
Chelci sand two songs for them.  JaNae seemed really happy &amp; both girls
looked really pretty - and Sandi surely did.  We took lots of pictures - so
we'll get them developed and send you some.  Sandi &amp; Terry were really
happy.  I think they will have a happy life together.  With remodeling his
duplex and adding a bedroom &amp; bathroom for Chelci in the basement, they
have really gotten to know each other.  He says she is really a
&quot;worker&quot; (we already knew that) and he really appreciates her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got home around 10:30
and Mike, Becky &amp; the children and David &amp; Shauna were still here just
finishing watching the end of a video.  We brought Chelci home with us and she
went to stay with David &amp; Shauna for a couple of days, and then Scott &amp;
Michelle and the rest of the week with us - while Sandi &amp; Terry are on
their honeymoon to Montana.  JaNae is down at Shellie's.  She flew down this
morning.  She will stay there a week.  Chelci just got back from there.  She
stayed two weeks &amp; had a great time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Today (Sunday) David, Shauna &amp; Chelci and
Scott &amp; Michelle came for dinner at 2:00.  They stayed until about 7:00. 
We watched part of the sescocenntennial celebration that was videotaped and
shown on TV.  We played &quot;Seven's&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot; &amp;
&quot;Rummy&quot; for awhile, then relaxed while I read your last 3 letters to
them.  Dad &amp; I were really tired so we laid down for a nap and slept until 9:30. 
Dad is still asleep for the night, but I woke and decided to finish your letter
so I can get it off tomorrow.  I started it this morning before church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got a letter from Larry &amp; Tammy
Braithwaite a week ago Saturday, telling us that they had apostatized from the
church.  I wasn't going to tell you while you were on your mission, but David
thought we should.  It was really sad for Dad &amp; I as we read this 3 page
typewritten letter which they sent to their close friends &amp; family telling
us how they have spent the last four years and $10,000 researching the church
and they have found it to be false.  That our leaders have deceived us and they
don't want to be in a church which isn't true.  They went to their Bishop &amp;
he sent them to their stake president.  They asked to have their names removed
from the records of the church.  Since they sent their documentation &amp; a
letter to each of their children telling of this, and they wouldn't consent to
give up this documentation to the Stake Presidency - as they want to give it to
others, and they don't believe the prophet to be a true prophet - they were
excommunicated.  (They apostatized).  Some of the things they state in their
letter - Meadow Mountain Massacre, etc., come from anti-mormon literature - so
we think they got ahold of some of that and since their testimony wasn't strong
as they had decided they didn't want to go to church and hold positions, they
were going the way of the world - Satan could get control of them.  It has
really been hard for Dad &amp; I to have this happen.  We have written them a
letter back and bore our testimonies to them.  Hope it will do some good, but
guess they have their agency.  I think of you out there working hard and
converting people, and here they are leaving the church after 36 years where
they have been temple workers, Larry has served in a bishopric twice &amp;
Tammy has been a Relief Society President.  It is so sad.  It goes to show that
we have to be so careful and always stay close to the Lord by going to church,
keeping his commandments, prayer, study of the scriptures, etc. to keep our
testimonies alive and growing.  In the letter they say that some of their
children understand and some do not.  I am sure that the ones who are active do
not, and I am sure it is so hard for them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>August 3, 1997</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Both Mom and I worked long hours last week,
trying to get things done so we can take a vacation next week. We are excited
to be going on vacation next week.  We will go to Mike and Becky's tomorrow
evening and leave from there Tuesday morning.  David, Shauna, Sandi, Chelci and
(hopefully) JaNae will meet us Tuesday morning at Mike's.  From there we will
go to Cedar City and up the canyon from there to Navajo Lake.  Scott &amp;
Mishelle will come down on Wednesday evening and Shellie and Roy will also come
Wednesday evening.  We will just have our family together (just missing YOU)
until Friday afternoon when we will go back to lodge for the Bushnell Family
reunion.  We're excited but will miss you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Yesterday Mike, Becky &amp; the children, Scott
&amp; Mishelle and Mom &amp; I went to Nicky's where her Father showed us his
garden and shelter.  We had a lot of fun and found it very interesting.  We
bought some sanitation supplies and a water purifier.  After Glen showed us
around, we had a barbecue and enjoyed visiting.  It was fun to be with Nicky. 
She is sure a special girl and a sweetheart.  When we got home, Sandi and Terry
came to get Chelci, as they returned from their Honeymoon.  They had a great
time as they went up to Montana and Canada. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As you see I didn't get this letter finished
yesterday.  Uncle Irven and Aunt Sandy invited us over for dinner, then we
played games and visited after.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are not sure if Mom told you the bad news we
got a couple of weeks ago or not.  I feel you would like to know, so will
explain.  Larry and Tammy sent us a letter informing us that they have been
excommunicated from the Church for Apostasy.  They claim that they have found
information that the Church Leaders have kept hidden from the members and can
no longer feel good about belonging to the Church.  What information they
indicated to in their letter is things I have known about for years.  Some of
it I also recognize as coming from anti-mormon literature.  Their letter did
not really surprise me, but was very sad.  I have written them in reply to
their letter, but do not know if it will help or not.  I believe the real
problem comes from pride and trying to justify ones actions.  I have seen this
coming for a long time, but thought Tammy was stronger than that.  Very, very
sad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>August 19, 1997  Letter to Jeff from Dad</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>              Last week was a busy week, just trying to
catch up with taking a week off work to go on our vacation.  The vacation was
wonderful so it was worth it.  Also last Friday Mom and I took off work so we
could attend Kristy's wedding.  It was at the Salt Lake Temple and Hartman
Rector Jr. performed the sealing.  It was just wonderful to be there and hear
the counsel that he gave.  Both Mom and I had tears, with thinking of what
Larry and Tammy have given up.  The news of their excommunication has really
been hard to take.  I called them last night and tried to talk to them, but
Larry wouldn't let me defend or give rebuttal to anything he told us.  It was
just like trying to talk to a Jehovah Witness, they won't argue but gust change
to subject when you do not agree with them.  I was on the phone with him for 1
½ hours, and got nowhere.  Anyway the wedding was beautiful and pictures were
after.  We then went to the Bridal Breakfast at the Della Fontana on Fourth
East.  In the evening we went to the reception and enjoyed visiting with family
and friends.  Sandi, Terry, JaNae and Chelci came to the reception.  Sandi is
sure happy now.  Besides work last week, we also tried to help Scott and
Mishelle move out of Uncle Verle and Aunt Beth's home.  On Saturday we helped
David and Shauna move out of their place, ready to go to Pocatello.  They drove
up to Pocatello on Monday, with Shauna's parents going up with them to help. 
Scott and Mishelle are staying with us this week and will move into David and
Shauna's old apartment on Saturday.  Mom and I will be flying down to Shellie
and Roy's on Friday for Garrett's Baptism on Saturday.  Garrett asked Mom to
speak on baptism and me to speak on the Gift of The Holy Ghost.  The way this
week is going my talk will probably be prepared like it was on Sunday, I had to
speak in the Fiddler Creek Ward and had given it some thought but really didn't
write it until Sunday morning and then I completely changed it when I gave it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>              We got your tape for Nicky and Mom is taking
it to her tomorrow evening.  Actually Nicky is meeting Mom at the Church
 Office Building and Nicky will go with Mom and our Ward Relief Society on a
Church Flower Garden tour.  That will give them some time together anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are all well and hope that the same goes for
you.  We want you to know how pleased with the work you are doing and the fine
son you are.  You are in our prayers and thoughts constantly.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We sure love you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 48 – MY FEELINGS  as
recorded 10/4/97 and  thereafter</span> </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have really been blessed by being born into a
home where there is love of family and love of the Lord.  I am so thankful for
my wonderful parents who set such a good example for their family.  I am
thankful for wonderful brothers &amp; a sister who I love and respect and am
thankful for their love.  They have married wonderful spouses and have special
families and we all enjoy each other and love to be together.  I am so thankful
to be blessed with such a wonderful husband who honors his priesthood, loves
the Lord, loves me and our children.  He is a hard worker, honest in all he
does, enjoys helping others, enjoys being with his family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I feel he &amp; I have one of the best marriages
that there are.  We aren’t perfect - we still get unhappy with each other once
in a while, but not very often.   When we do, we talk and work it out, or just
get over it.  We want to be together forever so we strive to keep our temple
covenants and do what’s right.  We make mistakes as everyone does, but we hope
we learn from our mistakes and keep trying to do better. Ken &amp; I have a lot
in common - we both love to dance.  Our first date was to the Stake Sweetheart
Ball and we have danced every since.  We were in the “All Church Dance
Festival” the year before we were married.  That was a marvelous experience. 
We were ward dance directors while we were living in Sunset in our apartment. 
Ken was working nights a lot of the time so it was mainly me teaching the
youth.  Ken &amp; I were in a Regional Dance Festival while we were living in
Grantsville.  That was GREAT too.  We squared danced for a couple of years. 
The name was the &quot;Double J Rustlers&quot;.  We really had a lot of fun. 
We met at an elementary school in Ogden.  We met a lot of nice people, I made
several square dance dresses and Ken some shirts or we bought his.  Square
dancing is something you can do which is such good exercise and such great
fun.  You forget all about any problems you have at home or elsewhere, just
concentrate on what the caller is saying and have fun.  We have missed it, but
felt at the time that since we were dancing at least once a week, we couldn’t
leave the children to do other things that we wanted to do also - go to the
temple, visit family &amp; friends, and other activities - so we quit.  We are
thinking of starting up again.  In fact, Aunt Wilma brought all her square
dance dresses down for me at the family reunion we held at Bob’s in June.  I
thought she was giving them to me, but I ended up paying her $10 a dress for 18
dresses and $10 a full slip for 4 slips so $220.00 - so I better start square
dancing as I can’t afford to lose that money.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken &amp; I go dancing every chance we get -
ward &amp; stake dances (there aren’t very many anymore), Red Flame Restaurant
in Bountiful.  They have a dance floor and live bands on Friday &amp; Saturday
nights.  And we belong to a dance club (Varianne) which meets once a month in
the ballroom at Weber State University.  They have live bands &amp; orchestras
too plus door prizes, decorations and refreshments.  Georgia &amp; Rick are
members also and Irven &amp; Sandy have come with us a few times.  Scott &amp;
Michelle are planning to come with us and perhaps join.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            Ken loves to fish &amp; hunt, but there isn’t
very good fishing &amp; hunting in Utah - so he has about given it up.  He has
gone to Idaho a few times with our boys or his brothers.  He &amp; I used to go
some and I would read while he fished.  Jeff went with us a few times.  <b>When
we got home from our mission to the Philippines, we bought a nice fishing boat.</b> 
It’s not too small and not too large, it’s just right for us.  We can take
seven people with us and the motor can troll while we fish or go fast to pull
toys behind.  <b>We have had lots of fishing trips.  Ken and I usually go to
East Canyon Reservoir as the fishing is great there.</b>  We have taken
grandchildren there and some of our children have brought their families and we
camp and fish or just picnic and fish.  We have gone there with my cousin, <b>Randy
and his wife, Judy</b>.  They have an RV so they take it and we pull the boat. 
We have gone to Strawberry reservoir with them too.  They have a cabin up in
the Unitas and Randy has paid Ken to do work on it.  One Summer when our
grandson, David, was fifteen and a strong young man, Ken took him, Taylor and
myself and we stayed for several days while Ken and David reshingled their
steep roof.  That was really a scary and hard job, but they did it.  Taylor and
I had fun going for walks, riding Randy’s 4 wheeler, making meals, playing
games and visiting.  Randy &amp; Judy invited us to stay with them a couple of
times up there too and it was fun.  Since Randy was almost blind at the time,
he had large playing cards and if he sat just right so the light could help
him, he could play cards with us.  Ken has taken Randy fishing many times.  <b>They
sometimes go to East Canyon and sometimes at Strawberry Reservoir.  We have
gone with Sandi and Nick to Fish Lake in Southern Utah</b>.  It is my favorite
place to go fishing.  It is so beautiful there with pine trees right next to
the lake and all around it and up the mountains.  The camping areas are so
pretty too.  The first time we went, Chelci had Nathan early so Sandi wasn’t
able to go, but Nick wanted to go anyway.  They hadn’t been married very long
so we really didn’t know Nick very well, but this was a great way to get to
know him.  We all stayed in our tent trailer.  Nick pulled it, while we pulled
the boat.  Nick is a great guy and helped with everything and we all had fun
together and caught lots of fish.  Sandi and Nick have gone with us two or
three times, plus once at Flaming Gorge.  Nick had the idea of having our kids 
and spouses go in on a paid fishing tour guide who could almost guarantee a
large (LARGE) fish.  Nick paid for one too so he and Ken could go together. 
They ended up taking Sandi &amp; I and we stayed in camp the day they went out
with the guide.  Ken didn’t catch one, but Nick did.  We had a family vacation
at Bear Lake and we took our boat and Big Mable (our water toy) and David &amp;
Shauna brought their boat, so we all had a great time, fishing, water skiing or
playing on Big Mable &amp; other water toys.  We rented a large home there with
several bedrooms and hideabeds.  It was a fun place.  We took turns fixing the
meals and we played games and visited there also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We love to camp.  That has been mainly what we
have done for family vacations and we continue to do that with our married
children and their families.  This year we all went to <b>Ti-ah campground up
Cedar Canyon.  We camped there for three days then went to the big extended
Bushnell Reunion at the College Lodge up Cedar Canyon.</b>  Ken &amp; I bought
a tent trailer from my brother, Bryce, several years ago for $400.00.  Boy,
have we ever gotten our money’s worth.  I wouldn’t sell the tent trailer for
anything.  (Well, unless we had the money to buy a trailer or RV - but I
wouldn’t unless we had the money for gas also as they take a lot more fuel) The
tent trailer sleeps six people and it is roomy and open.  We have really
enjoyed it.  Mom &amp; Dad bought a membership in <b>Camperworld s</b>everal
years ago - so Ken &amp; I have enjoyed going to the various campsites where
they have pools, hot tubs, tennis courts, clubhouses, playgrounds, nice
bathroom &amp; showers, etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken likes me to read good books to him while
we travel</b>.  I also enjoy doing that and we have read lots of good books
that way.  One of the books we read was Pres. Hinckley's book (His Biography). 
Pres. Hinckley is such a great prophet.  He is so amazing.  He didn't want this
book written on him, but too many others pressured him to let it be written -
to help the saints.  It is surely a help - he is such an inspiration and great
example.  Ken &amp; I can hardly put the book down.  Sister Sherri Dew, the 2nd
counselor of the General Relief Society Presidency, was the person who wrote
the book.  She also did the life story of one of the other prophets.  We also
read the Ensigns and scriptures.  We take a book, Ensign or the scriptures with
us even if we are just going to the store or to visit our Moms or anywhere.  It
is surprising how much it accumulates when we just read 10 or 15 minutes here
and there, and when we go to Provo or on trips we really get a lot read. We
used to sing as we traveled, but then started reading - so our voices aren’t as
good anymore - we mainly only sing at church.  My parents always sang as they
traveled and I grew up learning my parent’s good old songs.  I have them on
this history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We want our family forever also.  We may be
prejudiced, but we feel we have the best children, their spouses and
grandchildren that there are.  We are so thankful for them.  They are good,
talented and wonderful children and have been blessed with wonderful spouses. 
We couldn't have picked out better ones.  We are so thankful for each of them. 
Ken &amp; I love our grandchildren and enjoy being with them.  We hope we set a
good example for them and we hope they will always know of our love for each of
them and want to come to visit Grandpa &amp; Grandma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Ken and I have not been as wise as we should
have with regard to financial decisions, although, we have tried to be frugal</b>. 
We don't feel we waste money, or are extravagant.  We take care of our
furniture and belongings; we have usually had a garden and canned, frozen,
&amp; dried fruits and vegetables.  We have involved the children in this. 
Both Ken &amp; I have made home made bread - partly to save money and partly
because we liked it better.  I have cut Ken's hair and our boy's hair since
they were little and when they married, most of their wives took over (at least
if our sons were wise in how they handled it the first time.)  When we would go
over ways to save money, we found we were already doing most, if not all, the
things that were suggested.  We haven't bought expensive furniture, clothes,
jewelry, make-up, taken many vacations, etc. We have tried to always have at
least partial food storage.  <u>But we haven't saved like we should have and we
have moved many times.</u>  Someone has said that three moves is like a burnout
(a fire destroying all your assets).  I know it is really expensive.  I blame
myself partially for this.  My dad worked at the Arsnal (which became part of
Hill Air Force Base) for 28 years.  He hated it.  He worked with men who had
foil language, smoked, drank, etc. and he didn't like his work either.  He
wanted to quit several times, but Mom wouldn't let him as she reminded him that
they needed the benefits, retirements, etc. that he was building up.  I
remember one time dad wanting to quit and sell Beneficial Life Insurance full
time.  He had been selling part-time and was doing better than most full-time
salesmen.  Again, Mom, said &quot;no&quot;.  I couldn't understand that.  I
felt he should be able to do what he wanted since he was the breadwinner, and I
determined that when I married, my husband would be able to do whatever he
wanted with his occupation.  Consequently, Ken did change jobs frequently, and
for the most part I supported him.  Ken is a perfectionist, is very talented
and a logical thinker - so whatever he did, he did well - whether he was a
computer operator, programmer, data processing manager, carpenter, contractor,
farmer, etc.  He did go into sales a few times - insurance, cabinets, etc., but
he didn't enjoy being a salesman.  One of the problems Ken had was that he
expected a lot of himself and he produced excellent results - and he also
expected a lot of others, and they didn't always come through.  We are all
different and for one reason or another (personality, not as talented, not
caring, dishonesty, feeling their way was right and not wanting to change, etc)
they wouldn't perform like Ken expected them to so he would get upset with
them, criticize them and many times end up quitting his job.  Thus we moved
around a lot.  Ken has gained a lot of experience, but he feels a failure in
not having built up any retirement or savings for the future. Another reason
Ken hasn’t made much money in his occupation of building - was that he was too
good to the people.  He wanted to be fair and not cheat them, so he cheated
himself.  I am proud of him and would surely rather be poor and have a good,
honest, charitable husband than be rich and have a dishonest, greedy and
selfish man for a husband.  We haven’t been poor - we have struggled most of
the time, but we’ve had plenty to eat, wear and had nice homes to live in. 
I’ve had a wonderful life and have been very blessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One of the hardest things for Ken was having me
go to work.  He never wanted his wife to have to work.  I didn't work from the
time Sandi was born until we had major financial problems in Arizona the last
time we were there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Hale’s Theatre </b>– We had season tickets one year to
their plays, plus we have gone other times.  For several years <b>to celebrate
Ken &amp; Irven’s birthdays</b> (which are only 3 days apart), us two couples
would go to dinner and then to a play at Hale’s Theatre</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1997 Christmas letter</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another year has swiftly passed by bringing us
some good experiences and some not so good.  This life is full of ups and
downs, but we have to make the most of it and enjoy life.  I've learned over
the years that attitude really makes a difference.  Some people are very happy
even though they have many problems in this life, and other people are
miserable when it seems they have everything that should make them happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our oldest child, <b>Sandi,</b> has been married
for over 16 years and recently divorced her husband.  She hasn't been happy, so
we hope the future will be brighter.  We continue to pray for her and her
daughters JaNae &amp; Chelci and also Dave.  Divorce is never easy.  Sandi and
Dave have joint custody of the girls, but Chelci is living with her mom and
JaNae with her dad.  JaNae is a cheerleader at Grantsville High.  Sandi is the
head cook at Harris Elementary in Tooele and has an apartment right next door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Shellie</b> &amp; Roy have two little boys,
Garrett age 6 and Quint age 2.  Shellie is expecting their third son in April. 
Shellie, like Becky, doesn't work outside the home, but is kept busy with her
family and being in the Young Women's presidency.  I flew down to visit a
couple of weeks ago and surely enjoyed my week there.  It was so relaxing and
fun to just read stories to the boys and play games with them.  There are
several man-made lakes in the area where they live, and it's so beautiful and
the weather so wonderful that we went on several walks and to the parks, etc. 
Shellie and Roy couldn't have been better to me, it was a great week.  The only
thing which could have made it better was for Ken to have been there also.  He
had too much work at the mall and had used his vacation time building an
apartment for his Mom in his brother, Bob's basement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Mike</b>, Becky and their two little ones,
David age 4 and Taylor age 1 live in Inverness, Montana.  Mike teaches special
education in both the elementary and high schools there.  He also does some
coaching in athletics, especially football.  Becky doesn't work outside the
home and it's a good thing because she is the Relief Society President in their
ward so between that and the two children, she keeps pretty busy.  They really
enjoy the small town atmosphere.  They were down this summer, for most of the
summer, and we got to enjoy them quite often on the weekends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>David </b>&amp; Shauna live in Clearfield.  David is going to school full time at Weber and will graduate this summer. 
He is in the medicine field, so even though he will have his four year degree,
he still has lots of schooling ahead.  He gets good grades so is fortunate to
have scholarships to pay his tuition.  He also works part-time at the FHP lab
in Ogden.  Shauna is a nurse and has been working at the Davis South
 Hospital in Bountiful, however, she just accepted a position at the McKay
 Dee Hospital so will start there right away.  David &amp; Shauna are both
secretaries.  David in the Young Men's presidency and Shauna in the young
women's.         </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Scott</b> returned from his mission to Venezuela in May.  We were excited to have him home again, and so was his girl friend,
Mishelle, who waited for him.  They are engaged at the present and would like
to marry, but they had some sad news shortly after his return.  She had had a
cough for several months and finally the doctor took a chest x-ray and found
cancer in her lungs.  She is undergoing chemotherapy at the present.  These
treatments will last until at least March.  Even though it is tough, she has a
lot of faith and a good attitude and is determined to beat it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Jeff,</b> our youngest, is a senior at Layton
High.  He works part-time at the 5 points mall in Bountiful where his dad is
the maintenance director.  That works out pretty good since with Jeff being so
involved in music and drama at the high school, Ken works with him to have time
off when he needs it.  He is especially busy this time of year with
performances just about every evening and weekends.  They just finished a play
a couple of weeks ago and now their singing groups are performing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I changed jobs this summer.  I left Lincoln
Elementary to be the secretary of Staff Development at the district office. 
Claudia Seeley is the Director of Staff Development and my boss.  She's great
to work for, plus my first principal, Sandy Petersen, is the liaison between
the University of Utah and the district and one of my boss's also.  It's great
to be working with her again - she's wonderful.  I like what I do, but it's a
very busy department, so to keep up, I work long hours which I would prefer to
be at home with my family.  Hopefully, I can get it better organized so I won't
be working long hours.  I'm still in the Stake Relief Society Presidency so I
appreciate Ken &amp; the boys helping me with the house work &amp; meals.  Ken
is still in the High Council and enjoys it except for the speaking
assignments.  I think he does a good job at this, but he would prefer letting
others do the speaking.  I feel that way about my position also, but guess we
learn from doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>1999 - Jeff </b><u>came home
from his mission in January 1999,</u> and we were excited to have him home.  He
hasn’t told us a lot about his mission, but from what he has said, he had a
hard mission, but he stuck it out and did his best under very trying
circumstances and we are proud of him.  <b>He also had another hard trial.  His
girlfriend, Nicky</b>, who he had planned to break up with before leaving on
his mission, but felt the Lord told him she was the one for him, so he didn’t
break up with her and he expected her to wait for him.  She did wait up until the
last few months and ended up getting married two days after he returned home. 
Her family loved Jeff and felt she was making a big mistake.  Nicky’s friends
were getting married and she wanted to also.  She was dating a guy who had
graduated from college, had a good job and could afford to buy Nicky a home.  
I think she knew that Jeff would have to go to college and she would need to
work to help him get through with his education, so I think that was a big part
of it.  She used her free agency.  Free agency is a gift from God and he allows
us all to use it.  It was really hard on Jeff.   It was hard on all of us.  It
is really hard when your children are hurting, and you can’t do much about
it.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jeff didn’t date again for quite a
while.  He went to Weber State University in Accounting.  He got good grades so
got scholarships and was on the Honors program.  They had a trip to go with
doctors, nurses and dentists to Nepal.  He had been working so paid the money
and went with them.  It was a trip of a life time and we were glad Jeff had
that experience.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jeff had known a girl from school,
Gail Fairbourn, who he said everyone liked to be around because she was cute
and lots of fun.  He dated her off and on, but didn’t seem to be too serious. 
Trent had come home from his mission and married Anna, and Ben had married a
cute girl.  We were working on our papers to put in to go on a mission and Ken
mentioned to Jeff that if he was thinking of getting married, that he better do
it right away as we would be gone for two years and we wanted to be here for
his wedding.  We turned in our papers and it asked when we would be available
to go and we had put FEBRUARY.  The next thing we knew was that Jeff told us he
and Gail were going to get married.  We asked when and he said the 20<sup>th</sup>
of February.  We thought “Oh no, we said that we would be available in
February.  We called the bishop and he hadn’t sent the papers on to the stake
president as he had been sick with phenomena and they were locked in his file
cabinet at the church.  He told us we could change the date from February to
March.  We were thankful and felt the Lord had a hand in that.  <b>Jeff and
Gail’s wedding was beautiful.  They were married in the Salt Lake Temple and
all our children and their spouses were able to be there.  I felt that it was
the most wonderful day of my life as Ken and I were in the temple with all our
children and their spouses.  I felt the presence of Mom &amp; Dad there too and
I knew they would be there if at all possible as they loved their children and
grandchildren – family was so important to them, as it is to me.  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Payson Lake – </b>Payson Lake is
located up the canyon behind the town of Payson which is close to American Fork
where Mike and his family live.  We heard about that canyon so wanted to camp
there.  It is a beautiful area and a beautiful small lake with a walking path
around it with areas to go down by the lake to fish or just sit and enjoy the
view.  It’s not big enough for boats, but many put rafts and canoes on it.  We
invited our family and most came with us.  We had a tent trailer, but the
others had tents.  We fixed meals and ate together, sat around the campfire and
roasted hot dogs and marshmallows and sang songs and visited.  We have a great
family and love to be together.  We have gone camping with our family to Payson
Lake several years.  One year David found a log sticking partway out of the
water and went onto it.  It was tricky trying to keep his balance, but he did
great!  Others wanted to try their luck, but some fell into the lake. 
Sometimes Mike took his raft and let us all take turns using it on the lake. 
That was fun.  One time Ken and I went alone and Mike let us take his raft. 
They came up one evening to have a Dutch oven dinner and spend the evening with
us.  That was fun.  One time Ken and I were there alone part of the week and we
took our float tubes.  That was fun at first until the wind carried us to the
other end of the Lake.  We kept trying to paddle back up or to the side, but we
wore ourselves out and it didn’t work.  When we got out at the other end of the
lake, we had to carry our float tubes back to the truck.  That was the last
time we used those float tubes.  If the air is perfectly still or you are
floating down a slow river to fish, they were alright.  They had belonged to
Sandi &amp; Terry, but after Terry died, Sandi gave them to her dad.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 47 -
GRANDCHILDREN: 1998  </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We enjoyed <b>David &amp; Taylor</b>.  They are
such cute little grandchildren - so well behaved, bright and fun to be with. 
Mike &amp; Becky are doing a good job of raising these children.  Sometimes I
feel Mike is too strict on them, but he loves them and both he &amp; Becky
teach them what's right and set a good example for them and are good parents. 
We are proud of them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Shellie &amp; Roy also have three such
well-behaved &amp; bright sons, <b>Garrett, Quint and Kevis</b>.  When we go
down to visit them, usually once or twice a year, we join with them in kneeling
for family prayer both night and morning.  We join with them in reading
scripture each night before bedtime, and we join with them in Family Home
Evening each week.  They take turns giving prayers, conducting, giving the
lesson, preparing the refreshments and planning games or other activities.  I
am amazed at the questions and comments they make.  They are being taught well
and are special children.  Shellie, takes the lead in seeing that these things
happen, and Roy is not always with them as he is doing projects, working late
or sleeping in, etc.  Shellie struggles with this, and we wish he was more
spiritual, but he is a good man and a good provider.  Shellie has the boys do
chores too, which is teaching them the value of work.  Since Roy is a good
provider, they go on trips, buy fun vehicles, games, etc., and have beautiful
homes.  I, and sometimes, Ken, have gone down to be with the boys while Shellie
&amp; Roy take vacations and that has been fun getting to be with these
grandsons which we don’t see as often as our grandchildren in Utah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Since I'm mentioning our grandchildren, I
wouldn't want to leave out <b>JaNae &amp; Chelci</b> either.  They are
beautiful girls, and it has been great watching them grow up and attending
their special events in life.  I'm proud of Sandi.  She loves her girls and has
done a lot for and with them.  I loved tending the girls when we lived in
Grantsville, but then we moved to Firth for a couple of years and then to
Arizona for nine months, but they came to visit us in Firth and we loved
visiting them.  Sandi brought the girls and came with Grandma Jensen once while
we were living there.  When we moved to Grandma Jensen’s, I had the girls come
for a week each summer and we would have fun going swimming, making cookies,
going to the Mall, playing games, etc.  We pray for each of our children and
grandchildren.  This is both an exciting and wonderful, yet frightening world
in which to live.  There is so much goodness, yet so much evil.  Satan has a
lot of power and we have to be so careful to stay on the straight and narrow
path which leads back to our Heavenly Father.  I pray that we can all make the
right decisions and live righteously so we can be an eternal family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            David &amp; Shauna had a beautiful baby son, <b>Tyler</b>,

children worrying about how to take care of our mom.  She wouldn’t come live
with us or Georgia &amp; Rick, she wanted to stay in her home.  We got her a medical
alert to wear around her neck to push if she fell as it would go to us and if
we didn’t answer, it would go to the police and they would come to help her. 
She wouldn’t wear it, so it wasn’t helpful<i>.  </i><i><span style='font-family:

out for her and fix meals for them and for mom.  Bryce’s daughter, Shanna was
married to Danny and they had a little daughter and son.  Danny was going to
college, so we thought it might help them out if they lived there rent free and
took care of Grandma.  They agreed and we told Mom.  She wasn’t very happy
about it as she said she wanted her privacy.  I got upset with her and told her
she was being selfish, that we were trying to help her and she wasn’t willing
to let us.  She finally agreed.  We told her we needed to clean out the
basement, but that we would put her stuff in a storage unit close by so she
could get her items if she needed them.  Georgia &amp; I told her that when we
came to clean out the basement, that she needed to stay upstairs.  One reason
is that we didn’t want her to fall coming down the stairs and the other reason
is that Mom is a horter and won’t throw anything away, and we needed to throw
some things away.  She said she would agree if we would wash her windows, wash
her curtains, clean her kitchen (which we did often anyway) and clean out her
fridge.  We agreed, but on the day we agreed on, Georgia was sick – so I had to
do it all.  Kim did come and wash her big picture window in the living room. 
When I finished and went down stairs to clean, I hadn’t been there long, when
she appeared down there.  She looked in the garbage can and found that I had
put some short strands of yarn, a empty thin plastic container that she had had
candy in, some miscellaneous small pieces of ribbon, etc.  She took them all
out and said she needed them.  I got upset and told her she didn’t need them,
that they were all junk and she couldn’t keep everything.  I was tired, so
finally left to go home.  Mom sure tests our patience at times.  We finally got
the basement cleaned out and Danny. Shanna &amp; children moved in.  Mom still
wasn’t very nice to them and Danny said “Your mom doesn’t want us here and we
don’t want to be here if she doesn’t want us.”  I got after mom and asked her
what we were going to do with her – did she want to go to a nursing home?  She
got upset and said “You hadn’t ever better put me there.”  I said “Well, what
are we going to do then?”  She was better to Danny &amp; Shanna after that and
before long when I would come over, I would see her sitting on the couch with
Breanna on one side of her and Tanner on the other, and she would be reading
them a story.  Other times I would see her playing catch with them.  She would
sit on the couch and they would stand a short ways away and she would throw
them a yarn ball (she made several of these) and they were all having fun.  One
day she said: “Mae, when Danny graduated, they will want to move and buy their
own home and then what will I do?”  I told Danny and Shanna and they said “We
won’t leave her.”  They knew she wouldn’t live long as Mom’s doctor told her
that she only had six months to live if she wouldn’t have a heart operation. 
She had told me that they said she would have to lie on her back for several
days after the heart operation and her back was so bad that she didn’t think
she could stand to do that as the pain would be too bad.  I told her I agreed
with her and didn’t think she could do it either.  Mom passed away before Danny
graduated.  I know the Lord had a hand in that also.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 48 – SPIRITUAL 
EXPERIENCES WITH MOM, PRIOR TO HER DEATH AND AFTERWARDS:.  </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>On May 22,1999,</b> I had a hard, yet
wonderful experience that I really felt Heavenly Father’s presence and guidance
- at least I realize now that he was at the “Helm” - he knew what was best.  My
mother, Mildred Porter, had had a bad week.  She was so weak, it was hard for
her to breath even with her oxygen, her stomach &amp; back hurt and she felt
awful.  She didn’t know what was happening, whether she had the flu or whether
it was just her health problems.  I took her into the doctor the week before as
she had a spot on her cheek which wouldn’t heal.  It was pre-cancer and Dr.
Erickson froze it off.  She also told him how her stomach had been hurting and
he told her it was because of her osteoporosis, she told him that she wondered
if she had a blatter infection as it hurt when she urinated.  He had her give
him a urine sample to be tested.  I wasn’t very impressed with him as he sure
isn’t very compassionate with old people, I have never liked him since I saw
how he treated dad that way.  Dad was not a complainer, but even when he needed
to go to the doctor, Dr. Ericksen acted like “Well, you’re an old man, go home
and die.”  Mom didn’t get much better; she was so weak that she didn’t take her
lasics for two days. (This makes her urinate frequently to get rid of the fluid
around her heart and lungs).  I told her I would come Thursday night and spend
the night with her.  I probably should have Wednesday night, but I felt like I
needed to help Ken get things ready to go to Idaho as he was taking two days
off to go and help David put in his sprinkling system.  And Jeff was home and I
needed to fix his lunch and make his breakfast the next morning as he leaves so
early for work.  I guess he could have made out OK, but I wanted to be home to
say goodbye to Ken and be there with Jeff and I had other things I needed to
do.  I stopped at the book store to pick up 2 books for Mom.  They are of
Sister Hinckley’s life and are excellent books.  She had me stop the week
before as she wanted to give Georgia and I the books, now she wanted them for
her daughter-in-laws.  I also stopped at Lincoln Elementary to visit with
Bonnie Olsen and Suzanne Moon who were retiring and JoAnn Spencer who was going
to another school.  They were teacher friends of mine while I was the head
secretary at Lincoln Elementary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             When I got there, I could tell Mom was very
weak so I got her some supper and then I weeded in her flower garden as she had
wanted me to do that.  I got her to bed about 10:00
and went to bed myself.  I got up once to take her to the bathroom.  I was late
getting to work because I felt I needed to be there to get Mom up and dressed
and get her some breakfast.  Shanna &amp; Danny are living in the basement.  It
helps them financially because he has been going to school, just now graduated
and is looking for a teaching position.  Shanna does mom’s laundry, gives her
meals as she cooks her families meals, takes her to the doctor sometimes, etc.,
but we still help out a lot.  Their little son, Tanner, doesn’t sleep well so
Shanna doesn’t get up until around 9:00 or 10:00 and mom doesn’t sleep well,
but still is ready to get up about 8:00, so that is a problem for Mom.  Anyway,
I got to work around 9:00.  I stopped and bought a few groceries and a pizza
for Jeff &amp; I and potato salad for Mom and took Mom some leftover
casserole.  I finally got her settled sometime after 11:00
 p.m.  I had just gotten to sleep when the phone rang.  It was the Layton City
Police asking if we owned a 91 Mercury which was registered to Glendon and
Mildred Porter.  I said “yes”.  She asked if I knew where it was.  I was
surprised at that, but I went in and asked Mom.  She was concerned about the
late phone call, hadn’t gone to sleep.  She said Bryce had it at his home.  I
told the dispatch and she asked what that address was.  When I told her, she
said the car was found at Valley View Dr. in Layton and the officer had
wondered if it was a stolen car.  She asked if I would call Bryce to see if it
was there.  I hated to wake them at that time of night, but decided I’d better
do it.  Deanna woke up and was startled and a little confused but finally said
that Chad &amp; Darin had taken it as they were hiking and camping.  That
solved the mystery so we all went back to bed.  I couldn’t go to sleep for
awhile, but slept until 6:00 a.m. when Mom called me.  I went in and she had
had an accident about 4:00 a.m.  She didn’t want to wake me that early so laid
in it for two hours as she was so weak she couldn’t take care of it herself.  I
felt bad that she had lain there like that.  I told her that was why I was over
there, I was there to help her.  After I cleaned her up, she said she felt she
needed to go to the hospital and asked me to call Deanna as Deanna had been
through this with her mother and Uncle Franz.  Mom said she had not slept at
all and her chest and back was hurting and she felt so weak and so lousy.  I
called Deanna and she came down.  We thought that we might need to put Mom in a
rest home since she was so weak and couldn’t take care of herself, and we
didn’t know how we could take care of her around the clock.  I work, Georgia
has a preschool, Bryce goes to work way out west of the Great Salt Lake and has
to stay 3 to 4 days at a time, Kim lives up in Morgan and wouldn’t be able to help
much as he has a young family, is the scoutmaster in his ward and is a
insurance agent for Beneficial Insurance and needs to work many nights.  And,
of course, Terry can’t help much with living up in Alaska.  I talked to Terry
and he felt bad, but I told him not to - but to pray as he has a lot of faith. 
Pray that whatever is best for mom and for us will happen.  We called one of
the rest homes in Clearfield.  They said a person has to be in the hospital for
3 days or Medicare won’t pay for anything.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We ended up calling 911 for an ambulance since
Mom was too weak to even get to the car for me to drive her to the hospital.  I
rode in the ambulance with her.  When we got there they hooked her up to
machines, took many tests and got her on medication.  She hadn’t been taking
her lasic as she felt too weak to make it to the bathroom.  They said that was
the problem and the nurse chewed mom out, saying that she had to take it no
matter what - as the fluids build up around the heart and it pushes it into the
lungs, etc.  Georgia was sick so couldn’t come, but Rick came.  Kim was on a
scout trip, but Jeanenne called up there and he came home and the two of them
came to the hospital.  This was a Saturday and Ken was still up at David’s
helping him with his sprinkling system.  We were at the hospital all morning. 
Mom’s heart had been filtrating (racing) and she had lots of fluid around her
heart making it hard for her to breathe and making her feel lousy and weak. 
They got her on high doses of Lasic and put her on medication to slow her heart
down.  Between the nurse and I, we kept putting the bedpan under mom and
emptying it.  They took her vitals and she was doing much better - so they said
we could take her home.  She ate some lunch there as she was so weak.  They
helped her into a wheelchair and took her out to Deanna’s car and we took her
home.  I had been concerned when they said she could come home since she was so
bad, but the insurances don’t want to pay for them to be in the hospital - so
they won’t admit them.  Dr. Erickson was out of town again, so we couldn’t talk
to him to have him admit her, so I had to talk to a doctor who was on call for
the hospital.  He told me that since they had her stabilized, she could go
home.  I asked the nurse how we were going to get her up the stairs into her
home since she was so weak and we had to call the ambulance before.  She said
if Mom couldn’t make it, we could call an ambulance again to talk her into her
home.  I was disgusted.  Anyway, Kim followed us and he and Danny helped her up
the stairs and she was able to do it, but she was exhausted.  Kim and Jeanenne
told me to go home and get some rest - that they could stay with her that day
and I wouldn’t need to come back until 9:00 or even 10:00 p.m.  I was thankful
for that so I made sure Mom was resting well and told her I would be back that
night to spend the night with her.  When I got home, my neighbor, Bonnie
Benedict, came over and asked how Mom was.  I talked to her for awhile, then
came in and made phone calls to Mom’s brothers and sister - letting them know
of Mom’s condition.  I called for a substitute for my primary class and took
the books over.  I tried to rest for a few minutes, but couldn’t sleep so I got
up and straightened up the house and did some laundry.  Ken &amp; Jeff got home
and I told them the situation.  Ken took me over to Mom’s and stayed for awhile
then went home.  I asked him to bring a roast, potatoes, etc., and I would fix
dinner at Mom’s for everyone including Scott &amp; Michelle as it was their
week to be with us.  I enjoyed being with Mom and she did feel some better.  We
watched the BYU Devotionals, the Tabernacle Choir broadcast, etc.  I fixed Mom
some breakfast and took it to her as she ate in her chair in the front room. 
While we were eating supper with the family, the priesthood came with the
Sacrament for her and she called me in to partake of it with her.  Since she
was feeling some better now and Danny &amp; Shanna were there, I felt I needed
to go home as I needed to go to work the next day.  I did hate to leave Mom and
I knew she hated to have me go, but she knew I needed to.  Georgia
was still sick or she would have been over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom got along all right and she did take her
Lasic faithfully<b>.  I talked to Deanna and she told me that she felt Dad’s
presence there with Mom on Saturday morning when we were getting her ready to
go to the hospital and that she heard him saying as he nudged her on the arm
“Let’s go, Mom, let’s go” (He called her Mom when they were in the presence of
their children)     That week when I was with Mom, I told her what Deanna had
said and she said “I know, Mae, I felt him there too and heard him say that,
but I told him I would be coming soon, but I wasn’t ready yet.”</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom loved her family and didn’t want to leave us. 
She had told me many times that she wanted to be here when all of her
missionary grandsons came home from their missions.  She had five all out at
the same time - Jeff (our youngest son), Chad (Bryce &amp; Deanna’s son),
Brannon &amp; David (Terry &amp; Angela’s sons) and Brady (Georgia &amp; Rick’s
son).  Jeff came home in February and Chad in April, but the other three are
still out.  I had told her that she would never want to leave as there would
always be some grandchild getting married, having a baby, going on a mission,
etc., and that was true and she loved being here with her family.  She loved
each one of us and we are thankful for her love.  She was so good to write
faithfully to each of her missionary grandsons and to keep in touch with all of
her grandchildren.  Cindi, Hal’s daughter, is in Colorado and Mom worried a lot
about her as she has been on drugs and in and out of rehabs.  Cindi’s daughter,
Samantha, gives her a purpose for life now.  Jean, her mother, died about a
year and a half ago and is buried up in Morgan by Hal.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom’s brothers &amp; sister were all very
concerned about Mom so they called her and Uncle June came down to see her. 
Uncle Van had wanted her to go with him and Aunt Allison back to Arkansas
to visit Uncle Dean and Aunt Stella.  In fact, she had already purchased her
ticket.  This was in May.  But, she felt she didn’t feel well enough to go - so
she didn’t.  We are glad she didn’t as I am sure it would have been too hard on
her and she probably wouldn’t have made it back home to us.  Both Uncle June
and Aunt Joy wanted Mom to come stay with them again.  She had gone to visit
Uncle June last Fall and they all had such a good time that they wanted her to
come again.  She has gone to Aunt Joy’s several times and they always have a
wonderful time and Jack loves having her there also.  Mom is a wonderful person
and fun to be around.  Anyway, they all called her and she was little upset
with me for calling them, but I felt they should know as they love her a lot.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The following Thursday night when I went over to
Mom’s, I took flowers to plant as she loves flowers and has a big flower garden
in front of her home.  I weeded and then planted the flowers for her.  She sat
in her chair on the porch watching me and visiting with me.  Terry’s daughter,
Melia, came over to visit with her also.  She wasn’t able to stay very long,
however.  I got a  little upset with Mom again as I had been weeding and
planting the flowers and I was tired from working all day, and she kept having
me do other things in her garden.            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The next week, I came on a Wednesday as Ken
&amp; I were leaving Thursday right after work to go on a little anniversary
trip as it was our 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary.  I asked Mom if she would like
to get out and go for a ride and she said she would. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             She got tired being cooped up in her house all
the time, so Georgia and I tried to take her places when we could.  Ken &amp; I
had taken her with us on Memorial Day.  Actually, it was Sunday, the day before
Memorial Day.  I fixed a picnic lunch and we went to the Morgan Park and ate in
their bowery.  We took Mom’s wheelchair and she sat in it at the table.  The
weather was perfect and Ken, Mom &amp; I really enjoyed being there.  Jeff came
later with Georgia as he wasn’t home when we were ready to leave and we thought
he wanted to come up on his motorcycle, but when Georgia called to see if we
had left and he answered, he told her that we had left him.  I felt bad about
that, but Ken was anxious to go.  He had gone over to Mom’s to get her and
picked her flowers to take up and wanted to leave.  So, Georgia told Jeff to come over and ride up with them - which he did.  After supper, we
drove over to the cemetery where we soon met Kim &amp; part of his family and
Georgia and her family.  Bryce had to work so he and Deanna had come up on
Friday.  We put the flowers on all the graves and they looked beautiful.  Mom
was happy with them.  We enjoyed visiting, but it soon became cold and windy. 
We wrapped a blanket around Mom, but soon decided we had better leave.  Kim
wanted us to come over to his house and play games, but it was getting late -
so we headed for home.  Mom has mentioned many times how she enjoyed that good
picnic at the park and going to the cemetery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Well, back to Wednesday, June 16<sup>th</sup>. 
I drove all around Clinton and showed Mom where Ken is working on the Clinton
 Town Center.  She enjoyed the ride and we drove around in Syracuse and West
 Point.  Then she asked if we could go to the Arctic Circle and she would buy
us a root beer float as they had them on sale for 99 cents.  I knew she had
brought her purse.  We did and enjoyed sitting them visiting and watching the
people come and go and the employees in the Arctic Circle making the food and
helping the customers.  I started the car when we had finished with the floats,
but she said “could we stay a little longer, I’m enjoying watching the people
and just relaxing here.”  I said “Sure, Mom, we can stay as long as you like.” 
She finally said we could go.  I took her home and as I left to go to my home,
I glanced up at her front room window and she was there waving goodbye to me as
she always did (unless she was too sick to do so - and she had to be really bad
not to do it).  That was the last time I saw Mom in good health. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Ken and I went on our anniversary trip the next
afternoon.  We stayed at the Air Port Hilton.  I had always liked that hotel as
it has a big man-made lake in front of it with a beautiful fountain.  It has a
sidewalk all around it and I would see people walking around it and thought how
fun it would be to stay there.  It was wonderful.  The room was really nice
also.  Ken and I did walk around it that evening, fed the ducks and just
relaxed.  On Friday, we slept in, went out for breakfast and then went to the Salt
 Lake Temple.  We were asked to be witnesses, so that was special.  We had
lunch in the temple afterwards and that evening we went to see the play “Seven
Brides for Seven Brothers” at the Hale Theater.  It was really good.  We had
seen the movie, but enjoyed the play also.  We swam both in the inside and
outside pools before going to bed.  Saturday morning, we slept in again (sure
seemed good to not have to set an alarm and get up at 4:45
 a.m.)  We packed up and went to the Joseph Smith Memorial where we met with
the Burgesses on the top floor for the wedding breakfast for their son, Bryan
and his wife.  It was really nice and we enjoyed seeing Allen &amp; Jeanie’s
other children.  We went to the car which was parked in the J.S.M. parking lot,
got our casual clothes, went back in and changed our clothes in the restroom. 
We then went to the zoo where we spent the afternoon.  We really enjoyed being
together.  Ken was really sweet to me and bought me ice cream and cotton candy
even though he can’t have any himself because of his health.  We left for home
about 7:00 p.m.  We decided to stop at the grocery store to buy our groceries
before going home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>When we got home, there was a urgent message from Georgia
saying Mom was really bad</b>.  I called, grabbed my nightgown and what I
needed to spent the night and Ken and I drove over.  Mom had felt good that
morning, but when Shanna helped her into the bathroom, Mom complained a little
about her left foot saying it felt numb and tingling.  By the time she got back
to the couch it was hurting.  It wasn’t long until she was in terrible pain and
Shanna called her Mom to come down.  Deanna had errands to run, but realized
that both Georgia and I were out of town so she came down.  They gave Mom some
morphine and then called the Hospice nurse.  The nurse came right away and they
kept administering morphine, but it didn’t seem to help much.  Mom was in such
pain for over 6 hours, they said.  She told them that having babies wasn’t
anything compared to this pain.  What had happened was a blood clot had gone to
her foot and cut off the circulation.  I didn’t realize how painful it is when
the blood is not circulating blood.  The nurse told Deanna and the others that
it is terrible pain and that Mom’s foot and leg would turn black and the skin
would start to sluff off.  The leg would die and eventually have to be
amputated.  Just before I got there, Mom had said “Please, I’ll do anything,
just get me out of this pain”.  Soon after that she relaxed as they had given
her enough morphine to stop the severe pain.  They had called the hospice
pharmacist to come so they could insert a tube into Mom’s stomach allowing a
constant drip of morphine so Mom wouldn’t have to be in that terrible pain
again.  They had also put a catheter into Mom.  Mom was pretty much out of it
when I got there.  I helped the nurse put a nightgown on Mom and I just had to
pull her arms through the nightgown as she couldn’t help herself.  I don’t even
know if she knew I was there or not.  I was glad I didn’t have to see Mom in
such terrible pain, but I was disappointed that I wasn’t there to be with her
and help her.  Kim and Jeanenne and Shanna were there, and when Georgia
got home, she went right over.  I’m not sure what time she got there.  Bryce
also came from work.  Bryce, Georgia and I decided we all wanted to be there
with Mom and spend the night.  Kim &amp; Jeanenne had gone home after Georgia
got there.  The nurse left a brochure with us telling us the last stages before
death.  I woke up once to go to the bathroom and noticed that Mom had not stirred
as she was in the same position.  She was still breathing so I went back to
bed.  At 6:00 a.m. I woke and went in and sat in Mom’s rocking chair by her
bed.  She was still in the same position and I noticed on the catheter bag that
no more body fluids had been going in as it was the same level as last night. 
I knew that was one of the last signs .  I also noticed that her fingernails
were going dark and also around her eyes.  That was also one of the signs.  I
looked at her leg and it was going quite black and it upset me and I said a
quick prayer that Mom wouldn’t have to deal with that.  I hated to have her
leave us, but I also hated to have her stay and suffer more and I knew it would
be very hard on her if she had to have her leg amputated.  We had heard how
hard it was on Aunt Stella and how the pain was so intense.  Mom had been
through enough on Saturday, I didn’t want her to have to have more.  I sat
there for some time talking to Mom and just thinking about her and life.  I got
a washcloth and washed her face and hands as they were clammy.  Bryce and
Georgia got up and they knew Mom was dying also.  I called the nurse at Hospice
to be reassured that these signs were normal and that there was nothing any of
us needed to do for her.  The nurse said she was glad I called and she wanted
us to feel free to call at any time.  She did say that those were some of the
last signs and she didn’t expect Mom to last much longer.  She asked if we
would like to have an aid come and give Mom a sponge bath - which might make
her more comfortable.  I said we would.   We called our families and the ones
who lived close by came over and were able to say their last goodbyes to their
grandmother.  She couldn’t speak to them, but I’m sure she heard them and us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Aunt Beth had called and said her and Eve wanted
to bring dinner over to us.  That was very sweet of them and we appreciated
it.  She brought roast, potatoes and gravy, vegetable, rolls, salad and dessert. 
She is such a wonderful and thoughtful aunt.  We all love her and Uncle Verle
very much.  The food tasted so good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Julie, the aid, came about 3:50
 p.m. and gave Mom a sponge bath.  She was very sweet, tender and caring with
Mom. As she was finishing, she made the comment that many of her patients, at
this stage, had passed away during or right after the sponge bath as they were
relaxed and more comfortable.  It was right after that, about 4:30,
that we (her children and some of the grandchildren)were gathered around Mom
and Bryce had gone over to give her a kiss on the forehead.  He asked Julie to
come over and check Mom.  She did and said Mom had passed away.  We all quietly
cried and comforted each other, but were relieved that Mom didn’t have to
suffer any longer and she went in her sleep and didn’t seem to have any pain as
she left this world.  We had felt the presence of dad and I know he was anxious
to have her with him again.  It has been six years since he passed away and I
know he has missed her terribly as they were SWEETHEARTS.  They have both been
such wonderful examples to me and my children and all their family.  I love
them both so very much and will eternally be grateful to them for their love,
teachings, example and all they have done for me and my family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We started making phone calls.  Georgia
had brought her cell phone and I used Mom’s phone.  We called her brothers and
sister, Dad’s brothers and sisters, her close friends, her Bishop, the
mortician and others.  That took the rest of the afternoon and evening.  Uncle
Dale and Aunt Esther came over, Uncle June and his wife, the Bishop to help us
with the funeral arrangements.  I told him I would get all the information and
get it over to him the next day.  I took the week off work.  Mom wanted all her
children to speak if we felt we could, so I put us down on the program.  She
wanted special songs - “How Great Thou Art” and we asked her secret
granddaughter, Becky Weaver and her sister, Stephanie, to sing it as they have
beautiful voices and Mom loved them, especially Becky.  Mom loved that song and
also “I Need Thee Every Hour” - so all of us children and our spouses sang it
and Bryce and Deanna’s daughter, Shanna, accompanied us.  The grandchildren and
great grandchildren sang the first number and it was “Families Can Be Together
Forever”.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> I made the phone calls, typed up the program for the Bishop
and mortuary and then took it to them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It was an emotional time, but also a wonderful
time.  Terry came down on Monday and stayed at Mom’s home all week.  Shanna
said it really helped her to have him there as she really missed her
grandmother.  She lived there in the house and did a lot for Mom.  We enjoyed
having Terry down and his daughter, Melia, who is down here living with Georgia, really loved having her dad here.  She was with him all the time except when she
had to go to work.  Terry is such a cute guy.  He is a sweet, thoughtful, good
man and brother.  He has been either in the bishopric in his ward or in the
High Council in his stake most of the time he has lived in Alaska.  He is very
spiritual and realizes the value of serving the Lord and his fellow man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bryce, Terry, Georgia, Kim and I enjoyed being
together as we planned the funeral and went through some of Mom’s things.  We
probably wouldn’t have been going through her things this soon, but we felt we
needed to since Terry would only be here for a week.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We all met with the mortician to go over things
with him and write up the obituary, etc.  Mom &amp; Dad had already paid for
their funeral plan which made it easy for us.  They had picked out their
caskets and everything.  The only thing we needed for Mom was her temple
clothes.  The mortician was a good friend of Mom &amp; Dads and he and his
father had taken care of Mom’s parents and also grandma Porter.  He thought a
lot of them as they did him - so he wanted to have us pick out a beautiful
dress for Mom and he wanted the dress, shoes and all of the temple clothes to
be a gift to her from him.  That was so special and Mom did look so beautiful. 
Mom’s beautician, Donna Jensen in Sunset, loved Mom and the last few months,
she would come to Mom’s house each week to do her hair.  It was too hard for
Mom to go down Donna’s steps to her basement where she had her salon, so she
came to Mom.  We knew Mom would like Donna to do her hair for the funeral - so
I asked her.  She cried and then said “yes, it would be an honor to do it for
Mildred”.  So, with the beautiful clothes and her hair so pretty, she looked
very beautiful.  Georgia and I had gone to Ogden to pick out the flowers - the
casket piece from us children and a beautiful arrangement from the children and
grandchildren.  Georgia and I decided to pay for them out of the money in Mom’s
account - since I was a co-signer with Mom and the money would now be all of
ours anyway.  Most of our children are struggling financially so we decided to
pay for theirs also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom’s brothers and sister, especially Aunt Joy
and also Uncle June really had a hard time when we called to let them know Mom
had died. <b>Mom loved her brothers and sister very much</b>.  After dad died,
her and Uncle June became very close as they would call each other every
night.  <b>Uncle June</b> had lost his wife to cancer so they were both lonely
and turned to each other for support.  Mom spent time with Uncle June and
Benita up in Wyoming last year and loved it so much.  In fact, Uncle June was
planning to come last Tuesday to take her up for another visit.  Mom loved to
have <b>Uncle Van</b> stop in and visit when he would be up this way for
National Guard or other meetings and they kept in touch through phone calls and
letters, also her other brother, <b>Uncle Dean</b>, in Arkansas.  Mom only had
one sister and the two of them were very close.  She loved to go to <b>Aunt
Joys</b> in St George and stay with her and Jack.  They called her <b>“mims</b>”
and they loved their visits together and they always had high phone bills, when
they weren’t together,  because of the time they spent on the phone. They will
really miss her, and we, her family, will really miss her.  She was a wonderful
mother and great example to each of us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We talked about calling Cindi (Hal’s daughter)
and offering to pay for her flight out as we knew she would want to be here and
we know Mom would want her here.  She was glad we did offer as she did want to
come, but she didn’t have the money.  She got a friend to take care of
Samantha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>We did fly Cindi out, but it was a bad
experience for all of us</b>.  Cindi couldn’t handle having the last “family
link” gone - whom she had loved and had been loved by.  We are certain that she
took drugs to kill the pain, because she was so hyper and always wanted to
borrow Georgia &amp; Rick’s car (she was staying with them), she even got in a
minor wreck with it which, of course, upset Georgia &amp; Rick and the rest of
us.  She made Malia late for the viewing which upset Terry &amp; Malia.  Georgia couldn’t relax because the way Cindi was acting.  Cindi took Malia with her to
Mom’s house and began going through things and wanted Mom’s rings and most
valuable jewelry.  Malia told her she shouldn’t take anything.  Georgia took them away from Cindi and that upset Georgia more.  It put a damper on the
funeral, especially for Georgia.  Kim offered to take Cindi to his home until
she left to go back to Colorado, but she did the same thing there, which was
upsetting for Kim &amp; Jeanenne.  I can understand Cindi turning to drugs at
this time, but it was hard for everyone involved and we were all relieved to
see her go back.  Georgia called John, Cindi’s boyfriend, to tell him what
happened and to have him meet Cindi at the airport.  He was upset because she
has done this before.  He loves Cindi, but can’t trust her - so won’t marry
her.  We can’t blame him, but wish she could stay off them and prove to be
trustworthy so he would marry her and she could have a somewhat normal life for
her and Samantha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom was loved by everyone as she loved all of
them - so we had a steady line at the viewing on Wednesday evening, June 23<sup>rd</sup>
(dad’s birthday).  The flowers were beautiful.  It was good to see all our
relatives and friends and Mom’s friends, neighbors and ward members.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I marveled at how much love I felt during
this time.  I know the Holy Ghost was with us to comfort us and help us.  I
just wish I could feel that spirit and love all the time, but was sure grateful
for it then.  I didn’t have much time to write my talk because of all the
things I needed to do and calls I needed to make, but my Heavenly Father surely
blessed me.  When I finally sat down at the computer for a few minutes to
gather my thoughts for my talk, the words just came to my mind.  I had been
praying about it.  Ken had told me different things I should say, but those
were not the words which came to my mind - so I felt the Lord was guiding me
and I felt really good about it.  I wasn’t nervous even when I got up to give
the talk.  Bryce, Terry, Georgia and Kim all gave wonderful talks and I was
very proud of all of them.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sandi
&amp; Terry’s cabin in Star Valley, Wyoming</span> –  </b>Sandi &amp; Terry had
gone in with another couple (friends from Grantsville) to buy a beautiful cabin
among the pines in Star Valley, Wyoming.  There were other cabins there and
they had a golf course, swimming pool, etc.  It was a beautiful area and Sandi
and her friend decorated it so beautifully (Sandi mainly as she is very
talented at furnishing and decorating)  Sandi and Terry invited Ken and I to go
up to their cabin with them several times.  Ken, Terry &amp; Sandi would go
fishing on the stream which was close by, just west of the main road in Island
Park.  I would go with them and take pictures and read my book.  It was so
beautiful there in their cabin and on their property.  We played games, helped
each other fix meals, visited, rode their 4 wheelers in the summer and
snowmobiles in the winter.  We also went to the cheese factory and bought ice
cream and cheese curd. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b> Sandi and Terry invited all our
family one year.  I think it was 2000.</b>   Shellie, Roy &amp; boys came up
too.  It was after Christmas, during the holidays.  We stayed for several days
and we all had a ball.  Our family is great together and all work together for
meals, cleanup, etc.  We had lots of fun playing games, visiting, and riding
their 4 wheelers and snowmobiles.  Sandi &amp; Terry also had sleds, so we all
dressed up in our warm clothes, boots, hats and gloves and went sleigh riding
down the road that led just above their home to the end and then others would
be on the snowmobiles and pull the ones on the sleds back up the hill.  We all
had a ball doing that and we had snowball fights, etc.  That is the time we
found out about the property we bought.  Ken had been out on one of their 4
wheelers and had passed by a sign that said property for sale by owner
$10,000.  Mike told us and we couldn’t believe someone was selling it for only
$10,000.  The phone number was on the sign.  It was filled with quaking aspen
trees and was a large corner lot.  We called on it and to make a long story
short, we were able to purchase it with the goal of building our home on it at
a future date.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Aug 14, 2000</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I haven’t taken the time to write
down very much lately, but this summer has been a different summer so I wanted
to record it.  It has been a great summer in many ways, but almost too busy. 
It started <b>in February when Rich &amp; Lois invited us to share their
vacation condo in Island Park with them again</b>.  We love going there.  We
enjoy being with them as they are great people, plus we have so much fun
snowmobiling in Yellowstone and all around, going to the clubhouse and swim or
sit in sauna or hot tubs, or going site-seeing or playing games and visiting.  They
have two weeks starting the end of January, but we usually go on the second
week.  </p>

&amp; Shauna and Shauna’s parents &amp; brother in April of 2000</span></b>.              Ken
and I also went to London, England one day by ourselves.  This was a fantastic
vacation and another dream come true as I had always dreamed of going to Paris,
but never thought I would.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I stopped at David &amp; Shauna’s home
in Idaho Falls on the way to Island Park to be with Rich &amp; Lois in their
condo and <b>David asked us how we would like to go with them to <u>Paris, Fra</u></b><u>nce</u>. 
We thought he was just kidding, but he has always wanted to go back to France
since that’s where he went on his mission.  He had been looking on the internet
and was able to find tickets for $399.00 round trip.  It usually cost $1,750. 
We became excited.  I have wanted to go to Europe, but never thought I would be
able to.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>            Since we had sold Mom &amp; Dad’s home in
Clearfield, after Mom passed away, each of us children received approximately
$20,000.  We paid off Ken’s truck with the money I received and that took
almost $17,000.  We decided we wanted to go on a nice vacation with part of
it.  We had thought about a church history tour as we have never been to Nauvoo
or other church history sites, or going on a cruise since we have heard so much
about them, but never been on one. But, this was a once in a lifetime
opportunity, so, we said “yes”.  Shauna’s parents &amp; brother also went with
us and we enjoyed being with them.  It was a vacation of a lifetime.  Shauna
spent about 40 hours making all the arrangements - hotel reservations, tours,
checking times to visit places, correlating, etc.  They came down and we all
met and decided where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do and we basically
planned it and then she went from there.  (Actually, she and David had already
done some ground work by watching videos and reading books to find out what was
available.)  With David speaking the language so well and Shauna making all the
arrangements, it was a fantastic trip.  The flight over was great.  I had a
window seat and enjoyed looking at the sites below as well as the beautiful
clouds.  My first experience with the subway was fun, but hard since we had to
carry our luggage and hurry to make the next one as we had to get off and on
several times to get to our destination.  We had purchased a card to last us
while we were in Paris, which we used each time we went on it.  I really
enjoyed the <b>subways </b> as I had heard so much about them, but never
experienced it before.  It was fun to ride it and also to watch the people.  <b>The
hotel was small, but quaint and cute.  The elevator was tiny.  We opened our
window in our room and it looked out onto the street below where I liked to
watch the people and to see the pigeons and doves</b>.  It was fun to be in
this country.  After getting settled, we all went to the Notradame Cathedral. 
It was so beautiful with cut glass windows, all the beautiful carvings,
statues, etc.  We climbed to the top and looked out over the city.  It was magnificent. 
I hated to leave.  We had climbed over 300 steps as we climbed on up to the
bell.  Going down was harder, especially for Ken.  We then went to the Arch of
Triumph.  I was fascinated with the traffic.  It was a circle and cars and
vehicles were going every which way, we saw one collision, but thought there
would be many.  I had never seen anything like it before.  While others were
looking at the Arch of Triumph, I was looking at the traffic before me.  We did
walk over (underneath) and I enjoyed looking at it then.  The next morning
(Saturday) we rode the RNR (train) to <img width=320 height=1

align=left hspace=12>Versailles.  That is where King Loui the 14<sup>th</sup>
built his palace out 30 miles from the city.  I don’t remember how many acres
it covers, but it was Hugh - the buildings and the grounds.  There are over
300,000 fountains on the grounds. The fountains were not on when we went
because they don’t turn them on until the 1<sup>st</sup> of May.  When we got
back to Paris, we went to a museum where Napoleon’s tomb was plus knights
armor, etc.  It was interesting.  That night we took a cruise on the Seine
River then toured the Eiffel Tower.  It was so beautiful looking down over the
city from the top of the tower.  It was really crowded and as we were loading
the elevator, Ken was being pushed back while the rest of us were getting on; I
grabbed his arm and hurled him on with us.  He was surprised and shocked that I
could do that, but I didn’t want to get on without him.   We toured beautiful
castles and ate delicious French pastries and took lots of pictures.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>Ken &amp; I decided we wanted to go to London, England</b>
while we were over there.  The others didn’t want to, but said for us to “go
for it”.  That was great too.  We left the hotel at 4:30 as we had to meet the
group at 6 am.  We had directions of where to meet the group that were going to
London and so we rode the subway, but when we got off, the directions didn’t
make sense, so we saw a shop keeper watching the windows of his shop.  We went
over and showed him our map.  He unlocked his shop and took us in, so he could
turn on a light as it was still dark outside.  He raised 2 fingers (indicting 2
blocks) and pointed the way.  We walked the two blocks, but still couldn’t see
the name of the building where we were to meet, so we saw two street cleaners and
showed them our map.  They indicated that it was just around the corner.  We
thanked them and found it.  We were thankful that there were people on the
street who could help us, as we would have hated to miss this trip.   We went
on the Euro train under the English Channel.  It went fast.......  We met some
wonderful people, on the train, and had fun visiting with them also.  It was
cold and rainy in England, but we went on a tour bus and had a great time
anyway.  To see the palace, Big Ben, London Bridge, etc., was exciting.  We did
get off and ate at a cute little café and had fun talking to the waiter.  We
saw signs all over that said “To let”.  We thought it looked like “toilet” and
we wondered why they were advertizing toilets so often.  We found out that it
meant “To Rent”.  They were renting buildings for businesses, apartments or
rooms in buildings.   We arrived safely back in Paris that night, and were very
glad we had gone.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>            Thanks to David being able to speak French, we
ate good food at good restaurants.  I especially loved stopping at the little
shops on the street where we <b>bought a special yogurt, delicious cheese and
long, delicious bread.</b>  We would take them to the hotel and eat the bread
&amp; cheese while we drank the yogurt for our meal.  We also loved stopping at
the sidewalk cafes and ordering chocolate/banana crepes.  They were so
delicious.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The morning when we were to head for home, we
were all packing and then everyone wanted to go to another museum before going
to the airport.  In packing, Ken and I couldn’t find our passports &amp;
tickets.  We were frantic and searched everywhere and through our entire
luggage.  We told the others to go without us and we would meet them later as
soon as we found our passports &amp; tickets.  We prayed, of course, and
finally we found them.  We had decided to put them in a special pocket in one
of our bags.  Wow, were we relieved.  We decided to go for a walk as we still
had plenty of time.  We walked through the park and I loved it, it was so
beautiful and fun to be there, especially with my wonderful guy.  We stopped at
a sidewalk café and bought another chocolate/banana crepe.  We met up with
David, Shauna, her parents &amp; brother.  David &amp; Shauna’s friends and the
friend’s brother &amp; his wife, had gone over with us, but didn’t stay with
us.  They did their own thing, but hadn’t done the planning, the preparing and
scheduling like Shauna had done, so things didn’t work out for them like it did
for us, and they couldn’t see or do near as much as we did.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>(I guess I ran out of time and didn’t record what we did
the remainder of the summer)</b></p>

align=left hspace=12><b>It’s July 9, 2001.</b>  I wanted to record a Saturday a
couple of weeks ago.  Ken’s Mom has need of round-the-clock care.  She broke
her arm, and since her mind is about gone, she gets angry, frustrated, and
upset because of the pain and because of the cast which restricts her from
being as independent as she wants to be so she tries to cut it off, break it
off or soak it off.  We have to watch her all the time and many times it is the
nighttime which is the worst.  Irven &amp; Sandy and Ken &amp; I had been
taking turns watching her.  Sandy was doing it during the weekdays and Ken
&amp; I would take turns staying the evenings with her &amp; Irven, and Ken
&amp; I would do the weekends.  (We call it “tend her”) as sometimes she is
worse than a 2 year old as a 2 year old seems to understand and remember better
than she does.  She also gets angry and throws tantrums, like a 2 year old,
sometimes.  Other times she is quiet, sweet and alert.  We play “rummy”, her favorite
card game with her sometimes and she is alert and even wins.  I was amazed at
how she figured out how to play with her broken arm as the cast goes from her
hand to her shoulder.  Her fingers stick out of the cast and part of her hand. 
She got another chair and spread the cards out on it.  They were on the other
side of her so we couldn’t see them and then she could maneuver them and be
able to play with her one hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This one Saturday, Ken was staying with her
while I stayed at home to clean, do laundry, trim the lawns, go grocery
shopping, etc.  Ken had mowed the lawns early before he went over to be with
his mom.  I decided to trim before it got too hot.  When I came in to get a
drink of water, the phone rang and Scott asked if I had remembered that it was
Kylan’s birthday and that they had invited me to go swimming with them.  I
remembered his birthday, but forgot about going swimming.  I asked them when
they were going and they said “in about 15 minutes”.  I told them I’d meet them
at the Clearfield pool.  I hurried and changed and drove over.  We had a
wonderful time and stayed for about 3 hours.  Scott &amp; Mishelle had bought a
float tube for Kylan and he loved it and had a great time.  We took turns
playing with him and swimming.  Scott did some great dives off the high diving
board and the lower one - flips, backwards, etc.  Scott was on the Layton
 High School diving team and went to state.  I love to watch him.  He’s modest
so doesn’t want to do it if there are too many people.  Mishelle and I even
went off the lower diving board.  She dove, but I just jumped off.  I used to
dive when I was younger, but I’m too nervous now.  I really had a great time
being with Scott, Mishelle and little Kylan and I love to swim - so it was
great.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I gave them my gift and Kylan opened it and I
left for home, changed back into my grubbies and was heading out to finish
trimming the lawns when Jeff came up the stairs and asked if I would like to go
see the movie “Pearl Harbor” with him.  He said he had been calling his
friends, but either they weren’t home or couldn’t go.  I said “Oh Jeff, I’ve
been playing for 3 hours and I’ve got so much to do”.  He said “Oh Mom, you
need to watch the Disney video “Jungle Book” more and be like Baloo - he just
enjoyed life and doesn’t take it so seriously.”  Jeff told me he would do the
vacuuming when we got home.  I said “Ok” and went up to change my clothes
again.  It was fun being with Jeff and visiting.  He’s a special son and it was
great “bonding” together (as he put it).  The show was good, it was amazing to
see what actually went on when Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese.  It
only had a little “dog poop” (bad language and a love scene). I had been told
by many good people that the show is incredible and doesn’t have anything “bad”
in it, but there was.  Boy, it’s getting harder and harder to go to movies
anymore because of the language, sex and violence.  Ken and I just mainly rent
old movies on video instead of going to the movies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Anyway, I still enjoyed it and enjoyed being
with Jeff.  I changed into my grubbies for the 3<sup>rd</sup> time and was on
my way to at least finish trimming before it was too dark and the phone rang.  <b>It
was Scott asking if I wanted to come over and watch Kylan open his presents and
have cake and ice cream</b>.  I said to myself “what the heck”, that’s more
important than house cleaning so I asked them to give me a few minutes to
finish trimming and I would be over.  I quickly finished trimming, changed
clothes again and drove over to their home.  Kylan was tired as he hadn’t had a
nap, but he was cute most of the time anyway.  Mishelle made him a cupcake and
put a big candle in and lit it.  She helped him blow it out and took the candle
out and let him have to it.  He didn’t grab it, instead he took little pieces
off the edges of the cupcake with his thumb and index finger and ate it. 
Mishelle scared him accidently and he started crying so they got him down to
open his presents.  I got some cute pictures.  It was fun being with them and I
was glad they had invited me over.  Ken was staying the night at his mom’s, but
when I got home he called.  He had called earlier and was worried since no one
was home, wondering where I was.  He prayed and had a good feeling that I was
alright and the thought came to him that I might be at Scott’s.  I’m sure
thankful for prayer as I have prayed about him and the children different times
when I have been worried about them and I get that comforting, peaceful feeling
too and can relax.  Well, I had a fun day - didn’t accomplish much on the list
of things I had planned to do, but it was a wonderful day.  Jeff did vacuum for
me and I stayed up late getting a few things done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001</b>, on
the way to work, I was listening to the radio when the news came on of the
terrible tragedies which happened to the <b>Twin</b><b> Trade Towers</b><b> in New York and the Pendigon in Washington D.C. </b>  Two planes were hijacked
and flew right into the Twin Trade Towers in New York City.  The Hijackers were
illegal aliens from the Middle East - terrorists.   I was devastated and could
not believe what I had just heard.  Then a third plane hit the Pendigon.  We
found out several days later that over 6,000 people were killed.  That news has
greatly affected not only the citizens of the United States of America, but the
people throughout the world.  We have been praying all week for the people who
mourn the loss of their loved ones who were killed, for the firemen and
rescuers, for those who were injured and for the President of the United States
and the other leaders of our country.  We have realized later that these twin
towers could not have come down this way.  A science professor at BYU told
about that and the church had to tell him that he could not tell the public
this as he was representing the Church.  He wouldn’t stop, so he was fired.  Of
course, the media did not tell his information, now that he was fired.  They
would have made it a real story if they could have criticized the church. Satan
has control of the media, he has great power in the world today.  There are
many who feel this destruction of the Twin Towers was done deliberately as
since then our government have made such strict regulations and have more
control over us.  We had a good president in Ronald Regan, but since then it
has gone downhill.  But, we are told that in the last days there would be much
wickedness, evil, corruption and confusion and it surely is. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Since then we have had a drug which is a powder
sent in letters throughout the country and some have died from that drug.  They
feel these are from terrorist also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>This last week, Oct 20 - 23, 2001</b>, there
were so many terrible things reported in the news that it made me depressed and
upset and I didn’t want to listen to the news anymore and I haven’t for a few
days.  The news told of a man &amp; his wife who had separated.  He took his
two small children up in the mountains by Stockton (South of Tooele), shot and
killed the baby boy in his car seat and when the little girl started running,
he shot and killed her, and then he turned the gun on him and took his life. 
Another incident happened in Tooele - a little boy found his dad’s loaded rifle
and shot and killed his little brother.  In a daycare center a baby was
killed.  A couple of little boys (ages 3 &amp; 4) killed the baby girl.  The
daycare lady had gone outside to check on the other children I understand. 
Another report told of two men who shot and killed two deer hunters -just to
get their truck.  They led the police on a chase and escaped for a couple of
days, but were found and are in custody now.  The deer hunters were young men
in their 20's.  The one was married and had 3 small children.  This world is
getting so wicked; it scares me for my children and grandchildren.  I hope and
pray they will be strong and can overcome the powers of Satan and stay strong
in the gospel and stand for the right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>December 2001:  </b>Sandi &amp; Terry invited
our family to come to their cabin the day after Christmas and spend the rest of
that week there with them.  I think most, if not all, of our family were
there.  We had such a great time and Sandi &amp; Terry were a great host and
hostess.  We played games, visited, went sleigh riding down the road by their
house with their snowmobiles pulling us back up, ate great meals and just
enjoyed relaxing and being together.  We have a close family and we are so
thankful for that.  Everyone enjoys being together.  While there, Mike was
riding Sandi and Terry’s four wheeler and road past a building lot that was for
sale for $10,000.  He was amazed at that price and told Ken and I about it.  He
took us back and we looked at the beautiful corner lot with lots of quaking
aspen trees.  We got the phone number to call.  We thought that would be a
great investment even if we didn’t build on it, but the thought crossed our
minds that we might want to build on it.  We prayed about it and both of us had
a good feeling about it.  Ken has always wanted to build our own home and this
might be the right opportunity.  We called and were able to purchase it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Saturday,
 May 25, 2002.</b>  What a busy life.  Ken called me at work yesterday to say
he had gotten off work early and was planning to clean the carpet in our
bedroom, but noticed, after moving out the furniture, that the walls really
needed to be painted so wondered if he should go buy a paint sprayer and start
painting it.  We decided to do that since that bedroom had not been painted
when we painted the house when Scott came home from his mission.  The sprayer
cost $700.00, but we wouldn’t have to pay for it until the first of the year. 
Ken rationalized that he would need the sprayer when we build our home in Star
 Valley.  When I came home, I helped Ken finish moving the furniture, vacuumed
the carpet and started washing the walls and trim.  We then taped it and Ken
sprayed it.  It was after mid-night when we went to bed.  I was surprised that
it took so long to get it ready to paint.  We slept in the North bedroom.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken got up early the next morning and started
cleaning the carpet.  We then left for Star Valley as we wanted to look at some
other property to make sure our lot was where we wanted to build.  The other
property we looked at wouldn’t work out for us and when we looked at our
property again, we loved it and really want to build there.  We sure hope it
works out that we can.  We did meet a wonderful LDS couple who have a beautiful
home with a gorgeous view and had a good visit with them.  They are retired,
have gone on a mission and used to live in Taylorsville, Utah.  They, like us,
wanted to get away from the city and the traffic and have a slower, more
peaceful life.  Ken and I loved the drive up and back and loved being in that
beautiful valley.  We visited with Uncle June and his family.  He hasn’t been
well.  We were tired when we arrived back home that night, but we still had to
put our bedroom back in place as the next day was Sunday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Lake Mead/Los Vegas </b>– Ken and I were invited to go
with Mike and David’s families in <b>June of 2002</b>.  They rented a nice home
with a swimming pool for a week and we went boating and water skiing on Lake
Mead.  The home had a pool table and we took other games, so we had a great
time together.  We also went into Las Vegas one day and I was impressed by the
beautiful water fountains and how they dance to lights and music.  We had a
wonderful vacation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Motorcycle trip with Ken in fall of 2002 – </b>Quint had
sent us a paper cutout of himself (a flat Stanley) and we were to do something
fun and take the cutout with us and then send it back to Quint with pictures
and a report of what we did.  It was for a school project.  We decided to
borrow Jeff’s motorcycle and go on a trip to see the fall leaves.  We first
went to Denny’s to eat breakfast, then rode up Weber Canyon and on to
Coleville, then on to Heber City where we stopped for lunch and also eat a
frozen yogurt at Ken’s favorite yogurt place – Caroline’s.  We drove down one
of the canyon’s – Emigration, it seems like.  We had a great time.  We took
pictures all along the way and then sent them to Quint with his cutout and a
report of what we did.  It was a fun and beautiful trip.  I loved it, and loved
being with Ken.  I felt safe riding in back of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mom Jensen had been showing signs
of Dementia since we lived with her from 1986 through 1990.  Her 3<sup>rd</sup>
husband, Leo Jensen had passed away and she was lonely.   We had had financial
problems in Arizona and so had come to live with her to get back on our feet. 
She was forgetful and would mention frequently that she couldn’t remember
things and hoped her mind wasn’t going.  She would accuse Jeff of taking things
and losing them - when it was her.  After we bought our home at 778 E 700 S,
she continued to worsen and we finally had to take her car away from her as she
would get confused and get lost plus her eyes were getting bad.  She had said
to Ken “I don’t want to drive any more, take my car”.  He took that
opportunity.  She regretted it soon after, and almost to the day she died,
would keep telling us that she shouldn’t have given us her car as she needed it
so she could go to the store and other places where she wanted to go.  We kept
her car for a few months, but it was too hard for Mom as when we would bring
her over for Sunday dinner, etc., and she would see her car in our garage, she
would stroke it and cry.  We finally traded it in on a truck for Ken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>              Aunt Vida had been living in a retirement home
in Boise, Idaho and Mom wanted her to come live with her, so she finally did. 
That didn’t work too well either for they would argue and fight verbally with
each other plus Aunt Vida was so wobbly and she insisted on going down into the
basement as that bathroom had a shower and she liked to shower rather than
bathe.  Mom preferred bathing.  We worried about Aunt Vida falling as she went
down the stairs.  Mom kept calling Bob (he was retired so was generally home
where she would reach him) to come and find things for her or do things for
her.  It got to be such a problem as she was calling him 5 or 6 times a day. 
He &amp; Carroll lived in Sunset and Mom in Layton - so he didn’t get much else
done.  He would call me at Lincoln Elementary many times and ask if I could
come over after work to try to find her (glasses, purse, etc) that she couldn’t
find.  I would pray and then look for it and usually find what she had lost. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Bob was frustrated and asked Ken what could be
done.  They finally decided that they would need to move her in with Bob.  They
were going to make an addition on Bob’s present home, but that didn’t work so
Bob &amp; Carroll sold their home (which they had paid for) and took out a loan
to buy a bigger home in Clinton so Ken could remodel the basement and make an
apartment for Mom &amp; Aunt Vida.  It took Ken about 3 months by working
nights after work until late and each Saturday.  Ken about lost his health
doing this and I was worried about him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom never did like it there even though it was a
beautiful apartment.  She was a negative person and so would say that it was a
“hole in the ground” and she would say no one ever came to see her and that Bob
never came down and that she never got to go anyplace.  This wasn’t true, but I
think a lot of it was the dementia.  She couldn’t remember when people came to
visit her, when we’d take her places, (we took her to Idaho when we would go
visit David &amp; Shauna, or Rick &amp; Lois or go to Island Park
with Rich &amp; Lois to stay for a week in February with them in their vacation
condo.  We would drop her off at her brother, Irven’s or her sister, Wilma
place and pick her up on the way back.  Bob &amp; Carroll &amp; Irven &amp;
Sandy would take her there also.  She couldn’t remember any of this.  We
visited her often and Bob came down at least once or twice a day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Finally, Aunt Vida, went downhill and her son,
Mark, who was divorced, came to live with them to take care of his mom.  He
took care of Mom also and it was a blessing for us.  It was hard on him as Mom
resented him fixing meals, etc., and would give him a hard time.    Mom fell
outside, one day while working in the yard, and broke her arm.  Irven went over
and stayed in the hospital with her that night and I came the next morning to
stay with her.  That was a hard time for all of us.  Mom couldn’t remember why
the cast was on her arm and would keep trying to get it off with knives (we
finally had to hide them), scissors, or whatever she could find.  She even
tried to soak it off and the doctor had to put a new cast on.  She kept digging
at it until she caused it to heal unnaturally which looked awful when the cast
came off.  It hurt her and she was unrelentless about wanting it off and she
would become quite angry and upset.  It was more than Mark could handle so
Irven &amp; Sandy and Ken &amp; I plus Bob would take turns staying day &amp;
night with her.  We didn’t sleep so well at night since she would be up a lot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mark lived here about 2 ½ years when his mother
passed away in Jan. of 2002.  He didn’t want to stay and take care of Mom, but
he had no place to go - so Bob &amp; Carroll let him have one of their bedrooms
upstairs and they stored his other things in their garage.  Bob &amp; Carroll
are good people.  I have been upset with them at times because they expect Ken
to remodel their homes and do repairs and they don’t ever pay him.  They have
bought him a couple of tools and fixed meals for him when he’s there doing the
work, but it upset me that everyone else pays Ken even my Mom &amp; Dad and our
children, but Bob never has.  Irven asked Bob about it one time and Bob said
“If I paid Ken to do the work, I couldn’t afford to have it done.”  Ken was
busy and we needed the money so I have felt resentful at times.  But I hope I
have repented as since I have gotten to know them better I can see what good
people they are, and how good they have been to Mom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Irven &amp; Sandy took Mom to their home after
Aunt Vida passed away as they felt it would be too hard on her to be alone. 
That only lasted a couple of months as she kept insisting that she wanted to go
back to her home.  She even tried walking there a couple of times.  She made it
so miserable for them that they finally called a meeting with the other two
brothers &amp; spouses (Bob &amp; Ken).  They said they needed to bring her
back to her apartment and that we would all need to take turns staying with
her.  They had worked out a schedule for us all.  They would stay Sunday night,
Monday, Monday night, Tuesday, Tuesday night &amp; Wednesday.  Irven’s wife,
Sandy, doesn’t work so she could stay the days and Irven would come after work
and they would stay with her until Wednesday night.  Ken &amp; I were to stay
with her Wednesday, Thursday, Friday &amp; Saturday nights and Saturday day if
we could and Bob would look out for her on Thursday, Friday &amp; some
Saturdays during the day.  Irven had contacted Cheryl, Mom’s oldest
granddaughter, to come stay with her on Sundays and she agreed to do that.  We
did this for a few months, but it was a hardship on everyone.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken &amp; I had put up our home for
sale hoping to sell it quickly and then Ken would have the money to buy the
materials to start building our home in Star Valley, Wyoming.  We had purchased
the land while up visiting Sandi &amp; Terry.  Well, our home didn’t sell
quickly, even though all our neighbors thought it would as we had made the home
and landscaping really attractive.  It turned out that with the low economy,
homes were not selling.  Homes had been selling good in the spring, but seldom
now.  The realtor explained that many Realtors were going out of business and
that there were so many people losing their homes and that the listing would
fill a large telephone book.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken &amp; I thought about what to do -
whether to go on a mission first and let Scott, Mishelle &amp; their family
move into our home and pay what they could for rent and Ken &amp; I move in
with Mom to take care of her.  We made it a matter of prayer and Ken also spent
a afternoon in the Celestial room in the temple to get some answers.  Ken had
the feeling that we should not build up in Star Valley at this time, but we
should move in with Mom, have Scott &amp; Mishelle move into our home and
continue planning for a mission - that things would work out.  Well they have. 
If we place our faith in the Lord, He will work things out for us. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We moved in with Mom the end of
July.  It was both hard, but good.  It was good doing things for Mom and most
of the time she really appreciated it, but it was also hard as she couldn’t
remember hardly anything and didn’t even know who we were part of the time. 
She thought Ken was her husband, her brother and her son at different times. 
I’m not sure who she thought I was - sometimes a stranger.  Many times she
would act out especially if we told her “you can’t”, “Don’t do that”, “No” and
anything like that.  She would explode and start shouting, swearing, etc. 
People and doctors have told us that many people who have Alzheimer’s or
Dementia act out that way.  Many times I would rather have stayed at work,
rather than come home as I was always tense, not knowing how she would be and
it caused me and Ken a lot of stress.  Bob &amp; Carroll had taken care of her
about 7 years before Mark came and they were “burned out”.  Even with Mark
&amp; then us there, it was still hard on them as she would go up during the
night and wake them up at times, and go up during the day when we were at
work.  Carroll wasn’t a good house keeper and it really bothered Mom and she
would get upset and start cleaning Carroll’s house.  Of course, it upset
Carroll and they had problems.  Many times, 5 minutes later, Mom wouldn’t
remember anything about what she had said or done, but it still really bothered
Carroll and Bob.  By this time, they didn’t have much patience with her, but I
could understand why.  Finally the 1<sup>st</sup> of October, 2002, there was
another big episode between Mom &amp; Carroll and Mom threatened to beat Cole,
Sherry’s son, and started after him.  Carroll couldn’t take it any longer and
wanted Mom out of her house.  Ken was going to be gone to Mike &amp; Becky’s
doing some work in their basement and then to Roy &amp; Linda’s in California, so I was worried about being alone with her also.  Bob &amp; Ken had talked
about putting Mom in a nursing home, but Irven &amp; Sandy had a fit every time
we talked about it.  They wouldn’t hear of doing it.  I think they felt guilty
about putting Sandy’s mother in one and she wasn’t treated like they thought
she should be.  Anyway, Ken told Bob they would have to do it now.  The doctor
had already told them that they would eventually have to put Mom in one as she
would only get worse and that the hardest thing about this disease is
“caretaker burnout”.  He told them that when they needed to do it to just call
him and he would make the arrangement.  In order to have Medicare pay for it,
they had to put her in the hospital for three days, then 3 months in a nursing
home and they would evaluate her.  If they felt she really needed it, they
would pay for it and take her assets and social security checks.  (In order to
quality for Medicare to do this, the person couldn’t have over $2,000.  Mom
doesn’t.)  Ken called the doctor and then he went on down to Mike’s and left
Bob &amp; I to take care of this situation.  Bob took her to the hospital.  She
was really upset and told him “that’s the last time I will take a ride with
you”.  We called Irven &amp; Sandy, and they were upset with us for doing this,
but came to visit Mom a lot while she was in the hospital.  Bob &amp; I did also. 
Mom was upset and wanted us to take her home.  We could usually calm her down
by playing “rummy” (her favorite card game).  Bob looked for a nice nursing
home, but couldn’t find one close by.  He called me at work and asked if I
could meet him at the South Ogden Rehab (which is a nursing home) as he liked
that one.  I met him after work and was impressed with it also.  It was
carpeted throughout, and was decorated very nice - felt so warm and homey.  Bob
met with the manager the next day and did the paperwork.  I stayed up until
after midnight that night packing Mom’s belongings so Bob and his son, Grant,
could bring them to the nursing home the next afternoon where I met them and
together we arranged her room.  I had taken my nails and hammer and stayed
later to hang her pictures and other decorations on the walls and arrange the
furniture better.       On October 1, 2002, the caseworkers, from the hospital,
were supposed to take Mom from the hospital to the nursing home, but she
wouldn’t go with them.  They finally called Bob and told him.  He called Ken
and together they convinced her to go with them and that they would be taking
her to her new apartment.  She had wanted her own apartment since we took her
out of her home.  She liked it, so after awhile they left.  That evening she
had forgot, and insisted that she use the phone at the nurse’s station where
she called Bob and demanded that he come and get her.  He told her he couldn’t
that night, but he would be up the next day to see her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Well, her calling and being upset and demanding
continued for the next two or three weeks.   We would go there and find her
upset so we would spend the next hour or more convincing her of what a nice
apartment she had and the nice people who were taking care of her and that she
wanted her own apartment and now she had it.  One time when I had gone alone, I
walked her down to the rooms where the fish tank was and also the sun room. 
They were furnished so nice and the atmosphere was wonderful, beautiful,
soothing and relaxing.  I told her how lucky she was to be here and that I
would like to trade her as she didn’t have to worry about anything - that it
was all done for her, nice people doing it for her, and at least one family
member coming to visit her every day.  She had good food, entertainment, games,
church meetings, family home evening, etc., etc.  Maybe I would feel different
if I were there, but it does seem so nice and also nice not to have any
responsibilities - at least for awhile.  I’m so busy all the time that I hardly
have any time to sit down and rest.  I do enjoy my life, however, and it makes
me happy to serve others, especially my family, and accomplish things.  As I
was ready to leave, I gave her a hug and she said “You won’t forget me, will
you?”  That really touched me and I said “Of course not, Mom, I love you and I
will be up here to see you as often as I can.”  She also said, as I was going
out the door, “Tell my family I still love them even thought they put me here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken went to the Priesthood session of October
General conference with his sons, Scott &amp; Jeff.  He had only been gone a
few minutes when Bob knocked on the door of our home (where Scott &amp;
Mishelle were living as Mishelle had invited me to come and be with them while
the guys were at conference).  When I answered it, I found him all upset and he
asked where Ken was.  I told him Ken, Scott &amp; Jeff were at the stake house
for conference.  I could see he was all dressed up to go also, but he asked me
for directions as he said he had to get him and they had to quickly go to the
nursing home as Mom had hit a nurse in the face, took off her shoe, was waving
it back and forth and threatened to hit anyone who came near her.  When Ken got
home, later that night, he explained that when they got there he told Bob to
stay in the car, as he was worried about Bob having a heart attack or stoke as
he was so upset from the phone call.  Mom threatened to hit Ken also when he
started towards her so he sat across the hall from her.  He couldn’t hear her
so she finally told him he could sit by her.  He had a hard time calming her
down and getting her to her room as she had decided she was leaving this
place.  That is where the problem started.  The nurse &amp; aids saw her
heading for the door and told her not to leave.  Well, you don’t tell Mom not
to do anything.  You can’t say “no”, “don’t”, “you can’t do that”, etc.  If you
do, she explodes and you wish you hadn’t.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            She did that to me one day when I was doing the
laundry on a Saturday in her home.  She was taking it out of the dryer and it
was permanent press clothes and she was wrinkling them.  I told her I could do
it and she said “no”, that she had them.  I told her that she was wrinkling
them so she threw them at me, said she couldn’t do anything right anymore and
that she was leaving.  She started swearing, yelling, etc.  I got so upset that
I said things I shouldn’t have also.  When she went out the door, I went in the
bedroom, knelt down and prayed and asked the Lord to help me calm down, to
forgive me, and help me be able to go out and apologize and get things better
again.  He did bless me and I was able to go out and find her working in the
yard, I hugged her and told her I was sorry.  She said she was sorry too and
that we would forget the whole incident.  I was grateful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                 Irven &amp; Sandy finally realized that we
had done the right thing to put Mom in a rest home.  They realized how bad mom
was and that these people were trained to take care of Alzheimer and dementia
patients.  They were happy about how nice the nursing home was (Sandy’s Mom’s wasn’t nearly this nice) and how nice the nurses and aids were to Mom.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Irven made up a schedule for all of us giving us
certain days to be with Mom so she would have family with her every day.  We
didn’t have to be with her 24 hours a day, but someone was there for at least
an hour or longer every day.  The nurses and aids couldn’t believe that we were
there so much, they told us that none of the other patients had visitors so
often.  Cheryl still wanted to come and be with her on Sundays.  Many times,
she would bring her sister, Terry, with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom started having problems with her bowels. 
She got hydroids also, which caused her a lot of pain.  The nurses gave her
medicine for that and they had to clean up a lot of messes.  Many times we
would go there and find a real mess everywhere and it smelled terrible.  We
could hardly stand to go in.  I would gather up all these clothes and wash them
out in the toilet and sink and wash down the bathroom.  I felt bad for Mom as
it really bothered her that she was having these problems.  Mom was a private
person, when it came to things like this, and she was very independent, but she
didn’t have the strength and mentality to take care of these problems now.  
Even though it was hard, I am glad I was able to help her with these things.  I
felt I was showing love for her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Cheryl and Terry came one Sunday and found Mom
in this mess and they were really upset.  Cheryl called us and wanted us all to
come in as she felt the nursing home wasn’t taking care of her Grandma.  Irven
was here and he said he would go in and calm Cheryl and Terry down.  Ken had
had to go in and calm down Irven and Sandy one time when they went in and found
her like that.  Irven &amp; Sandy were so upset that they chewed out the nurses
and aids and had the whole place upset with our family.  The people at the
nursing home did take good care of Mom, but they couldn’t be with her all the
time.  Since she had these problems, they would clean her up and 10 minutes later
she would have a mess again.  We had been with her enough to understand that
and we appreciated how good and patient they were with Mom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It wasn’t long until she couldn’t even play
“Rummy”.  This was the one thing she enjoyed doing, but her mind was so gone
that she couldn’t remember how to play it.  When she started having problems,
we would cheat to have her win the games, as it made her happy to win, but at
the end it would frustrate her to even try to play as she couldn’t remember
anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One day we got a call from the nurse that Mom
had fallen, that she had seen it, checked her over, but couldn’t find anything
wrong.  Mom told her she wanted to go back to bed so she helped her.  She told
us that Mom had been sleeping for a long time and she tried to wake her up, but
couldn’t get her to wake up.  Ken told Bob &amp; Carroll and called Irven &amp;
Sandy and then we left to go to the nursing home.  When we got there, Mom was
still asleep.  We tried to wake her, but couldn’t.  Bob, Irven &amp; Sandy soon
arrived.  We all tried at different times during the evening to wake her, but
couldn’t.  She had gone into a coma.  The nurse said she thought she might have
had a slight stroke as she hadn’t really fallen, but just slid down to the
floor as she was walking out the door of her room.  Mom had only been in the
nursing home for about a month.  We talked that first night and redid our
schedule to have someone with mom around the clock.  They brought in a nice
recliner so we could sleep in it.  We all took turns being with Mom.  Cheryl
came in on Sunday and other times as it was hard on her to know that her
Grandmother was passing away.  We called in Hospice as the nursing home
suggested it.  The nurse came while Cheryl and I were there and asked if we had
any questions.  All of us, including Roy &amp; Linda in California, were
concerned that maybe we were starving her to death since we couldn’t give her
any food or water with her being in a coma and Mom didn’t want any life
support.  I told her our concerns and she explained that this is nature’s way
of shutting down the body.  She said that Mom was peaceful and her body didn’t
want food or water since it was shutting down - that if we gave it to her
intravenously, it would cause problems.  If we gave her water, it would either
go into the lungs and cause pneumonia or cause the body to swell.  If we gave
her food, the digestive system couldn’t handle it.  I was grateful to
understand that.  I knew that mom did seem peaceful.  Sometimes she opened her
eyes a little and I could see that there was not fear or anxiety in them.  Mom
even moved her arms some and we thought that maybe she was coming out of the
coma, but the doctor told us not to expect that as she was dying.  The nurses
from Hospice told us that the last thing to go was the hearing so we should
talk to her and say good, positive things.  We did this.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bob was with Mom when she passed away at 12:01
 a.m. on Nov 7, 2002.  He called us, and Ken called Irven and Cheryl to let
them know, but we decided to wait until the next morning to call the rest of
the family.  Ken called the mortician.  We met the next day at the mortuary
with Irven &amp; Sandy as Bob &amp; Carroll were both sick.  We made the
funeral arrangements, but it wasn’t hard as Mom had a funeral plan with Linquist
Mortuary.  Ken, Sandy &amp; I then stopped at a florist to pick out the
flowers.  We planned the program for the funeral and Irven said he wanted to
speak.  Neither Bob nor Roy wanted to speak so Ken decided he better.  He then
asked Mom’s bishop if he would say a few words.  Sandy said her and her
daughters could sing and our daughter, Sandi, would accompany them.  We decided
to have all the grandchildren and great grandchildren sing “I Am A Child of
God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mom Jensen had wanted to die every
since her third husband, Leo Jensen, had passed away.  She used to say to me
“They say old age is golden, well it isn’t, it’s just a lot of lead” .She also
said: “When you turn 50 years old, they should take you out and shoot you as
you are no good to anyone.”  I would say to her “Mom, I’m over 50 and I don’t
want anyone shooting me.  I love life and I love my family and want to be here
with them.”  Mom Jensen didn’t love life.  She was a negative person and she
was not out-going, like my mother, so she didn’t have many friends.  She would
go to church and sit on the back row and leave quickly after church so she
didn’t have to talk to anyone and yet she would criticize people and say they
were unfriendly and thought they were too good for her as they wouldn’t talk to
her - and yet they didn’t have much of a chance.  She criticized her neighbors
and said they were unfriendly, but she never went to visit them.  I really felt
sorry for her.  She was a good grandmother to Cheryl, but not to her other
grandchildren.  We think the problem was that she loved her children so much
that she thought her grandchildren caused problems for her children so she was
always criticizing them and getting after them.  <b>We told her many times that
she should love them and be a grandmother to them, not a parent, as they
already had parents, but needed good grandparents</b>.   Our children didn’t
want to visit Grandma Jensen, but they loved going to Grandma Porters.  They
knew my mother loved them and was glad to see them.  My mother always
remembered them on their birthdays, Christmas and other times and she had toys
for them to play with at her home and cookies and other goodies for them to
eat.  Ken’s mother didn’t, so it is no wonder they didn’t want to go see her. 
They felt she only wanted to see her children, but not them and that they were
a bother to her.  She had a pool table at her home in Layton so they would go
downstairs right after we arrived and play pool or go outside and play in the
summer, but they were always glad to leave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken’s mom was a good cook and
fixed delicious meals and made the best pies that I have tasted.</b>  I used to
make pies, but when we moved close to Ken’s mom, I never made them as she would
make them for me or we could go to her home and have pie.  That was her
specialty.  She had been a school lunch cook for several years both in Idaho, while her children were young, and in Utah, after they were grown.  She was an
emackulant housekeeper and her home was very important to her.  I would see her
spend money to buy nice things for her home and I knew that was her priority as
she spent her money there instead of on her family.  My money goes to buy gifts
and things for my children and grandchildren; I guess I got this from my mother
as she did this also.  My mother didn’t have nice furniture or other nice
things, but always bought things for her family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved Ken’s Mom, but would be upset with her
attitude and the way she treated our children.  When we lived with her, <b>I
encouraged her to write her history</b>.  She resisted at first saying she
didn’t have anything worthwhile writing about and that no one would want to
read it anyway.  I finally got her to start writing it by asking her questions
about her childhood.  As she started writing it down, she would think of other
things and write them down and seemed to be excited to do it.  I would keep
encouraging her, reading and editing it and then typing it up.  We worked on it
for two or three years while we were living there and I had several rough
drafts.  Sandy, Irven’s, wife offered to take it and type it up on their
computer as she said she had the time and that way we could save it on disks
and make copies for everyone, etc.  They were living in Idaho at the time.  We
didn’t have a computer then and thought I would have to stay late at work and
type it up there, but was glad when she volunteered to do it.  Like a dummy, I
didn’t make a copy of my rough draft.  We never got the disks or copy of Mom’s
history so I finally asked Sandy about it.  They had moved to the state of Washington
by then and she said she didn’t know for sure where it was, that she hadn’t
gotten it done and she thinks that when Mom was visiting them, she might have
given it to her.  I asked Mom about it, but she didn’t remember getting it.  I
asked Sandy to look for it and she said she would, but we never heard anything
more.  I was sick about it as by now, Mom’s mind was going and she couldn’t
remember these things and wouldn’t be able to rewrite her history.  We had
spent so much time on it and it was a valuable history.  Well years went by and
towards the end of Mom’s life, while we were staying with her from July through
September, 2002, Cheryl had been out visiting Mom and while we were gone to our
church meetings, she looked through Mom’s things to find pictures as she is
making a scrapbook for mom &amp; she was going to make copies for all of us. 
She found a large manila envelope which had the Ogden Temple address on it. 
Mom had worked at the Ogden Temple for a few years.  She looked inside it and
there was Mom’s history.  Sandy had given it to Mom and she had put it in this
envelope.  When I had looked through her things for the history and saw this
envelope, I didn’t look inside as I just figured it was mementos from when she
worked at the temple.  I was very excited to have this.  I spent the next
several weeks, whenever I had the time, typing up this rough draft on the
computer.  As I would finish one page, Mom would read it.  She seemed really
happy with it.  One day when I was wrapping Christmas presents (I do them
early) she asked what she could give her children for Christmas.  I told her we
would have her history made into books and we could wrap them and give them as
her Christmas gifts.  She was excited about doing that, however, she didn’t
live until Christmas.  When I finished the history, I sent a copy to Roy &amp;
Linda, gave one to Bob &amp; Carroll &amp; Irven &amp; Sandy for them all to
edit.  They did and it is finished now.  I haven’t had it copied as Cheryl
wants to have the pictures with the history.  I did finish it soon after and
gave a copy to all Mom’s children and to Cheryl.  I think I gave one to each of
our children also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            We had bought some land in Star Valley,
Wyoming and we planned to sell our home in Layton and build there.</b>  I was
planning to retire at age 62 from the district so we put our home up for sale. 
Homes had been selling all around us and our realtor said we wouldn’t have a
hard time selling it as we had taken good care of it and made improvements and
the yards looked great.  We didn’t hear back from him as time went on, so I
finally called him and he said that the market had dropped and homes were not
selling now.  That there were a lot of foreclosures and that if we were to sell
our home, we would practically have to give it away.  We sure didn’t want to do
that again.  Bob &amp; Carroll needed help with Ken &amp; Bob’s Mom who had
Alzheimer’s and had been living in Bob &amp; Carroll’s basement apartment which
Ken had built for their mother.  Ken and I wanted to go on a mission, but we didn’t
know if we should go on a mission first or build our home in Star
 Valley first.  <b>Ken &amp; I thought about what to do - whether to go on a
mission first and let Scott, Mishelle &amp; their family move into our home and
pay what they could for rent and Ken &amp; I move in with Mom to take care of
her.  We made it a matter of prayer and Ken also spent a afternoon in the
Celestial room in the temple to get some answers.  Ken had the feeling that we
should not build up in Star Valley at this time, but we should move in with Mom
and take care of her, have Scott &amp; Mishelle move into our home and continue
planning for a mission - that things would work out.  Well they have. </b> <b>Ken’s
mother passed away the end of November and our mission call to the Philippines
came on Christmas Eve.</b>  . <b>(This was a great spiritual experience for Ken
and I</b>)  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We sold our home to Scott &amp; Mishelle while
we were on our mission as Scott had graduated from college and had a good job
and they wanted to buy a home.  We didn’t end up building our home in Star Valley
as Sandi &amp; Terry had sold their cabin there which was just a couple of
blocks from where our property was, and David &amp; Shauna moved down to Utah. 
He was transferred and they bought a home in Enterprise (North of Morgan).  I
didn’t want to live four hours away from our nearest family as I wanted to
attend birthdays, ball games, and recitals and have dinners and holidays
together.  Plus the building supplies had increased 3 times since we were on
our mission so I didn’t feel we could afford to build our home now.  Ken was
disappointed as he has always wanted to build his own home.  Bob &amp; Carroll
invited us to come and live in their basement apartment again and we have.  Now
we are close to all our children and their families and I love that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Well, Mom Jensen finally got to go
at age 92, in November 2002.  She didn’t want a funeral, but all of us thought
we should have one.  I guess she was right - we shouldn’t have had one as it
didn’t turn out so good.  .  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ken’s Mother’s funeral</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>My Aunt Esther, My Dad’s brother,
Dale’s wife, passed away the same day as Ken’s mom and they had her funeral the
same day as Mom Jensen’s.  Aunt Esther’s funeral was in the morning so Ken
&amp; I went to it.  Several of the children spoke and did a beautiful job and
also Elder Porter, formerly of the Seventy and a relative of ours, spoke.  The
music was beautiful and we really felt the spirit.  We were hoping for that at
Ken’s Mom’s funeral as well, but that wasn’t the case.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>There were more people there than
she thought would come, and the music and speakers were good - except Irven.  
Irven spoke first and spoke for 41 minutes.  He said very inappropriate things,
and said things, that I think would have made Mom feel bad.  Irven’s own
children went out in the hall and were embarrassed at the things he said.  Our
children were upset and went out in the hall also.  Sandy was sitting beside me
and she was nervous about his talk also.  Bob wasn’t feeling well, but he was
so upset that he went to the back of the building and looked up at Irven and
made the cutting signs to get him to stop and sit down.  Irven either didn’t
see him or ignored him and kept going.  Finally, Bob went to the front and sat
right in front of Irven and with a red face, as he was angry by then, he kept
pointing down with his finger and mouthing the words “Sit Down!”, “Sit Down!”. 
Irven saw him this time, looked surprised, but quickly ended and sat down.  Our
children heard comments from others in the audience saying things like “Boy,
make sure you don’t ask Irven Browning to speak at my funeral”, or “No wonder,
their mother didn’t want a funeral if she knew her son would say things like
that.”  It was hard for Ken to speak after that, but he did a great job and
only spoke for 7 minutes.  After another musical number, the Bishop spoke.  He
spoke for 20 minutes which was too long also, his talk was great, but people
were tired as the funeral was too long and they were still upset with Irven’s
talk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went over to Mom’s and Bob &amp; Carroll’s
church house afterwards where their Relief Society had prepared a meal for us. 
It was very good.  All our children could talk about was Irven’s talk.  Irven
and Sandy sat by themselves as their children were sitting at another table.  I
know Irven knew we were upset with him so Ken finally went over and spoke to
him.  We talked about who would be riding together to go up to Driggs,
 Idaho where Mom was to be buried.  Our daughter, Sandi, wanted to go, but
didn’t want to go if Irven &amp; Sandy would be riding with us.  Roy had rented
a van to bring his daughter &amp; family up from California with them - so he
offered to drive it and let us all ride with him as his daughter &amp; family
wouldn’t be going as they were staying with Linda’s Mom.  Bob &amp; Carroll
were still sick so they said they didn’t feel like they could go, so it looked
like Irven &amp; Sandy would be riding with Roy, Linda, Ken &amp; I.  Then
Cheryl said her and Bob wanted to go so Irven offered to drive and they could
go with them.  Ken didn’t sleep much that night as he worried about Cheryl
&amp; Bob riding with Irven &amp; Sandy since Irven &amp; Sandy are so
fanatical now about politics, taxes, etc.  Cheryl called us early the next
morning to say that Bob wasn’t feeling well so he wouldn’t be going, but she
still wanted to go and wondered if she should just drive to our place and go
with us.  That was the answer to our prayers and we told her “yes” and that our
daughter, Sandi, was going with us so they would feel better having each other
without husbands that day.   I told Ken that he shouldn’t call Irven until just
before we were ready to go and just say that Cheryl came here without Bob and
so we would take her with us.  I’m sure they weren’t too happy with us, but we
felt that it was the best solution to our problem.  We had a good time visiting
as we traveled and we enjoyed each other’s company.  Everything went well at
the burial except Irven &amp; Sandy acted a little cold towards us.  Ken’s Aunt
Wilma invited all of us to come to her home in Teton afterwards for lunch.  She
had made soup, chili and pies.  There were other family members at the burial
also and they were also invited.  We had a good time visiting, but Irven &amp;
Sandy were eating in the kitchen with Uncle Lee &amp; Aunt Wilma and the rest
of us were in the front room.  I went in to tell them that we were all getting
together at our place when we got back, so we could divide up Mom’s belongings
as Roy &amp; Linda had to leave the next morning to drive back to California.  They were upset and just said, we’re not coming, just divide it up with yourselves. 
I told them we really would like to have them there and that they should have
part of the furniture, etc., also.  Finally, they relented and said they would
come.  We had a fairly nice time being together and it turned out that Irven
&amp; Sandy got several things so they felt better.  Roy &amp; Linda didn’t
take hardly anything.  They said they had a small home and no place to put more
furniture and they didn’t have room in their vehicle to take it back anyway.  I
also think they realized that they hadn’t been up here to help take care of Mom
and it had been hard on the three siblings &amp; their spouses who did live
here and took care of her.  We invited Roy &amp; Linda to come over the next
morning for Biscuits &amp; gravy before leaving for California and we also invited
Irven &amp; Sandy as we wanted to have family unity again.  They all came and
we did have a nice time and were able to laugh and talk again.  I was grateful
for that as I hate to have bad feelings in the family and it has been a hard
year for all of us.  We can’t stay angry with Irven as he is part of our family
and Heavenly Father tells us to forgive everyone 70 x 7.  We feel better now
too</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ken has had the power of attorney for Mom as Bob didn’t want
to do it and wanted Ken to do it.  Bob is Mom’s oldest son so would normally be
the one to do all that.  With that, Ken has had to make a lot of the decisions
and be the executor.  Irven &amp; Bob didn’t get along too well and they would
keep calling Ken about problems they were having with each other and things
they disagreed on.  Irven &amp; Sandy felt Bob &amp; Carroll should take care
of Mom since they are retired - well, they have for 7 years and were “burned
out”.  They as much as told Bob &amp; Carroll this so it caused resentment, and
when Irven &amp; Sandy came over to take their turns being with Mom (before we
put her in the nursing home), they didn’t tell Bob &amp; Carroll (who lived
upstairs) when they were coming and leaving and they would leave Mom for long
periods of time without saying anything - so this made Bob &amp; Carroll mad at
them.  Irven and Sandy had given us much grief all during the time when we
needed to help Mom after Aunt Vida passed away.  They didn’t seem to agree with
hardly anything the rest of us agreed on.  Things got ugly a couple of times. 
One time we were meeting together at Bob &amp; Carroll’s to decide what to do
and it was tense.  I finally said “The Holy Ghost isn’t here with us when we
are acting this way.  Can we have a prayer and calm down?”  We did and it
helped.  I had some hard feelings towards them for a while, but thank goodness
I have repented and now feel good towards them.  Anyway, it was quite a
feascal, and hard on everyone.  I’m glad that year is over as Ken was about to
his wit’s end,  I wasn’t much better and neither were Bob &amp; Carroll and I
don’t think it was very easy on Irven &amp; Sandy either even though we felt
they were a big part of the problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jeff hadn’t dated for quite a while
after his mission since it was really hard on him that his girl friend, Nicki,
had found someone else just shortly before Jeff came home from his mission, and
in fact, she got married three days after he got home.  They had met at Scott
&amp; Mishelle’s wedding reception as Nicki is a friend to Mishelle’s sister,
and Nicki’s and Mishelle’s parents were good friends.  Nicki had asked
Mishelle’s sister, who that cute guy standing next to Scott was.  She told her
he was Scott’s brother.  Nicki said she would like to go out with him.  They
were introduced and started dating.  They had a lot in common; for one thing, they
both loved music.  Nicki was a beautiful girl and very talented.  She used her
piano talent in beauty pageants and she usually won.  She was Taylorsville’s
Queen also.  They both loved having fun and doing fun things.  When Jeff was
ready to go on his mission, he thought he should break up with Nicki so he
could concentrate fully on his mission, but when he prayed about it, he felt
that Heavenly Father told him that Nicki was to be his wife and he shouldn’t
break up with her.  He was called to the Mexico City Mission.  Nicki said she
wanted to wait for him and she wrote him faithfully until two or three months
before Jeff was to come home.  Nicki would come to our home every other week
and have dinner with us and play games or visit.  I remember one of the last
times she came, she didn’t want to go home and it was getting late, so we
encouraged her to go since it was so late.  I am sure she was engaged at that
time and wanted to tell us, but it was too hard for her.   Nicki’s parents and
family loved Jeff, and at Nicki’s bridal shower, her mom was crying.   When
Nicki said “Can’t you be happy for me?”   Her mom answered “Not when I know you
are marrying the wrong man”  Nicki’s younger brother and sister loved Jeff too
and he loved Nicki and all her family.  Nicki’s parents and siblings came to
the airport, to meet Jeff, when he came home from his mission, they came to his
home coming talk in our Sacrament meeting, and they had him come to their home
and tell them about his mission for Family Home Evening.  They invited Jeff to
Nicki’s wedding and they really wanted him to come.  Jeff took Anna, Trent’s
girlfriend to the reception.  Trent was still on his mission, and Anna was also
a good friend of Jeff’s.   When Jeff saw Nicki walk in front of the big glass
windows in her wedding gown, he couldn’t handle it and told Anna “We’re going
home.”  We didn’t blame Jeff for doing this, as it was too hard on him. 
Because of this, Jeff didn’t date for quite a while.  He went to Weber
University and lived at home with us.  We encouraged him to live at home so he
could save money, and I loved having him home with us.  Jeff also worked and
saved his money.  The Honor Society, of which Jeff was on, went on a trip to
NaPal and Jeff went with them and had a great time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Finally Jeff starting dating a cute
girl named Gail Fairbourn.  They had been casual friends in High School.  I
think he met her again at the Singles Ward.  </p>

Gail wanted to get married</b> and Ken asked When?  Jeff said the 20<sup>th</sup>
of February.  Because our Bishop got pneumonia and hadn’t been able to get our
papers to the stake presidency, we were able to change the date, on our papers,
from February 1<sup>st</sup> to March 1<sup>st</sup>.  We are sure that the
Lord had a hand in that.  Jeff had brought Gail to our home so we could meet
her and we were very impressed with her, but Ken wanted to meet with her
separately, so they set a date and when he came back, he was very impressed
with her and said Jeff had made a wise decision to marry Gail.</p>

align=left hspace=12>When we received our mission call on Christmas Eve 2002,
it said we would go to the Angeles Philippine Mission and be proselyting in the
Tagalong language. We were so surprised.   Because of our health, our
nutritionist, Nancy Litchford, told us that we would not go foreign.  I had
high blood pressure and fibromyalgia and Ken had yeast problems for which he
had to be on a special diet and take lots of supplements.  When the brother,
from the mission department called, he said “I bet you didn’t expect to go on a
foreign mission.”  I said “No, we didn’t.”  He then told me that all senior
couples want to go on English speaking missions as they don’t want to have to
learn a foreign language.  He told me that they don’t have enough places
(United States, Canada and England) to send all these couples to, and he said:
“other countries need you senior couples.   He told us that we would have a
tutor call us three times a week to teach us Tagalong.  This tutor’s name was
Elder Black.  He had been a missionary in the Philippines and was now going to
BYU and was working for the church as a part-time job to help make money for
his studies.  We were told to go to BYU to pick up our manuals and other
materials, which we did.  We also got phone equipment so that Ken and I could
both hear him and use our hands to write down what he told us.  Learning the
language was very hard for Ken, but I was able to memorize enough words to be
able to bear my testimony and pray in Tagalong.  We had told our children that
we would come visit them and spend a few days with each of them before going on
our mission.  We had to take our books along, when we went to visit our
families, and we had a schedule of which day and time he would call us.  Our
sons were excited that we were going foreign because all of them had – Mike to
Norway, David to France and Belgium, Scott to Venezuela, and Jeff to Mexico
City, Mexico.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were able to talk to our family physician,
Dr. Gary Lee, who gave us a letter telling, the authorities at the airports,
that we needed these medicines and supplements for our health and we would be
gone for two years.  We bought and packed one suitcase with our two year’s
supply of supplements and my three month supply of blood pressure medication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> I<b> will continue with my Homecoming talk since it gives a
summary of our mission.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>TALK FOR OUR HOMECOMING MEETING -</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My, what an experience we have had with going on
a full-time mission.  We are so thankful for this opportunity and blessing.  It
has been hard and challenging at times, just like anything we do in life, that
is good and rewarding, but it was a privilege to serve our Heavenly Father and
his children in the Philippines.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             When our stake president, President Sanders,
was interviewing me prior to coming on our mission, he asked if I felt worthy
to represent our Savior, Jesus Christ.  I became emotional and said “I hope so,
I do love him.   Now that our mission is over, I hope that our Savior was
pleased with what we did.   It was a great privilege to represent Him.     </p>

align=left hspace=12>            I have always loved the song “Called to
Serve”.  I loved to sing it in Primary with the children, when I was serving in
the Primary, and when it was added to our Hymn book, I was excited.  As we
joined, with all the other missionaries at our last devotional at the MTC,
before leaving for our missions, and sang that beautiful missionary hymn, I
could hardly sing at all because I had become so emotional.  “Called to serve
him, Heavenly King of Glory, chosen heir to witness for his name, far and wide
we tell the Father’s story, far and wide, his love proclaim.”  When we arrived
in the Philippines and went to our new little branch for our Sunday meetings,
the branch president asked us to sit on the stand and bear our testimonies to
the members.  One of the hymns we sang that morning was this beautiful hymn
“Called to Serve”.  As I looked down at my Filipino brothers and sisters and
heard them singing this hymn, and realized that Elder Browning and I were here
on our missions on the other side of the world, singing this special hymn with
them, again I could hardly sing.   We were “called to serve our Heavenly King
of Glory and chosen to witness for his name.  We had come “far” to tell the
Father’s story and proclaim his love.”  This was the mission we had set a goal
for when we were first married and for which we had hoped and prayed for all
our married life.  And NOW WE WERE HERE.  <b>(This picture is of the District
Choir in the Paniqui District. These were great friends of ours</b>)</p>

align=left hspace=12>            Elder &amp; Sister Clark, our good friends who
were the office couple, e-mailed us and one of the things they told us was “You
will love the people.  They are so friendly, hospitable, affectionate and
kind.  They said “When your mission is over, the office elders will have to
drag you to the airport as you won’t want to leave these people.”  Well, Brother. 
Clark, they didn’t have to drag us to the airport, as we were anxious to see
our family &amp; friends here in America, but it was really hard to leave our
wonderful friends there in the Philippines.  The Guimba District gave us a
“farewell party” and I think I cried most of the evening thinking that I might
not see them again, at least in this life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>This picture is from left to right: Sister &amp; Elder
Browning, Sister &amp; Elder Mcharry, Sister &amp; Elder Hyer and Sister &amp;

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Small miracles took place making it possible for
us to go on our mission, and small miracles took place over there also.  One
such miracle, in the Philippines, was with our good friends Brother Roger &amp;
Sister Heidi Silvia.  They were a wonderful couple with two precious children, but
after setting goal to go to the temple, Satan jumped in was trying to destroy
their marriage.  They knew they had to pay tithing in order to get a temple recommend,
but they didn’t see how they could.  He had just lost his job and they didn’t
have much money to hold them over until he could get a new job.  He had been
trying to find a job, but hadn’t been able to. We told them that the Lord
blessed us after the trial of our faith.  We told them that if they paid their
tithing, the Lord would bless them.  They took the leap of faith and did pay
their tithing and a couple of days later, while he was out looking for a job,
his wife got a call for Roger to come in for an interview with a company he had
applied with.  She called Roger really excited; he went in for the interview
and got the job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am so thankful for the power of prayer and for
the love our Heavenly Father has for his children.  Elder Browning and I would
pray that we would be led and guided as to how we could help these people, and
we were led and guided.   We prayed for inspiration, and we were blessed with
inspiration.  We couldn’t have done what we did without the Lord’s help. 
Brother Browning is amazing.  Sandi, our oldest child, used to tell everyone
when she was little “My dad can fix it, my dad can do anything<u>”. And, he can
do practically anything</u>, but he too needed the Lord’s help on our mission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=151 height=1

align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we first met with our wonderful <b>mission
president, President Grant Brimhall</b>, and his wife, we asked him what he
wanted us to do and he said “Go to your area, see what needs to be fixed and
fix it.”  He said, “We prayed you here, so the Lord will help you.”  The Lord
did help us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We learned to rely on the spirit, as we were
called upon, many times at the last minute. to speak, give a lesson, lead the
music, etc. – the many experiences of a missionary.  Sometimes we would go to
meetings or activities and find our names on the program.  But as we read,
studied, prayed and fasted, the Lord was always there for us and it constantly
amazed us at the help he would give us.  We felt the spirit with us much of the
time, and when we didn’t, we knew it was because we didn’t do our part or have
the right attitude.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>              Many times we would be prompted to go visit
someone, and sometimes to take something to them and when we arrived they would
say “Thank you for coming, I was praying that you would come.” Or, “How did you
know I/we needed you?”  Sometimes, it was just because they were lonely and
needed someone to come and visit with them, sometimes they were sick and needed
a blessing, and sometimes they had serious problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            That is the first problem we tried to “fix” was
getting the brethren to go Home Teaching and the sisters to go ‘Visiting
Teaching”.  This wasn’t happening like it should.  We felt that if the members
were doing this, there wouldn’t be so many lonely, sad, unhappy people, because
they would have their home teachers and visiting teachers, who were their
friends and who cared about them, and they would be the ones to go there and
help them.  They would be the ones, who would be prompted to go visit these
people.  In Mosiah 18:8-9, It says that we will be “willing to bear one
another’s burdens, to comfort those who stand in need of comfort, mourn with
those who mourn and stand as witnesses of Christ at all times, in all things
and in all places.”   The members were not fulfilling these assignments and we
felt that was the reason why there was only about 10% of the members attending
Church.  We fasted and prayed about what to do and we were soon giving
H.T./V.T. workshops and firesides, in our branches and districts and throughout
the mission.  Sometimes we held them with the help of the young missionaries,
and sometimes by ourselves.  At first, we thought we could just teach them how
to do H.T./V.T., teach them what to do, the importance of doing it and give
some inspirational experiences to motivate them, and WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD DO
IT – but it wasn’t that easy.  They are a more laid-back, easy going people. 
They would be excited at first, but it wasn’t long until it would die down
again.  Many of the leaders would get H.T./V.T. organized,  but it was hard for
them to get the members to go.  We kept praying, evaluating &amp; changing, in
the hopes that somehow we could get them to do it.  But, we didn’t feel too
successful in this area.  We hope we helped some.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Soon, we were given instruction, from our area
president &amp; apostle, Elder Dalen Oaks, through our mission president that
President Oaks would like the couple missionaries to go to 5 less-active
families from each branch and give presentations to them.  He gave us a list of
7 topics which we were to develop presentations on, and he said if we were
inspired to do others, that we should do it.  We were having some success with
that and enjoying teaching these families, especially one family – <b>the
Corpus family</b>.  They had one child whose name was “Joy”.   They lived in our
branch in Munoz.  She would call me “Mrs. Universe” and smile as she said it,
and we would kid each other about who was Mrs. Universe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             One evening as we were teaching them, it
started to rain.  They have a tin roof, so it was noisy, and they had to move
in closer to us in order to hear us.  It rained harder and harder and pretty
soon the water started coming into their home.  We decided we better close and
head for home as it looked like a typhoon was on its way.  Brother Corpus said
he would get their boots for us to wear, but Ken told him that we had boots in
the trunk of our car, and asked if he could go out and get them for us.  He did
this and when we went out, we were glad we had on boots as the water was so
high.  We were parked by one of their sewage ditches and as I walked to the
car, I forgot about the ditch as I didn’t see it since the water had filled it
up and overflowed.  I stepped into it and the water was high so it went inside
my boots.  We got into the car and when I got home, I quickly showered and we
poured alcohol all over my feet and legs.  The water is so polluted that it is
dangerous if you get it on you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One evening, as we were leaving a home and it
was raining, as I stepped out the door, <b>a gecko dropped off their roof and
down my neck inside my blouse</b>.  I stifled a scream, as I didn’t want to
embarrass the family.  I quickly ducked down a little, put my hand down my
blouse, grabbed the gecko and threw it out.  When we got into the car, Ken
asked me what that was all about, and I told him.  I was sure glad I was able
to get the gecko out, before it got any further down my body.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we first moved into our cute home in Munoz,
there were geckos on the outside of the screen, and I thought they were cute
and even named them, but as I saw more and more of them in our home and heard
the loud noise they made, I didn’t like them so much anymore.  As I would open
a drawer or cupboard and one would be inside and would scurry around, I would
be scared.  Marlyn cleaned our cupboards, drawers and countertops at least once
or twice a week, so I was glad for that and appreciate her so much.  Marlyn had
served a mission, and she had also been a domestic helper in Hong Cong, so she
really knew how to clean, do laundry and cook very well.  She was certainly a
blessing to us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>With leadership training, we saw more success.</b>  
We had been doing some leadership training, but after a few months in the
mission, Pres. Brimhall, under the direction of Pres. Oaks, changed our
assignment, asking that we go to a branch for a month at a time to train all
the priesthood and auxiliary leaders.  Elder and Sister Clark, who were the
office couple, were asked to help Elder &amp; Sister Maharry and Elder Browning
and I, with this, so we worked together to make a schedule.  We felt this made
a difference and we could see more progress.  We enjoyed getting to know the
members better by being with them at all their meetings and activities for a
month.   We would teach &amp; train, then repeat, follow-up, encourage and
praise them.  We used pictures, over-head transparencies, role plays,
demonstrated &amp; used power point presentations.  We taught them the
importance of having presidency meetings and what we do in presidency meetings
as they were not having them.  We told them “If you fail to plan, you plan to
fail.”  Many were failing – the children or youth were bored and misbehaving
because the leaders &amp; teachers were not prepared, and many of the children
&amp; youth were not coming.  After we worked with the presidencies and trained
them, many became excited and they held their meetings and came prepared.  Most
of these good people wanted help and they appreciated it.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We met with President Gajonera, his counselors
&amp; executive committee at a PEC meeting, and they were excited.  President
Gajonera told us that all of his priesthood and auxiliary leaders were working
hard and magnifying their callings and were visiting and reactivating.  He told
us that the training we had given, had really helped their branch.  We were
grateful that we could help and to see them so excited.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The month went by fast and we would say
“goodbye” and go to the next branch.  We wished we had at least 2 to 6 months
with each branch as 1 month wasn’t enough, but with the Lord’s help, we were
able to help them.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we started this schedule, President &amp;
Sister Brimhall asked us to make primary our priority, and attend there every
week.  They asked us to teach, train and help the leaders so they could
function like Primary should.  They said:  “Primary is where the foundation for
the testimony of the children begins, and we are losing too many children and
youth.”  Primary, in the Philippines, had mainly been a “nursery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first week that we attended Paniqui 1, we
went into primary.  The primary president was an older sister.  Primary wasn’t
functioning like it should, but she was trying.  She asked me to help her. She
had 2 counselors, but they were not helping her, she was doing it all.   I was
able to give her and her counselors some training after primary, and she said “Sister,
I was ready to ask to be released.  I have been the primary president for 10
years.  I love the children, but I was getting tired and discouraged.  No one
seemed to care about primary except me, and no one visited or gave us
training.  Now I want to stay in and I can do it right.  She did do it right. 
We were invited to attend a district activity a few months later, and her
branch had more children than any, and they were really prepared with their
presentation and did so well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            One primary president said “Sister, the children
want you to do “Sharing Time” and “Singing Time” because you make it fun.  I
told her “You and your counselors can make it “fun” also, just follow the
Outline for “Sharing Time and the Sacrament Meeting Presentation”.    Use the
Liahona, prepare well, pray for the spirit to be with you, and be
enthusiastic.  Sister Brimhall said “If you’re having fun, the children are
having fun too”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            President &amp; Sister Brimhall said our second
priority was to be YM &amp; YW and we attended at least one of their Sunday
meetings a month and attended mutual as often as we could.  We were also to
train the Relief Society and the Branch Presidency and Elder’s Quorum.  Ken
trained the men and I trained the women. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We also trained the district leaders, and had
them help us with the trainings whenever they could.  We asked these district
leaders to continue to teach, train, resolve concerns and help these branch
presidencies.  We found that many presidencies if they were not trained, became
overwhelmed and discouraged and just quit coming to church and then became
inactive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was so thankful for the experiences, knowledge
and testimony I had gained from serving, throughout my life, in various
positions in the church.  This helped me so much with being able to train the
leaders in R.S., Y.W. &amp; Primary in the 2 Districts and 14 Branches we
served in.   I was able to share experiences and give suggestions from having
served in these positions, along with teaching them from the “Handbook of
Instructions”.<span style='font-size:16.0pt'>  </span>I read and studied the
handbooks, for these organizations, as I didn’t want to lead any of them astray
– so I learned a lot more.  I was always referring to these handbooks,
highlighting and underlining them.  I’ve learned more about the Handbooks of
Instruction than I ever knew before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There is so much poverty over in the Philippines, and it made us sad to see so many suffer, but there was such a difference when
they joined the church and remained faithful. They had hope, and they were
happy even though they had trials as they trusted in the Lord.  Many of our
Filipino brothers &amp; sisters would delight in telling us about their
conversion and baptism and how it had blessed their lives.  They spoke fondly
of the missionaries who had baptized them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were in the Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch in
January and there is a sweet little sister in Paniqui 3, who had a stroke about
a year ago.  The right side of her body is affected and she can hardly walk and
can’t use her right arm or hand, but she comes to church faithfully and tries
to do whatever she can.  She confided to me that she suffers with much pain but
they can’t afford her pain medication.  She says as she reads the story of
“Job” in the Bible, it comforts her.  She says she reads the Bible, Book of
Mormon &amp; other scriptures every day and that way she feels close to the
Lord and feels his love for her.  She has hope that one day, probably in the
next life, she will be well and whole and if she remains faithful she will be
with her family and our Savior and Heavenly Father in the Celestial Kingdom. 
This sweet sister is only 42 years old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had many experiences we could tell you
about.  Elder Browning and I did a CSP with the young missionaries in our zone
of cleaning and painting hospital beds, and later going to this same hospital
with our batch mates, who were the humanitarian couple missionaries, to deliver
supplies and equipment, and this made it possible for us to take a girl there,
who had a terrible skin disease, to get help at no charge; and also to take 4
perspective missionaries there to get their exams, x-rays and dental work, prior
to going on their mission.  The hospital, doctors and dentists didn’t charge
us.  (More about this on p. 250) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was sad when sisters would confide their
problems to me and then say “Sister, you are the only one I can trust.”  This
is a real problem there – the gossiping and dishonesty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I love children and it was great being able to
meet with the primary children each week.  We also got close to many youth with
meeting with them in YM/YW, Mutual, Youth Conference &amp; other activities.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Marlyn </span></b> -
Most of you know that Brother Browning has health problems and has to watch his
diet or he is in terrible pain.  One of the special blessings we received,
while in the Philippines, was Marlyn, our cute little “house helper”.  Pres.
Brimhall had suggested that we hire a house helper to do our laundry, cooking
and cleaning so we could spend our full time in the work of the Lord.  Elder
Kendall, our zone leader and his companion, Elder Ieniora, found Marlyn for us
(actually, the Lord brought her to us). Marlyn was surely a blessing to us. We
have kept in touch with Marlyn through Facebook and Messenger, and I just
received a message from her saying that her and her family were doing good and
that she just had four more months in Kuwait until she could go back to the
Philippines to her family<b>. (We are messaging back &amp; forth right now. 
This is amazing.  She is in Kuwait and I am here in Utah in the United States,
and we are messaging immediately.  It is October 25, 2017) </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We loved being with the young missionaries. 
They were so dedicated and obedient.  We learned a lot from them as we met with
them in district meetings and zone conference and heard them give workshops. 
Some of them, especially the Filipino Elders, had sad stories also, but we were
proud of them for their sacrifice to come on missions when many times they were
the only member in their family and didn’t receive any support from their
families, and some parents disowned them for joining the church.  We had the Zone
Leaders, who lived close to us, over for breakfast and other meals often, and
enjoyed being with them.  They were dedicated, good missionaries. <b>Elder
Daniel Hulbert</b> was one of them.  We loved him.  When we moved to the Monte
Vista Ward and went to church, we saw Daniel and were so surprised and
excited.  They live in another ward who meets in our building.  He introduced
us to his wife and three children.  They have four now.  We invited their
family to dinner and had a great time.  It is fun to see their family as we
pass by in the building and chat a minute or two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We don’t have time in this meeting to tell you
about these people, but maybe we could tell you some of these in a fireside and
show you pictures of these wonderful people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am so thankful for the gospel – for the <b>“Hope
and Happiness”</b> it brings us.  By living the gospel of Jesus Christ, by
keeping his commandments, we can be happy.  Our Heavenly Father wants us to be
happy.  He said <i>“Men are that they might have joy, that they might have it
more abundantly.</i>” We know many people live &amp; die without knowing of the
beautiful plan of our Heavenly Father &amp; it makes us sad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There is a little primary song that I have been
teaching the children in the Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> branch during the month of
January, and I’m sure these primary children have been learning it also.  It
says: <i>My life is a gift, my life has a plan, my life has a purpose in Heav’n
it began.  My choice was to come to this lovely home on earth and seek for God’s
light to direct me from birth.  I will follow God’s plan for me holding fast to
his word and his love.  I will work and I will pray.  I will always walk in his
way.  Then I will be happy on earth and in my home above.”</i>  These primary
children, along with the primary children throughout the world, are being
taught that they are children of our Heavenly Father.  What a blessing that is
for us to know that we lived with our Heavenly Father before we came to this
earth, that we are his children and he loves us.  Our Savior, Jesus Christ
loved us so much that he atoned for our sins and died on the cross for us.  He
says:  As I have loved you, love one another.”  He also asks us to keep the
commandments, for he knows that if we do, we will be happy.  Another primary
song says”  <i>Keep the commandments, in them there is safety &amp; peace.”</i>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we would say “Goodbye” to these beautiful people, they
would say “When will we see you again?” and we would say “We don’t know whether
we will see you again in this life or not,” and most would say “Well, we will
endure to the end and be together in the Millennium.”  We told them we would
hope and pray for that.  It was hard to leave these special friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We would like to thank all of you for the love
and support you have given us –our children and their special families, our
extended family, friends, neighbors &amp; ward members.  We were like all the
other missionaries, we looked forward to getting mail whether it was letters,
cards, pictures, e-mail, or packages.  I especially want to thank the primary
children and their leaders &amp; teachers for the 6 foot colored paper
Christmas tree with all the stars, candy canes, presents with pictures, names
and messages.  Some messages said, we are proud of you keep up the good work,
others said ‘Remember who you represent, work hard” and others said “We miss
you and love you.”  This last year we received a 6 foot “Autumn Tree” with the
beautiful colored autumn leaves with names, messages and pictures.  We put both
trees on our walls in our living room and enjoyed them both until the time to
come home.  Then we gave one to each of our district primaries so they could
show them to the branch primaries and give them ideas of what they could do for
their missionaries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Our experience in the Philippines</b> when <b>Tina
Linderman</b> woke up in the night having a terrible feeling that something bad
was happening to us and that she needed to pray.  She did pray for our safety
and that was when Ken and I were dropping off the zone leaders after being to
zone leaders conference in Angeles.  Ken usually dropped them off on the side
of the road and let them walk across the road to their home, but this time we
had two boxes of Book of Mormons for them, so he looked both ways and started
to do a U turn to let them off in front of their home, when at that moment a
black car without his lights on was right there on us.  It was a miracle that
he didn’t hit us.  We all screamed and the Elders dove for the floor of the car
and I threw myself over to Ken as the car would have hit me broadside.  The
Lord just put out his hand and stopped that car.  Ken drove off the road and
stopped and we all shook and the black car didn’t move for some time and
finally went on.  I’m sure he was as shaken as we were.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, November 01, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Letter to our family  (Home and Visiting Teaching Fireside
for the Tarlac Stake)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It’s 12:30
 p.m. Saturday afternoon and we just got back from Tarlac.  Elder &amp; Sister
Hyer had invited us to stay at their home in Tarlac since we were giving
another fireside on Home Teaching/Visiting Teaching to the Tarlac Stake last
night.  Since it was Halloween and there are many drunks on the road on
Halloween, they wanted us to stay with them.  They have a lovely home also.  It
is a very colorful home, with brightly colored walls.  It is a gated area, so
is safe.  They were in our area last Tuesday, so they called us and stopped in
to visit and see our home.   It was fun visiting with them and we had them stay
for lunch.  Marlyn, as always, fixed us a nice meal.  When they heard we were
giving this fireside, they ordered a bed so we could stay with them.  We
thought that was really special.  We really enjoyed being with them.  Elder and
Sister Maharry had come to hear our presentation since they will be giving them
also, so Elder &amp; Sister Hyer invited them to come over also for doughnuts
and ice cream Sundays.  It was fun visiting – it was like being home with good
friends.  After the Maharry’s left, we visited a while longer and then went to
bed.  They have a balcony, connected to the bedroom we slept in, and it
overlooks many pastures and farm lands.  It was really beautiful.  This
morning, Sister Hyer fixed bacon, eggs and pancakes.  She said she still likes
to fix and eat American food.  She had fruit also and it was great.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>.  Their assignment is much
different than ours.  We might have already told you that they are Employment
Specialists, and are assigned to five missions.  They are going all over the Philippines giving firesides and career workshops.  They are meeting with business leaders,
government officials, etc., to see about getting more jobs for the people.  I
worry about them as they have no one over them – except for the mission
department in Salt Lake.  They go all over and no one knows where they are or
how they are.  The people in Manilla told them they don’t have to report to
them. They do meet with us, and the other couples in our mission, when we go to
the mission home to meet with President &amp; Sister Brimhall for our “Couple
Conference”.  Us couples usually meet together for breakfast in Tarlac at
McDonalds.  We looked forward to these times, to be together and to eat this
food.  They made wonderful breakfast at McDonalds, over there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When they were at our home, it gave
dad an opportunity to talk with Elder Hyer about his idea of the Church forming
a coop.  The idea behind the coop was to help the farmers modernize their
farming methods, increase production and quality, build better marketing and
create jobs.  Brother Hyer said dad’s ideas were great, but if the Church had
anything at all to do with it, the government would not allow us to sell any of
the products outside of the coop.  This, of course, would defeat the whole
purpose.  I guess that’s one project we won’t try to pursue.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This fireside was intended for the
Leadership of the Stake, but they announced it in all the wards, so many other
members came.  We were able to use our Power Point Presentation because all the
stakes have a projector to which we can plug the cord into our laptop.  They
also have the big screen which comes down – so dad was happy.  He loves to give
the power point presentations.  I like them too as they are so much easier and
nicer than the overhead projectors.  I was a little nervous about this
presentation as we were making major changes to it again this week.  Last week
we were working on our presentations for the Paniqui District Conference and
this week, in our spare time, we were working on this one.  Dad awoke yesterday
morning saying “I’ve thought of some other slides we need to put into our
presentation.”  We were not even through with the narrative for what we had, so
it was frustrating for me as I hate to still be making changes the day of the
presentation, and we do that a lot.  We were only able to go through it once
before it was time to leave, as we had District Meeting in the morning, and we
hadn’t gone through all of it so I was worried about the time it would take and
if it would all fit together well so it would flow, but the Lord blessed us and
it went over really well.  We had a large crowd, even though it was Halloween. 
Elder &amp; Sister Maharry, Brother &amp; Sister Montemayor, and Elder &amp;
Sister Hyer came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Last Monday, for our “P” day, we
went with the Maharry’s to Cabuyaban to see another war memorial,</b> but first
we went to McDonalds for lunch.  Going to McDonalds is a treat for us.  Marlyn
cooks good food for us, and I occasionally make some American food for us, but
all of us couples, including President and Sister Brimhall enjoy going to
McDonalds.  Probably when we get home, we won’t go there again.  They have good
fried chicken with their delicious rice and it is much better than the
hamburgers &amp; fries that we get back in the United States.  Their breakfasts
are delicious also.  Dad &amp; I don’t go to Cabuyaban very often, just mainly
when we are asked to do a workshop, fireside or training there.   There are no
McDonalds in our area, so we don’t eat there very often, but when we go to the
mission home, there are McDonalds along the way in Tarlac and in Angeles.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We stood in awe at the remains of this Japanese
concentration camp, where the Japanese held our American soldiers as prisoners
of war and treated them so inhumanly.  If you read the series “The Children of
Promise”, you would have read all about this camp, along with the other war
memorials we have been to where there was the “Death March” and other camps. 
It was so terrible.  The grounds of this memorial, along with the other
American war memorials, are beautiful.  They are kept up so well.  We sent you
a couple of pictures of this one last week.  One of the pictures of me was
where I was sitting on one of the remains of the original camp.  I thought
about the men who were there and how they were treated, and it made me sad.  I
didn’t feel like smiling for the picture, so it is one of the few pictures of
me without a smile</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>            Ken &amp; I have had
many special Christmases over the years, but one which stands out in our minds
right now is our first Christmas on our mission to the Philippines in 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>Elder &amp;
Sister Swenson –Humanitarian  couple missionaries over the Philippines – our
batch mates.  They invited us to go with them to the Guimba District Hospital
to get an order of supplies &amp; equipment.<b>  </b>As we entered the
hospital, our hearts sank because of the poverty</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>            We met Rose &amp; she
introduced us to the director &amp; head doctor. <b>  </b>After the order was
done, they asked if we would like to walk around the hospital – Sister Swenson
and I were able to take pictures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>I mentioned to
Sister Swenson that it might help some if the beds and other equipment were
painted.  She agreed and said they could probably furnish the paint &amp;
supplies, if our zone could do the service.<b> </b>Elder Browning and I were
excited so we talked to the zone leaders and other missionaries.  They were
excited.  They said what better way to spend Christmas Day than to give
service, like the Lord would have us do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>We received an
E-mail from Elder &amp; Sister Swenson – They said they could not furnish the
paint and other supplies as they found out that they could only do one order,
and the equipment and supplies for the hospital were more important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>Ken and I talked
to Pres. Brimhall about using the money, David had sent us to buy souvenirs for
our Christmas present from their family, for paint, etc.  He said “God Bless
Him”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>We went to
hospital and talked to Rose – She was excited and said we could do it on
Christmas day and New Years day as the families take the patients home on these
days.  Some take them home on the one holiday and some on the other holiday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>We met on
Christmas morning, and Elder Browning and some of the Elders washed down the
beds, tables, benches, etc, while other sanded them and others painted them. 
Rose came to help us and also our branch missionaries.  We all worked together
and had fun doing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            We enjoyed being
together and it was fun doing this service.  Rose and the other hospital doctors,
nurses and staff members were so appreciative.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>            When the equipment and
supplies were to be delivered, Elder &amp; Sister Swenson asked us to go back
with them when the delivery came.  .We were able to be instruments in the
Lord’s hands to help with these services and because of it, we were able to
take Nomi Balioli to get help there. Nomi was a young girl, eight years of age
who had a terrible skin rash and it hurt and burned so badly that she couldn’t
sleep at night and she hated to go to school as it looked so terrible and the
kids would make fun of her.  When I first saw her, my heart broke as she
wouldn’t lift her head up to look at anyone and her long hair fell over her
face.  I asked the counselor, in the branch primary presidency, whose child she
was, and this sister started to cry and said that this girl was hers, and that
her and her husband could not afford to take Nomi to doctors or pay for the
medicine.  Elder Browning and I were able to get her to a dermatologist and we
paid for her medicine.  Great changes happened and Nomi was at last a happy
child when the rash was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>We had four
young men who were ready to go on missions, but they, nor their parents, could
afford the medical examinations or the dental work which needed to be done
before they could turn in their papers to go on their missions. The doctor and
dentist, there at the hospital, consented to do this work for them for free
since our church had done so much for their hospital.  We were very grateful
and so were these young men and their parents..</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><b>            </b>What a blessing
for Nomi &amp; her parents and for these missionaries and their parents, and
what a blessing to the hospital and to all of us.  We were grateful for this
opportunity that our Heavenly Father had given us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>September 30, 2004</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Sister Brimhall,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I enjoyed visiting with you
yesterday.  You are such a “special lady, I am privileged to be your friend.  I
hope to continue striving to become like our Savior and, hopefully, someday I
can be like you.   You are such a “good” person.  You are always concerned
about others.  You are concerned about doing what’s right.  You are very
supportive of your husband and all the priesthood.  You are close to the spirit
because you love the Lord and you love his children.  You are very dedicated
and serve with all your heart, might, mind and strength.  Everyone loves you
and loves being around you because of the way you live your life.  Thank you
for your love and example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I mentioned yesterday that Elder Browning has
received some massage therapy treatments from Sister Nida Valentino of the
Moncada 2nd Branch.  She has helped him a lot with his back and neck problems. 
He doesn’t get the treatments often, just when he is in a lot of pain and on a
Monday, if she is available.  We do stretch exercises each morning and they
help us and we try to walk in the mornings as often as we can, which helps a
lot.  I was thinking, while driving home, that maybe I should explain to you
that Elder Browning does have his garment bottoms on and also his pajama
bottoms on as she gives him the massage therapy treatments.  I know many massage
therapists prefer that you just have a towel over you so they can work the
muscles better, but we don’t feel comfortable doing that, and we certainly
wouldn’t do it while on our mission.   Just thought you should know that.  You
probably assumed that we wouldn’t undress anyway, but wanted to confirm it. 
The first treatment she wouldn’t let us pay her, but after that one, we
insisted as she needs the money so badly.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While I’m writing to you, I thought I would
share with you a little about Elder Browning’s nature.  He is such a good man,
as you already know, but he tends to be more negative than I wish he was. 
However, I can understand because his mother was the most negative little woman
I have ever met.  I grew to love her, but she was very negative and critical. 
Our children didn’t grow to love her as they did my mother, and I felt sorry
for her.  Both Ken and I tried to talk to her about letting us be the parents
and her just be a loving grandmother.  She was very critical with all her
grandchildren so not many of them cared for her.  She had a hard life, but we
all have trials in our lives and it depends on our attitude, and she had a
“bad” attitude.   She was a good person and did Family History work and was a
temple worker for a few years, and she did love her children and the Lord.  
She wanted to die for 25 years before she died at age 92, just prior to our
coming on our mission.  She did suffer from depression and took medication the
last several years, which did help.  I know many people suffer from this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Even thought Elder Browning could see how
negative she was and tried to help her become more positive, he still struggles
with these tendencies.   She didn’t have much patience and he struggles with
this also.  He is impatient with himself at times too.  Of course, he isn’t
nearly as negative as was his mom.  I love him very much and we have a great
marriage.  I just feel bad when you or someone else is saying something
positive, and he says something negative about it.   I remind him of how you
said your friend “Missed her Mission” when he gets too negative.  He is a
perfectionist also, and he can’t “fix” all the problems over here so that
frustrates him.  I tell him to relax, that he doesn’t need to fix it all, but
just do what he can.  He does enjoy the mission and is doing a lot of good. 
The people love, admire and respect him.  He is always thinking of ways to help
them, not just spiritually, but financially as well, as he says “how can they
come to church and fulfill their callings, like they should, when their wives
and children are hungry and they have no job or have a job, but don’t make
enough money that they can eat enough.&quot;  He is also very concerned about
the widow or single lady who struggles.  He feels handicapped because we can’t
speak the language and he gets very frustrated.  I had hoped it would get
easier for him as it doesn’t seem to bother me and the other couples like it
does him.  I just ask questions of them when I don’t understand and am in a
meeting where I need to share or train them, but he doesn’t, he just gets
upset.  They do all speak Tagalog, when they are together, unless they are
speaking directly to us.  Last Sunday in P.E.C. Meeting, Elder Browning was
telling me that 3 times they asked for his opinion, and he told them each time
“I don’t know what you were talking about as I don’t speak your language.” 
Elder Hyer told us that he makes them speak English when he is in meetings with
them and he says they are doing it now when he is with them, but if they don’t,
he says “Speak English”.  Elder Browning won’t do that, I wish he would.  He
feels like he can’t help them because he doesn’t know if they are teaching
incorrect doctrine or not, because he doesn’t understand what they are saying. 
If the missionaries are in the meeting, sometimes he will ask them or sometimes
they will sit by him and translate for him (or us) which is good.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I don’t think I could get him to go on another
foreign mission again because of the language barrier.  I just hope and pray he
won’t say negative things when he gets home about the things that have
frustrated him over here, especially this problem with the language.  I have
talked to him about this as we want to encourage couples to come on missions,
not discourage them in any way.  He has helped &amp; influenced many for good,
with the help of the Lord, so I pray he will remember and give these
experiences for his Homecoming talk and as he talks with his family, neighbors
and friends.  I will do my best to share my feelings about these wonderful
Filipino people and the wonderful experiences we have had here.  Elder Browning
does love many of these people too, and surely has love and a high regard for
both you and President Brimhall and I do also.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Elder Browning is in Guimba now meeting with
President Buccay in the Guimba 1st Branch – so even though he is sick, he went
there to help them.  Wish he could realize the good he is doing.  He probably
wouldn’t appreciate me sharing all this with you, but I felt maybe it would
help you to understand him and why he is as negative at times as he is.  I
certainly don’t want to make myself look great or above him in any way, as I
have many faults and weaknesses of my own and I need to continue to improve
myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        With love and appreciation,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                        Sister Browning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P.S. I’ll look forward to seeing you on the 6th.  Hope you
are feeling much better.  We are feeling some better and we slept better last
night than the night before, so that was good.  We are taking lots of vitamin C
and Echinacea and that is helping, also some zinc lozenges.  We brought these
with us.  With Elder Browning’s health, we are “health nuts”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>**I still believe our church is true coz I knew it. Im not
happy 2 be here but I need. I always read the prayer of women and I always cry.
Thank u.  I love u wrote me. Tnks. Luv u, Sis Browning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>09-11-04 Roda Dela Cruz.  This note was given to me by a
young single adult sister, who is the branch president’s daughter.  He is
branch president of the Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> branch.  Roda is one of our
branch missionaries.  I felt bad when I read this note, as I’m sorry that she’s
not happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>            <b>SHORT
HISTORY OF THE YEAR 2004 – ELDER &amp; SISTER BROWNING</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As we have been asked to give a short history of
this past year, 2004, we have been reflecting on the many experiences we have
had, great people we have met, and wonderful friends we have made.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we first came on our mission, President
Brimhall, our mission president, asked us to go to our area, see what needed to
be fixed and fix it.  We could see that Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching was
not being done, and so we focused on that.  We spend much of our time, that
first year – 2003, on preparing and giving workshops and firesides on these
important assignments, which are given to each of us by the Lord, in our
branches and districts and throughout the mission.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This past year 2004, we have still been doing
some of that, but our main focus, given to us this year by our area president,
President Dallin H. Oaks and our mission president, has been Leadership Training. 
We were to go to each branch in our two districts, for one month each, attend
all their meetings, and train the Priesthood Executive Committee and all the
Auxiliary Organization leaders.  Actually, we started doing this the latter
part of 2003.  President &amp; Sister Brimhall asked us to focus on the Primary
and get the primary organization, in each branch, functioning like it does
according to the “General Handbook of Instructions” and how they are in Utah,
and need to be throughout the world.  When we first went to each branch
primary, they were more like a nursery.  It has been challenging, yet
rewarding, as we have shown, taught and trained these primary leaders.  Many
are humble and after they are trained, they are excited and magnify their callings. 
Many have the handbooks, but they don’t understand them.  Some do not have them
so we ask them to get them ordered immediately and read and study them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            These people are a beautiful people, very
friendly, hospitable and loving, but they are also very child-like.  We have to
keep evaluating our training methods and presentations to make them simpler and
easier to be understood.  We used the Handbook of Instructions, along with
power point presentation with lots of pictures, overhead projector presentations,
books we had put together with pictures showing how to accomplish their
responsibilities and what they are to do.  We gave out lots of handouts and we
did role plays, as well as we ourselves doing “Sharing Time”, “Singing Time”,
and giving the lessons at times.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our second area of focus was the Young Men and
Young Women.  Elder Browning mainly attended the youth Sunday school classes
and Aaronic Priesthood, because the primary rooms were so small, there usually
wasn’t enough room for both of us to attend Primary.  At least once during the
month I would visit the Young Women’s class and we tried to attend Mutual
(mid-week activity) as often as possible to help them and teach them what they
could and should do at mutual activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also trained the Relief Society Presidencies,
but didn’t attend their Sunday meetings.   I did try to attend their Home,
Family, and Personal Enrichment Meetings.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Both Elder Browning and I went visiting with the
branch leaders.  Elder Browning went visiting with the Branch Presidencies and
other Priesthood leaders and I went visiting with the Women’s Auxiliary leaders
to help do activation work.  We both enjoyed this very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            For four months – June, July, August and
September, Elder Browning served as the only counselor in one of our small
branches.  There were so few priesthood holders, who were active, that the
branch was just not progressing.  Our assignment from President Brimhall was to
stimulate activity until they could again be able to carry their own load.  We
found that the main success came through personal visits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We also trained the District Leaders and had
them go with us, as often as possible, to train the branch leadership, as after
we leave, they will have to take over doing this training.  We found most of
the Leaders to be very wonderful, capable, and willing to fulfill their
responsibilities, but a few were challenging to work with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As we have been training Priesthood and
Auxiliary leaders, we have tried to focus on getting them to read and follow
the Church Handbook of Instructions, and hold weekly presidency meetings. 
Although progress has been slow, we have seen progress, and so we are
encouraged.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We enjoyed helping with medical missions.  We
helped with humanitarian work by working with our “batch mates” who are the
Humanitarian Couple Missionaries, here in the Philippines.  We were able to
help bring equipment and supplies to a hospital in our district, and also help
with getting a well of clear, pure water to many families in one of our districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have also had the opportunity of helping to bring a
wonderful and “Golden” family into the gospel by introducing them to the Young
Elders, who taught them, and we were able to fellowship and help teach them. 
They are now some of our dear friends, <b>Tony &amp; Leah Garrison and their
son, Michael</b>.  Tony was an avid reader.  He read the Book of Mormon so
quickly and wanted more LDS literature.  We gave him the D&amp;C and Pearl of
Great Price.  He read them and wanted more.  We had brought with us several LDS
books “The Miracle of Forgiveness” and “Faith Precedes the Miracle” by Spencer
W. Spencer, and several others.  He read them over and over.  Each morning,
Tony would get a cup of coffee, go out on his patio and read in <img width=405
height=1
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image245.jpg"
align=left hspace=12 alt="a_003">his scriptures.  One morning his coffee tasted
terrible so he thought that maybe Leah hadn’t washed the coffee pot, so he
washed it and then made a fresh batch of coffee.  As he started to drink this
cup of coffee, he tasted even worse than the first one, so he dumped it out,
and just continued to read his scriptures.  The next time we met with him, he
told us about this experience and said he had been reading in the D&amp;C
section 88 where it talks about the Word of Wisdom and said “I guess I am not
supposed to be drinking coffee, is that correct?”  We said yes, that it is
against the Word of Wisdom, and the Word of Wisdom is to keep us healthy.  From
that day on, he never drank another cup of coffee.  We were proud of him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Tony had a little café in Munoz and was a
wonderful chef; Leah was also a great cook.  We went to this café sometimes and
so did the Elders who served in this area.  Tony and Leah invited us to their
beautiful home and prepared delicious meals for us. (Not many homes were as
nice as this one in the Philippines.  They also had beautiful furniture, china,
etc.  Tony had met Leah in Hong Gong.  She is Filipino, but was working there
as an entertainer.  Tony was born and raised in Holland.  They lived different
places and bought furniture there.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             One time when they had invited us to dinner and
Family Home Evening, they had invited the Elders also.  As we were sitting in
their living room listening to Tony give the lesson<b>, I saw a large rat
running back and forth along the top of their entertainment center.</b>  Ken
and I were sitting on a couch, in front of the entertainment center.  The
Elders were sitting on a love seat at one end of the living room and Tony, Leah
and Michael were sitting on a love seat on the other end of the living room. 
As I watched in horror at this rat, it jumped and flew across the room in the
direction of the Elder’s and lit on the back of their love seat.  It ran down
the back of the love seat and ran along the side of the wall and into another
room.  The others didn’t notice the rat, Ken hadn’t either as they were focused
on Tony.  I was so grateful that the rat hadn’t jumped in my direction, or I
would have screamed and ducked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Tony was baptized and then given the Aaronic
Priesthood and then he baptized Leah and Michael.  Leah’s 17-year-old niece
lived with them for awhile.  When I told her about the Personal Progress
Program, she became excited.  I gave her the book and she started working on
the requirements to receive her certificate and her YW medallion.  This program
usually takes the girls at least 3 years to complete, but since she had to have
it finished before she turned 18, she worked and studied hard, she finished all
the requirements in less than a year.  We were proud of her.  When we returned
home, we were so busy that we didn’t keep in touch with them and later we found
out that Tony had been in a terrible accident and was in the hospital for a
long time.  He almost lost his life.  He was riding his motorcycle late at
night, coming home from his café, and ran into a caribou.  This accident left
him with many injuries and caused him to be by-polar, changing his
personality.  Finally, Leah couldn’t take it and she divorced Tony.  We were
very sad to hear that.  Tony told us by way of Facebook.  He was living in
Norway with his daughter from an earlier marriage.  He said that Leah didn’t go
to church anymore, but that he was still trying to go and to read the
scriptures.  We were happy to hear that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We saw other rats there as we would visit the
families – some in their homes and some outside.  I hated them.  One time I saw
a rat on top of the table in one of the homes.  We were sitting in the living
room, but I could see into the kitchen.  The rat was trying to get into the
food that was on the table, but they had covers over the food, thank goodness. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Elder Browning and I were asked by our
branch president to help him with the <b>Health Fair,</b> he took us to see the
<b>Mayor of Munoz.</b>  We needed to ask him if we could use a school or other
venue to hold this Health Fair.  When we arrived at the office of the Mayor,
his waiting room was full, and we thought “Oh dear, we are going to have to
wait a long time, and we don’t have a lot of time to waste.”  The branch
president <b>(find his name) </b>talked to the receptionist and the next thing
we knew, we were invited into his office.  We introduced ourselves and told him
the reason for our visit.  He was very gracious and made a couple of phone
calls and told us that we could use the elementary school.  He had talked to
the principal and she would be expecting us to come and look over it and give
her the details of what we would be needing.  He told us if there was anything
else we needed, to please come see him.  He told us that he would like to come
to our Health Fair too, and we were excited.  This was a big project.  This was
supposed to be the responsibility of the District Presidency, but they handed
it down to the branch presidency and they were over whelmed with it, and that’s
why they asked for our help.  We worked with the couple missionary who were
over these health fairs to get the instructions, etc.  We had many in our
branch help us and together we were able to pull it off.  There were displays,
presentations and demonstrations.  These were set up all around the outside of
the front of the school.  There was a nursing station where the people could
get vaccinations, their blood pressure checked, a minimal physical checkup,
etc.  There was a program at the end of each day.  This was a three-day health
fair.  The school children, from all the schools attended and some preformed at
the programs, families attended, business and political leaders and the church
leaders.  It was very successful.  It was stressful for Ken and I, but it was
well worth it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After this, whenever there was a cultural or
entertainment event that the city put on (which was several), the mayor sent
Elder Browning and I a personal invitation.  We would be excited and when we
went to the first one, we got there a little early, and just sat down about in
the middle of the auditorium.  Before long, here came the Mayor walking down to
us.  He told us to follow him and he lead us to the front of the auditorium and
had us sit on the front row with some other dignitaries.  He asked if we would
help present the beautiful leis to the performers at the end of their
performances.  We were happy to do this, but wondered why he would want us to
do this.  There were camera men there taking pictures and we realized we were
being pyrographed also. We worried that maybe our mission president wouldn’t
want us to spend our valuable mission time going to these events and thought he
might find out about it since we might be on the news.  We called President
Brimhall and told him about this and asked what we should do.  He was excited
and told us to keep attending them as it was good publicity for our church.  We
enjoyed these events and each time the Mayor would insist that we sit on the
front row and help present the gifts or leis.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We saw other rats there as we would visit the
families – some in their homes and some outside.  I hated them.  One time I saw
a rat on top of the table in one of the homes.  We were sitting in the living

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>(Tell about the mayor of Munoz here and the
activities he invited us to, etc…………….( I did write it up on Nov. 25, 2017,
find it).</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.   We have also met several special people and families
while walking at the college near us, in the mornings.  We are currently
helping the Lord to prepare them to be taught the gospel.  We have given other
referrals to the Young Elders, as that is the Young Elders responsibility to
teach, but we, as couple missionaries, are to help with activation, retention
and mainly Leadership Training.  One such couple we met while on our morning
walks was the <b>Anywanu family.</b>  We met <b>Marie </b>first and enjoyed
visiting with her.  She told us about her family, how her husband was from
Africa and was here in the Philippines, at this college, getting his doctorate
degree.  They have these four beautiful children.  She wanted us to meet them
and invited us to dinner at their home.  We went and had a wonderful time
visiting and eating the delicious meal she prepared.  She made wonderful home
baked bread, and we bought loafs from her several times.  We invited their
family for dinner also.  They are Christian and 7<sup>th</sup> Day Adventists. 
We discussed religion.  We asked if we could show them some of our beautiful
videos on the Savior and they said they could reserve a pavilion near their
home and wondered if <img width=283 height=1

align=left hspace=12>they could invite their friends.  We were excited and said
“certainly”.  We took our projector, screen and videos and I made brownies, and
it was a success.  Many came and were impressed with the videos and we all had
a wonderful time afterwards discussing them and getting to know each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We have helped to prepare couples and families
to go to the temple.  We were privileged to go to the Manila temple and witness
the temple marriages of one family and four young couples. We loved this family
and all these couples, but two of them we are especially impressed with <b>Ronald
and Crisanta Dator</b> and <b>William and Anna Liza Mactal Buccay</b>.  Roger
was single, when we met him.  He lived in our branch and we had visited him and
his parents and siblings.  We needed some electrical work done in our home, so
we hired Ronald and he did a great job.  We had him do other electrical jobs
for us after that.  He met Crisanta, a beautiful, wonderful, spiritual young
woman.  They fell in love and we were privileged to teach them the temple
preparation lessons and go to the Manila Temple with them when they were
married for time and all eternity.  It was a wonderful ceremony and a wonderful
day.  Ronald’s older brother married a righteous woman in the temple and they
had two little children when we first met them.  We hired him (can’t remember
his name right now) to wash our car at least once a week.  He had a trike with
a sidecar and had this as his main business – like a Taxi business.  Many men
did that.  He took our daughters, Sandi &amp; Shellie, for a ride on his trike
when they were visiting us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We met <b>Anna Liza</b> at a YW activity as she
was the District Young Women’s President.  She was a beautiful, outstanding
young woman with many talents and leadership ability.  We were very impressed
with her.  She lived in Guimba and we visited her, her parents and siblings in
the parent’s home.  We fell in love with all of them.  Her parents are such
wonderful people and her sisters were beautiful and special too.  William came
home from his mission and he and Anna Liza started dating.  They got too
intimate, so had to be disfellowshipped.  That was hard on them and on us. 
They kept coming to church faithfully, but they couldn’t take the sacrament or
hold positions, so she was released from being the YW president.  In time they
both fully repented and were able to make plans to be married in the Manila
Temple.  We were privileged to work with them and teach them lessons.  About
that time, President Oaks was released from being our Area President as his
time was up and we were sad to have him leave.  President Maines was his
counselor and he was sustained as the new area president.  President Oaks was
pretty lenient with the couple missionaries and let us go to the temple with
our branch members on their branch temple trips and with these special couples
who were to be married there.  He also let us couples travel with each other to
see various beautiful places here in the Philippines, on our “P” days or on
holidays.  Elder &amp; Sister Hyer had a van and us four couples fit in it and
we enjoyed these trips tremendously.  President Maines stopped all that and
told the mission presidents that the couples were not to travel outside our
missions and that went for going to the temple also as it was in Manila and
outside of our mission.  When we heard that and told Anna Liza and William that
we would not be able to go with them to the temple, they said that they were
not going to go to the temple without us.  We tried to explain to them why we
couldn’t, but they were insistent that we go with them, so we talked to
President Brimhall and he talked to President Maines and explained this
situation, and he finally made an exception for this one time.  We were
thrilled and it was a beautiful day in the temple with this special couple and
their family and friends<b>.  (This picture is of them with us. They are
holding the wedding gift we gave them).</b>  We keep in touch with them through
Facebook and Email and we found out that Anna Liza got her teaching degree and
is teaching school.  They were only able to have one child – a son, who they
love very much.  William was put in as branch president and later as a counselor
to President Mario Gasmena in the District Presidency.  She has had many
positions in her branch and district.  We love them.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>            Ken and I tried to talk to Anna Liza’s parents
about being sealed in the temple and then having their children sealed to them,
but her father said that they didn’t have the money to pay tithing.  We talked
to them about having faith, paying it first and then the Lord would bless
them.  Anna Liza’s sisters wanted to be married in the temple and they found
handsome, righteous men who they did marry in the temple.  We found out later
that the parents did take the leap of faith and started paying tithing, got
their recommends and were sealed to each other and their family.  What a happy
family they are now, however, the father has had health problems and been in
the hospital at times.  We love this special family.  Anna Liza and her sisters
put pictures of them, their families and their parents with all the family
together, on Facebook and we love seeing these pictures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were called upon to speak at many branch and
district meetings and activities, sometimes at the last minute, so we are very
thankful to the Lord for his help and inspiration.  On two different occasions
– one was a Guimba District Young Women’s conference.  I was handed a program
when we walked in, and my name was on the program as the main speaker.  That
caught me off guard as I hadn’t been asked.  In fact, we had just come from the
Paniqui District where we had done some training, and we almost hadn’t stopped
at this YW Conference.  Thankfully, the Lord blessed me again, as he did many
times and I felt He put words in my mouth.  I remember speaking on the Young
Woman’s program, but I don’t remember what I said.  Ken and others said I gave
a good talk.  Another time was when I went to the Guimba District primary
program and activity, and again my name was on the program and I hadn’t been
asked to speak.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we went to the Paniqui District Leadership
trainings, which they held once a month, President Nadado or one of his
counselors would either ask us as we came in, if we would train the R.S. or
Primary or YW for me, and the Elder’s Quorum and branch presidencies for Ken or
sometimes, they would just announce, from the pulpit, that we would be training
a certain organization or priesthood group – so we had to be prepared. I would
have been really stressed if asked to do that over here, but with the Lord’s
help, and “angels to bear us up”, like we were told in our priesthood
blessings, we were able to do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             We have gone through several typhoons during
this year, three of which caused quite extensive damage with considerable loss
to property, farm crops &amp; lives.  We had the opportunity to help render
relief to many victims of these storms.  We met with the district R.S. leaders
and they had a check from the district president, so we went shopping.  We came
back and with others helping, we divided up this food (rice, sardines,
crackers, medicines, etc.) into cloth sacks and went to deliver it to the families. 
Ken and I drove our car to different areas and then, with our boots on, we
walked through the water to deliver the food, etc.  We saw some sad sights.  In
November, there were two typhoons that caused quite extensive damage and then
followed reports of a “super” typhoon that was coming in.  <img width=277

align=left hspace=12>There were massive preparations for this storm.   However,
when the storm hit, the winds stayed high, basically not touching the ground
and was only 24 hours of a high wind noise, almost like the noise of jet
airplanes over head.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We loved serving the Lord and serving these
wonderful Filipino brothers and sisters in our two districts<b>.  President
Mercado was the district president of the Guimba District</b> and <b>President
Patronilo Nadado was the president from the Paniqui District.</b>  We grew to
love and respect <b>President Nadado and his sweet wife</b> and their children,
and we became good friends.  They invited us to their home for dinner and I
think Family Home Evening.  They told us their stories of how they met and the
circumstances surrounding their romance, and the trials and difficulties they
faced.  Theirs was such a fascinating story that I typed it up and send it in
to the Ensign, hoping that it would be printed in one of the issues, but it
wasn’t.  The picture is of the Nadado family.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            We had the opportunity of having our two
daughters, <b>Sandi and Shellie, come to the Philippines</b> and spend 10 days
with us in February.  This opportunity came as a result of our eldest
daughter’s husband (Terry) being killed in a car accident on November 21<sup>st</sup>
of 2003.  This was the evening of Sandi’s birthday, so what a horrible birthday
that was.  After counseling with our mission president, he asked that we
consider remaining on our mission, rather than returning home for the funeral. 
His suggestion was that we have our daughter come over and spend time with us
after the funeral.  He said that it might be good for her to get away, relax
and enjoy being with us.  He said we could take time off to take her to some of
the beautiful places here in the Philippines.  We called Sandi, and she agreed
that we shouldn’t leave our mission and that she would love to come visit us in
the Philippines.  As we were concerned with our daughter traveling alone, we
also invited her sister, who was excited to join her.  We had a wonderful
experience, of a lifetime, with them and were able to take them to see some of
the beautiful sights here in the Philippines.  We took them up the mountains
and through the jungle to Balair.  Balair is located right by the ocean and they
have a beautiful resort there.  When Ken and I would go there, either by
ourselves, or with one of the other couples (Maharry’s or Clarks), to help the
branch with their branch conference or to do trainings for them, we would stay
in the beautiful motel on the sandy ocean beach.  We would walk along the beach
in the evenings, pick up sea shells and just enjoy looking at the ocean.  We
knew Sandi &amp; Shellie would love to go there, and they did.  We ate in the
restaurant there at the resort, but none of us enjoyed the food too much.   The
girls put on their swimming suits and enjoyed playing in the ocean while Ken
and I took pictures and walked along the beach.  We took them to Baguio, where
we had gone with the other couples for our Easter holiday.  We had stayed in
the Camp John Hayes Hotel, which is really beautiful and is a resort area. 
Baguio has a more mild climate, not as hot and humid as where we live, and most
of the Philippines.  It is more on the mountains and is so beautiful there. 
They raise lots of fruits and vegetables.  There are many carving shops,
jewelry shops, etc., so the girls wanted to go shopping and we spent a couple
of fun, wonderful days at this hotel and in Baguio.  We also took them to
another area, where we had hiked the mountain with the Clarks to a beautiful
waterfall.  The trail isn’t too easy as we had to climb over large boulders and
logs and cross the river on makeshift bridges.  Luckily, both times we went
there (with the Clarks and with the girls), there were youth climbing also, and
they were happy to help us.  We sure appreciated them.  It was fun and very
beautiful there.  We went lots of places – walked over hanging bridges and took
pictures of the beautiful rivers and lush, green landscapes below.  We also
took them with us as we went to meetings and did some training and teaching. 
They were so graciously accepted by the wonderful members here in the
Philippines.  The children really loved them too, and Sandi &amp; Shellie
played with some children, outside, when we were in one of our meetings, and
they had a great time.  The children didn’t want them to quit when Sandi &amp;
Shellie got tired.  We hated to take our daughters back to Manila to the
airport at the end of their two week vacation, the time had gone by so fast.  We
had such a great time and loved being with these special, beautiful daughters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Unlike the young Elders, who often count their
success by the number of baptisms they have had, our success is in seeing the
wards and branches progressing and members excited as they fulfill and magnify
their callings.  It is also in watching member’s testimonies grow of the Lord,
Jesus Christ as they pray, study the scriptures and keep his commandments, and
to see families become active in the Church and be sealed together in the Holy
Temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            2004 has been an exciting year, filled with many
wonderful, as well as challenging experiences and meeting many wonderful
friends, who are our brothers and sisters in this part of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Saturday, August 07, 2004   </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ken still has some health problems</b>.  I think they are
mainly caused by diet and <b><u>stress.</u></b>  He wants to “fix” everything
and he can’t fix everything over here and it is hard on him.  He gets
frustrated and discouraged.  Sometimes I don’t help him, as I get upset with
him when he gets to talking negatively, especially when he says he doesn’t
think we are accomplishing anything, when I am sure we are.  I tell him “I can
see progress even if you can’t.”  I wish he could relax more and enjoy the
mission more.  Satan wants Ken to get discouraged, I’m sure, as he knows how
Ken wants to help these people &amp; can help them.  President and Sister
Brimhall are always praising us for all we’re doing, so I tell him that the
mission president thinks we’re doing great.  When President Oaks left, he told
the people that in ten years, he feels the Church will be flourishing in the
Philippines.</p>

</span></span><b>Sister Iluminada Vigilia</b> – She is a cute older sister who
just lost her husband.  She is a retired school teacher, and she always looks
so nice – she is slim &amp; trim and beautiful, except for her teeth.  She has
one crooked tooth in front and has lost most of the others.  Her hair always
looks nice, she has nice clothes, even though they are probably old, she wears
jewelry and nice sandals.  She always looks “klassy”.  I think she bought and
wore these clothes when she was a school teacher.  She is the chorister in
Sacrament Meeting and does a great job… She told me that I am the only couple
missionary sister that she has ever been close to, and that she loves me.  I
love her too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:2.25pt'>She  thanked me
today for bringing her food during the flooding and asked if I instigated it. 
I told her that the District Presidency got the money from the PBO and gave it
to us and we got together with President Cabuyaban and other leaders to have a
meeting to decide what food we need and how many need it and who to how to
disperse it.  All 3 branches were affected.  Elder Browning got a little
impatient because they were not accomplishing much in the meeting and finally
he told them to give him the money and we would take the district R.S.
presidency and buy the food.  They could decide who the food is to go to, but   we
would get it and meet other sisters at our R.S. president’s home, Sister   Villanuela
and package the food and then we could all take it around – which we   did.  I
loved visiting the people as we gave it out.  We went over to where 7 families
were isolated and without food because the river was too deep and too  wide to
get across.  The bridge washed out last year in a typhoon and the government
won’t build a new one for them.  Ken bought a rope for them and a  tatay
(father) on this side of the river who has family over on the other side, went into
the water and tied the rope around a big tree and then swam across the river with
the rest of the rope and then tied it to another big tree on the other side. 
This way the tatays could get back and forth across the river.  We left the
packages of food with the older father and he will see that his children get
the food. </p>

She pulled me aside soon after we started going to this branch and said she was
so worried about her granddaughter as she heard she was in trouble with the law
because she was helping her boss to smuggle in other girls to be entertainers
who didn’t have visa’s.  She said she couldn’t eat or sleep for worrying about
her.  She asked me what she could do.  I prayed with her and for her
granddaughter and put her name in the temple.  Since then, we have become close
and today she told me that she heard we were to be transferred this week and
asked if that was true.  I told her “no”, however, Elder Browning might be
released from being 1<sup>st</sup> counselor to Pres. Cabuyaban soon as Pres.
Brimhall needed us to help train the leaders in other branches.  She said when
she heard that we would be transferred; she started to cry as she will miss me

children missed her and got sick – both physically and emotionally, so she quit
to take care of them.  She is a pretty woman except for her teeth also.  Many
Filipino women (and men) have lost most of their teeth, or they are crooked
because they cannot afford to go to a dentist.  She told me yesterday when she

doesn’t work.  Not sure if he is as sick as he makes out or not – maybe he is,
but most men over here are lazy.  She works at a school as a custodian.  She
doesn’t make much money so they are struggling.  She has been a member of the
church for 32 years.  Her mother is a temple worker at the Manila Temple. 
Sister De Guzman does handicrafts.  I went to her house to buy some and they
are very nice – klenex boxes, letter holders, purses, hats, etc.  I bought most
of what she had for P500.  She doesn’t have the lace, ribbon and flowers to
finish them up, so I paid her in advance for them so she could buy these
materials – but she used the money to take her husband to the doctor and get
medicine.  I gave her another P200 and ordered another purse &amp; hat, but she
again used the money for food for her family.  I think I will go buy the
materials, take to her and then pick up the items soon.  She is a nice lady. 
Their home is also tiny with a dirt floor.  She has a darling daughter who is
10 years old and in primary.  She is also a smart girl.  She has 3 teenage
daughters and an older son who is a drunk.  She feels so bad about him.  She
wanted him to go on a mission and kind of blames the branch for not helping him
more.  He got attached to one of the missionaries and when he went home, the
son went inactive and started drinking with his old friends again.</p>

where we rode practically bareback on thin, boney mules up a mountain to see
inside the volcano.  My behind was so sore after that ride that I was
miserable.  It was beautiful up there to look down from where we had come and
also to look inside the volcano, but I was dreading the trip back down.  We
also went to <b>a beautiful river where you could hire men to take you in a
canoe up the river to a beautiful waterfall and then back again.  That was a
trip of a lifetime</b>.  The walls of the mountains were covered with green,
lush bushes, ivey, etc.  They told us that if we wanted to ride the raft to the

wanted to do this.  When the Filipino men paddled the raft under the waterfall,
it was like amazing – so much water falling on you and then to be inside this
giant waterfall was also amazing.  We rode back down the river, changed clothes
and were thrilled that we had this opportunity.</p>

He is a returned missionary and they are such a sharp couple.  She was the

fell in love, and Satan tempted them, they fornicated and they had to be on
disciplinary action for about 6 months.  They had to be released from all their
callings, not partake of the sacrament or function in every way, but they came
faithfully and did whatever Pres. Cabuyaban asked them to do, so we were proud
of them.</p>

her husband and family are great.  He has a problem with tithing, so didn’t go
to the temple with Analiza and William.  Ken had been really working with him
to realize that if he had faith and just paid it at the first of the month when
he gets his check, the Lord would bless him and he would have enough to pay his
bills.  Guess he still lacks faith.  Hope he will gain it soon.  He told us
that they are working towards going to the temple.</p>

dedicated.  She is good with the children. Has had many trials.  She has a son
who has mental problems and killed a man and intended to kill several others
because they made fun of him.  He was put in prison (was supposed to be an
institution for the mentally retarded)  Sis. Dela Cruz works hard and only
makes P100 a day and it cost that much for the medication for her son.  She has
twin sons about 14, a daughter about 15 and older children.  Her husband is not
active and I’ve been told is mean to her.  She is a little heavy, but so
humble, sweet and childlike.  I love her.  About a month ago, she was given
P1,000 to pay to have her son put in the institution, and to pay for his
medicine.  Well she spent some of it to buy soda pop for some of the guards
(again, so childlike – she shouldn’t have done that as it was fast offering
money, not her money.  When asked by Pres. Cabuyaban why she did that, she said
because she wanted to be nice to them and give them a treat) Someone robbed her
wallet from her while she was riding in a jeepnie, so she was so distraught.  I
tried to comfort her and prayed with her, but she kept crying.  She said the
money wasn’t as important as the papers and cards in the wallet.  Her tax card
was there and she needed it along with a deed to the land where their house is,
etc.  I felt so bad for her.  She has still been faithful to come every week to
church and is still cheerful now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>PROBLEMS IN THE PHILIPPINES:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marlynn’s, (our maid) brother has been having great trials
lately.  There have been robbery’s going on and he was a suspect.  We’re sure
he is innocent as he is a RM (“Returned Missionary”that doesn’t always mean too
much, especially over here), but he was home teaching and his partner verifies
that and also the people they visited, on the date that a witness said he was
in Cabanatuan helping with a robbery.  He was engaged to be married to a fine
young woman, who is also a RM, and they were to be married in December, but a
man from Tarlac, came to church today and reported to her Bishop that the girl
committed fornification with him and he wanted to come and get it cleared up. 
He has been excommunicated as he was a missionary, but she has not confessed. 
She also went on a mission and lied to do so.  Marlynn’s brother is very
distressed, as we can imagine.  He wonders why he is having such great trials.</p>

of Church callings, make assignments and appointments.  As to out of load, many
buy their time or load card at P30 each.  That is a very expensive way to buy because
you have to use those cards within 24 hours or lose the time.  We buy a P300
card and that time is good for two months.  </p>

are few families that have their own transportation.</b>  Of those that do, it
will probably be a bike, or a scooter, a motorcycle, a trike and occasionally a
car. Some farmers have converted a farm implement (kulikliks) which is like a
large hand garden motivator with the blades taken off and tires installed and
attached to a trailer.  Farm implements do not have to be licensed and taxed as
are other forms of transportation.  Public transportation is “Trikes” which is
a small motorcycle with side car. These are everywhere and often a cause of
traffic blockages.  There are “Jeepnies”  which is a model of the old army jeep
with a long body and is build to accommodate 10 to 12 people but you often see
14 to 18 and some times we have seen as many as 6 to 12 people hanging on the
top and rear bumper.  Busses are used for long distance travel and are mainly
found only on major highways.  Because they are large the driver often is rude
and pushes the right of way.  We see many motorcycle operators with helmets,
often hanging from their arm.  If there more that on person on a motorcycle and
the operator has a helmet his passengers will not.  Often you see babies, 6
months old and up riding in front between the fathers knees.  We often see 3 to
4 passengers on a motorcycle.</p>

one that had to be removed in order to put underground utilities in.  After
covering up the utilities the ground was raked down and a funeral was held with
the placement of a cross, flowers and candles burned through the night.  </p>

the eyes of North Americans, <b>the Filipino people are polite in some ways and
rude in other ways.  </b>For example, when you are talking with them and they
need to go, they will say “please excuse me, I need to go now.”  If someone
comes over to talk to them, they don’t just walk away from you or turn away
from you, they say “Please excuse me”.  If two people are talking and blocking
the hallway or doorway, etc., and a person needs to go in front of them, they
will crouch down, put their hands together and say “please excuse me” or “cuse
me”.  But, if they are in meetings, many think nothing of talking to other
people while someone is speaking from the pulpit or a teacher is in front
teaching a class.  They also think nothing of getting up and walking out –
whether to go to the bathroom, to txt someone, or just walk outside for a few
minutes.  Adults as well as children and youth, do this.  We are trying to
teach them reverence and that this is also rude.  They are also rude on the
roads and in traffic.  They walk, drive or stop anywhere or anytime they want,
and they are not concerned about how it affects other people.</p>

said she had just the position for me.  I wondered if it was to be her
secretary again.  She is the Assistant Superintendent.  I declined as I really
want to have time now to enjoy my family and have time to visit and travel,

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2005</b>    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The past two years we were on a
mission to the Philippines.  Our special primary, from our home ward, sent us a
6’ green paper Christmas tree with all kinds of paper ornaments, stars, candy
canes &amp; presents, taped to the tree.  These items had messages and names
from the primary children, their teachers and the presidency.  We taped it to
our living room wall and left it up all year so we could enjoy it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Filipino people celebrate Christmas a little
differently than we do.  They start celebrating in September and end the 30<sup>th</sup>
of December – they celebrate all during the “ber” months.  They start playing
Christmas music, putting up their lights and other decorations, and come
caroling right after the 1<sup>st</sup> of September.  Many children and youth
come caroling, but they don’t just do it as a service or something fun to do,
they expect to be paid.  That is the main time in the year that these children
can get some pesos.  If you give them treats besides the money, they are really
excited.   In one town, most of the people make beautiful Christmas lanterns
during the year and in September; they put up lots of little shops on both
sides of the road for about a mile.  These shops are made very simple, out of
bamboo poles, and at night they turn the lanterns on and they are so
beautiful.  We loved going to meetings and trainings in Paniqui at night, as we
would go through this town and see these beautiful lights.   The people don’t
have much money, they are a very poor people, but they love to have parties at
this time of year.  For their branch Christmas parties, they would plan the
party for 1 pm at the church, but they were always at least ½ hour to 3 hours
late starting as the people always come late.  They would play games, have a
program with lots of entertainment and eat a simple meal.  Their parties would
last several hours.  The weather was always hot in the Philippines, so it didn’t seem like Christmas, but we loved celebrating with them.  Last
Christmas, most of the members of our “home” branch came Christmas caroling to
our home.  They had guitars and beautiful voices – we loved it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The Philippines is beautiful and lush in many
parts of this country.  There are beautiful jungles, the ocean with white sandy
beaches and also rock beaches, and beautiful green rice fields.  But it is dirty;
it could be a paradise if it was taken care of and improved.  They have open
sewers, rivers with garbage floating on top and very polluted.  Because the
water is so polluted, we had to carry a small plastic bottle of alcohol to use
to clean our hands often.  The alcohol was given to us when we were at the
mission home after we arrived.  The alcohol didn’t dry our hands out because it
is so humid there.  We had water coolers in our missionary homes and water was
delivered to us in 3 gallon bottles.  The plant in Munoz was very clean and
sterile, so we were thankful for that.  We had to take deworming pills to try
to kill the parasites. The public CRs (comfort rooms – bathrooms) were so
dirty, it made us sick to have to use them.  Few had toilet seats and you
didn’t want to sit on them anyway, so we would just squat over them.  In some
CRs there was just a hole in the cement.  There usually wasn’t any toilet
paper, soap, or paper towels, so we carried Kleenex and alcohol with us. There
were nicer CRs in McDonalds restaurants and some gas stations.  The CRs were
terrible in most hospitals.  Ken found that out when he took a blind man
there.  We helped take supplies and equipment, with the humanitarian couple
missionaries to a hospital in Guimba, and because of that, they let us take
young men who wanted to go on missions there, to get a physical and their
dental work done.  It was horrible.  We saw the dentist drop her pick, whip it
off on her dirty apron and put it in the mouth of one of our
to-be-missionaries.  He did get an antibiotic and Ken told him to take every
single pill.  They did have a couple of beautiful hotels and hospitals in
Manila, and the missionaries were taken there when they had to go to a hospital. 
Most doctors and nurses who work there were trained in the United States.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In the Philippines, there is the richest of the
rich and the poorest of the poor.  Most Filipinos would love to come and live
in America and that is their dream.  Catholic, Iglesio Cristo and our church
are the religions in the Philippine Islands.  Iglesio Cristo is mainly a mafia
because the people have to pay every time they come to church and they must
come often.  They are promised protection for their money.  They do dress very
nicely when they come to this church.  Anyone can preach or teach in this
church.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There are many different types of homes is in
the Philippines.  Some are made of bamboo and are small, others are made of
rough cement with dirt floors and hardly any furniture or belongings.  Many are
just shacks made out of whatever they can find – tin, cardboard, odd shaped
boards, etc.  It is a very poor country, but most of the people are good and
sweet, hospitable and affectionate, especially the ladies and children, as most
of the men drink, smoke, gamble and are lazy.  Many cannot find work, if they
want to work, although the tradition is that the women work.  The oldest girl
in the family is to support the family.  Many times she goes abroad as a house
helper, nanny or entertainer.  Some go to Hong Kong where they are entertainers
(prostitutes).  Some go to England, many go to Iran or Irack, some go to Canada
and the lucky ones go to the United States.  They send the money home to their
families. The government takes a big hunk out of what they send home.  One
couple in Munoz, who we loved and were richer than most, was because the wife
went to Iran and taught in a hospital there.  She was a nurse and sent home the
money.  They saved it so their children could go to college.  One daughter
became a doctor and the other a nurse.  The son didn’t want to go to college. 
The father raised the children while the mother was away making money.  She
could come home every few years.  Their daughter, the doctor, helped us in
different ways.   The Filipinos are very child like.  When we were teaching or
training them, we had to keep changing our way of thinking and our presentations
to make them more simple, so the members could understand what we were trying
to teach them.  They love to have their pictures taken, so we would take
pictures of them with our digital camera and then put them in our Power Point
Presentation, and they loved that.  That would get their attention.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There were many beggars there.  Some came door
to door.  We had several come to our home.  Others had their children beg at
McDonalds, stores and where ever.  The dad would have the children give him the
money and then he would usually buy beer or cigarettes.   When we saw these
children, we would buy hamburgers for them and see that they ate it, and they
were so happy as they were hungry.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Many sold wares in the middle of busy traffic. 
Some men drove “Trikes” which are motorcycles with a side car.  They drive
people around for money. That’s how some make their living.  You could see a
man with his small child on his lap, while driving and one or two behind him on
the seat.  Several would be in the side car, but it was only room enough for
Ken &amp; I.  We had our own car, but we rode in one a couple of times.  You
could see one on top of the side car as it had a canvas top, and maybe another
standing on the back.  They had several accidents and you can see why.  One
branch president drove a trike for his living and Ken was talking to him and
asked him about the number of people they can put in a Trike as it looks like
it is dangerous and the president said “Yes, if you get more than 11 or 12 on a
Trike, it can be dangerous. The other main types of transportation were
“Jeepnies” which were jeeps made into kind of a small bus, with benches on both
sides.  You could get in and others would keep getting in and you would be
swashed.  They also had buses and some rode on top of the buses.  The traffic
was terrible and you would have vehicles drive on sidewalks and three across
where there should be one or two.  There were trucks too and you had to get out
of their way as since they were bigger, they figured they had the right of
way.  There wasn’t much law enforcement.  While Ken and I were sitting on the
top floor of a Jolly Bee restaurant, we looked down on the intersection in
which five streets entered the intersection.  This was in San Jose. We got
quite a kick out of a police officer trying to direct traffic, but most didn’t
pay attention to him.  One day we were there and were watching him, but when he
came out into the intersection, he had a pair of gloves on.  One glove painted
red and the other painted green.  We presume he thought this way he could
control the traffic, but in reality, it wasn’t working.  We also watched people
get onto one of their Jeepnies and we counted over 20 people that got on that
vehicle, which would be crowded for a dozen.  All the banks and most businesses
had an armed guard at the door with a loaded shotgun and pistols. They had the
Gadeantan Robbers and the Philippines National Police.  You got out of their
way.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The women crouched down on their laurels (to put
their feet on the cement and sit on their heels) to do their laundry by hand in
a cement enclosure.  They hung their clothes on the fences or wherever they
could find a place.  Most did iron everything, at least our Marlin did.  She
even ironed our sheets, garments and socks.  Most of the people looked clean
and neat, and the school uniforms looked great.  We would see men waiting for a
bus or Jeepnie and they would be sitting on their laurels.  It looked so funny,
we thought they looked like magpies sitting on a fence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            During planting of the palay (rice), the fields
were flooded with water and they did use a mixer that looked much like our snow
blowers, but had barrels that were made out of iron strips.  This would work as
a mixer to mix the water and the soil together, and when the field was ready
for planting, the mud would be up to the knees of the planters.  Large batches
of pre started seed would be given to the planter and he/she would take each
stem out, one by one, and plant it until just about an inch remained above the
surface of the mud.  As the palay was put into the mud, each person would take
an area about 3’ wide, and as fast as they could plant the starters in the mud
in front of them, they would back up, and when they finished, the entire field
would look like it had been planted with a transit.  The plants would be in
perfect straight lines going forward, sideways and on a 45 degree angle.  We
talked to an 80 year old sister who said it was so hard for her to do this
work, but she had no other income.  They earn about 50 Pecos a day for a 10
hour day.  They got two breaks, and if they cannot keep that pace up, they
could get out of the field as there were more to take their place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were surprised when they told us the branch
was having an activity at the church and it would start at 6 pm.  It rarely
started for one to two hours later.  They were usually always late arriving and
starting meetings and activities.  That was hard for us.  When Ken was the
counselor to Branch President Cabayaban, he worked on him to start his meetings
on time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a beautiful home in Munoz with a gated
block fence all around.  We did have power outages at times and since we only
had a window air conditioner in our bedroom, we would drive someplace in our
car to cool off as it had air conditioning.  Also, when the power went off, we
didn’t have water to take showers, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We loved the fruit, especially the mangos and we
had a large fruit bowl with all kinds of fruit in it that we enjoyed.  When we
were at the mission home, soon after we arrived in the Philippines, Elder &amp;
Sister Clark invited us for breakfast and they fixed pancakes with almond
butter and lots of fruit on top.  It was delicious and so we have almond butter
and fruit on all our waffles, pancakes and French toast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            While we were on our mission, two more
grandchildren were born.  <b>Mike and Becky had a daughter, which they named
Jessica, and David &amp; Shauna had a son, which they named Connor</b>.  We
were excited to see them, as well as all our other grandchildren and their parents,
when we arrived home.  I’m sure that most of you already know that <b>we also
had a death in our family while we were gone.  Sandi’s husband, Terry, was
killed in a vehicle accident in November 2003.  That was surely sad news for
us, and it was hard for us not to leave our mission and come home to be with
Sandi during this hard time</b>.  Our mission president said it was his wish
that we would stay and then have Sandi come to the Philippines a little later
and spend some one-on-one time with us.  She brought her sister, Shellie, and
came for 10 days the following February, and we were able to show them some of
the beautiful places in the Philippines as well as meet many of our wonderful
Filipino friends.  We had a special time together.  We arrived home, from our
mission, the 17<sup>th</sup> of February and since that time we have had many
wonderful family get-to-gethers as well as visiting our good friends again.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            A <b>little great-granddaughter, Kennedy Grace,
was born soon after we arrived home to our granddaughter, JaNae, and her
husband, Brad.</b>  Sandi is her grandmother.  That makes 15 grandchildren and
3 great grandchildren for us.  <b>Sandi’s younger daughter, Chelci, just called
yesterday with good news that she is getting married in the Salt
 Lake Temple on the 11<sup>th</sup> of March</b>.  We are very excited for her
and her fiancée.  <b>Scott graduated from Weber University while we were gone</b>
and <b>Jeff graduated from the University of Utah this past April</b>.  They
were both happy to be finished with college studies and have more time for
their families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We have postponed the building of our home in Star
  Valley, Wyoming due to the costs in building materials tripling since we have
been gone.  We had sold our home in Layton to our son, Scott and his wife,
Mishelle.  We are living in the cute basement apartment, which Ken built for
his mother a few years ago in his brother’s home.  Mom Jensen passed away prior
to our going on our mission.  Bob &amp; Carroll are wonderful to us and we
enjoy the Clinton 20<sup>th</sup> ward, so for the present, we are happy to be
here.  We live close to most of our children as well as most of our brothers
and their families and my sister and her family, which makes it nice also.  We
are very thankful for the many blessings the Lord has blessed us with,
especially the gospel, our family and friends, and to live here in America..</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>In October, 2005, Shellie and the boys came up in 2005 to
visit and spend time with us and the rest of our family.</b>  Roy couldn’t come
as he needed to work.  Shellie wanted to take the boys and go to <b>“Martin’s
Cove”</b> where Roy’s parents, Veldon &amp; Patsy, were serving a six month
(summer) mission there.  Shellie wondered if Ken and I could go with them,  and
we were excited to go.  We stayed the night with Patsy &amp; Veldon’s neighbor
and Shellie and the boys stayed with Patsy &amp; Veldon in their RV. They have
to have RV’s to stay in with these service missions.  We had a great time,
although it was cold and windy.  The visitors center was wonderful and we saw
my great grandfather, Lyman Wight’s name on the list of those who went to
rescue the handcart saints, who were stranded here in Wyoming in the terrible
cold, snow and wind of winter.  How any of them survived is a miracle.  They
had handcarts there that we could pull each other in.  Veldon took us in his outdoor
vehicle to the spot that they call “Martin’s Cove” where the saints were trying
to get by the hills to get out of the terrible cold.  We saw many other sights
there and enjoyed the time with Shellie and our grandsons.  Also with Patsy
&amp; Veldon, as they are good friends. </p>

align=left hspace=12>While we were on our mission, Scott graduated from college
and got a good job so he and Mishelle wanted to buy a home.  We wanted to sell
our home so we could build up on our property in Star Valley, Wyoming so we
asked them if they would like to buy our home.  They said they couldn’t afford
it.  We asked how much they felt they could pay for a home and when they told
us, we lowered our price to that amount - $25,000 less than we had asked before
when putting it up for sale.  Ken figured it out and knew we would be getting
$50,000 from our equity if we sold it to Scott &amp; Mishelle and he felt that
would be enough to purchase the lumber, cement and other building materials to
build our home in Star Valley and we wanted to help them out and wanted to keep
this home in our family, so we did sell it to them.  We had given Mike our
power of attorney so he was able to sign the papers for us.  He was concerned
about us dropping the price that low, but did what we asked him to do.  To our
surprise, the cost of lumber, cement and the other building materials had gone
up three times while we were on our mission and now that we were home, Ken
realized that we couldn’t build our home for the $50,000.  He still wanted to
build it, but we would have had to get a loan and either one or both of us
would have had to go to work to pay the loan off.   I had felt good about us
building in Star Valley before the mission.  I knew that David &amp; Shauna
lived in Idaho Falls so just a half hour or so away from us and with Sandi
&amp; Terry having their cabin there, there would be family around for us to be
with, but while we were away on our mission, David &amp; Shauna moved to Utah. 
They had wanted to be closer to family and David was able to be transferred
down here.  They bought a home in Enterprise, which is close to Morgan.  The couple,
who had purchased the cabin with Sandi &amp; Terry, built them a big new home
so couldn’t afford their share of the cabin so backed out.  Sandi &amp; Terry
didn’t feel they could afford the cabin by themselves so asked our family and
other friends if any wanted to go in on it with them.  None did, so they ended
up selling their cabin, much to Sandi’s sorrow as she loved that cabin and had
furnished and decorated it so beautifully.  Her &amp; Terry, or her and her
daughters, or just her alone sometimes went there and enjoyed it.  They invited
Ken and I to go with them sometimes, and we loved being with them and loved the
cabin and area also.  My Uncle June and his 2<sup>nd</sup> wife, Banita, lived
in an adjoining town so Sandi would always stop and visit them while she was
there.  She and Uncle “George” became really close.  (He was named after his
father, so was given the name of George Jr.  All the family called him “June”
(for Jr.) so they didn’t get confused with the two Georges.  Uncle June loved
Sandi and looked forward to her visits, so did Banita.  Ken and I visited them
also when we were there.  When we realized that we would be alone up in Star
Valley as Uncle June wasn’t there either, as he had passed away and Banita
moved back to Utah to be close to her daughters, I wasn’t as anxious to build
up on our property.  Ken and I drove up there and I prayed there among the
trees and I didn’t have the good feeling that I had had before.  I thought of
the cold, hard winters and that if Ken got sick during a winter and had to go
to the hospital, which was several miles away in another town, I would be
really nervous driving on those icy roads and I would be nervous being there
without our family to help us.  I have always wanted to be close to my family
so I could go to our grandchildren’s ball games, recitals and other special
events and I wanted to be close so I could invite them for Sunday dinners and
spend the holidays with them.  If we lived here in Star Valley, that wouldn’t
be the case as it is four hours away from most of them and five hours away from
Sandi, Terry &amp; their family and Mike, Becky &amp; their family, and it
would put another four hours on our already twelve hours to Shellie &amp; Roy’s
home.  I know why I had the good feeling before, but didn’t now.  It was
because it was such a good investment.  We bought the land for $10,000 and we
sold it for $60,000.  If we hadn’t sold it at that time, the economy went bad
and the land dropped way down in value.  The Lord blessed us as He knew we
would need the money to live on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Bob &amp; Carroll had enjoyed having us live in
the basement apartment with Mom.  They didn’t want anyone else to live here,
but they invited us to do so.  Bob said “Your furniture is already here, why
not move back in, and you can share the utilities and other expenses with us.” 
I felt that was our answer.  Ken wasn’t too happy about that as it had always
been his dream to build his own home and he had already drawn up the plans for
our home.  I loved the plans too and I know it would have been a beautiful
home, but I was worried that since Ken would have to get a job, (me too
probably) that it would be too hard on him to work and then come back and work
on our home, and work all day on Saturdays.  It was the same fear I had when he
wanted to build our home, while he was working, when we bought our home in
Layton.  It was really hard on his health when he built this basement apartment
for their mother.  When he had built this apartment, I loved it and said “I
could retire in this apartment”, but at that time, I never thought I would be
doing it and now we were.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We love the ward, there are several
couples around our age, who love the gospel and have gone on missions too.  Two
of the couples are our neighbors here on 1300 N.  We have all ages in our ward,
which makes it a great ward.  Ken was again called into the High Priest Group
Leadership.  He was first assistant to Morgan Thomas, who is the Group Leader. 
Charles Saunders is the second counselor.  Charles and Carolyn and Ken and I
love to play games so we try to take turns getting together at each other’s
home once a month.  We have invited our back yard neighbors, Marilyn and Kelly
Bodily to join with us as they love to play games also.  Their daughter, Jill,
who we love and her husband came over one night and we had fun playing games
with them.  They were living with Marilyn and Kelly at the time, but have since
moved to their own apartment.  They now have a cute baby daughter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Our Bishop, Steve Smith, called
both Ken and I to be Family History Consultants.  We were excited, especially
me as I love Family History.  There was so much to learn.  We took classes at
the Ogden Family History Center, we volunteered to serve at the Clearfield
Family History Center and was trained there.  We served each Tuesday evening
from 6 to 9 pm.  We enjoyed the others who served there and we learned a lot as
we helped others register and find ancestors.  They also called Marie McEntire,
a single lady in her 50s as a F.H. Consultant, so Marie and I met with several
sisters in our ward, at their homes, to help them and teach them about Family
History.  Ken and I were asked to teach the Young Women in our ward, during
their mutual night, how to register on FamilySearch.org and also how to do
indexing.  That was an enjoyable evening.  We were also asked to show the
Priesthood/Relief Society at one of our 5<sup>th</sup> Sunday meetings, how to
do family history and indexing.  We used our Power Point Projector. We didn’t
have enough time to show them all that we hoped to.  Marie, Ken and I were
asked to take the Laurel and Priest representatives from our ward to the Family
History Center in Ogden and there help them learn about Family History.  All
the wards in our stake were there and did this.  We did this one week and the 2<sup>nd</sup>
week, we taught them at our ward building.  Marie, Ken and I taught several
Family History classes during Sunday School.  As we were about to teach another
class, our bishop asked that instead of teaching a class, we just open up the
doors to the computer room and let whoever wanted to come during Sunday School,
to come meet with us and we could help them on an individual basis.  This was a
good idea, and some did come, but after a while the Ward Mission Leader asked
the Bishop if they could use our room to teach their investigator class/Gospel
Essentials.  This was granted so we didn’t do Family History again on Sundays. 
We were disappointed that this class couldn’t find another room.  They could
have, but they wanted our large room.  Ken and I attended several Family
History conferences at different stake centers and also at the ?? in Salt Lake
City.  I kept taking online classes and watching F.H. videos for Family History
Consultants on FamilySearch.Org.  I also spent time trying to find more of my
ancestors who needed their work done.  I was able to find a couple, but that
was all.  Ken and I went to the Bountiful Temple and had James Harris sealed to
his parents and siblings.  That was a great experience.  We felt the spirit
strongly as did the sealer and others in the room, so we knew he was happy to
have this work done for him.  I was also able to get my brother, Hal, sealed to
his wife, Jean, and then their daughter, Cindi’s work done and her sealed to
her parents.  We took Georgia with us and she was proxy for Cindy, Ken was for
Hal, and I was for Jean.  We were thankful to have them sealed together.  You
can add photos and stories of your ancestors, so I have added many photos and I
have gathered many stories.  We were released from these positions when we went
on our mission to California, but when we returned, the Bishop called us in and
asked if we would again fulfill the positions of Family History Consultants.  I
was excited, not sure if Ken was, as it was harder for him and he had a hard
time getting motivated.  He did some great things, however, getting his cousins
involved in Family History, especially one, whose mother and father had been
killed in a car accident when she and her brother and sister were small.  They
were raised by grandparents and hadn’t been involved with the Hill family
relatives that much.  They also were not close with each other, but this made a
difference in their lives as Ken found a baby brother who they didn’t know
about, who died shortly after birth.  Ken also got interested in doing indexing
and spent hours doing this and really enjoyed it.  He also taught others,
especially a widower, who is a neighbor, Dee Francom.  Dee has really enjoyed
it too and since he has diabetes, and doesn’t get out much except to church and
the store, this has helped fill his time and given him something to do which he
feels is important, which it is.  Ken and I were released this past year (2013)
and I was called to teach the 10 year olds in primary.  I team teach with a
sister who has been less active, but has determined to start coming regularly
and even went to the temple to take out her endowments.  We have a cute class
of mostly girls and they are attentive and well behaved.  I already had a
second calling to serve on the Relief Society Committee.  These two callings
keep me busy.  Ken is still serving as 1<sup>st</sup> assistant in the High
Priest Group Leadership with Morgan and Charles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have enjoyed our home and have
enjoyed our association with Bob and Carroll.  Bob likes to fix meals and cook,
so he would usually prepare Sunday dinner and when we hadn’t invited our family
members to dinner here or if they hadn’t invited us to their homes, then Bob
would want us to come and eat with them.  Sometimes I would make a salad, and
with our diet, I would make brown rice for us as he would make potatoes for him
and Carroll.  Ken and I enjoy playing Canasta with Bob &amp; Carroll.  It’s
usually the men against the ladies and it’s about a 50/50 tossup on who wins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Mark, Bob &amp; Ken’s cousin,</b>
who had come to help care for his mother, Aunt Vida, stayed on after his mother
died and rented a bedroom from Bob &amp; Carroll as he didn’t want to live in
the basement with Ken’s and Bob’s mother as they didn’t get along.  Ken’s Mom
didn’t want him down here either.  Ken’s mom died prior to us going on our
mission to the Philippines, but Mark stayed on.  I guess Bob &amp; Carroll had
told him that he could stay for a couple of months until he found something
else.  Well, he didn’t have any intention of finding something else, as he
liked it here.  Anyway, he always ate Sunday dinners with us too.  We had a
large garden and Mark was excited about that.  We worked out a deal that he
would mainly take care of the garden (water and weed) and Ken and I, and Bob
&amp; Carroll would pay for the plants, seeds and other expenses and we would
help plant the garden and help harvest it.  That way, Mark could have what he
wanted and needed from the garden, and so could the rest of us.  It worked
pretty well.  But Mark had a different personality.  He felt he was always
right and he was overbearing about it.  I could see why he was married three
times and each time his wife divorced him.  None of his children are close to
him either.  He was a good dentist, but lost his practice and equipment because
he fought the dental association because he had found out that mercury fillings
were dangerous for our health.  He couldn’t win and it ruined him, he lost
everything including his last family.  Mark was taking advantage of Bob &amp;
Carroll by eating their food without asking, by not only using their washer
&amp; dryer, but also using their laundry detergent.  He burned some of their
pans, he would argue with them and spoke cross to Bob a lot of the time. 
Finally, Carroll had had enough and she told Bob, she wanted him out.  She
wanted her privacy and wanted his bedroom for her children to be able to use
when they came to visit as Kathy lives in Texas and Bruce in Arizona.  When
they told him, they wanted him to move out, he was upset and didn’t do anything
about it.  After a while, Bob spoke to him again about it, but he said he
couldn’t afford to move.  Bob gave him some money to put down on an apartment,
but he used it to pay bills, so that upset them more.  Finally, Bob told him
that either he was out by January 1<sup>st</sup> or Bob’s kids would help him
move Mark’s things out on the lawn.  It was a bad scene and he blamed Ken, for
some unknown reason.  It wasn’t Ken’s idea, although we agreed with Bob &amp;
Carroll, but it was them that wanted him out.  He found an apartment (while Ken
and I were visiting Shellie &amp; family in Arizona) and our Bishop and other
ward members helped him move down to Provo in a student cheap apartment.  Don’t
know how he was able to get that.  Maybe he told the landlord that he would be
taking classes at BYU.  Bishop was so amazed at all the junk Mark had and took
down with him.  He said they stacked it in his apartment and there was hardly
room for him to walk to the bedroom and bathroom, and that the cupboards and
table were filled too.  Mark’s son and his wife lived in America Fork so he
wanted to live closer to them.  They did invite him for dinner once in a great
while.  He died a few months later.  He was in his late 80s.  The landlady
found him dead in his apartment.  We never found out the cost, but we assume it
was a heart attack.  Mark had a gold watch on a gold chain.  He used this to
see whether food or different things were good for him.  He argued with our
Bishop and Stake President over what the church mills sold and should sell to
church members.  He just felt they should stick with the basis – wheat, rice,
powdered milk, etc., but not things like pancake mix, muffin mix, chocolate
milk, etc.  He was a different guy.  He was nice some times, but difficult at
other times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Family vacation at Shellie &amp; Roys in July of 2005 –
We celebrated the 4<sup>th</sup> of July there.  </b>All our family, except
Scott &amp; his family went to Shellie &amp; Roy’s in July of 2005.  Shellie
had wonderful things planned and we all got along so well and helped one
another and it was a grand time.  We all were assigned a couple of meals to
fix.  We gave Shellie our menu and she bought all the groceries and snacks, but
each family fixed the meal they were assigned and cleaned up after.  We were
there for the 4<sup>th</sup> of July, so Shellie had bought cloth bags, toys,
candy, cups, handkerchiefs, etc. for each child.  The parents paid her back. 
Shellie had decorations so when the children woke up and saw their bags, it was
almost like Christmas.  They loved it.  We tie-dyed shirts, went swimming in
their pool, even watched movies in their pool at night while lying on air
mattresses.  We went to the lake and went water skiing a couple of times.  We
went out to eat twice – once to the Organ Grinder’s Pizza place.  That was fun
for everyone.  We did lots of things and Shellie &amp; Roy were wonderful
hosts.  We all had a great time.  In fact, when David asked his children where
they wanted to go for their family vacation the next year – Disneyland, to a
beach, etc., they wanted to go back to Aunt Shellie’s. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             When Ken and I were driving home, we stopped at
<b>Cove Fort, </b>as we hadn’t been there before.  The church owns it and they
have senior full time missionaries who are dressed up in the pioneer costumes
and take you through a tour of the fort and tell you all about it - why it was
built, what the pioneers did there, etc.  It was very interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Anchorage Alaska to Terry &amp; Angela’s in July</b><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> 2005</span> – </b>I had never been up to Terry &amp;
Angela’s even though Ken and all my siblings had, so Ken said we better go.  We
got back from our mission in February 2005 and left for Anchorage in July.  It
was so beautiful and green.  Terry was so cute, he picked us up at the airport
with Jaben and took us places on the way to his home.  Angela had hurt her back
and was in a lot of pain, so felt bad that she couldn’t go.  Because of this,
she couldn’t go the first few days as Terry took us to see the sights.  Ken
wanted to go fishing, so David, Terry’s son, took him one day, but they didn’t
catch anything which was unusual.  They did see several bear in and around the
river.  He went another day with Jared, but again they didn’t catch anything. 
Ken &amp; I went on a day cruise, which was wonderful.  We saw whales, sea
lions and practically all ocean wildlife.  The captain told us all about
everything.  We saw beautiful glaciers, had wonderful meals – everything was
great.  Ken went with a friend, who we saw at church and who was visiting
relatives, on a Halibut and Salmon boat and caught both.  He had them quick
frozen, packaged and sent home to us.  It was quite expensive, but worth it –
at least this once.  Terry, Angela and their family took us to the ocean and
park for a picnic, to their stake camp where we went canoeing on the lake, had
a picnic, etc.  Terry, Angela, Ken &amp; I went on a session at the Anchorage
Temple.  Terry is a temple worker there and loves it.  I went with Angela and
her two daughter-in-laws to a flea market where we had fun shopping.  We played
games at night, their son’s and families came over several times and we ate,
visited and played games.  We loved being with them and their special family. 
Jaben was cute.  He is “Down Syndrome”, can’t talk, so just make sounds, but
holds out his hand to do a “high five”, shake hands or hold your hand.  He is
cute and affectionate.  He was about 19 at this time.  He is short and stocky,
and a challenge for Terry, Angela and their family, but they all love him very
much.  Terry &amp; Angela were great hosts and we had a fabulous two weeks with
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>     2006 has been a good year for Ken and I. It has gone
by quickly</b>.  I had hoped to be more involved in Family History work, but so
far about all I have done in that area is take a class at the Family History
Center and have gone to a Family History Conference.  We have attended several
family reunions this year and we go to the temple as often as possible.   Ken
keeps busy doing repairs and remodeling jobs for family and friends, and when
it is out-of-town, he likes me to go with him.  I enjoy being with him and
enjoy being with those family members, so I have gone whenever I could.  Ken
really enjoys fishing, and I enjoy it too, so we have done some of that also.  <b>We
purchased a fishing boat this year</b>.   We mainly use it for trolling on
lakes such as Strawberry or East Canyon Reservoir.   Sometimes some of our
children and their families have gone with us and that has been fun.  We have

done, has helped with these. </p>

align=left hspace=12><b>Vacation at Lake Powell with Shellie, Roy &amp; Family.</b> 
We spent a week at Lake Powell the <b>summer of 2006</b> with our daughter,
Shellie, her husband Roy and their four sons – Garrett, Quint, Kevis &amp;
Jase.  We were on a house boat, we had our fishing boat and they had their ski
boat.  It was lots of fun.   We took turns fixing the meals.  It was hot so we
were in the water a lot.  I helped the boys make sand castles and rivers and
motes around the castles, on the beach where we were docked.  The older
grandsons walked over to the other side of the cove and jumped off the rocks
and cliffs into the water.  They had a fun time, but I was glad when they were
finished and came back safely.  I’m sure Shellie was also.  We played games
whenever we were not in the boats, fixing meals or eating.  Ken and I had a
great time fishing, one day, as the special kind of fish there, Silverfish??
were on the hook the minute it hit the water.  We caught lots of fish and they
were large.  Many times both of us would catch one at the same time.  Our kids
went in together and had bought Ken a beautiful new fishing pole &amp; reel for
his birthday that year.  Ken laid it down to take a picture of me with my
fish.  When he went to pick up his pole, it was gone.  A fish had bit at his
hook and took off with his pole.  He was sick about that.  We tried to find it
by using my pole, but couldn’t.  The owner of the boat drove the house boat,
and he was fun to be with too.  He kept to himself a lot of the time so he
wouldn’t intrude on our privacy</p>

align=left hspace=12> <b>Cruise with Mike &amp; Becky in November of 2006  </b><u><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Our first cruise.</span></u>  Our oldest son, Mike and
his wife, Becky, invited us to go with them on a Carnival cruise. It was out of
Long Beach, California and stopped at the ports of Catalina and Ensenada.  It
was fun and we had an enjoyable time being with Mike and Becky.   We drove down
together and stayed at a motel in Los Angeles, and then a shuttle took us to the
ship the next morning and came to get us when our ship landed and the cruse was
over.  Ken &amp; I went on a Glass Bottom Boat tour in Catalina where you could
see and feed beautiful fish.  We also went on a city bus tour and stopped at
interesting spots along the way.  Mike &amp; Becky went snorkeling.  At
Ensenada, we went to the Blow Hole where the ocean water blows up at various
times.  We walked through lots of sidewalk shops along the way.  On the ship we
swam in the pool and sunbathed, played games, ate lots of wonderful food,
watched good entertainment at night, one was a magician. All in all, we had a
grand, relaxing time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have a close family and spend as
much time together as we can.  It is great to be retired and able to enjoy
being with them more.  We love to be with them for birthdays, piano recitals,
ball games, choir and band concerts, Sunday dinners, camping trips, holidays,
family reunions, barbecues, etc., etc.  This was the main reason we sold our
land in Star Valley, Wyoming this summer, rather than build a home there.   It
was too far away from them.  All of our children, except Shellie who lives in
Chandler, Arizona, live within an hour radius from us.  Sandi, Nick and their
families live in Grantsville and the surrounding areas.  Mike, Becky &amp;
their four children live in American Fork.  David, Shauna &amp; their three
children live in the Morgan area.  Scott, Mishelle &amp; their two children
live in Layton and Jeff, Gail and little Benjamin live in South Weber.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Special Family events that occurred this year are: 
Our granddaughter, Chelci’s marriage to Steve Holste in the Salt Lake Temple in
March.  Jeff and Gail’s first child, Benjamin, was born the 19<sup>th</sup> of
June, on our 47th wedding anniversary.  Sandi was married to Nick Drake in
July.  Tyler, David &amp; Shauna’s son, was baptized and confirmed a member of
the Church by his father in November.  We now have 16 grandchildren &amp; 2
great-grandchildren.  From Sandi’s family, we also have 3 step grandchildren
and 5 step great grandchildren. (Terry’s son’s and grandchildren) We feel so
blessed and enjoy each member of our family</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Ken and I enjoy living in our cute basement apartment
in Bob &amp; Carroll’s home.  We enjoy Bob, Carroll and Mark.  Bob loves to
cook and bake and is often inviting us up to eat with them.  We had a wonderful
garden this year, thanks mainly to the efforts of Mark.  Ken and I enjoy
playing Canasta with Bob &amp; Carroll.  It’s usually the men against the
ladies and it’s about a 50/50 tossup on who wins.  We love our ward and enjoy
the positions we hold and the people we serve.  Ken is in the High Priest Group
Leadership and I serve in the Relief Society on the R.S. committee and host the
book group.  Several sisters come each month to my home and we have fun reading
and discussing the books we read.  We have read some good books by John
Bytheway, Sherrie Dew and other good LDS authors.  Both Ken and I are also called
and set apart substitute teachers for any of the organizations.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      We love each other, our family, the Lord and his
gospel and our many friends.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>Jeff and Gail wanted to go to Zion Canyon in October of<b>
2006</b> and they asked if we would go with them.  We had our tent trailer and
it would easily fit all of us.  We pulled the tent trailer with our truck so we
were able to take their sleeping bags, portable crib &amp; stroller for Ben. 
We had a great time and Benji was so cute and enjoyed being in the stroller as
we went on the shuttle bus and walked the trails.  We took lots of pictures and
have done each time we went.  This is Jeff’s favorite place and he has come
with his brothers and cousins to explore canyons by climbing and repelling. 
They had great times here too.  We ate together, played games at night after
getting Ben to sleep and Ken and I tended Ben while Jeff &amp; Gail climbed
Angels’ Landing.  It was beautiful there and we loved it.  We camped one year
at the RV Park in Springdale because it had showers and we had a pretty site
looking at the red mountains.  The other years we camped at Watchman campground
at Zion’s.  It has electric hookups, but no water or sewer hookups so we had to
fill our water tank in our tent trailer as we entered the campground.  It was
fun each time we went and soon we had little Rachel and so they had a double
stroller, then Ben was old enough to walk and Matt was born and he was in the
stroller with Rachel.  The last time in 2013, all the three children were able
to walk and probably out hiked their grandmother and grandfather.  We would
tend the children while Jeff &amp; Gail took the hike to Eagle’s Landing.  I
didn’t dare go there, but Ken went a couple of times, and really enjoyed it. 
One time he had been sick and I didn’t think he should go, but he wanted to and
did just fine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Cedar Breaks – coming home from
Zion’s in October of 2006 – </b>Ken and I decided to take a detour when we were
coming home from camping with Jeff, Gail &amp; little Ben for a week at Zion’s
Canyon. We wanted to go through Cedar Breaks as we hadn’t been there for
several years and it is so beautiful.  We stopped at the different lookouts and
enjoyed the beauty and took pictures.  This reminded me of several years ago
when dad wanted to go on a trip down to Southern Utah and see Zion’s Canyon,
and other places for the last time.  His health had been declining as he had an
inherited disease “Anti Tripson Deficiency” which is a lung disease.  Mom had
told me that he really hoped someone would take them there.  I went into his
office /bedroom where he was and told him that I was sure that Ken would agree
that we could take he and mom on that trip.  He got all excited and said they
would pay for the gas.  The next thing I knew was Mom calling me at home and
saying: “Did you tell your dad that we were going this coming weekend?”  I said
“no” and she said well, he thinks you did and he’s getting packed to go.  Ken
and I didn’t want to disappoint him so we did make arrangements to take them. 
We had a wonderful time.  When we were at Zion’s, dad didn’t have the energy to
walk on any of the trails, but they said for Ken and I to go and they would
just wait there at the camp.  As we were about to head for home, we asked if
they would like to go see Cedar Breaks too and they said they would.  Well,
that was a mistake as it is too high and the altitude was too hard on dad.  He
couldn’t breathe well and so we quickly went on home.  He kept declining until
he had to be on oxygen 24/7.  We felt bad that we had taken him up there.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>While living in Clinton</b>, in the basement apartment
of Bob &amp; Carroll’s home, which Ken built for their mother, we had a hugh
back yard.  When Mark moved to Provo, he didn’t take his volleyball poles, so
Ken put the fittings in the ground so we could just slip the poles into them
when our family would come for <b>family backyard parties and barbecues.</b> 
We had several each summer.  Our children and grandchildren love to play
volleyball so we played that at each family party.  I love to watch them play. 
Each family would bring their own meat and a side dish.  I usually asked Becky
if she could bring her delicious broccoli and bacon salad as I love that and
everyone else does also.  Mishelle makes wonderful rolls, so she would bring
rolls at times.  All our daughters and daughter-in-laws make delicious food.  I
usually made a potato salad and a Acini de pepe salad.  We bought two
“Lifetime” picnic tables, from a neighbor who worked at “Lifetime” in Layton,
and we have surely used them a lot and enjoyed them.  We also bought two
smaller picnic tables so our young grandchildren could sit at them.  Our
apartment wasn’t large enough to have all our family inside at one time, but in
the summer, it worked great.  In the winter, we would invite one or maybe two
families at a time for Sunday dinner or for special occasions.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also had <b>Easter Egg Hunts</b> each year in our
backyard. Those were fun.  I would buy lots of plastic Easter eggs and put
candy in some and money in some.  I would color lots of boiled eggs also. 
Sometimes some of our younger grandchildren would come and help me color the
eggs.  Ken and I would hide the younger grandchildren’s eggs in the back yard
and the older grandchildren’s eggs in the far back of the property where we had
our chicken coop, shed, rabbit pens and large garden area.  I bought Easter
baskets for them at the Dollar Store and gave them a list of how many money
eggs, candy eggs and boiled eggs each of them could find and keep.  On the
signal they would all run around to find their eggs, it was so fun watching
them and seeing the excitement on their faces.  We would usually start the
Easter Egg Hunt about 10 am and then we would have a barbecue afterward, play
volleyball and visit.  Good memories!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     <b>2007 has been a good year for Ken and I</b>.  It has
gone by quickly.    Ken keeps busy doing repairs and remodeling jobs for family
and friends, and when it is out-of-town, he likes me to go with him.  I enjoy
being with him and enjoy being with our children and other family members, so I
have gone whenever I could.  I keep busy with church work, house work and
family.  I have been able to do some family history and am hoping to do more in
the coming year.  Ken really enjoys fishing, and I enjoy it too, so when Ken
isn’t working and we have the time, we go fishing.  Sometimes we have gone by
ourselves and other times we have gone with some of our children and their
families, or with cousins and friends.  We had a fun get-a-way this summer with
my sister, Georgia and her husband, Rick.  They have a membership to Camper
World. so we took our tent trailer and boat and went to the Camper World at
Coalville, Utah.  We had a great time </p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'>Israel </span>with our daughter, Shellie, her husband,
Roy, and 3 of their 4 sons.</b> <b>Roy’s parents went also.</b>   Shellie had
gone to Israel on the Travel Abroad Program with BYU when she was in college 20
years ago.  It had always been her dream to return with her husband and
children.  This was the year.  Shellie &amp; Roy’s oldest son, Garrett, will be
19 and go on a mission next year, so they wanted to go now.  They took Quint
&amp; Kevis too, but Jase was too young to go.  They invited Ken &amp; I and
Roy’s parents also.   It cost us $7,000.  This was a hard decision to make as
that is a lot of money and we are not wealthy by any means, but Shellie kept
telling us that it was an experience that we would always remember and that we
would be with them and probably never have the opportunity again if we didn’t go
now.  Most of the children were supportive, but David was not.  He knew we
didn’t have much money and thought it was foolish for us to spend that kind of
money on a vacation.  He even got angry and it was very upsetting to me, but we
went, and he apologized later and we are glad we went.  It was a glorious 14
days on a wonderful tour where everything was taken care of and we walked where
the Savior walked and went inside the Dome of the Rock, Garden of Gethsemane –
all the wonderful places in Jerusalem plus all over Israel – the Dead Sea, the
River Jordan where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, the Sea of Galilee,
the place where David slew Goliath, where Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried
and King David, the walls of Jericho, the place where Sampson and Delilah were,
etc.  We ate foods we have never heard of before, we had great hotels we stayed
in.  Our tour guide was excellent and we enjoyed every minute of it.  There
were 34 on our tour.&nbsp; There were 3 former mission presidents with their
wives, Brother Robert Whetton, who was recently released from the
Seventy,&nbsp;and his wife, and other former bishops and stake presidents and
their wives - so we were with a great group.&nbsp; Our guide, Brother Richard
Barrett, had just retired from 40 years of teaching institute.&nbsp; He had
taken 26 tours over to the Holy Land and he had taught 3 years and been in the
Administration of the Jerusalem Center - so he was so knowledgeable and we
learned so much from him<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was great being with our special, beautiful daughter, her
handsome husband and handsome sons and Roy’s parents, Veldon &amp; Patsy.  This
was in March of 2007.  Upon our return, Shellie took hers and our pictures and
put them together and made a scrapbook for us for Christmas.  We love it. </p>

sons in 2007</b>. (2<sup>nd</sup> writing of this wonderful trip, so wanted to
include it also.)   Ken and I returned from Israel late on the 29th, so we
still had jet lag.&nbsp; We sure had a marvelous time in Israel.&nbsp; It was
incredible.&nbsp; It's more beautiful than we had imagined, and is such an
interesting place.&nbsp; Our guide was great, so we learned a lot.&nbsp; It was
wonderful to walk where Jesus walked, to be at the place when David slew
Goliath, to be at Mt. Carmel where Elisha challenged the priests of Baal to see
which God would burn their sacrifice, to be in Jericho and hear those stories
we have heard since a youth, but they meant so much more since we were
there.&nbsp; I was able to ride a camel, which was a fun experience.  We rode a
gondola up to Masada and our guide showed us around and told us all that went
on there - much more than we had heard before.&nbsp; We swam in the Sea of
Galilee and rode in a boat (like the boat Jesus and his disciples would have
been in) over to Capernaum.&nbsp; We watched people being baptized in the
Jordan River where John the Baptist had baptized people.&nbsp; We floated in
the Dead Sea, and saw the caves where they found the Dead Sea Scrolls.&nbsp; We
saw King David's tomb.&nbsp; We were at the place where Abraham rescued Lot
from the kings.&nbsp; We were in Hebron and at the sites where Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob were buried with their wives, except Rachel who was buried in
Bethlehem.&nbsp; We were in Nazareth &amp;&nbsp;Bethlehem.&nbsp; We were
in&nbsp;Bethany where Mary, Martha and<span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>
</span>Lazareth lived and visited the tomb&nbsp;where Lazareth was raised from
the dead.&nbsp; We spent a week in Jerusalem and that was fantastic.&nbsp;
Besides visiting all the places where Jesus walked and going to the Jerusalem
Center for church and a tour, we bought lots of souvenirs in the old city as well
as other places.&nbsp; It was amazing to see all the ruins and to realize that </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>several civilizations had built their cities on top of
others which&nbsp;had been&nbsp;destroyed.&nbsp; I could go on and go.&nbsp; We
are so glad we went.&nbsp; Before going on to Israel, we had a layover in <b>Frankford,
Germany</b> for an entire day, so the Barrett’s, our tour guides, had hired a
German lady tour guide to show us around.  One of the highlights was to see and
walk around the beautiful Frankford Temple. We also ate good food.  We were
glad that we had this opportunity to be in Germany also.  The picture above
shows some of the architectural and scenic beauty.</p>

wakeboarding, riding on the toys, swimming, playing on the beach, eating,
visiting, playing games and just relaxing and enjoying being together. These
pictures are of our family and Ken, on or by, our big water toy “Great Big
Mable”.  Ken had told me to go to Petersen Marine and buy a water toy and make
sure it was a good one and big enough.  The salesman sold me this one, and it
was too big for our boat, but we had fun on it anyway.</p>

align=left hspace=12><u>We spent time this summer doing some remodeling,
painting and getting new carpet for our cute basement apartment</u>.  Bob,
Ken’s brother, and I were Ken’s helpers.  Ken took out the door going into the
sun room and also the window.  I asked him if he could make arches for the
window and door, and sure enough, he could and did.  When we lived in our home in
Layton, I had a large china cabinet, which our neighbor had given us.  I had
all the souvenirs, which our sons had brought back to us from their missions,
souvenirs from our missions and other vacations and beautiful items our
children and friends had given us.  This cabinet was too large for our basement
apartment, so Ken had glass shelves made and installed them on this west wall
of our sunroom, for my souvenirs, etc.  I was thrilled about that.  Our
apartment  looks so nice now</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I were just released as the ward nursery
leaders.  I enjoyed this calling more than Ken, but I was proud of him.  He got
down on the floor and played cars with the children or helped them put puzzles
together and he had at least one on his lap during the lesson.  He set up the
tables and chairs for our snacks, helped me and Camille set up the nursery when
we arrived.  He was wonderful and the children loved him.  The children are
precious.  It did get hard at times when one or more started crying and they
would start some of the others crying.  We had between 14 and 20 there each
week so we were exhausted when we went into Sacrament Meeting.  They just
sustained Ken as the Ward Family History Consultant.  I was excited about his
calling because he will be trained and we can work on family history together. 
He will have at least one other person to help him train the members of our
ward too.  I am still the discussion leader for our Relief Society Book Group. 
I have had this calling for 2 ½ years, but I really enjoy it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span

compiling the Byron Porter &amp; Descendents Family History Book.  This was

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>BACKGROUND<b>:  </b>In June of
1980, my uncle, Dale Porter, called and asked me if I would be interested in
putting together a family history book for his parents - my grandparents, Byron
and Mary Elizabeth or “May” as she was called, and their descendents.  He knew
I was interested in family histories, and he told me of a family history
conference in Salt Lake City and said he would pay for me to go to it and he
would finance the expenses until the books were printed and then we could sell
them at a reduced cost to our families.  I was excited and gained much
information at the 3 day conference.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>WHAT I DID:  Shortly after the
conference, I contacted my parents, siblings and each of my uncles, aunts and
cousins and told them of this project and asked if they would get me a family
group sheet of their family, family pictures and a personal history of
themselves.   I set a deadline for them to have these items in to me. 
Meanwhile I worked on gathering journals, and histories of my grandparents
since they had already passed away and also what information I could collect on
a deceased aunt &amp; uncle, Maurine &amp; Royal. .  Grandma’s children were
sure that she had written a history, but no one could find it so I asked each
of them to write what they could remember about the lives of their parents –
spiritual experiences, trials, successes, etc.  I began compiling all this
information together to form histories for them.    Grandpa Porter was a
writer, so I wanted some of his poems and stories in the book.   I don’t know
that he had any of them published other than one story “Red Cloud”, which was
in the Morgan County newspaper, but I thought they were great and I know many
other family members agreed with me.  When the deadline for the histories,
pictures, etc., came, I only had a few, so I sent out a reminder and set
another deadline.  More came in and after doing this a couple more times, I
called and set up a time to come and pick up the materials of those I didn’t
have.  This way I was able to get histories from all of them.  Some histories
were more detailed and longer than others, but that didn’t matter.  It was
important that they had a history in this book for their posterity.   Shortly
before the manuscript was to go to the printer, my father, Glendon Porter, was
going through some papers and found his mother’s history.   We were all
excited.  I was able to add it to the history I had compiled.  I felt that our
prayers had been answered</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I enlisted other people’s help.  I
knew a lady who did calligraphy and asked her if she would write our title page
“Byron Porter Family Descendents”.   My cousin, Verla Porter was going to BYU
and also had a job there working in an office.  She volunteered to type the
final draft on her computer.  I was excited about that as I only had a
typewriter.  She also volunteered to proof read and make corrections where
needed.  I would type a section, get it to her and she would type it up after
work and in her free time..  That was a big help to me.  She gave many, many
hours to this project.  I appreciated her help so much.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>One member of the family had a
beautiful picture of Grandpa and Grandma Porter on their wedding day, so I was
able to use it in the book.  I included Porter songs, pictures of their homes,
a Pedigree Chart, histories of Grandpa &amp; Grandma’s parents &amp;
grandparents -  Lyman Wright, Byron’s father, spiritual experiences of Sanford
Porter, Byron’s grandfather; history of Mary Elizabeth Clark Robinson, May’s
mother;  parting instructions &amp; testimony of Ezra T. Clark, May’s
grandfather.  All these items were in the Introductory Pages.  I made a Table
of Contents with a chapter for each family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I put a family tree and family group sheet at
the beginning of each chapter.  Of course it started with the Patriarch &amp;
Matriarch, Byron &amp; May.  Next I put a personal history sheet, then pictures
of them, and then their history.  I also included Byron &amp; May’s Patriarchal
Blessings as well as the poems and stories for Byron.  At the end of this
chapter, I put pictures of the family.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mary Maurine was the oldest child so her
information was in the 2<sup>nd</sup> chapter, then Elmer Royal had the 3<sup>rd</sup>
chapter, then my parents, Glendon &amp; Mildred, then Dad’s sister, Merlynn and
her husband Jeff Olsen, the 6<sup>th</sup> chapter was another sister, Enid and
her husband, Wayne De Graw. The 7<sup>th</sup> chapter was a brother, Joseph
Verle and his wife, Beth, &amp; family.  Aunt Beth will be speaking on this
program also.  The youngest child was a son, Dale, so he and his wife, Esther
and their family made up the 8<sup>th</sup> chapter, which was the last
chapter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>GRANT STEVENSON –  Uncle Dale, Dad
and their siblings suggested I talk to Grant Stevenson, our good relative who
owns a Genealogy or Family History firm in Provo, about printing the book.  We
made an appointment for me to bring the manuscript and come meet with him and
his staff.  Mom came with me, she was always a great support, as also was Dad. 
Grant Stevenson and his staff were so helpful and kind.  They gave me
suggestions, let me use their cutting tools, helped me with the layout and when
I was finished and took the final draft there, they printed the book for us.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Including the index at the back, this book has
358 pages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Grant asked how long it took me to
put together this book.  I was embarrassed to tell him it took me 3 years.  I
explained that with raising our family, helping Ken with the farm, my church
and my civic callings, that I didn’t have as much time to devote to this
project as I would have liked.  He told me that 3 years wasn’t that long to put
together a book of this size that many people took five to 10 years.  That made
me feel much better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had a Porter Family Reunion and
gave the books out to the families at that time.  Uncle Dale was very generous
in financing most of the cost of the books.  He wanted the family to pay a
little for the books as he knew they would appreciate them more if they paid
something for them, but he wanted the books to be reasonable enough so that
everyone who wanted one could have it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had a Glendon Porter Reunion on
the 27<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> of July and I was talking with a
nephew, Nathan Tew, about family history books.  He told me that he is in the
Elder’s Quorum Presidency in his ward and a few weeks ago, he gave a lesson to
the Elders on Family History.  He said in preparing for this lesson, he read
the 2<sup>nd</sup> Porter book, the one Aunt Beth did.  He said the more he
read, the more excited he got and he could hardly put it down.  He said he
learned so much about Byron, his great grandfather, and his other ancestors and
he enjoyed giving the lesson.  That’s how I got so excited about family history
work.   I started reading these histories and I wanted to read more.  I got to
know these wonderful people by reading about their lives.  They have helped me
because as I would read about the trials they had, I would say to myself “Wow!,
if they had those trials and yet endured to the end, I should be able to endure
with my trails.”   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>APPRECIATION:  I am very grateful
to Uncle Dale for giving me this opportunity.  It was a wonderful experience. 
I appreciate and love my grandparents even more as I worked to put together
their histories.  They were a righteous couple.  They had their trials and problems,
just like all of us do, but they loved the Lord and loved the scriptures and
faithfully endured to the end.    I am so grateful for their examples.  I got
closer to my aunts, uncles and cousins not only by working with them to get
their histories, pictures and family group sheets, but by reading their
histories as I typed them into the manuscript.  I am thankful that I was
privileged to be born into this special family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>KEN’S MOTHER’S HISTORY:  A few
years ago, I encouraged Ken’s mother to write her history.  She would say “Oh
nobody would want to read it if I did.  My life has been boring”.  One day I
started asking her questions about her life and as she answered these
questions, I would write them down.  Soon other things about her life would pop
into her mind and she would tell me those things or experiences.  It wasn’t
long until I had several pages and then I read it back to her.  I felt she had
some great experiences and so I kept encouraging her to write down things as
they came to her.  Pretty soon, she was excited too.  This went on for some
time.  Finally I was able to compile it and add pictures.  She passed away in
November of that year.  She had wanted to give them as Christmas gifts to her
children and siblings, so we had them printed and spiral bound and gave the
books as her final gift to them..  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I would encourage all of you to
read your family histories and learn about your ancestors.  I would also
encourage you to write your history if you haven’t already done so.  You will
be happy if you do, and your children and posterity will be thankful.</p>

would have enjoyed working with her and Ken and I could use the money.  I
wanted to be able to enjoy our grandchildren and families more, do more family

hired Patty Woodward.  Patty had left the Planning Dept and was hired in Staff
Development to take Billie’s place after she retired.  Patty is a “flake” and
not dependable.  She is a social butterfly, so it caused a lot of frustration
to Jackie, like Patty did to me.  Jackie was so relieved when Patty quit.  I
think Patty knew she better or she might be fired.  Jackie got a good secretary
after that.  Her and I still keep walking, talking and going to lunch as often

nature.  We are not content to just sit at home and watch TV or read.  Ken has

charge much and is always having to replace tools and equipment, so our tax man
told us that Ken went into the hole over $6,000. last year on this business. 
Some of that was the depreciation of his trailer, but since it is hard work and
Ken is 69 now, it is hard, and he comes home so tired and hurting all over, and
it’s not worth it when you lose money instead of making money so he has decided
to give it up.  Handyman jobs were also frustrating (as you know) because of
past work done on homes by contractors or carpenters, electricians or plumbers

good driver, but I hope he has enough patience with the school children.  He
will have to develop it as they have told him he can’t touch any of them, or
look angry as they take pictures with their cell phones (older kids).  He seems
to be enjoying the training and learning a lot – guess we’ll see how it goes. 
He hasn’t done this before.  Ken is a great school bus driver because he is a
great driver.  I have always felt confident when riding with Ken, and much
better than when I am driving myself.  He is good with the children and youth
and he commands their respect.  Everyone at the Transportation Department likes
him as he is dependable, keeps his bus clean and maintenance done when it needs
it, is fair with the children and others, etc.  He enjoys it for the most part
and they just made him the employee of the month (Jan 2013) for the
transportation dept</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken is a very good school bus driver.</b>  I
knew he would be able to handle the bus really well as he is an excellent
driver, but I wondered about his patience with the kids, but he is doing
great.  If he has any problems, he just pulls his bus over and talks to me and
they settle down.  Ken is always amazing to me how he can do just about
anything.  He has great talents and abilities.  I could never be a school bus
driver as I don’t have confidence in my driving and to drive a big vehicle like
that would scare me to death, especially with worrying about the safety of the
children.  I love secretarial work and I’m glad that is what I have been able
to do part of the time during my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>December, 2008</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  Last year we were in sunny Arizona with our daughter,
Shellie, and her family for Christmas and the month of January.  It seemed
crazy to be playing miniature golf, riding in paddle boats and enjoying the
Phoenix Zoo during the holidays.  We were invited there again this year, but
decided to wait and go in the spring since we have five of our six children
living within an hour’s distance from us and its fun to be with them and their
families for Christmas Eve and Christmas day also.  Besides, Shellie and Roy’s
youngest son, Jase, will be baptized next spring and we want to be there with
him and his family at that time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We’ve had several additions to our family this
year.  Our youngest son, Jeff, and his wife, Gail, had a beautiful baby
daughter, <b>Rachel,</b> born to them on February 12<sup>th</sup>, and the next
month, our oldest grandchild, JaNae, (Sandi’s daughter) gave birth to a
beautiful baby daughter, <b>Emma</b>, on March 10<sup>th</sup>.   On the 26<sup>th</sup>
of October, our son Scott, and his wife, Mishelle, had <b>twins</b> born to
them.  <b>Kaden</b> was born first and weighed 5 lbs, 14 ozs and his sister,<b>
Kaitlyn</b>, weighed 5 lbs, 8 ozs.  When Scott &amp; Mishelle told their older

Heavenly Father for that.  If the baby was a girl, Kylan would be sad not to
have a brother and if it was a boy, I would be sad not to have a sister – so we
needed one of each.”</u>  I know that Ashley received this blessing from the
Lord too.  That makes 19 grandchildren for us and 5 great-grandchildren which
includes a step great-grandson.  They are all very special and we are so

Washington Mission.  Ken and I flew down to Arizona to help Shellie with the
preparations for an open house they were giving him and to hear him speak in
Sacrament meeting.   Ken and Roy also were able to be in the circle when the
Stake President set Garrett apart as a Missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints.  The next morning we flew home.  Garrett’s other
grandparents, Veldon and Patsy Seymore, had just finished their mission at
Martin’s Cove in Wyoming. On their way home they stopped at our place.  That
evening the four of us drove down to the Salt Lake Airport to meet Garrett as
he flew in to report to the Provo M.T.C.  We brought Garrett back to our place
for the night.  The next morning the four Grandparents had the privilege of
taking our Grandson to the MTC.  It was a wonderful experience.  Garrett is a

He gave us 2 rooms for $40.00 ($20.00 for each couple) and that included a
wonderful breakfast of sausage, eggs, hash browns, toast&nbsp;and orange
juice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lodge&nbsp;had a large screen TV with a DVD player, hot
tub, fireplace, tables to play games, etc. plus 25 miles of groomed snow mobile
trails with lots of hills and valleys to play around on.&nbsp; The four of us
plan to go again next year, and we'd like to invite any of the rest of you to
go with us.&nbsp; We will stay the two nights at the Lodge in Soda Springs rather
than stay one night in Lava.&nbsp; They have several snowmobiles to rent.&nbsp;
If you rent a snowmobile, they furnish the snowmobile outfits free.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We had all of that for Wednesday afternoon, Wednesday night and most of the day
on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only cost us&nbsp;$76.00 a couple, (we shared
the cost of the snowmobile and the rooms).&nbsp; &nbsp;Sandi said it was the

its way and that they were to close the camp and get down off the mountain. 
They said since we had already paid, we could stay if we wanted to, but we
might be stranded up there for a while.  We didn’t dare chance it, so we left
and it started snowing as we went down the canyon so we were glad we had gone. 
It snowed or rained most of the way to Fillmore so we decided to stay in a

Benjamin &amp; baby Rachel at Zion’s.  In our tent trailer, there was room for

stroller, so away we would go during the day to enjoy the beautiful Zion’s

align=left hspace=12> <b><u>For several years I have purchased a Grandmother’s
yearly pass to Dinosaur Park in Ogden and enjoy taking the grandchildren there
throughout the year.</u>  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I started doing this when David and Taylor Paige
were young.  They were about 7 and 9 years old, I think.  I took all the
grandkids there usually at least once or twice a year.  I usually just took one
family’s children at a time, but as they got older, sometimes I would take
cousins.  In our Buicks, I could take 5 grandkids, but now in our Chev Impala,
I can only take four.  Most of these grandchildren love to go there, even when
they are teenagers. I mentioned that to Shauna, one day, and she said it was
mainly because they wanted to spend time with Grandma.  Her comment made my
day.  I love to be with our children too.  Ken went a couple of times with us,
but he was usually working or doing projects for us or other family or
friends.  Dinosaur Park is a fun place, especially for younger children.  They
have a great museum where all kinds of Dinosaur skeletons are displays on the
main floor and upstairs they have displays of all different kinds of rocks made
into jewelry or other items.  They also have an area upstairs where they have
robot dinosaurs that growl and move somewhat.  The children love this area. 
Outside is lots of paths which take you to different full-size manmade
dinosaurs, they growl too.  They also have a playground made up of manmade
dinosaurs, etc.  They have an area where you can dig for bones – actually use
brushes to uncover dinosaur bones and eggs.  Another area is where you overlook
the pond and can buy food to feed the large fish, ducks &amp; geese.  They have
other hidden paths, etc., etc.  It is a fun place.  I don’t know how many times
I have been there, but it is still fun, especially to watch the grandchildren
having such a good time.  We usually take our lunch and treats as there are
picnic areas all around.  They also have a gift shop and snack bar.  The gifts
are too expensive, but I usually buy the grandchildren a ice cream treat, just
before leaving to go home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We always have a <b>family Christmas party</b>, but last
year we also had our first <b>“Grandchildren’s Christmas party</b>”.  I got the

book).  I liked this idea so decided to try it.  The first year I also invited
our great grandchildren (Dawson, Kennedy, Emma, Jaden and Nathan)  This was
almost too many for me to handle, but I had Paige help me</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We enjoy tending the grandchildren whenever possible and
supporting them in their sports, academic, music and other accomplishments. 
It’s fun to be grandparents.  <b>Emily, David &amp; Shauna’s daughter, will be
baptized on the 6<sup>th</sup> of December.</b>  We look forward to that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I decided it was too hard on him to
continue doing handyman and remodeling jobs to earn extra money, so he started
working for Davis School District last spring as a substitute school bus
driver.  He enjoys it.  He doesn’t plan to apply for a regular bus route as he
still wants time to go fishing, go to the temple, etc.  Ken and I are the
Family History Consultants for our ward.  We work at the Family History Center
in Clearfield on Tuesday nights and are learning a lot and enjoying it.  We
keep really busy with family and Church, but we have a good life.  We are
thankful for our family, extended family and good friends, and especially for

need the money, so he is in training to be a <b>school bus driver</b>.  Ken is
a really good driver, but I hope he has enough patience with the school
children.  He will have to develop it as they have told him he can’t touch any
of them, or look angry as they take pictures with their cell phones (older
kids).  He seems to be enjoying the training and learning a lot – guess we’ll
see how it goes.  He hasn’t done this before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tuesday, May 6, 2008 – Ken keeps really busy, but helps
others - Virginia Johnston today</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken has been really busy the last while
(although he usually keeps really busy as everyone wants him to help them with
one project or another, since he knows how to do everything) as he has been
training to be a bus driver.  Since he is getting older (69 now), he gets tired
easier and gets in pain if he works too hard or too long or if the project is
stressful – so he has decided he wants to phase out of doing construction jobs
except just for our immediate family, and Bob since we live here.  Although, he
will help others in an emergency, if needed, I’m sure.  We can’t make ends meet
just with our social security checks &amp; my small retirement check, so he
needs to bring in extra money some way, so he decided to be a school bus
driver.  He applied and they need bus drivers, so they were excited to have
him.  The training has been lengthy and several tests, but he has completed
them.  He is to work as a substitute for 6 months and then he can apply for his
own bus route if he chooses to.  Anyway, my brother, Bryce and his wife,
Deanna, brought a home in Perry, but it needed a lot of work done to it, so
Bryce asked Ken if he would help him.  My sister, Georgia and her husband need
him to help them do a project, our son, Scott and wife, Mishelle, need him to
fix their bathroom, my cousin, Randy needs him to do projects on remodeling
their home, etc., etc.  On Tuesday, after morning school bus training, he had
planned to go to Bryce’s home to work there again, but realized he wouldn’t
have enough time as we had a meeting that evening with the High Priest Leader
in our ward about family history work, so he worked on projects for Bob &amp;
Mark on the yard and garden.  While we were eating supper, a neighbor called
and asked if he would got to Sister Virginia Johnston’s home and install some
hand safety railings in her shower for her.  He explained that he didn’t have
time and she needed it done right away.  Ken accepted, and we stopped at her
home on our way to the meeting to see what it entailed.  After the meeting, Ken
asked if I would go with him to Virginia’s home while he installed them.  I had
hoped to stay home and do more on-line training on the internet since Irven
&amp; Sandy had been to our home all day while we cooked a meal in our solar
oven.  They hadn’t planned to be there all day, but her and I kept visiting
about different things and the day was gone.  Time sure flies by so fast.  I
started to object about going with him but then I realized that it was hard for
him to spend the time doing this for her, since he was tired from working so
hard all day, but he was willing to do it and besides it wasn’t appropriate for
a man to go into a single woman’s home alone.  Virginia was a widow – so I went
with him.  I was glad I did because as I visited with Virginia, she told me
several spiritual experiences she had with raising her family.  I felt the
spirit and my love and admiration for this special lady and her family grew in
my heart.  I felt the Lord gave me this blessing since I was willing to go with
Ken.  Virginia was happy for my visit too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>May 2008 - Dentist</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I went to the dentist in May for a checkup and to have them
cleaned.  I found out after I got there that Dr. Cottle had retired and a new
young dentist was taking his place.  They took xrays and the dentist told me
that the roots of a tooth on the back top right side were crumbling and because
I had had a root canal in that tooth, I couldn’t feel any pain.  He said the
tooth couldn’t be saved and I would need to go to an oral surgeon to have it
pulled as he didn’t have the equipment needed to get it out.  He also said I
had a cavity which needed filling and that I needed three new crowns in order
to save those teeth.  They gave me a paper itemizing the cost of the work which
needed to be done and it was $3,000.00 plus the cost of the oral surgeon.  Each
crown was $670.00 plus $150.00 for some other procedure they do with crowns. 
Needless to say, I was pretty discouraged when I left that day as $3,000.00 is
a lot of money even in today’s world, and we don’t have any dental insurance. 
They wanted to make an appointment for me to have the work done, but I decided
to call other dentists and get a second opinion.  I did make an appointment
with the oral surgeon.  I was nervous about going there since the dentist said
the roots were crumbling, I knew he would have to dig them out and it would be
a painful and stressful experience.  <b>I prayed hard to Heavenly Father that
the tooth would come out ok and to bless the oral surgeon as he took it out. 
He deadened all around the tooth and I felt it being numbed even up into my
right eye.  When he pulled the tooth, it came out all intact.  I was surprised
and asked him about it and he showed me the tooth.  I told him Dr. Harris had
told me the roots were crumbling.  He said I know, I am very surprised myself. 
I knew my prayers had been answered</b>.  I got along great and didn’t even
have to take a pain pill that he prescribed.  I only took tylanol.  Mark Hulet.
Ken’s cousin, had been a dentist and he kept asking me how I felt and how I was
doing.  He was surprised that I was doing so well.  Ken had been with me as he
wanted to know how the oral surgeon felt about me having dentures instead of
having all this work done since my teeth have always been soft and I have
always had so many cavities, caps, bridges, root canals, crowns, teeth pulled,
paradonels disease, etc., and I take fairly good care of my teeth.  We have
spent a lot of money on my teeth, plus what the insurance would pay.  I always
liked Dr. Cottle, but I don’t think he took as good of care of my teeth as he
should as prior to going on our mission to the Philippines, Dr. Cottle had
checked my teeth and said they were good.  But soon after I got there I had an
absessed tooth and had to go to a dentist that the mission president referred
me to in Angeles.  She did a lot of work and also had to put on three crowns. 
Now here we are again.  The oral surgeon told me that if he were me, he would
have the new crowns put on and keep my teeth as long as I can.  He said “If you
even decide to have dentures, only do it on the top as you have a ridge on the
bottom and the dentures would slide back and forth and wouldn’t work.  I had
other dentists tell me that since I had had paradonal’s disease my gums would
never adjust to dentures and I would be miserable.</p>

Illinois and Kirkland, Ohio in July of 2008.  </b>Jeff had transferred with his
job to Greenville, Ohio when he and Gail separated.  Ken and I wanted to go
visit him there and he wanted us to come so we went in July of 2009.  We have
always wanted to go to the church history sites back there – Nauvoo, Illinois
and Kirkland, Ohio so we talked to Jeff about it and he said we could use his
car and he would just ride his bike back and forth to work.  We flew into
Cincinnati and Jeff met us at the airport and took us to his home that he was
renting.  It was an old home, but cute as it had a wrap-around porch with a
swing.  He had the upstairs apartment which consisted of a living room,
kitchen, two bedroom, bath and a screened in porch.  We enjoyed being there and
spending time with Jeff.  On the weekends, he would take us sightseeing.  It is
beautiful there with beautiful trees everywhere.  It is so lush and green. 
They don’t irrigate as they get plenty of rainfall.  He took us to beautiful
parks, one in particular I loved as you would walk down paths to a lake with
trees, shrubs and flowers everywhere.  It was more a wilderness park.  He took
us to the Annie Oakley Park where they tell all about her and have statues,
etc.  He  took us out to eat at one of his favorite restaurants which was in a
great area with trees, etc., all around.  Ken and I went to Sacrament Meeting
at the branch there both Sundays.  I fixed our meals and it was fun to cook in
his cute kitchen.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>reservations at a cute motel in a nearby town as it was
much cheaper than staying in Nauvoo.  We loved Nauvoo.  It was beautiful and
there was so much to see and do.  Nothing cost money there, except for your
meals.  We went on a buggy ride all around the city where a tour guide told us
all about everything in the city.  It was great!  We went on a covered wagon
ride pulled by oxen and were told about the pioneers and the oxen.  We walked
down Parley Street or later it was called “The Street of Tears” as that is
where the Saints went as they were driven out of their beautiful city in the
dead of winter and had to cross the frozen river.  They had to leave their
beautiful homes and farms and their beautiful temple which they had sacrificed
so greatly to build and worked on it even knowing they would be leaving it to
mobs.  Many did get their endowments there before they left as Brigham Young
&amp; other members of the twelve stayed night and day to give these ordinances
to the members.  Ken and I went in museums and all the homes where there were
couple missionaries there to take us on tours of the homes and in some they
would demonstrate how they made rope, wax candles, spoon cotton into yarn, silk
worms, etc.  The mansion house was one of the homes we toured, plus we toured
the shops, and other businesses.  We also went to the Nauvoo temple one day. 
You had to get reservations way ahead to do this and so we had done that before
we left home.  We ate in fun restaurants and cafes. The night programs were
excellent – talent shows and plays.  The couple missionaries and young
missionaries put these on and they were wonderful, so talented.  We missed the
pageant by a couple of weeks, but most people want to come at that time, so it
wasn’t so crowded and that was great!  We enjoyed our motel and going back and
forth across the Missouri River and one day we watched the huge gates come up
and open so boats and ships could pass through.  That was interesting.  Anyway,
Ken and I had a wonderful five days in <img width=262 height=1

align=left hspace=12>            The following Monday, we left for Kirtland to
see the church history sites there.  We had already made reservations at a nice
hotel there.  We had phoned Maryon and Jim Frazier, our good friends from when
we lived in Arizona and who had moved to Springville, Ohio, which isn’t far
from Greenville.  They were planning to go to Kirtland with us, but things came
up and they weren’t able to, so we went to visit them at their home.  They have
a beautiful farm on top of a hill.  There are lots of trees until you get to
the top.  They have an old home, but it was still nice.  Ken and I didn’t
recognize Jim &amp; Maryon.  They were sitting outside on their chairs waiting
for us, but when we saw them, we thought we must be at the wrong place so Ken
went to ask them where the Fraziers lived.  As he approached them, he finally recognized
them as they called his name and walked out to greet us.  Maryon has put on a
lot of weight and of course, has gray hair now and Jim has put on weight and is
bald.  Their daughter, Malinda, and her four children are living with them
because Malinda’s husband is in prison for sexually abusing their children. 
She has divorced him, of course. They are practically raising their adopted
daughter’s daughter also as Pamela and her husband work and they have Jim and
Maryon tend their daughter and just don’t come to get her after work. 
Sometimes it is several days or weeks before they come to see her or get her. 
Wow! I don’t get why Jim &amp; Maryon are doing this.  Anyway, we enjoyed being
with them for most of a day and they took us to different points of interest in
Springfield.  Ken and I toured some of the church history homes and sites in
and around Kirtland, including the Kirtland Temple.  I was excited to see it
and walk through it.  It is owned by the Reorganized Church, but was great to
see it.  One day we went to see Lake Erie and it was beautiful, it is so huge
that it looked like the ocean.  It had large waves come in onto the beach. 
This was a wonderful vacation and we loved being with our son as we have surely
missed him.     </p>

and Big Mable (our water toy) and David &amp; Shauna brought their boat, so we
all had a great time, fishing, water skiing or playing on Big Mable &amp; other
water toys.  We rented a large home there with several bedrooms and
hide-a-beds.  It was a fun place.  We took turns fixing the meals and we played
games and did lots of visiting.  It seems like all of our family were there. 
It was fun watching our grandchildren having so much fun.  Chelci is pregnant
and had ?stones and was really miserable for part of the time.  She finally
passed them.  Gail and JaNae both announced to all of us that they were
pregnant.  Mishelle was happy for them, but it made her sad as she wants
another baby so badly.  She got pregnant soon after and they now have twins, a

year we decided to meet in Salt Lake for dinner and then go shopping (or window

left the next morning.  As I remember it, Becky came for the dinner in Salt
Lake, but then she needed to leave.  The rest of us (Shellie, Sandi, Shauna,
Mishelle and Gail) went to the mall and then to the motel.  It had been really
great and I enjoyed being with my daughters and daughter-in-laws.  But, at the
motel, we started visiting.  It was good at first, but then Shellie &amp; Sandi
started telling about experiences growing up.  I don’t remember what was said,
but especially, Shellie, said some hurtful things about me and her dad.  The
others didn’t appreciate what was said, and neither did I.  Finally, Sandi
stopped it and came over and apologized to me.  I don’t think Shellie did. 
Shellie is a wonderful daughter and an amazing wife, mother &amp; friend.  She
is very talented and goes the extra mile in doing things for others.  Sandi is
this way also.  But this night I was disappointed in my girls, especially
Shellie.  Shellie says things sometimes, that if she thought before she spoke,
I don’t think she would say some of the things she does.  David told me later,

to all get together.  Doug and his family were down visiting in Utah, and
Shellie &amp; her boys were here, so we decided to have a barbecue on a

getting reacquainted with each other.  I think all of Irven &amp; Sandy’s

on Saturdays, so don’t think he and Stacey were able to come.  It seems like

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>May 2009 Dentist (Spiritual Experience)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I didn’t like the dentist who replaced Dr. Cottle and he
wanted to do so much work on my teeth and it would be very expensive, so I
decided to go to another dentist and get a second opinion.  Bob, Ken’s brother,
told me about his dentist in Roy and that he felt he was very good and
reasonable in price, so I made an appointment and went.  After checking my
teeth, there wasn’t as much work needing to be done as this former dentist had
told me, but still there was plenty.  I went probably four to five times and it
cost me well over $1,000.  Later my bridge on my upper left side came off, so I
went back in to Bob’s dentist.  He fixed the tooth temporarily and put the
bridge back on, but said it wouldn’t last as my teeth back there were bad and
needed to be pulled and that I would need 3 posts put in.  Those are really
expensive.  He also said my caps on my front teeth were worn out and needed to
be replaced.  He did a root canal, but couldn’t find the last canal, so didn’t
put a crown on it, and said it needed to be done, plus other work.  I told him
we would have to wait.  It came home very discouraged as we didn’t have that
kind of money to pay for all that work.  I decided to make it a matter of
prayer.  I asked Heavenly Father what I should do – should I get dentures, even
though all the dentists had told me I shouldn’t.  The thought came into my mind
to call Aunt Banita (Uncle June’s wife) and I had a good feeling about getting
dentures.  I knew that Banita had dentures.  I called her and asked her about
her dentures and she said she loved them, that she had always had bad teeth,
like mine, and was also always in the dentures office and spending tons of
money on her teeth.  She said she finally told her dentist to pull her teeth,
that she wanted dentures.  He told her she would regret it, but she said “Pull
them anyway.”  She said she has loved them and has never regretted getting
them.  She told me who her dentist was and I was going to make an appointment
to go to her dentist, but he was in South Jordan (over an hour away).  I went
to church on Sunday and spoke to my friend, ? Larsen and I noticed how
beautiful her teeth were.  I went to pick her up to go walking the next morning
and she didn’t have her teeth in.  I didn’t know she had dentures.  We talked
about them and she said she loved them and her husband had dentures and he
loved them too.  I asked her who her dentist was and she said “Dr. Gray in
Kaysville, and said he was LDS and a wonderful man and great dentist”.  I was
excited, so I called the next day to make an appointment.  After examining my
teeth and me telling him about the problems I had had with them all my life, he
agreed that I needed dentures on the top, but said he wouldn’t have them on the
bottom as they never fit right since the tongue is in the way.  He said my
bottom teeth and bridges looked fine anyway.  I made the appointment too have
the top teeth pulled.  Ken went with me.  I was amazed that after deadening the
teeth, they came out so easily.  He had made the molds and put the new dentures
in and told me to leave them in until the next appointment or otherwise the
gums would swell and I wouldn’t be able to get them back in.  He told me how to
take care of them.  Well, to make a long story short.  I got along great!  My
teeth look beautiful and many have told me that too.  I can eat almost anything
and I surely haven’t regretted getting them, I wish I had done it years ago,
like Ken wanted, and they would have saved us tons of money – although, maybe I
was supposed to wait and get this great dentist.  <b>The Lord surely answered
my prayer.</b></p>

I'm not sure if it would be wise to have it next Saturday.&nbsp; I'm wondering
about having it&nbsp;three weeks from Saturday. &nbsp;Maybe the weather would
be better then.&nbsp; I thought we would do practically the same thing as we
did a couple of years ago - have the Easter egg hunt at 10 am, play games and
relays, eat - barbacue hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken or steak (whatever meat
you would like to bring for your family) and bring salads, chips, vegetable
trays and desserts.&nbsp; Dad and I would furnish a potato salad and drink for
the meal and furnish the Easter eggs for the Easter egg hunt.&nbsp; We could
visit and play games as long as you want, as dad and I won't plan anything else
for that day.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to being together again, so hope you
can make it.&nbsp; The tentative date would be Saturday, April 12th.&nbsp; This
way you can do your own thing for Easter and yet we can still celebrate with an
Easter egg hunt in April.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; Let me know if this

to play games, etc. plus 25 miles of groomed snow mobile trails with lots of
hills and valleys to play around on.&nbsp; The four of us plan to go again next
year, and we'd like to invite any of the rest of you to go with us.&nbsp; We
will stay the two nights at the Lodge in Soda Springs rather than stay one
night in Lava.&nbsp; They have several snowmobiles to rent.&nbsp; If you rent a
snowmobile, they furnish the snowmobile outfits free.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had all of
that for Wednesday afternoon, Wednesday night and most of the day on
Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only cost us&nbsp;$76.00 a couple, (we shared the
cost of the snowmobile and the rooms).&nbsp; &nbsp;Sandi said it was the most
fun she has ever had snow mobiling.&nbsp; This was the first time Nick has been
snow mobiling and I asked him if he liked it and he said he loved it.&nbsp; If
we go during the week, and if most of you wanted to go, we could rent the lodge
for a good price.&nbsp; It has 7 bedrooms, plus lots of other space for
sleeping bags.&nbsp; Let us know soon if you are interested as we need to make
the reservations soon.&nbsp; The owner&nbsp;says that many people make
reservations a year in advance.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We went snowmobiling at Trail Canyon Lodge for Ken’s
birthday with Sandi &amp; Nick again this year, so we are making it a
tradition.  </b>We had a wonderful time again snowmobiling on the beautiful
hills and roads, eating good meals that Sherrie prepared for us.  She fixed
gluten free, dairy free and sugar free meals for Ken, Sandi &amp; I and made
regular meals for Nick.  That was great of her.  We had a fun time playing
games and visiting at night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>We celebrated our 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year
on June 19<sup>th</sup>.</b>  My, it’s hard to believe Ken and I have been
married for that many years.  We have had our share of trials, like all of us
do; but all in all, it’s been a great life together.  Our love has continued to
grow over the years.  Our six special children, Sandi, Shellie, Mike, David,
Scott, Jeff and their spouses, planned a fun week for us at that time.  They
rented a lodge up in the pines outside of Soda Springs, Idaho.  The people who
own it fixed our meals while we went biking, hiking, 4 wheeling, fishing,
swimming at Lava Hot Springs or soaking in the hot mineral pools there,
visiting, playing games, sitting in the hot tub, or watching late movies on the
big screened TV.  We had such a good time.  It was just the adults there so we
had lots of time to enjoy each other.  Just before we all left to come home,
our children presented us with a beautiful quilt they had made.  It was
Shellie’s idea and she asked the moms of each family to make quilt blocks for
each member of their family.  They were all so different, yet very special. 
They sent them to Shellie and she put them all together, adding family pictures
and the picture of Ken and I, on our wedding day, in the center of the quilt
with all the other blocks around them, and finished the quilt.  We were so
surprised and thrilled.  We love it.  We were there from Monday through
Friday.  Friday night we went to the temple and on Saturday we had <b>the
baptism of Shellie &amp; Roy’s son, Jase, at our church</b>.  They were coming
from Arizona so wanted this side of the family to be able to attend this
baptism.  Jase’s other grandparents were able to attend also.  After the
baptism, we went to David &amp; Shauna’s home where we had a family party which
included the grandchildren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Since I got married right after I graduated from
high school, it was also<b> my high school class reunion</b> this year, which
they held in June.  It was a grand event held at the Grand American Hotel in
Salt Lake City.  It was so fun to see my old classmates and their spouses and
to reminisce on the past and get updates on what they have been doing since
that time.</p>

19, 2009 with our children and their spouses at Trail Canyon Lodge in the
mountains east of Soda Springs, Idaho  (I wrote this up twice, so decided to
put both of them in.)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our kids wanted to do something special for Ken and my 50<sup>th</sup>
anniversary.  They asked if we would like to have an open house since we have
so many friends all over, or if we would like to go on a cruise with just</p>

align=left hspace=12>They, their spouses and Ken and I, or they asked if we
wanted to go or do something else.  Mike was hoping we would choose a cruise as
he loves those.  They hoped we wouldn’t choose an open house as they wanted to
spend time alone with us for a few days, but they said if we wanted it, they
would be glad to put one on for us.  The idea of spending several days alone
with our children and their spouses, rather than an afternoon/evening opening
house, appealed to Ken &amp; I.  We talked about going to Moab since some of
our friends love it there and our sons have gone there and enjoyed it.  Shellie
didn’t want to go as it would be so hot in June, some of the others didn’t
either.  Sandi with being the oldest was kind of in charge of planning it with
their help.  She was getting frustrated, as were we, as some of the children
wanted to do one thing, while others didn’t and wanted to do something else. 
We were about to give up and just have Ken and I go off by ourselves or else do
the open house, when Sandi suggested Trail Canyon Lodge as they go with us
there each February for Ken’s birthday and go snowmobiling. We thought that was
a great idea and so Sandi called the others and told them we would like to go
there.  There is Lava Hot Springs not far away, Sherrie makes the meals for us
and they are great, even gluten free/dairy free ones for Ken, Sandi &amp; I.   Not
everyone was able to come for the entire week. Shauna was working so wasn’t in
the above picture, but was there most of the time. Some of the others had to
come late or leave early, Scott &amp; Mishelle needed to bring one of their
twins with them, but most were there most of the time, and we loved being with
all of them.  We all had a great time together going to Lava and sitting in the
hot mineral pools one night, going on the four wheelers all around, playing
games, visiting, eating good meals and just hanging out together.  Ken and I
loved it, we love being with our wonderful children and their spouses.  They
all paid for Ken’s and my share of the expenses.  The day before we left, they
presented Ken and I with a beautiful quilt which Shellie put together, tied and
bound with Pecos.  She asked her sister and sister-in-laws to make a quilt
block for each member of their families and put on things that represent that
person’s hobbies, interests, or skills and then to get them to her by a certain
date so she would have time to put them together and make the quilt.  It was a
beautiful quilt and we were so surprised but thrilled.  They gave us a
beautiful card also.  We came home on Friday and Ken and I went to the temple
as we always love to do that on our anniversary.  It seems like Shellie &amp;
Roy went with us.  On Saturday all our family came to our home for a backyard
barbecue.  We enjoyed being with our grandchildren as well as our children and
spouses, so that climaxed our wonderful 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a new grandson born in July to Jeff &amp;
Gail.  They named him <b>Matthew Lee</b> and call him <b>Matt</b>.  (This
little guy was supposed to come to this family, he saved his parent’s marriage.
He was how the Lord answered our prayers.)  That makes 3 children for them and
20 grandchildren for us.  We also have 5 great grandchildren.  Sandi’s oldest
daughter, JaNae has 3 plus a stepson, and her younger daughter, Chelci, has a
little boy.  We had two baptisms this year, Jase, Shellie &amp; Roy’s son, and
Maddi, Mike &amp; Becky’s daughter.  Our oldest grandson, Garrett, Shellie
&amp; Roy’s son, is serving his mission in Kennewick Washington.  We love his
letters.  He will return next August.  Jeff &amp; Gail moved to Layton, so all
of our children live close except for Shellie &amp; Roy who still live in
Arizona.  They moved from Chandler to Queen Creek.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Fish Lake with Nick in August of
2009  </b>Nick was the one to tell us about Fish Lake and how beautiful it is
and what great fishing.  He and Sandi hadn’t been married long when he
suggested we go there together as he loves to fish like Ken does.  It turned
out that Chelci had her baby early (Nathan) and so Sandi needed to be with
Chelci and help her and the baby, but Nick went with us anyway and we got to
know him better this way.  He pulled our tent trailer and we pulled our boat. 
He helped us with everything and we had a great time fishing and caught lots of
fish, he likes to play games too so we played games at night.  We were glad he
went with us and we had a great time, although it would have even been better
if Sandi could have come.  We have gone several years there together and loved
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I keep busy with our church callings of
Family History Consultants where we help the people in our ward and work at the
Family History Center in Clearfield.  This summer, along with the above trips
plus several other trips with family, we enjoyed our garden and were able to
can lots of vegetables and fruit.  We now have rabbits and chickens too.  Ken
is still a sub school bus driver.  We enjoy tending our grandchildren and being
with our family.  When we get a chance, we get some fishing in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>We went to Zion’s National Park
with Jeff, Gail &amp; family again this year</b>.  They love it here and so do
we.  Jeff &amp; Gail had added a daughter and another son to their family. 
Rachel was born in February 2008 and Matt was born in July of 2009 so in October
of 2009, we still have room for all of us in our tent trailer as Ben &amp;
Rachel could sleep on the bed when the table usually goes and we put up the
portable crib for Matt.  We loved it again this year and the children were
great!  Jeff &amp; Gail took a double stroller and Rachel and Matt rode in it
and Ben was old enough to walk on his own.  With the four adults, we could
manage the stroller and children on the shuttle buses and the trails.  The four
of us played games after getting the children to sleep on our beds and
afterwards transferring them to their beds.  <b>We didn’t go in 2010</b> as Ken
and I were on our mission to California</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>THANKSGIVING 2009  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thanksgiving was wonderful.  We met at Bryce's church where
Deanna, Bryce and Wendy and her children had set up tables, chairs and
decorated the tables and the room.  They had a Christmas tree which Wendy
decorated with Thanksgiving and autumn decorations.  She had asked Georgia
&amp; me to send her stories of our ancestors via e-mail and then she cut out the
ones she wanted and pasted them on cards and put their names on the front.  She
hot glued them to small pumpkins as centerpieces.  It looked so nice.  Me and
each of my siblings cooked a turkey, Bryce and Deanna did the mashed potatoes,
me, Jeanenne and Deanna made dressing.  Georgia brought the candied yams. Each
brought drippings from the turkeys and I made the gravy there, and everyone
else brought salads, veggie trays, rolls, vegetables, pies - so we had so much
food.  It was delicious.  The next generations were anxious to start playing
volleyball so they helped us clear off the tables and put the tables and chairs
away and then they began their games.  I love to watch them play.  They are all
really good.  Meliah came down and she had the younger children come to the
nursery for a couple of hours after dinner and had crafts for the older
children and the little ones played with toys while their mothers watched them
and visited with each other.  Paige and Nathan's wife, Jessica, helped Meliah. 
Everyone had a wonderful time.  Misha, Kim &amp; Jeanenne's cute daughter,
brought her boyfriend.  He is a really cute young man.  They seem so in love,
so that's neat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> I thought I would insert this article “Gods Come Cheap
These Days” By Chuck Baldwin<br>
June 12, 2009, to show a little of what is going on in the world today.  We are
living in a turbulent time with so much evil, crime, confusion, frustration,
corruption, etc.<br>

            When President George W. Bush was first elected back in 2000, I
well<br>
remember the way Christian conservatives went gaga over him. They would deny<br>
it, of course, but it was more than hero worship: they acted as if he were a<br>
god. Life-size posters filled Christian bookstores. Religious broadcasters<br>
and televangelists swooned over him like 16-year-old girls used to swoon<br>
over Elvis Presley. Pastors invoked his name almost as a prayer. The<br>
Religious Right acted like they had died and gone to Heaven. In the minds of<br>
Christian conservatives, G.W. Bush could do no wrong. The result of all this<br>
sophomoric silliness was that the Religious Right became blind, impotent<br>
lackeys to a Big-Government, big-spending, Orwellian, and inept<br>
administration--maybe one of the worst in U.S. history.<br>
            And all of this was not lost to the political left. They called
Christian<br>
conservatives &quot;dupes,&quot; &quot;buffoons,&quot; &quot;gullible,&quot;
and a whole lot more. But now<br>
it is the liberals' turn to take a voyage in the vehicle of villainous<br>
vulnerability.<br>
            First, there was the major media's &quot;anointing&quot; of
President Barack Obama.<br>
Yes, I use the word &quot;anointing&quot; on purpose. Make no mistake about it:
in the<br>
minds of the major media, Obama was not inaugurated; he was canonized. No<br>
pope, king, or potentate of history received the coronation that Barack<br>
Obama received. To the liberals who dominate the news media and<br>
entertainment industry in this country, Obama is not a President: he is a<br>
god.<br>
            For example, did readers see the way NBC newsman, Brian Williams,
bowed to<br>
his majesty, Barack Obama? (If you missed it, see it here</p>

            Where are Keith Olbermann's eloquent rebukes of the Military
Commissions Act<br>
(MCA), the suspension of Habeas Corpus, and many other Big-Government<br>
intrusions into the private lives of the American people that were first<br>
instituted under George W. Bush and that now continue under Barack Obama?<br>
When he wants to, Olbermann can be a very convincing, articulate defender of<br>
constitutional liberties. However, it seems that Olbermann is only<br>
interested in constitutional government when it is a Republican trampling<br>
it. Since Obama became President, Olbermann has not only muted his criticism<br>
against unconstitutional policies emanating from the White House, he has<br>
joined the chorus of mindless worship of the new President.<br>
            (Here are Olbermann's trenchant comments on President Bush's
support for the<br>
Military Commissions Act and denying Habeas Corpus--something we will not<br>
see from Olbermann regarding the same policies emanating from the Obama<br>
White House:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I went early to decorate and start to
get tables and chairs set up, and then others came to help us.  It seems like
everyone was able to be there except Shellie &amp; her family who live in
Arizona.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had a yummy fried <b>chicken dinner</b> with
mashed potatoes &amp; gravy, vegetables, rolls, salads &amp; desserts.  Ken
&amp; I furnished the chicken and paper supplies and everyone else brought the
other items.  We always enjoy being together.  We have a special family.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            This was Ken’s birthday so I wanted to have a
birthday party for him and since we would be gone for a year and we wouldn’t be
able to be to these family members birthdays and give them b-day presents, I
decided we should have a birthday party for everyone.  I bought <b>presents</b>
for everyone, and after our lunch, we moved our chairs into a large semi circle
and I proceeded to give out the presents one family at a time.  Everyone watched
as they opened their presents and then we all watched as the next family opened
theirs.  They all seemed excited and happy with their gifts, and that made me
happy.  After everyone had opened their presents, then we had Ken open his
gifts and we all sang “Happy Birthday” to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had asked the moms to bring toys or games for
their younger children, so these children had fun playing with each other on
the stage, while most of the older children and their parents played <b>volleyball.</b> 
That is a tradition whenever we get together for a barbecue or party, if we
hold it in a church or in our backyard.  Some of the moms like to play, while
others would rather watch the other play or visit.  I love to watch these fun
games.  They are so cute with each other, praising when someone makes a score
or hits the ball back into the other court, and if they miss the ball, the
others let them know that it was okay and that they all miss at times.  They
encourage the older children who play also.  They laugh and have a great time.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The mission department found out
from Brother Grenn Clark, that Ken had been a contractor and they needed him on
this mission to help another couple missionary built a home for the missionary
couple and a duplex for interns and other leadership who would be visiting over
extended times.  Ken and Elder Judd (and then Elder Shaw) also remodeled other
homes on the farm and did repairs on the processing plant and other buildings. 
They worked 8 hours a day.  Brother Lee Brown (who later became our bishop of
the Wasco Ward) was the farm manager, who Ken &amp; Elder Judd &amp; Elder Shaw
worked under.  Since Ken had been a contractor and Elder Judd and Elder Shaw
were carpenters, Ken was mainly in charge and did the planning and figuring of
materials, etc.  Ken amazes me at how he can do anything.  I didn’t enjoy going
to the plant, where he was building the house and duplex as it frightened me to
watch him walk the walls they had put up (with nothing to hang on to).  Lee,
Elder Judd and others would hand him up the roof joices and he would nail them
on.  I am so thankful that he didn’t fall.  Both Elder Judd and Elder Shaw did
fall off the roof.  On the day that Elder and Sister Judd were leaving, Ken
told Elder Judd to get down off the roof and help his wife pack, but he told
Ken he could help for a while longer.  Then Ken heard a scream and looked over,
and Elder Judd wasn’t on the roof.  He got down off the roof as quick as he
could and they took Elder Judd to the hospital.  He had broke both his arms. 
After we had finished our mission and were home, we got word from Sister Shaw
that Elder Shaw had fallen off another roof and broke his arm.  Ken thought a
lot of Lee and enjoyed being with him.  He also enjoyed working and becoming friends
with Elder Judd and Elder Shaw.  They accomplished a lot during the year we
were there.</p>

align=left hspace=12>We were only with the Judds for three months, but enjoyed
them.  We didn’t do much with them because they had a son and his family in
Bakersfield, so they went there most weekends.  But we became close with <b>Ken
and Vivian Shaw</b> and did a lot with them.  We had Family Home Evening
together and took turns having it at each other’s homes.  If it was at our
home, we would give the lesson, decide on the activity and provide the
refreshments, and they would do the same at their home.  Their home was a
single wide mobile home.  They moved into the home when the two “Ken’s”
finished it.  <b>Vivian and I would be together quite a bit helping with plant
activities</b> or quilting, shopping, etc.  We went on trips together – to the
coast and also to San Diego.  We spent two full days there.  We went to the harbor
at San Diego and toured the Midway  and other ships, we went to the Mormon
Battalion Monument, to the San Diego Temple, To Sea World, to the Old World,
etc.  We had a wonderful time and the weather was perfect.   We also went to
the Los Angeles temple together several times and stayed over at the Patron
house.  It was very inexpensive and was just for those going to the temple.  We
had to reserve a room there in advance.  Vivian, Ken and Ken &amp; I went out
to eat often also, especially when we went to the temple.  We really enjoyed
being with them. </p>

align=left hspace=12>We loved our cute little home which was located in the
middle of the pistachio groves.  It was fun to watch the workers on the
equipment pruning the trees and harvesting the nuts in the fall.  It was also
great to drive through the almond groves, especially in the spring when they
were in blossom.  It was so beautiful.  We lived in Shafter and the plant was
in Wasco, so we were in the next town, but Shafter was a farming community
(Wasco was also), so it was fun to watch the farmers plowing, disking,
planting, and harvesting all kinds of vegetables..  I remember see the corn
fields and the corn was so high, that I started singing: “Oh, what a beautiful
morning, Oh, what a beautiful day.  The corn is as high as an elephant’s eye
and it looks like it’s climbing clear up to the sky.”  Ken and I walked over to
the one field and saw beautiful flowers on the plants.  They were white, pink,
purple, etc.  They were so pretty and we wondered what kind they were.  We
later found out that they were the blossoms on the cotton plants.  We watched
the machine harvest the cotton and that was great to see.  One evening, Ken and
I were walking through the pistachio groves and were quite a ways from home. 
It was starting to get dark and then we heard howling off in the distance.  It
was getting closer.  Dogs were dropped off at the farm often and they would
hook up with the coyotes and form a pack and could be mean.  We started for
home as fast as we could.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Soon after we arrived at the farm,
Lee took us on a tour of the farm and told us that there were 17,000 acres of
almonds and 3,000 acres of pistachios.  He showed us the equipment they used
and explained how they used them and drove us all over the farm pointing out
certain things.  They later took us on a tour of the plant and that was so
interesting also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We soon made friends at the plant
and also at the ward.  It wasn’t long until we were given a calling.  We were
asked to be the nursery leaders.  That was quite a challenge, but we loved the
children and the two Spanish sisters who were assisting us.  They also asked if
we would be in the ward choir.  Practices were held before our meetings and
that worked well.  I was given Tara Guyton as my visiting teaching companion
and we were giving seven sisters to visit teach.  Some were Spanish.  I enjoyed
getting to know them and enjoyed visiting them. The ward had wonderful ward
parties and activities.  They decorated so beautifully and the food was always
so delicious.  Vivian and I were invited to everything.  The plant had a large
park in the center of the homes for the personal and their families who were in
the plant management and staff.  We held plant and ward activities there.  The
main one was the “Farm Fun Day” for all the plant employees, who were mainly
Spanish.  They had a petting zoo, a bounce house, a clown, a booth where they
did face painting, they had a snow cone machine and Ken and I helped there when
I wasn’t telling stories over in my booth.  They had game booths and served
lunch to everyone.  That was a fun day.  They had a wonderful Christmas party
for the plant management, staff and their spouses, and we were also invited. 
They held it at a beautiful reception center in Bakersfield.  The meal was
wonderful and they had “minit to winit” games, which we all enjoyed.</p>

align=left hspace=12>Ken got a hernia, caused by lifting a 5 gallon bucket of
perfatape mud in a fit of anger as the store clerk wouldn’t go around and use
her machine to get the numbers off the bucket, but made him lift it up and put
it on the counter.  It was so heavy and he was so tired.  We were both upset
with her because that wasn’t necessary.  I was going to write a letter to the
manager about her, as it cost us a lot of money and pain for Ken and time away
from the mission for him to recover from his operation, but I didn’t write it. 
Maybe I should have as she needed to be reprimanded.  While Ken was recovering,
we were able to get permission from our mission president and also from Lee to
go back home as our granddaughter, Ashley, was being baptized at that time and
we wanted to be there.  The doctor thought that would be a good idea, but told
him to rest a lot and not lift anything.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>We loved the full-time
missionaries</b> and had them over for dinner at least once or twice a week. 
The ward members didn’t invite them often as they didn’t have much money,
especially the Spanish members.  Elder and Sister Shaw invited them often also.</p>

align=left hspace=12>Soon after our mission began, Sister Judd asked me if I
could take <b>Sister Louise Hyer</b>, from our ward, to her doctor in
Bakersfield.  (Louise is the sister in the pink dress, who is looking at us). She
told me that she had been taking Louise to her appointments as Louise is a
widow and in her 80’s and can’t drive at the present.  I told her I would be
happy to, and I loved this sweet little sister, the minute I met her.  I was
able to take her a few times and always enjoyed being with her.  I went to
visit her at her lovely home a few times.  She had us come for a Valentine’s
dinner before we left our mission.  She wanted to have a dinner for us before
we left.  She also invited Lee and Kim Brown and Vivian and Ken Shaw.  We had a
wonderful time and her dinner was delicious.  When I left, I gave her my plant. 
We called each other a few times after we were home and she told me how the
plant just kept blooming.  She loved plants and had lots, plus lots of rose
bushes and flowers out in her yard.  She passed away shortly after we returned
home.  What a beautiful sister she was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>As we would drive around the area
or go to Roy and Linda’s in Fresno, or to the coast, we would see lots of oil
driggings.  The oil companies could come in and put their machines down in the
grounds.  These machines could move out in all directions for hundreds of feet,
and when they found oil, they would purchase a small plot of ground to put
their oil driggings on, from the owner of the land.  The owners had to sell
them that portion of land and they didn’t get the money for the oil on their
property.  We didn’t think that was fair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We mainly shopped in Bakersfield as
there wasn’t much in Shafter or Wasco.  There was a Winco grocery store as well
as a Costco and a health food store, so we had what we needed.  Bakersfield is
a large city so we were glad we had a GPS to get us where we needed to go.  In
California, you go from one freeway to another and then exit to what part of
the city you want to go to.  I was nervous going there by myself the first few
times even with the GPS.  We found a good family practice doctor there and also
a good surgeon when Ken had his hernia operation.</p>

visit us on this mission.  <b>Bryce and Deanna</b> came down when we drove down
to Shafter &amp; Wasco, for our mission.  We couldn’t bring down everything we
needed, but they had offered to drive their car and bring part of the items we
needed.  They only stayed a day or two and had to get back.  We had stopped in
St. George, on our way, and visited the historic places there.  </p>

align=left hspace=12><b>Bob &amp; Carroll</b> came and stayed for several
days.  We took them on a tour of the plant and a few other places, but they
didn’t feel like traveling again much, but we did take them over to Fresno to
visit Roy &amp; Linda.  We ate, visited and played games.  We didn’t stay the
night as they don’t have that much room and we didn’t want to put them out
anyway.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>With being only an hour away from <b>Roy
&amp; Linda’s</b> home, we visited them quite frequently on the weekends or
they visited us.  We also went on several trips together during the holiday
breaks.  We went to San Francisco and Oakland.  We went to Yosemite National
Park, and we went to Hollywood and took a bus tour all around.  They invited us
to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas day with them.  That was great.  On
Christmas Eve, after dinner, we went to the Christmas Street where all the
houses on both sides of the street are decorated beautifully.  The street has a
wide center area and the neighborhood has decorations and lights on that also. 
On Christmas morning we woke about 7 am, but Roy &amp; Linda were still
asleep.  We decided to put on our bathing suits and go outside to their hot
tub, pick some oranges off their tree and enjoy soaking in the hot tub while
eating those sweet, delicious oranges. After Roy &amp; Linda woke, we opened
our gifts and then went over to Julianna &amp; Phil’s home where they had
invited all of us for Christmas dinner.  It was delicious and we had a good
visit with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Georgia &amp; Rick</b> came to
visit us and spend a few days.  We enjoyed having them and we took them on a
tour of the plant and almond &amp; pistachio groves.  Another day, we took them
down to the ocean.  We went on a tour of the Hirst Castle and afterwards, we
went to a spot on the beach where the elephant seals were and watched them for
a while.  We went to another beach and enjoyed walking and talking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Shellie</b> came and dropped off
<b>Jase</b> for him to spend a week with us while she drove on to Lake Tahoe
where she met Sandi and the two of them stayed in a time-share condo Sandi has
and they had a wonderful time hiking, shopping, eating, visiting, driving
around to see the sights.  It was a wonderful sister’s time for them.  <b>Sandi
&amp; Shellie</b> both came to our home afterward and spend a couple of days
with us.  We took them on a tour of the plant also and one day we all went down
to the ocean.  It was a cold day, but I had told them that it would be, as it
is always cold down by the ocean.  I told them to bring heavy jackets, they
were surprised as it was hot where we lived, but they were glad they had
brought them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Irven &amp; Sandy and Bryce and
Deanna</b> came down for a few days.  We all rode together and went to Sequoia
National Park.  We were amazed at the size of those trees.  We went on a
walking trail and really enjoyed our day there.  It was beautiful.  We enjoyed
being together.  Bryce &amp; Irven were friends in High School and they stayed
friends throughout their lives.  Their wives loved each other too.  Both
couple’s children knew that Ken and I were their aunt and uncle, so they
thought each other’s parents were siblings also and that they were all cousins.
They were surprised when they learned the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Scott &amp; Jeff</b> drove our
truck down, so we could load all our belongings in him along with our car. 
They could only stay overnight as they needed to get back to go to work, but
they were able to look around the plant and pick some oranges to take back with
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We were grateful that so many of our
family could come down to visit us.  The farm manager was lenient with us and
okay with us taking time off to show our family around.  Ken is a hard worker
and accomplished so much for the plant, that I’m sure they felt he needed some
time off to rest and relax with family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken &amp; Vivian Shaw</b> were
the other couple missionaries for most of the time we were there.  We really
enjoyed them.  Ken Shaw had prostate cancer, but that didn’t slow him down.  My
Ken would sometimes tell him to take off early and go home and rest, but he
wouldn’t quit until Ken did.  We went on several trips with them.  Their son
was stationed with his family in San Diego and he was able to get us discount
tickets for the “Midway” ship and other ships and to Sea World.  We also went to
old town and to the Mormon Battalion monument.  We had a great time.  We also
went to the ocean with them.  We went to the Las Angeles Temple several times
together and stayed overnight in the patron house.  We went out to eat several
times with them and we took turns hosting Family Home Evenings.  When we left
to go home, after our mission was completed, they took us out to eat and
presented us with beautiful and thoughtful gifts.  They are great friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>TALK FOR SACRAMENT
MEETING</b><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> </span>in our new Wasco Ward –
MAY 23, 2010 while serving our mission on the South Valley Farms in California </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>“MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON YOUR PIECE OF THE WORLD”</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Brother Allred asked if, before I start my talk,
I would tell you a little about us and our lives.  I grew up in Sunset, Utah in
a wonderful home.   My five siblings &amp; I were born to good parents who
loved the Lord and their family.   Elder Browning was born in Victor, Idaho –
just below the Teton Peaks.  His family moved to Sunset when he was a junior in
High School.   We both dated others, so our first date was about 3 years later
to our stake Sweetheart Ball.  <b>We both love to dance</b> and in those days,
we did ballroom dancing and there were ward or stake dances just about every
Friday or Saturday night, so those were many of our dates.  It was after the
Stake Harvest Ball, 8 months later, that he asked me to marry him.  <u>Ken had
always wanted to go on a mission</u>, but wasn’t able to because he helped
finance his older brother’s mission, and when he met with our bishop about him
going on a mission, our bishop told him that when you find the right person,
then marriage can be the mission.  We were married in the Salt Lake temple, and
we continued to help finance Roy’s mission after we were married.  <b>I told
Ken that someday he and I would go on a mission together</b><u>, and when we
were set apart for our 1<sup>st</sup> mission, which was to the Philippines,
Ken was told that “</u><b>the Lord knew his sacrifice and now it was his turn.”</b> 
We had a great experience over there and loved the people and were amazed at
how the Lord helped us in so many ways.  <b>Our main mission, which our bishop
had told us, is our marriage and raising a family.  We have 6 children, our two
oldest are daughters and then we had 4 sons.  We have 20 grandchildren and 5
great grandchildren. </b> Our oldest grandson is on a mission in the state of
Washington<u>.  I was blessed to be able to stay at home while raising our
children, but when our sons started going on mission, I went to work as a
secretary for an elementary school.  I love secretary work and always wanted to
be an Elementary school secretary.</u>  I later went to the district and
retired as a secretary for Staff Development.  <b>Elder Browning is very
talented and has had several occupations.  He has been successful as a computer
programmer and supervisor of data processing, He has been the manager of two
church welfare farms which amounted to 7 years, and he has been a contractor.</b> 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The month before leaving for our
mission to the Philippines, <b>we were in the temple with all of our children
and their spouses at our youngest son’s marriage.  I think that was the
happiest day of my life</b>.  We have had many trials and challenges in our
lives, just like you and all of us do.  We’ve had health problems, financial
problems, worries &amp; trials with our children and it is ongoing.  We came
back from our 1<sup>st</sup> mission to find that <b>two of our sons had lost
their testimonies</b>, so we keep their names in the temple and we continue to
love and pray for them and their families.  We have faith that if we continue
to obey Heavenly Father’s commandments and endure to the end, that one day we
will be an eternal family.  We have trials and they are supposed to make us
stronger and hopefully they have.  I do know Elder Browning and I have had a
wonderful life and the lord has blessed us in so many ways.  <b>We celebrated
our 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary</b> on the 19<sup>th</sup> of June last summer
with our special family.   <u>When we were set apart for this mission, we were
both told that our marriage would become even stronger and better</u>.  I
thought “Wow! We have a great marriage already”, but I can see that is
happening.  We love being here with all of you wonderful people and are looking
forward to getting to know you even better.  We love serving the Lord and his
children.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The topic I was given to speak on is <b>“Make a
difference on your piece of the world”.</b>  I thought “which piece of the
world have I made a difference on and have I made a difference there?”  Elder
Browning and I have moved around a lot and so we have friends in Arizona, Idaho
and several towns in Utah.  One of the things I was told in my <b>patriarchal
blessing</b> was “to cultivate the spirit of peace, the spirit of joy, the
spirit of happiness that I may be happy and have a sacred influence upon the
lives of others”.    In <b>D&amp;C 136:28-29,</b> it says: <b>“If thou art
merry, praise the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing, and with a
prayer of praise and thanksgiving.&nbsp; If thou are sorrowful, call on the
Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be joyful.”&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I have tried to do as my patriarchal
blessing stated and make a conscious effort to be happy, and by so doing, it
has made me happy.  So I think that one way to make a difference is to read our
patriarchal blessings often and try to fulfill what we are asked to do in
them.  If some of you older teenagers and adults don’t have your patriarchal
blessing, I would encourage you to get it as it is a guide for us as we live
our lives in this world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>  <span class=normalchar><b>The
Daffodil Principle:</b></span></p>

<p class=normal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
class=normalchar>Several times my daughter had telephoned to say, &quot;Mother,
you must come see the daffodils before they are over.&quot;&nbsp; I wanted to
go, but it was a two-hour drive from Lag</span>una to Lake Arrowhead. &quot;I
will come next Tuesday,&quot; I promised, a little reluctantly, on her third
call. Next Tuesday dawned cold and rainy. Still, I had promised and so I drove
there.&nbsp; When I finally walked into Carolyn's house and hugged and greeted
my grandchildren, I said, &quot;Forget the daffodils, Carolyn!&nbsp; The road
is invisible in the clouds and fog and there is nothing in the world except you
and these children that I want to see badly enough to drive another inch!&quot;<span
class=normalchar>&nbsp;</span><br>
<span class=normalchar>         My daughter smiled calmly and said, &quot;</span>We
drive in this all the time, Mother. I was hoping you'd take me over to the
garage to pick up my car.&quot; “How far will we have to drive?” I asked.
&quot;Just a few blocks,&quot; Carolyn said. &quot;I'll drive. I'm used to
this.&quot; After several minutes of driving, I had to ask, &quot;Where are we
going?&nbsp; This isn't the way to the garage!&quot; &quot;We're going to my
garage by the long way,” Carolyn smiled, “by the way of the daffodils.&quot;
&quot;Carolyn,&quot; I said sternly, &quot;please, turn the car around!&quot;
&quot;It's all right, Mother, I promise. You will never forgive yourself if you
miss this experience.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;           After about twenty minutes, we turned onto a small gravel road
and I saw a small church. On the far side of the church, I saw a hand lettered
sign that read: <span class=normalchar><b>“Daffodil Garden.”&nbsp;</b></span><b><br>
</b>&nbsp;           We got out of the car and each took a child's hand and I
followed Carolyn down the path. Then we turned a corner of the path and I
looked up and gasped.&nbsp; Before me lay the most glorious sight! It looked as
though someone had taken a great vat of gold and poured it down over the
mountain peak and slopes. The flowers were planted in majestic, swirling
patterns; in great ribbons and swaths of deep orange, white, lemon yellow,
salmon, pink saffron, and butter yellow.&nbsp; Each different-colored variety
was planted as a group, so that it swirled and flowed like its own river with
its own unique hue.&nbsp; There were five acres of flowers.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;           &quot;But who has done this?&quot; I asked Carolyn. &quot;It's
just one woman,&quot; Carolyn answered. &quot;She lives on the property. That's
her home.” Carolyn pointed to a well-kept A-frame house that looked small and
modest in the midst of all that glory.&nbsp; We walked up to the house.&nbsp;
On the patio, we saw a poster: &nbsp;</p>

class=normalchar><b>There it was--the Daffodil Principle.&nbsp;</b></span><b><br>
</b>&nbsp;           For me, that moment was a life-changing experience.&nbsp;
I thought of this woman, whom I had never met, who, more than forty years
before, had begun, one bulb at a time, to bring her vision of beauty and joy to
an obscure mountain top.&nbsp; Still, just planting one bulb at a time, year
after year, had changed the world.&nbsp; She had created something of
indescribable magnificence, beauty, and inspiration.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;           The principle her daffodil garden taught is one of the
greatest principles of celebration. That is, learning to move toward our goals
and desires one step at a time; learning to use the accumulation of time. When
we multiply tiny pieces of time with small increments of daily effort we too
will find we can accomplish magnificent things.&nbsp; We can change the world. 
<span class=normalchar>We need to begin today—decide what we want to do and

<span class=normalchar>        It's so pointless to think of the lost hours of
yesterday.&nbsp; The question is: </span>How can I make this a lesson

have learned today?&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=normalchar>So, stop waiting until
your car or home is paid off, until you get a new car or home, until your kids

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Several years ago I was talking to
my <b>mother-in-law and asked her if she had written her life history. </b> She
said “no, that she didn’t have anything worthy to write about – that she hadn’t
done anything in her life which would interest her family or others.”  I told
her that I knew that wasn’t true.  I started asking her questions about her
life and as she answered, I began writing them down.  It took several months,
but she became more excited as she told me of one experience after another. 
No, she hadn’t become anyone famous in the eyes of the world, but she had
raised a good family, had been a temple worker, had done name extraction, had
fulfilled several callings in the church.  She had had many trials and I told
her that by us writing them down, her posterity could benefit from them and
from how she handled them.  She had made some mistakes, as we all have, but she
did love the Lord and tried to keep his commandments and she endured to the
end.   We can’t all be Bishops, R.S. Presidents, Stake presidents, general
authorities or general auxiliary leaders – and neither do we all want to have
those positions, but whatever or wherever the Lord calls us to serve, we need
to fulfill it to the best of our ability and that is all the Lord expects.  He
just expects us to do our best.     <b> </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Abraham Lincoln said “I do the
very best I know how—the very best I can; and I mean to keep on doing so until
the end.&nbsp; If the end brings me out all right, what is said against me
won’t amount to anything.&nbsp; If the end brings me out wrong, 10,000 angels
swearing I was right would make no difference”. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>President Monson</b> told about
two of his Sunday School Teachers and the difference they made in his life. 
The one had told her class that at the end of the year they would have <b>a
class party</b>.  They were all looking forward to the party, but a while
before one of their classmates’ mother died and the Sunday before the party,
the teacher showed them the bottle of money they would use for the party, but
then she said:  “I was wondering how you felt about taking this bottle of money
to Jake’s home and give it to his father to help him take care of his family.  
He said they all agreed that it was more important to give the money to them,
so she had them all walk to Jake’s home and they presented it to his father who
had tears in his eyes when he thanked them.   <u>He was taught it is better to
give than to receive</u>.  Another teacher had the class give a <b>scripture
before they entered the room</b>.  If they didn’t have one, he gave them one. 
He said he was thankful to the teacher for he learned many scriptures and at an
early age.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>In Moses 2:24-31 and Abraham 4:24-31</b>, it <b>tells
of the creation of this earth.</b>  “And on the sixth day, the Gods said “Let
us go down and form man in our image, after our likeness…So the Gods went
down.  In the image of the Gods to form they him, male and female to form they
them.  Man is the crowning creature to step forth according to the divine
will.  He is in the image and likeness of the Eternal Elohim and to him is
given “dominion” over all things.  And, then, finally that his purposes shall
roll everlastingly onward, God blesses the male and female whom he has created
and commands them: “Be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth, and
subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”  As the sixth day
closes, the Creators, viewing their creative labors with satisfaction, see that
all things which they have made are very good.  <b>If we are made in the image
of God, and we can become like God, what are we waiting for – let’s do all we
can to make a difference on our piece of the world.     </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“We can’t do all things, but we can do some things and
what we can do, we ought to do.”</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>My favorite scripture is <b>1<sup>st</sup>
Nephi 3:7 </b>“<u>I will go and do the things which the Lord has commanded for
I know that the Lord giveth no commandment unto the children of men, save he
shall prepare a way that they shall accomplish it.”</u>  If we keep the
commandments, and try to follow our Savior’s example by forgetting ourselves
and thinking of others and serving them, even if it’s just a smile some times,
we will find happiness and I feel “we will make a difference in our part of the
world.”</p>

effort into the gifts.  We hated to leave them, but were excited to get back
home to our family.  We got permission to leave a couple of weeks early from
our mission, so we could be to Mike and Becky’s for David’s mission farewell
meeting and we were also there when he was set apart by his stake presidency
for his mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>When we arrived at our home</b>,
Bob told us he didn’t think we wanted to go downstairs to our cute apartment. 
We found out what he meant.  Bob had told us that he didn’t usually go
downstairs, but one day he did and to his surprise, there was water all over. 
We had had problems with the drains and when we heard our sink gurgling, we
would have Bob put some draino down his sinks and it would take care of the
problem.  Well, he didn’t think of that and we were not there to hear the
gurgling, so when he or Carroll did laundry, the water came up in our sink,
overflowed and went all over.  He called the home owner’s insurance and they
told him to get carpenters, and people to put down new carpet in the sun room
and front room, and linoleum in the kitchen. The insurance would pay for all
that, but we would have to pay to have a plumber come to fix the original
problem.  They had to jack hammer from the sink to the middle of the living
room, so fine dust was everywhere.  Ken and I paid to have the plumbing all
taken care of, and we were able to pick out the carpet and linoleum, from a
place in Bakersfield who called their sister company in Riverdale, who we had
worked with.  We didn’t realize we would walk into such a mess.  Carroll had
wrapped my souvenirs and nick nacks, statues of Christ, etc., in newspaper and
put them in boxes, which I surely appreciated, but there were boxes and stuff
all over the cupboards and it was a disaster to walk into.  I felt overwhelmed
after that long trip home and to find this, but we made our bed, got a good
night’s sleep and started cleaning the next day.  Scott and Mishelle came over
to help us some too.  It took several days to get it all clean as that fine
dust didn’t just brush or wash off.  We had to scrub everything and vacuum
everything thoroughly.  Mice had gotten into our one big chair which matched
our set of couch and love seat, so we had to get rid of it.  We decided to go
to R.C. Willey’s Furniture Store where we bought a loveseat which reclined and
a matching rocking chair which also reclined.  In our home in Shafter, there
were two big blue recliners, which we loved, so we wanted recliners here, and
we have really enjoyed them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Here are a couple of my journal entries from our mission</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Wednesday, September 08, 2010</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I left at 7:30 am, following Ken to the Kimberlina Homes
where he is working and where Sister Shaw, myself and other sisters were tying
a couple of quilts for Project Linus.  <b>I am thankful for the <u>Holy Ghost</u>
who prompts and helps us all the time.  Ken went into the back room to carry
out the quilting frames and load them into his truck.  I gathered up the other
things I needed and headed to the car.  When I started the car, the thought
came to me “Did Ken get all the pieces to the quilting frames?”  I drove the
car over to his truck as he was just leaving.  As I asked him, I looked into
the back of his truck and the two pieces of the leg stands were not there.  I
mentioned it to him and he went in the back door to get them.  I went in the
kitchen door and was glad I did, as Ken had forgotten to pick up his lunch.  I
walked on back to the back room to make sure we got all the pieces and parts we
needed.  I was sure thankful to the Holy Ghost for that thought.  He is a
precious gift and I hope I can always be worthy to have him with me to help,
guide, comfort and prompt me.</b>  Back to the quilts, we are to turn them in
Saturday.  We had Mishelle Birch come around 9 and stayed all the time.  Ilene
Payne came for a few minutes and Bonnie Slate came late so was only there for
an hour or two.  We quit around 1:40 leaving for home, but we had completed the
big quilt and enjoyed visiting.  These are special, cute sisters here at the
South Valley Farms.  We were hoping that some other sisters from the ward would
come as it was announced the past two Sundays in Church, but none of them
came.  Anyway, the weather was nice and we enjoyed it.  I came home tired, went
through the mail, and internet mail and got supper.  Ken and I watched Big
Valley DVD (one series) before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Friday, September 17, 2010</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boy, I am worried about Carroll and Linda because of how
they are acting and worried about them getting Alzheimer's or Dementia.&nbsp;
When I was talking with Sandi on the phone today, she told me that she was
going to the Utah State University football game tomorrow with a friend.  My
mind didn’t register; I was thinking she was down here for some reason so I
asked her if she was going to fly up to the Utah State football game.  She said
“Mom, it’s only a couple of hours away to Logan.”  Finally it clicked and I
realized that yes, she was in Utah.   I think I had better worry about myself
getting dementia.   I was really tired and for some reason I was thinking of
her being down here.&nbsp; I haven't been sleeping well and with Bryce, Deanna,
Irven &amp; Sandy here, we have been on the go.&nbsp; It's been great, but I'm
exhausted today.&nbsp; Mrs. Ochoa kept me really busy at school again today
too.&nbsp; I do really enjoy the children and helping out, however.&nbsp; Guess
I'm just getting old.&nbsp; I do feel &quot;old&quot; sometimes.&nbsp; Mom and
dad lived to be 83, but Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell both died at 70 and I will
be that in December.&nbsp; I don't plan on dying at 70; however, as with this
diet and exercise, I'm pretty healthy.  We all got up at 5:30 am this morning,
but the pistachio harvesting is on and the big equipment woke us all up around
4:30.  I fixed us breakfast and they left at 6 oclock.  I then went for my walk
and read my scriptures, then took a shower and got ready to go to Redwood
Elementary where I volunteer in Mrs. Ochoa’s third grade class each Friday.  
Ken made the bed for me again this morning.  He’s sure a wonderful guy and I’m
sure glad he’s mine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I love the Holiday season, and one of the great
things I love about it is hearing from our friends and loved ones..  Some send
photo cards, and Ken and I love these to see how their families have grown. 
Some send letters and we love these so we can hear what they and their families
have been doing during the past year, and some send Christmas cards, and we also
love these as we know that they are thinking of us and sending their love and
good wishes.   Because we love to receive them, we like to send them as we love
and appreciate all of them very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I enjoyed our mission to California at
South Valley Farms.  We received permission to return home the end of February,
which was a week early, so we could be with our grandson, <b>David Michael, as
he was set apart for his mission to Africa </b>and also be with our family as
David spoke in their Sacrament Meeting prior to leaving the following
Wednesday.  We stayed with Mike &amp; Becky &amp; their family until David
left.  It was great to be home with our family again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Some of the other highlights of this year are:</p>

align=left hspace=12><b>For Ken’s birthday, we again went snowmobiling at Trail
Canyon Lodge with Sandi &amp; Nick.  It’s a fun tradition</b>.  We couldn’t go
last year as we were on our California Mission.  I think it was this year that
Ken decided to head up a steep mountain.  I wouldn’t ride behind him, but he
didn’t want me to anyway.  Neither Sandi nor Nick wanted to go either and Ken
shouldn’t have as it was too steep and the snowmobile couldn’t make it and
rolled over on top on him.  We were at the bottom and when we all saw that, we
panicked and Sandi ran up the mountain to her dad as fast as she could. Boy, I
couldn’t believe how fast she got up there. I ran after her, but it was so
steep and slick that I was having a really hard time getting to Ken.  Both
Sandi &amp; I were trying to pull it back off him, but it was too heavy and Ken
said not to.  Nick was trying to get to us, but really having a hard time and
we yelled for him to hurry.  When he got there, Ken told us to roll the
snowmobile forward off him.  We were worried about crushing him, but we did and
Nick grabbed hold of the handlebars as it turned right side up, and flew down
the mountain holding on to it and was able to guide it down safely.  Ken was
alright, thank goodness, as he had his helmet on and that protected his head,
but he said he was having a hard time breathing and was thankful we were able
to get it off him as soon as we did.  He agreed that that was a foolish thing
to do and he promised us he wouldn’t do anything like that again.</p>

align=left hspace=12>Ken and I were with them most of this time except we
stayed longer at Lava Hot Springs as Scott, Mishelle &amp; family and Jeff,
Gail &amp; family were coming up and we wanted to spend time with them also. 
Scott &amp; Mishelle &amp; family were there when Shellie, Roy &amp; sons and
Sandi &amp; Dawson were there so we all went rafting down the river a few
times.  It was fun.  We also went to the mineral hot pools in Lava for one
evening and we all enjoyed that.  Jeff &amp; Gail came the next day after
Shellie &amp; family and Sandi &amp; Dawson had left.  We all enjoyed being
together.  We ate together, played games, visited and played on the teeter totters
which were in the campsites. After Scott, Jeff and families left to go home,
Ken and I drove on up to Cody Wyoming to join up with our daughters and
families.  Roy’s parent’s, Veldon &amp; Patsy, were on a mission there so we
stayed with them and spent the following day with them showing us around Cody. 
We went to the church, where they serve, as it is also a museum and they took
us on a tour of it.  They then took us to the Buffalo Bill Cody museum and it
was a fun place.  They even had lots of guns and other memorabilia from
Jonathon and John Browning.  They had a Wild West show enactment on the streets
in the evening.  It was ok, but we saw much better ones at Old Tucson, Arizona
when we went there, while living in Arizona. </p>

drove on to Jackson Wyoming and spent the night there in a great motel.  We all
ate dinner at a cute café and then Ken and the boys went back to the motel and
went swimming and in the hot tub.  Ken’s feet were hurting so he didn’t feel
like walking longer, but Shellie, Roy, Sandi and I walked down town and into
the shops.  Sandi, Shellie &amp; I bought a T shirt and we had fun being
together.  The next morning, we ate at a nice café and had a good breakfast,
then went on our way to<b> Flaming Gorge</b>.  We set up camp and then let
everyone take our boat and go boating while Ken and I fixed a Dutch Oven Dinner
for all of us.  They didn’t stay very long as it started to rain.  We enjoyed
visiting and singing around the campfire that night and after breakfast and
pictures the next morning, all of them left us to go on their way to Durango
Colorado where they spent another couple of days.  Then they separated, and
Sandi and Dawson left them and came back home and Shellie, Roy and boys went on
to their home in Arizona.  Ken and I wanted to stay longer at Flaming Gorge, so
we enjoyed camping there for a couple more days.   Ken caught fish in the
stream by where we camped, and we took the boat and went fishing in the Gorge. 
We had a great time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Another vacation was going to Zion’s
National Park again this year with Jeff, Gail &amp; kids,</b> we went in
September instead of October and it was way hot.  We had to go on the trails
during the morning hours and then play in the river in the afternoons.  We were
glad we had the river close by.   One of the things I remember about this trip
was when all of us hiked up the mountain trail on the other side of the tunnel,
we met three oriental men.  Don’t know if they were from Japan or china.  They
had expensive cameras and were taking pictures of all the landscape.  When we
arrived on top, they asked if they could take a picture of us.  We agreed, but
they wanted more and more pictures.  This made us a little nervous.  We finally
said we had to head back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We didn’t go to Zion’s in 2012 as Jeff started a new job and

<p><b><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Email to family:  Dear
family, about Easter Egg Hunt, Snowmobiling at Trail Creek Lodge, etc. 2012</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;I have heard about the
&quot;wheat shortage&quot; from different people.&nbsp; Maybe you have heard
about it too.&nbsp; I had heard that the LDS mills still had some, but I was
talking to a friend yesterday in church and she said they are out too.&nbsp;
She and her husband volunteer at the church mill in Kaysville every Wednesday.&nbsp;
She said there was a rush on wheat and it is gone now.&nbsp; She said they had
a truck come in last week and people knew it was coming in and within a few
hours, it was all gone.&nbsp; She said she checks on the internet regularly and
found it is a major concern world wide.&nbsp; We hope you have already got some
put away for your food storage.&nbsp; Maybe it isn't as big a concern as she
and others are saying, but maybe it is.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;It has been great getting
together with most of you lately.&nbsp; Thanks for the Birthday dinners for dad
and time spent with you.&nbsp; We've enjoyed being with our newest grandbaby,
Rachel Lyn, and her parents and brother.&nbsp; Dad wanted to celebrate his
birthday at Lava and soak in the mineral tubs.&nbsp; He also wanted to go snowmobiling,
so he checked around and found the best place to do that was at Soda Springs in
Idaho which is just 25 miles from Lava.&nbsp; Sandi and Nick went with us and
we had a great time.&nbsp; We spent one night&nbsp;at Lava and one night at
Soda Springs.&nbsp; The lodge was so fun there at Soda Springs.&nbsp; It is a
bed and breakfast.&nbsp; We were the only ones there at that time, so it was
really fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner&nbsp;gave us a&nbsp;super deal since we were
renting a double snowmobile for $120.00 and since we weren't there on a weekend.&nbsp;
He gave us 2 rooms for $40.00 ($20.00 for each couple) and that included a
wonderful breakfast of sausage, eggs, hash browns, toast&nbsp;and orange
juice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lodge&nbsp;had a large screen TV with a DVD player, hot
tub, fireplace, tables to play games, etc. plus 25 miles of groomed snow mobile
trails with lots of hills and valleys to play around on.&nbsp; The four of us
plan to go again next year, and we'd like to invite any of the rest of you to
go with us.&nbsp; We will stay the two nights at the Lodge in Soda Springs
rather than stay one night in Lava.&nbsp; They have several snowmobiles to
rent.&nbsp; If you rent a snowmobile, they furnish the snowmobile outfits
free.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had all of that for Wednesday afternoon, Wednesday night
and most of the day on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only cost us&nbsp;$76.00 a
couple, (we shared the cost of the snowmobile and the rooms).&nbsp; &nbsp;Sandi
said it was the most fun she has ever had snowmobiling.&nbsp; This was the
first time Nick has been snow mobiling and I asked him if he liked it and he
said he loved it.&nbsp; If we go during the week, and if most of you wanted to
go, we could rent the lodge for a good price.&nbsp; It has 7 bedrooms, plus
lots of other space for sleeping bags.&nbsp; Let us know soon if you are
interested as we need to make the reservations soon.&nbsp; The owner&nbsp;says
that many people make reservations a year in advance.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Dad's Christmas or birthday
gift from you - Dad's guided fishing trip in August is another fun trip we're
looking forward to.&nbsp; We will take our&nbsp;boat and tent trailer and plan
to stay the week at Flaming Gorge reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad's guided trip for
the big fish is for part of a day, but since we will be there, we wanted to
stay a week.&nbsp; If any of you can come, we would love to have you.&nbsp;
Sandi and Nick will be there as he will be on the guided trip too.&nbsp; Not
sure if they are staying the entire week.&nbsp;That will be the week of August
4th through the 9th.&nbsp; I'm sure we will be going to East Canyon Reservoir
again at least once or twice this summer and maybe to Willard Bay and take
&quot;Great Big Mable&quot;, so hopefully some of you can some during those
times too.&nbsp; Shellie and family will be coming up again in July, so we will
have a &quot;Girl's Day Out&quot; again.&nbsp; We'll plan that later, but if
you girls have any ideas for what to do or where to go, please let me
know.&nbsp; Shellie and family always like to go to Lagoon while they are here,
so maybe some of you could go with us there too, plus we will have a family
barbecue.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp;will have at least 2 or 3 more Saturday summer
barbecues in our back yard too.&nbsp; If any of you have ideas for fun things
to do as families or as couples, let us know that also.  Well, we hope you all
have a wonderful Easter.&nbsp; Come see us when you can.&nbsp; We know you are
all busy, but you don't need an invitation to come.&nbsp; We're always excited
to see you when you can.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>HAWAIIAN CRUSE WITH SANDI, SHELLIE &amp; ROY – December 1
– 17, 2012</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We got up at 3AM and got Sandi’s
luggage packed into the car.  When we finished the car was really loaded.  We
had six suite cases, each weighing about 50 pounds, plus the three of us.  We
left Tooele at 4:30AM with some winds.  We stopped at St. George for rather to
eat.  There were some winds but no storm.  Before getting into California we
saw snow on the high mountains, but the roads were good.  With the G.P.S. we
were able to travel right on to our motel in Long Beach.  At the motel, we went
out to soak in the hot tub and a swim in the pool,  Roy and Shellie were late
leaving home and when they got to the California Border they were held up for 1
½ hours getting through the Border inspection.  It was 10PM when they got to
the motel.  We visited with them for a little while before we all went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We went in for breakfast, which was very good.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We got to the pier at 1PM but the
ship had been two hours late getting to the port, so they were late starting
the check in.  It was after 7PM when the ship left the dock.  We toured some of
the boat and then went to dinner.  Dinner was very good, and they sure are
trying to take care of us with Mae and my diet needs.  After dinner we went
exploring the ship.  It is quite a boat.  After leaving Roy and Shellie, Sandi,
Mae and I started for our room.  On the way we passed a dance hall, so <b>Mae
and I danced for a few minutes.</b>  <img width=186 height=1
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image313.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>We have always loved to dance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I woke shortly after 4AM and mainly
watched the ocean waves.  After the sky started to lighten I saw tuna
surfacing.  Sandi and Mae came to the port window and watched them with me. 
The waves are quite large and the ocean very rough.  It is interesting to walk
around with the ship swaying.  After a good breakfast, we attended a ballroom
dance class and really enjoyed that.  Mae and Sandi did some research of shore
activities.  When Mae and Sandi came back we went to the dance lessons.  We
then had some Suchi which was Mae’s first time.  We came back and got ready for
dinner.  We met Roy and Shellie at the Monarch room and played Mexican Train
Dominos until dinner time.  We stayed for a show <img width=346 height=1
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image314.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>but I wasn’t very impressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We didn’t have a lot of activity
except meals.  We watched the movie “The Man Called Peter” using our computer
and projector.  It makes it a little crowded with 5 of us in our room.  This
afternoon we attended a dance class.  We then came back and dressed in our best
for the dinner this evening.  We then went for pictures to be taken.  They had
many photographers taking many poses so that everyone had lots of chooses.  We
did have some time to dance in some of the Ball Rooms before going to dinner. 
This was the captains evening in the dining room.  He spoke for a minute, but I
really wasn’t very impressed.  After dinner we attended Show Time and the Big
Band.  We were tired but when we went past the Club Cool room we couldn’t
resist going in and dancing until mid-night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mae and I went walking around the
ship as the weather was much warmer today.  It was fun walking all over the
upper decks.  The sun broke through the clouds and everyone was out sun
bathing.    We were able to use the swimming pool and they we quite warm.  
Sandi came and said that they wanted to play miniature golf, but I was tired,
so Mae went, and I took a nap.  An hour and a half later Mae came back and woke
me.  We went to a dance lesson but didn’t stay very long as it was basic Fox
Trout steps.  We looked at the pictures that were taken last night and picked
some of what we liked.    We came back to our cabin and watched the movie “The
Ultimate Gift” and we all enjoyed it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This morning when I woke my pain
level was up.  I will have to be stricter with my diet.  After breakfast the
five of us played the game “Trans America” and quite enjoyed it.  Sandi and I
attended the dance class.  While we did that Mae went to our cabin and lay down
for a while.  We then went up to Roy and Shellie’s cabin and played “Mormon
Bridge”.  After getting started in the card game we attended the Magician
show.  Following dinner, we finished the card game we started earlier.  It was
late when we were ready to go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=229 height=1
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image315.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>We came into port about 10AM.  It was neat to see us come
into the island.  Sandi, Mae and I took a bus tour to the Hawaii Volcano
National Park.  Roy and Shellie took a helicopter tour of the Island.  On the
way we stopped at the Mauna Loa Macadamias plant and saw how they processed the
Macadamia nuts.  We also bought some packages of the nuts for gifts and to
eat.  After returning we went to a show on board the ship and then to dinner. 
After dinner we came back to our room and the five of us watched “Heaven Can
Wait” which was a cute show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We arrived at Maui at 8AM and
disembarked shortly after in order to be on our tour by 10AM.   Sandi, Mae and
I rode the tour bus to the Sheraton Hotel where we walked through their
facilities to the beach.  It was a beautiful sandy beach where we enjoyed the
warm sun shine.  We also enjoyed snorkeling and seeing the many fish.  Back at
the ship, we then went to eat and then attended an Hawaiian dance show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This morning we were at the Island of Oahu.  I woke with the
pain level very high.  We went for breakfast and then left for the tours.  Mae,
Sandi and I went on a bus tour of Diamond Head.  Most of the stops, I stayed on
the bus because my feet and legs hurt too much to walk very far.  The tour
guide was very good and we did enjoy the trip.  I have really watched what I
have eaten today but tonight I’m still in a lot of pain.  When we came back to
the ship I got me some chicken to eat and went to the cabin.  Mae and Sandi
went shopping.  I took a nap.  Mae and Sandi had a lot of fun shopping this
afternoon.  This evening I watched a show on TV.  Mae and I went to bed early.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=235 height=1
src="THE%20LIFE%20OF%20IVA%20MAE%20PORTER%20BROWNING%20-%20UPDATED%20-%20from%20flash%20drive_files/image316.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>            This morning we were on the Island of Kauai. 
We set the alarm and was up at 6AM in order to be ready for our shore excursion
at Kauai.  Mae didn’t sleep very well last night because she was worried about
me.  I do feel much better today, although my feet are still tender.  Roy and
Shellie went four wheeling in the mud.  Sandi, Mae and I went on the Waimea
canyon &amp; Wailua river boat tour to the Fern Grotto.  It was a very
beautiful ride up the river and then when we got up the canyon we docked and
had a short walk up through beautiful jungle trees and plants to a cave.  They
only let us go to a view area because the hurricane had damaged the cave and
loosened the rocks above making it dangerous to go further.  When we got there
the tour was to show and teach some Hula but it started to rain very hard. 
Finally when it broke they had everyone return to the boat where they gave us
the show.  It was good that they did because it rained more.  This area has
more rain than anywhere on the earth receiving over 400 inches annually.  It
was a very worth wile experience.  When we returned Mae and Sandi again went
shopping.  I came back to the cabin and took a nap.  This evening Roy, Shellie,
Sandi, Mae and I went to the evening show, which was a Juggler Entertainment. 
We stopped for more photo shouts and went to dinner and then quit for the
night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Today we are on the Island of Hawaii, city of
Kona.  We had to get up early in order to be on time for our tour.  The weather
was very pleasant.   Sandi, Shellie and Roy went on a tour where they were able
to swim with wild dolphins.  They also saw a hump back whale.  Mae and I went
on a walking tour in the city.  My pain level is high, and my feet and legs
hurt.   For breakfasts I have been having scrambled eggs but as I finished
eating this morning it dawned on me that they probably are using powered eggs
mixed with water and milk.  That was kind of dumb on my part.  The tour was
very good but by the time it was over my pain level was high.  Mae and I set on
a bench and ate a boiled egg.  We were going to go through a museum when Sandi
called and said that they were back from their tour.  We waited for her to join
us.  I decided to return to the ship and let Mae and Sandi continue in town.  I
carried several items back with me so that they wouldn’t have to carry them around
town.  When I got back to the pier I met Roy and Shellie.  I also took their
snorkeling equipment back to the boat with me, so they wouldn’t have to pack it
with them.  After dropping the extra items off at our cabin, I then up to the
dining area and got something to eat.  I then came back to the cabin and I fell
asleep until Mae and Sandi came.  We departed Hawaii about 4PM.  As soon as we
got out to sea the seas seem to become quite rough.   We put on the DVD movie
“Golden Plates”.  It wasn’t finished when Shellie called just before 7PM.  She
reminded us of this evening’s entertainment.  We paused the movie and went up
to the theater.  We were able to find Roy and Shellie there.  The show was a
musical and dance production that was very good.  After dinner we ended up
getting more pictures taken.  My pain level was high so I found a place to just
sit.  When Mae came we went downstairs to our cabin.  Sandi wasn’t much longer
coming to the cabin.  We watched the rest of the movie and really enjoyed it. 
Roy and Shellie came down to get their scuba gear and while they were here I
had Roy give me a Priesthood blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are back on the ship.   We slept in this
morning.  I slept fairly well although the pain level in my feet, legs and hips
is quite high.  I didn’t get up for breakfast, but Mae brought some breakfast
down to me.  Mae isn’t feeling very good this morning.  She seems to have some
congestion and a sore throat.  The sea is quite rough this morning.  The waves
are very interesting to me and I think of the earlier mariners, especially the
early Saints and also the scriptural accounts.  Our cabin boy “Katut” came in
to clean our room.  This afternoon we played some card games.  Mae is feeling worse,
but she did go to dinner.  My pain level is decreasing as the day goes on.  We
came back to our cabin after dinner and soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am feeling much better, but Mae is feeling
quite bad.  I went up and brought back breakfast for the two of us.  Sandi and
Shellie went running and later some sun broke through, so they went sun
tanning.  Mae and I watched a movie on DVD titled A Walk in the Clouds” that
was very good even though it was rated PG13.  Both Mae and I took a nap.  This
afternoon we watched another movie “The Blind Side” and that was very good. 
Roy, Shellie and Sandi came down and we played some games.  At dinner time Mae
still isn’t feeling well.  Sandi checked with the dining room and she was told
that they couldn’t take food out.  So, I went up to the 9<sup>th</sup> floor
and got us something.  We had just finished eating when our waiter from the
Dining Room brought our dinner to us.  They have treated us so good there.  I
put most of the food in the refrigerator for tomorrow.  Mae went to sleep after
eating but before she did I gave her a Priesthood Blessing.  I watched an old
John Wayne movie and finished this entry before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mae was quite sick during the night with a high
fever.  This morning when she woke she felt some better.  I woke for a while,
but it was still dark.  I went back to bed and may have dosed a little.  When
we got up we decided to go up for breakfast and then go to the hot tub.  Sandi
and Shellie also came up for breakfast at the same time.  They had gone walking
at 6AM.  Roy decided to sleep in.  After eating, Mae and I went up to the
indoor spa and enjoyed it for a few minutes.  We came down to our cabin and lay
down.  Mae laid took a nap while I worked on the computer.  When Mae woke, we
watched the movie “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas”.  It was good but also depressing. 
I took a walk around the boat.  The sea is quite rough, and the winds outside
are strong.  This evening the five of us got together and played games for a
little while before getting ready for dinner.  Mae and I were served a fish
with tomato sauce on.  I was concerned about the sauce, so I asked our waiter
and he assured me that it had been made especially for us without any sugar. 
It was very good and probably the best tasting food we had been served.  Mae
wasn’t as happy with it as I because of the spices.  After dinner we went to a
dance where I danced with Sandi once and Mae once before we went to the
Pharoses Palace for this evening’s entertainment.  It was good as far as
performance, but for Mae and I it was too loud, lights to bright, and costumes
too revealing.  After the program ended Mae and I came to our cabin and got
ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are now in California’s time.  I woke at 4:30
and not being sleepy I took the camera and went up to the 9<sup>th</sup>
floor.  I fixed me a cup of hot herbal tea.  We found that using our protein
powder as a creamer with the tea makes a very pleasant drink.  I wanted to go
up on the top deck, but it is still closed off due to winds, so I walked around
the ship for a while.  I went out on the side deck on the 3<sup>rd</sup> level
but it was dark, windy and then it started to rain, so I went back to our cabin
about 6AM.  I went back to bed and after a while fell asleep.  When I woke
again Sandi had left and the skies had cleared, and the sun was shining.  Mae
and I went up for breakfast about 10AM.  Mae still isn’t feeling good so we
tried to find somewhere outside to lay in the sun but the wind is still cold,
and we didn’t want Mae to get cold so we came back to our cabin.  Our cabin had
been cleaned while we were gone.  That has been one of the fun things about
this cruse is to have the cleaning and cooking all taken care of for us.  Mae
went back to bed and I read a couple of chapters in the Book of Mormon before
working on my journals.  Roy, Shellie, Sandi and I started to play miniature golf,
but the winds were so strong that we quit.  Sandi, Shellie, Mae and I played a
short game of Hearts before we went for our dinner. This evening for dinner Mae
and I had pork steak that was very good.  We attended the evening program, but
I wasn’t very impressed with it.  Mae and I came back to our cabin and soon got
ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke at 6AM and soon went up to the 9<sup>th</sup>
deck where I could see the sun rise.  I took several pictures and just marveled
at the beautiful sun rise.  I couldn’t help but think of the scriptural
reference as to “Why does God consider my worth when He has such creations.”  I
hadn’t taken a coat with me and it was very cold so when I got back to the
cabin I got back in bed to warm up.  We went up to breakfast about 9:30AM and
then at 11AM we attended the debarkation meeting.  From there we went to the
dance class.  We spent the rest of the morning packing.  Sandi and Shellie
participated in a one mile walk St. Jude Children Fund.  After lunch we
continued the packing.   The ship got into Ensenada about 4PM.  After it docked
Shellie called us and said that they could see seals from their cabin deck.  We
went up but as the men tied the boat it scared the seals into the water.  After
we watched them in the water for a few minutes, Roy, Shellie and Sandi left to
go into Ensenada shopping.  Mae and I continued to watch the seals return after
the men finished securing the ship and left.  We stayed until one large seal
climbed up the rocky bank and lay on the shore.  More would have followed but a
man kept walking on the dock to see the seals, so the seals would not get out
of the water.  We finally went back to our cabin.   Mae became very worried
about the kid’s safety and, so we had a prayer asking for their safety.   Mae
and I then went up to the 9<sup>th</sup> deck and got us some bean soup.  While
we were eating Mae over heard a lady and she was very upset.  The lady’s
husband was in a wheelchair and she had evidently had a run in with some of the
passengers while she was trying to get both her and her husband’s dinner.  She
was about in tears, so Mae went over to her and visited with her for a few
minutes.  That is one of the neat characteristics of my special wife.  She is
so concerned about others.  After eating we went to the game room and played a
game of Rummy in which Mae won.  She does that quite often.  By the time we
finished the game Mae was getting quite worried about the kids.  We just
started to go looking for them when Sandi came.  Mae was very relieved.  They
had found a tour bus at the dock that took them around the city and then to a store,
so they could get some vanilla.  All of us went dancing this evening and had a
lot of fun.  It was mid-night when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up at 5:30AM but Mae and Sandi slept a
little longer.  We went up for breakfast at 7AM and then came back to the cabin
and finished getting the suitcases ready to go.  I took a short nap.  It took
us quite a while to debark but the customs came onto the boat so when we got
through them we went right off.  Sandi’s arms started hurting her, so I pulled
both her luggage and mine.  Mae did pretty good with hers.  Roy and Shellie
weren’t far behind us.  Shellie’s bag had trouble with its wheels so that was a
little difficult for her.  We left L.A. about 12:30PM and traveled straight
through with only a stop for Subways sandwiches.  We got to Sandi’s at 12:30AM,
so with losing an hour time with time-zone, we made it in just about 11 hours. 
We were very tired and sure glad to be staying at Sandi’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another year has come and gone.  It seems like
the months &amp; years just fly by and our grandchildren grow taller and taller
and soon they are grown up, going off to college, on missions, getting married
&amp; having children.  I look in the mirror and realize I am getting older
too, but the aches and pains, in my body, tell me that also.  However, Ken and
I have relatively good health and we are very grateful for that.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our children and their families are doing well. 
Jeff, Gail &amp; family and Scott, Mishelle &amp; family live in Layton. 
David, Shauna &amp; family live in Enterprise, which is North of Morgan.  Mike,
Becky &amp; family live in American Fork.  Shellie, Roy &amp; Family live in
Queen Creek, Arizona with their son &amp; his wife living in Mesa.  And, Sandi
&amp; Nick live in Tooele with Sandi’s daughters &amp; families living in
Tooele County.  We love having most of our children live close by so we can
enjoy family dinners, going to grandchildren’s sports events, recitals,
birthdays and other special events and going on vacations together.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mike &amp; Becky’s son, David, is
serving his mission in Africa and will be home the first part of February.  
David’s sister, <b>Paige, is attending Utah State University</b>.  Shellie
&amp; Roy’s son, <b>Quint, will be leaving for his mission to Washington DC on
the 12<sup>th</sup> of December.</b>  David &amp; Shauna’s son, <b>Conner, was
baptized this year</b>.  Ken and I have 21 grandchildren and six great
grandchildren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>My siblings and I were in charge
of the Bushnell Family Reunion held in August</b>.  It is our grandparent’s
descendants on our mother’s side.  It is held for three days every three
years.  It was held in Tropic, Utah and there were 150 in attendance.  It took
a lot of planning and effort to prepare the food and activities, but everyone
had a good time, so we were happy.   <b>Ken &amp; I also hosted the Glendon
Porter Family Reunion, which are my parent’s descendants.  It was only an
afternoon and evening and we held it in our back yard.  We had a good time at
this reunion also. </b>  Ken &amp; I were able to go on some camping and
fishing trips with our children and their families and we surely enjoyed these
vacations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>We had our usual snowmobiling
trip to Trail Creek Lodge with Sandi &amp; Nick for Ken’s birthday, but this
year Shellie &amp; Roy joined us</b>.  We all had a great time, except for the
fact that the people who owe it, Sid and Sherrie, got in trouble for taking
people on guided hunting trips without a license and Sid is in prison for it. 
Sherrie is running it, but had to charge more and the snowmobiles were not
running properly and we had to drive to Soda Springs for gas for them, which
never happened before.  Ken worked for a long time getting them to run.  There
were only 3 snowmobiles so we couldn’t all go together at the same time,
although I think we doubled up even though two of the snowmobiles were meant
for just one rider.  The guys went one time by themselves.  We had good meals
again – Nick &amp; Roy ate regular food, but Sherrie made gluten free, dairy
and sugar free food for Sandi, Shellie, Ken &amp; I.  We had fun playing games
and visiting. Ken and I also decided we are too old to go snowmobiling now.  It
isn’t as fun as it used to be since we are older.  We now understand why Rich
and Lois finally didn’t want to do it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> <b>  Our family went to Payson
Lake for a vacation.</b>  Most of the family just came up on Saturday to spend
the day.  David was studying hard as he was in medical school, but Shauna came
and brought her kids.  Mike, Becky and their family came that day too.  I think
Jeff, Gail &amp; the children stayed the weekend with us.  I can’t remember if
Scott, Mishelle and their family came.  Sandi came and I think she brought
Dawson, but not sure if she did.  It rained part of the time and cooled off at
night.  Sandi had brought her shade tent so we put it over the table and we
played games under it even though it was raining.  Shauna and the kids hadn’t
brought jackets, but we had some extras, thank goodness as it was quite cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The remainder of the summer &amp;
fall was spend gardening, working in the yard, canning fruit and vegetables and
spending time with our family and friends and tending grandchildren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and I are still the family

<p class=MsoNormal>The picture of Ken &amp; I was taken last December when we
went on a Hawaiian cruse with our two daughters, Sandi &amp; Shellie and
Shellie’s husband, Roy.  Sandi’s husband, Nick, wasn’t able to get off work, so
we missed him not being with us.  We had a wonderful time; it was a great
Christmas present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Hawaiian cruise with Shellie &amp;
Roy and Sandi in December 2012 - </b> Shellie called me I think in October and
asked if dad and I would like to go on an Hawaiian cruse with them the first
couple of weeks in December.  It was a 14 day cruise.  Ken and I talked about
it, but decided not to go as we didn’t want to spend that much money,
especially at this time of year and especially with it being such a busy
month.  We would be missing the ward and R.S. Christmas parties and other
holiday activities and I had a lot to do to get ready for Christmas.  Besides
that both Ken and I are allergic to gluten, dairy and sugar, so what fun would
that be on a cruise &amp; great vacation if we couldn’t have any of that which
is in most of the food on the ship and in Hawaii.  Shellie said that we could
tell them when we signed up and they would make special meals for us which we
could eat.  Shellie called Sandi and Sandi wanted to go, but Nick couldn’t get
off work and she didn’t want to spend that money on a cabin by herself. 
Shellie called me back and put more pressure on us, saying that Sandi wanted to
go, but couldn’t unless we went too so we could share the cabin with her and it
wouldn’t cost either of us so much.  We finally decided to go.  We did have a
great time, however, since both Ken and I love frozen yogurt and they had those
machines, we ate one now and then.  Our meal hostess would come to our table
each day and give us the special gluten/dairy free menu and help us plan our
meals for the next day.  We wouldn’t choose any desserts.  The gluten free
bread was terrible, so we didn’t eat much of that.  We pretty much had the same
meal each night: baked chicken, green salad, the same vegetables and our bread
and water.  It was hard when Sandi, Shellie &amp; Roy could eat anything they
wanted, but we stayed healthy most of the time, except that since Ken had eaten
the frozen yogurt and fudged a little here and there, suddenly he was in pain. 
Shellie, Roy &amp; Sandi had warned him not to eat anything he shouldn’t, but
since he did and the scrambled eggs each morning had milk in them and he didn’t
realize that, he had pain mainly the last day on the ship and wasn’t able to
walk around, on the tours, like the rest of us.  He had to stay on the tour bus
some while Sandi &amp; I got off and saw the sights.  He did get off some, but
his feet always hurt.  I felt bad for him.  We cruised over for four days and
it was fun being on the ship.  We went to the game room and played games when
the weather was rainy or cold.  When it was nice, we swam in the pool,
sunbathed, sat in the hot tub, played miniature golf or shuffle board.  Sandi
and Shellie usually got up early and met at the gym and exercised and then went
walking or jogging around the ship for more exercise.  We all love to dance and
they had a dance instructor each day who taught the fox trot, swing and other
dances.  We usually tried to go to those classes even though Ken and I didn’t
need them.  In fact, he told us that, but we told him we love to dance so
enjoyed it anyway.  Sometimes, Sandi, Shellie or myself would be his dance
partner as his wife was in a wheelchair, but worked the music.  Roy &amp; Ken
took turns dancing with Sandi too, plus other men asked her to dance.  At night
they had different entertainment in the main event center.  One night they had
a musician, one night they had a hypnotist and two nights each way they had the
ships dancers and singers put on a show.  They were good, but sometimes wore
skimpy costumes.  After the show, we would go to a dance floor where a Filipino
dance band was playing.  They had great voice too, especially the lead singer. 
They played songs that were great to dance to so we loved going there each
night.  Again, Roy &amp; Ken danced with Sandi off and on too so she could have
fun.  She is a great dancer and her and her dad looked great together.  I took
lots of pictures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went to a different Hawaiian Island each day
for five days and went on tours there.  That was great!  Roy &amp; Shellie went
on different tours as they had already signed up for them before we decided to
go on the cruse.  They went on a Helicopter ride one day, which was very
expensive and she said there were clouds so they couldn’t see as much as they
were supposed to.  They went to the Polynesian Cultural Center another day. 
They went on a Mud Jeep Ride one day where they got really muddy and they went
swimming with Dolphins one day.  Sandi went on that with them and they went
snorkeling one day.  Ken, Sandi and I went to on several bus tours.  One was to
volcanoes, another to where a volcano had been and we climbed up a mountain to
get to it.  The tour bus drivers always were explaining things and pointing
things out to us as we traveled.  Another tour was to a place where the wind
blows upward and they tell of a maiden who jumped off the cliff there and the
wind blew her back.  The wind was incredible there.  We went on a fun Hawaiian
boat ride down a beautiful river to a gorgeous jungle area where we walked down
a path to an opening where we all stood and looked at the cave across from us. 
The foliage was beautiful.  They have weddings there.  A group of Hawaiian
dancers and singers were there to perform for us, bus it started raining so
they performed to us on our way back down the river. Another day the tour took
us to a beautiful resort and beach.  We sunbathed, swan and snorkeled.  That
was great fun as Ken and I had never been snorkeling before.  It was great to
see all the different fish underwater.  That was a great day!! The last day we
went on a walking tour around the city of ??  That was the day Sandi went on the
“Swimming with dolphins tour” with Shellie &amp; Roy.  Sandi called us on our
cell phone and she met up with us and then Ken went back to the ship as his
feet were really hurting.  Sandi &amp; I went to gift shops and bought
souvenirs  Sandi, Shellie &amp; I went shopping one night after our tours. I
bought a beautiful top which I wear a lot.  I also bought Hawaiian dancing
dolls for my granddaughters for Christmas.  Sandi &amp; Shellie bought them
Hawaiian dresses and we all bought Leis to wear on ship for the Hawaiian dinner
meal.  We would eat breakfast, which was a delicious buffet and then go on our
tours.  Lunch was up to us, but we would have the dinner meal back on board the
ship each night. We all had a great time.  Hawaii is so beautiful and there is
so much to see and do.  The ship was beautiful too.  Our cabin had a window
where we could look out and see Tuna jumping, etc.  Ken &amp; I had a queen
sized bed and Sandi could either sleep on the couch or the bed which folded up
in the wall.  She did that the first few nights, but it was hard going up and
down the ladder, so she finally just slept on the couch.  It was great being
with our daughters and Roy, we all had a great time together.  I prayed for
several years that our daughters would be close and love each other and want to
be together.  They are now and we are so grateful.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Disneyland with Gail, her
children and her mom, Marcy in May of 2013</b> -  Ken and I were at Jeff &amp;
Gail’s one Sunday evening playing games when Gail started telling us that her
and her mom were taking the children and going to Disneyland in May.  She said
that Jeff was going to take off a couple of days to fly down and meet them and
be with them for a day and fly back. She said he didn’t have much vacation
time, but she wanted him to be with her and the kids for part of the time.  In
talking with them, it turns out that Jeff really didn’t want to go.  He’s like
Ken, he doesn’t like amusement parks and he didn’t have time to take off.  He
said: “Mom, you would like to go in my place, wouldn’t you?”  He caught me off
guard and I told him I would love to be with Gail, her mom and the kids, but
that I needed to be home with Ken to keep him on our strict diet.  He asked Ken
if he wouldn’t be alright for a week as he thought it would be great to have
two grandmas’ and their mom.  That way each child could have someone to be with
and go on rides with.  Anyway, it turned out that he talked me and Ken into it,
and Gail too, however, she was disappointed that Jeff couldn’t go.  Jeff told
me that since I would be going in his place and doing a favor for him, he would
pay for me to go.  I ended up going and having a wonderful time.  Ken and I
missed each other, but it was good spending more time with Gail and the
children.  Marcy was great about it too and I enjoyed being with her also.  </p>

align=left hspace=12><b>Marcy</b> took her vehicle and she packed all of us
into it and all our luggage.  She drove most of the time with Gail trading her
off for a break now and then.  I was willing to drive, but relieved that I
didn’t have to as I was nervous driving her vehicle with all the precious cargo. 
We stayed with Gail’s sisters and their families.  We stayed at Lisa &amp;
Ralph’s in St. George on the way down and back and we stayed with Debbie and
her husband and children the five days we were there.  We spent three full days
at Disneyland and we had two down days where we could rest and relax at
Debbie’s house and the children could have naps since we stayed late each time
we were at Disneyland.  Debbie and 2 of her children came one evening as they
have a season pass.  We took lunches with us and we bought the evening meals
there.  Gail took two strollers so Rachel and Matt didn’t have to walk all the
time.  That worked good so we could put our lunches, etc. in them too.  It was
so fun watching the expressions and excitement as the children rode the rides
with us or got their books signed by the princesses or cartoon characters –
Mickey Mouse, Miney Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, Goofy, etc and also got pictures
with them and with the Cars – Lightning McQueen, Mateur, etc. I enjoyed most of
the rides, but there were a couple I wouldn’t go on again as they were too hard
on my back &amp; neck and they were too frightening for me, for the children
too.  The children were really good most of the time and it was a lot of fun. 
Gail had bought me a Disney T shirt for Mother’s Day as she wanted us all to
match when we wore them there one day.  That was fun too.  Marcy is a wonderful
person and Gail is a special daughter-in-law and great to be with.  She is
usually always happy and bubbly and excited about life, which makes it great
for all of us.  I was worried about staying with Gail’s sister’s and families
as I am not one of the family, but they were all good to me and said they were
glad to have me. </p>

decided we needed to use them more this summer and, so we had to plan way ahead
to get reservations at the places we wanted to go.  I went over the calendar,
selecting times we could be away and then I showed Ken and talked it over with
him.  I then made reservations at <b>Hyrum Reservoir for five days</b>, Monday
through Friday in June.  I made reservations at Fish Lake for a week in July
and I made reservations for a <b>Monday through Saturday at Payson Lake for
August</b>.  I also talked to Ken about us going to <b>BYU Education Week</b>

align=left hspace=12>however, the government was furloughing the government
employees and he works for the government as a guard at Dugway Proving Grounds,
so he wasn’t able to go and Sandi had already booked a vacation with one of her
friends to Glazier National Park and Canada for two weeks, so she couldn’t go
either.  None of the others could go, so Ken and I still had a great time
fishing and camping together.  There was a good family camped by us which we
got to know and enjoyed visiting with them.  They were kind to us by taking us
in their truck down to our boat.  Ken and I love to be alone together anyway. 
We have fun whatever we are doing, especially vacationing.  We have gone
fishing at Strawberry Reservoir together also and staying overnight in the
cabin there.  That was fun too.  Ken and Nick have gone together fishing both
at Strawberry Reservoir and East Canyon Reservoir</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>In August of 2013</b>, Ken and I
reserved a campsite for a <b>week at Payson Lake</b>.  it ended up that only
Jeff, Gail and the children were going to be with us for Friday night and
Saturday and they were going to use our tent and share our campground, but
Sherrie, Bob’s daughter had passed away from a liver disease caused by drinking
alcohol, so we needed to leave on Friday as the funeral was early Saturday
morning.  When Jeff found out about it, they decided they wanted to go to the
funeral so wouldn’t be coming up.  We asked Scott if Kylan could come with us
as he loves to camp and fish.  Kylan was excited, so we had fun playing games
together in the evenings and he and Grandpa went fishing several times. 
Sometimes they caught some fish and sometimes they didn’t.  Sometimes I would
stay and read in the camper and other times I would take my camp chair and book
and watch them.  Kylan loved the meals and snacks we had.  He’s a cute boy and
we enjoyed having him with us.  Mike couldn’t come up, but Becky brought Maddi
&amp; Jessie and Jessie’s friend and spent part of one day with us and had
supper with us. </p>

align=left hspace=12>            <b>Sherrie, Bob’s daughter, (woman on the
left), passed away</b> that week from liver disease caused by alcoholism.  Bob
didn’t know that her and her husband drank a lot, so that was upsetting to him,
and to lose his daughter just a couple of years after losing his wife was
really hard on him.  They were having the funeral on Saturday, so we called
Scott to see if they wanted to come up and stay overnight both Friday and
Saturday nights.  We had reserved it for Saturday night as Jeff, Gail and the
children were planning to come up after work on Friday night and stay in our
tent in our camp site with us. Ken and I planned to leave Saturday night, so we
could be home to go to church on Sunday.  Scott &amp; Mishelle had wanted to
come up and bring their trailer before, but there were no campsites left, so
they were excited to come up since they moved this summer and were so busy
getting settled in and working on the yard that they hadn’t been able to go
camping.  Jeff decided if we were coming home, they wouldn’t go to Payson Lake,
they would come to the funeral also.  Ken and I were excited that all of our
children except Shellie came to <b>Sherrie’s funeral</b>, mainly to support
Bob.  They all went to the cemetery afterwards where Ken dedicated the grave
and they came back to the church and ate the luncheon that the Relief Society
had prepared for all the family.  We visited and enjoyed being together, even
though it was a sad time, especially for Sherrie’s husband, Eric, and her son,
Cole, and of course, Bob. (This picture is of Bob and his children at Carroll’s
funeral.  Sherry died a few months later.  She was a heavy drinker and Bob
didn’t even know it until the doctor told him at the hospital when she passed
away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>We were able to go to Zion’s
National Park.  Jeff and Gail wanted to go to Zion’s Canyon again </b><img

align=left hspace=12><b>this year in October,</b> so I called all the family to
see if any of the rest of them could go with us and Scott and Sandi wanted to
go.  It turns out that Scott didn’t get his reservation made and now he doesn’t
have the vacation time to go anyway.  David said he would be graduating from
Medical School and getting a job, so didn’t know if they would be able to get
away at that time and thought they probably would not be able to.  Shellie said
they couldn’t come as it is a lot of hiking and Roy can’t do that with his bad
hip.  Sandi &amp; Nick were planning to go for a week, but Shellie invited her
and Nick to go with them to San Diego in September for a week as Shellie &amp;
Roy were able to get a condo with two rooms and, so they went.  Now Sandi doesn’t
have enough vacation for the entire week at Zion’s, but they are coming for the
Wednesday through Saturday.  Mike &amp; his family were coming too as it is
their fall break, however, theirs was the week before Davis School District, so
Ken and I decided Ken would take the time off, so we could make reservations to
be with them on the 10<sup>th</sup> &amp; 11<sup>th</sup> and then the others
would come for Friday &amp; Saturday and then Mike &amp; family would go home
and the others would be with us for the next week.  Mike, however, found out
later that he had to be to a conference in Chicago, so they wouldn’t be able to
come to Zion’s.  That makes it bad because Ken had already scheduled to take
off work and he wouldn’t have had to and we would have just gone up on Monday
with Jeff &amp; Gail, rather than the previous Thursday.  Oh well, we have to
be flexible with family and not get upset when things don’t turn out as
planned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This all worked out, but we were afraid it
wouldn’t as the government had shut down and they closed down all the national
parks.  We were hoping they would open the parks, but they didn’t, so finally
our Utah governor told the president that Utah would pay to open the Utah
National Parks as the state was losing so much money from tourists not being
able to come.  There are so many businesses that were losing money and might
even lose their business as the national parks brought them in so many tourists
who spend money in their shops, restaurants, etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and I had decided we would at
least go to Salt Lake, stay in a motel or hotel and eat out, go on the trolley,
go to the temple, etc, since we had the vacation time.  On Thursday we invited <b>Grinn
&amp; Kathleen Clark</b> and <b>Ken and</b> <b>Vivian Shaw </b>to go to the
Bountiful Temple and then out to eat with us.  The Clarks served in the Philippines
with us and we love them, and the Shaws served in our California mission with
us.  Both couples live in Bountiful.  We love them too.  After eating, Ken and
I went to our hotel to spend the night.  David called the next morning, on our
cell phones, and told us that the Utah National Parks were opening today.  We
were excited and called to make sure our reservations were still open.  We
didn’t hear back until we were almost there.  We left the hotel and drove back
to pack up and leave for Zion’s.  We were thrilled that we got to go for at
least most of our vacation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             We again went in October for the school’s fall
break as Ben and Rachel were both in school.   Jeff, Gail &amp; family &amp;
family came down on Monday and stayed the week.  Their friends, Stewart and
Nisha came down for the last couple of days too and they had reserved places
for them and Jeff &amp; Gail to go repelling.  Ken and I tended Jeff &amp;
Gail’s children while they went.  Sandi and her family went on the shuttle bus
and trails that day.  Jeff had told Nolan that he should come down with Stewart
and Nisha.  Nolan and his family were coming to St. George and staying at a
condo for that weekend, so at the last minute, he did come.  He told me that
when Jeff said that I would love to have him there, he wanted to come.  Nolan
is a cute nephew and we have always had a close relationship.  I took Jeff’s
children over to the sand area to play and Nolan came with us.  He was cute
with the children.  Ben brought his insect net and container and wanted to
catch lizards.  He and his dad had caught some the day before, but his dad had
him let them go that night.  I promised him we would catch some, so Nolan
played with Rachel &amp; Matt in the sand while I took Ben to catch lizards. 
We did catch some, but he wanted to catch more so later Nolan went with him. 
Nolan’s leg is really bad, so it was hard for him to walk very far.  We sat
&amp; visited some.  He slept in the camper with us on Thursday night.  
Stewart and Nisha slept in our tent as Jeff &amp; Gail brought Gail’s mother’s
big tent for them to sleep in.  They didn’t bring food, only snacks so ate
meals with us.  We were a little surprised that they didn’t offer to pay
anything on the food, nor did they really thank us.  Oh well, they’re nice
people and good friends of Jeff &amp; Gail’s.  We brought Sandi’s table over
and made a big family table with the two tables, so everyone could eat together
and that was fun.  We brought our big shad tent and put it up over the tables
so in case it rained.  It was colder than we expected this year.  We also all
crowded into our tiny table area in our camper and played games.  Ken wasn’t
feeling good the one night so went to bed.  There was Sandi, Chelci, Nathan
(who watched), Jeff, Gail, Stewart, Nisha, Nolan and I playing.  It was crazy,
but we had fun.  </p>

align=left hspace=12><b>We have always had Family Christmas Parties.</b>  At
first we would have them at my parent’s home in Clearfield and then for several
years we had them at Georgia &amp; Rick’s home in Fruit Heights as they have a
large home.  All our extended family came.  We always had a dinner with all of
us bringing food and then we would have a program.  A nativity with the younger
children playing the parts was always a mandatory part of the program and then
other family members would share their talents.  Rick would have all those who
had gone on foreign missions and learned a foreign language stand with him and
sing “Silent Night” in their own language.  That was fun.  Mom always loved the
Christmas parties.  After she passed away in 1999, we still had them at Georgia
&amp; Rick’s home until finally she told us that our families were getting so
large, that it was hard having them at her home and she felt we should separate
and each have our own family Christmas parties.  Some of the younger generations
were disappointed, but it was for the best.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We started
having our Kenneth Browning Family Christmas parties</span></b> at our home in
Layton and then decided it would be better to hold them at our children’s
homes, as they had larger homes.  David &amp; Sandi held the first ones in
their homes.  Then Jeff &amp; Gail bought a larger home in Layton and we had
them at their home too.  Scott &amp; Mishelle have a large home now too (2014) <u>but
now our family is so large – 47 of us, that our children rotate the

align=left hspace=12>This is an example of one of our Christmas parties.  <b>We
went to David &amp; Shauna’s</b> for our family Christmas party.  Every couple
had an assignment this time.  David &amp; Shauna hosted the gathering at their
home.  Becky planned the dinner menu and assigned it out.  Mishelle &amp; Scott
were over the program and since Chelci is on total bed rest, she couldn’t sing
for us and our grandson, David, couldn’t get off work, so he couldn’t play for
us, but Kylan brought his electric piano and played a fantastic piece for us,
he doesn’t read music, but listens to it and learns it.  He is very talented,
it was a hard piece, but he didn’t make any mistakes.  Kylan had taught Kaden a
small piece and it was cute to watch him play it.  Emily played a couple of
pieces for us on her violin and it was beautiful.  She is talented also.  Sandi
was over the games and we had a “game” exchange activity and we also played the
“Right &amp; Left” game with candy bars.  Jeff was over getting &amp; wrapping
the Santa gifts for the children.   We put them in our Santa bag and pretended
that Santa left it on the doorstep.  Grandma &amp; Grandpa Browning gave the
gifts out.  It was a very enjoyable evening and all seemed to have a good
time.  it was late when we got home and I was tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Another time Jeff &amp; Gail hosted the Family Christmas
party at their home in Layton</b>.  Everyone brought food and we had a
delicious Christmas dinner.  We had a program with Kylan playing the piano,
Chelci singing, Emily playing her violin and younger children singing and
giving poems.  We played “Mini-to-Winit” games in their family room and Grandma
led the children in the game “Mr. Wright and Mrs. Wright” with candy bars
passing to the right or to the left as Grandma reads the story.  Santa also
came and left his Christmas bag on the porch, so Grandpa &amp; Grandma
distributed them to the children.  Sandi lead the adults in a fun Christmas
gift exchange game.  We all had a wonderful time.  We have a close family and
love to be together.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>Sandi is still working at Grantsville High as their
registrar. The beginning and ending of each year are the hardest and busiest
times for her.  She hopes to retire in about four years.  She is married to
Nick Drake and they have a beautiful home in Tooele.  It is up on Bench View
Drive, so she has a beautiful view from their home.  Sandi has two daughters
and they are both married. <b> JaNae</b> has three children – <b>Dawson,
Kennedy and Emma</b> and <b>Chelci</b> has two children – <b>Nathan &amp;
Addison Mae “Addie”.</b>  We are suspecting that <b>JaNae and her husband, Brad</b>,
are on drugs and we worry about their three children.  It has been especially
hard on Sandi as she loves those grandchildren so much.  Because of this, Sandi
investigated more and is certain they are on drugs so called the child
protective services to see if she could get custody of the children.  (Anyway,
that’s what I understand).  When JaNae found out, she was furious and called
her mom and called her every bad thing she could think of and told her what a
terrible mother she was and told her that she was not allowed to see these
grandchildren again.  You can imagine what that did to Sandi, especially when
she has been such a wonderful mother to her daughters.  She has done everything
for them.  She even gave JaNae &amp; Brad $20,000 to put down on their new home
in Stockton, Tooele County.  Sandi was visiting Shellie at the time, and that
surely spoiled her vacation.  We are heartsick about it too.  JaNae denies that
her &amp; Brad are on drugs, and to be able to stay close to JaNae, I don’t say
much to the contrary, but if she starts slamming her mother, I come to Sandi’s
defense.  <b>Chelci</b> has a beautiful voice and sings at the County Fair and
other community &amp; ward meetings or activities. .  Ken &amp; I love to go
out and watch her sing whenever we know about it and can go.  Chelci is in a
band and is the lead singer and plays a guitar.  They practice every Friday
night.  Her and Steve are married in the temple and are active in the church
and are good parents.    Sandi is always so thoughtful and kind to us, her
family, neighbors, friends, etc.  Sandi is active in the church.  She was a
counselor in Young Women’s, and now is the chorister in primary.  Nick
occasionally comes to Sacrament Meeting with her, but doesn’t stay for the
other meetings.  He really isn’t interested in becoming active.  We are
somewhat disappointed in him as he doesn’t do much to help Sandi with the home
or yard.  He just mainly wants to watch sports on TV.  Ken &amp; I have enjoyed
going fishing with him &amp; Sandi, especially at Fish Lake, and we have
enjoyed going to Country Creek Lodge in the mountains above Soda Springs, Idaho
to go snowmobiling on those beautiful hills.  We stay a night or two, usually
for Ken’s birthday and Sherrie fixed wonderful meals for us and we love playing
games at night.  Nick does like to play games, so we get together occasionally
for dinner and then play games afterward.  Nick &amp; Ken stand Sandi &amp; I. 
Marbles is one of our favorite games we play with them. </p>

align=left hspace=12><span style='color:#222222'>SHELLIE:  I am here in Arizona
with Shellie, Roy and their family.&nbsp; I flew down on Friday and will be
going home on this coming Friday, the 20th.&nbsp; My grandson, <b>Quint</b>,
their 2nd oldest, was going into the military and since I hadn't seen him for
quite a while as we hadn't been down for a year, and when Shellie came up,
Quint and Kevis didn't come, the last couple of times, as they had jobs
here.&nbsp; Shellie said this would be a great time for me to come.&nbsp; Ken
couldn't come because he is driving a school bus route so he told me to fly
down.&nbsp; I had only planned to be here a week, but Shellie &amp; Roy asked
if I could stay an extra week so that they could go on a week vacation to San
Diego (where they were planning to take Quint) as their youngest son, Jase, has
ADD and is on a special health diet, even stricter than the one Ken and I are
on, so they wanted me to be here with the boys so Jase could get the food he
needs.&nbsp; It turned out that Quint didn't go into the military.&nbsp; He had
a leg injury from skiing and as he met with the Marines to work out before
going into basic training, it started bothering him.&nbsp; Since the military
has been cut&nbsp;back so much, they really didn't need him, and didn't want
him if he couldn't do what he would need to do in the Marines, so they let him
out.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Shellie told me, I thought maybe I should try to change my
flight to our Christmas vacation so Ken could come with me, but it cost way too
much to change it, so I came anyway, and I'm glad I did.&nbsp; <b>Shellie &amp;
Roy left on Saturday and met up with Sandi &amp; Nick in San Diego</b>.&nbsp;
I'm glad the two sisters and their husbands could have this time
together.&nbsp; They were able to get a condo with two bedrooms.&nbsp; I didn't
spend a lot of time with my grandsons the first week, as I knew I would be able
to this week and the boys were gone to school, work and Karate.&nbsp; I did
more with <b>Jase, </b>however.&nbsp; This week I have had great conversations
with Quint.&nbsp; He&nbsp;is a special grandson.&nbsp; He didn't stay on his
mission and&nbsp;told the mission president that he didn't have a testimony,
but he was in Washington DC and had a Tongan&nbsp;companion as his trainer and
that didn't work well.&nbsp; I think he does have a testimony.&nbsp; He goes to
the Young Adult ward each Sunday, and even last Sunday, when his parents were
gone, and he had to work from 4 am until 10 am at Target unloading trucks, he
still came home and got ready and went to church.&nbsp; I was surprised, but
thrilled.&nbsp; We had Family Home Evening Monday night and he had a great
attitude and all three of the boys participated and we had a great
evening.&nbsp; I gave a lesson on the Holy Ghost and gave some experiences; we
sang songs, prayed, played Pictionary with using scriptures stories and had
refreshments.&nbsp; Mine and Jase's was a healthy snack.&nbsp; I am enjoying
this time with these special grandsons.&nbsp; They&nbsp;say I am spoiling them,
but I told them that I don't get the opportunity to do that very often, and
besides that's what grandmothers like to do.</span></p>

style='color:#222222'>&nbsp;           I have enjoyed this time with Shellie,
Roy &amp; the boys as I don't get to see them enough, however, Shellie came up
three times this past year and that was great!&nbsp; Roy came up with her &amp;
Jase once.&nbsp; She mainly came up the first time to get Jase and herself into
Nancy, our nutritionist, to see if&nbsp;Nancy could help Jase.&nbsp; Nancy told
her to read the &quot;Gut and Psychology Syndrome&quot; Natural treatment for
Dyspraxia, Autism, ADD, Dyslexia, A.D.H.D., Depression, Schizophrenia, etc. by
Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride MD, MMedSci(neurology), MMedSci(nutrition).&nbsp;
Shellie bought it and read it and realized she needed to follow this diet even
though it is so hard, but she could tell from reading the book, that this would
help Jase.&nbsp; Nancy tested Jase, Shellie &amp; Sandi and found they are all
allergic to Gluten, Dairy and Sugar and that processed foods are so bad for us,
so not to use any.&nbsp; Sandi is on our diet, but Shellie opted to do the GAPS
diet.&nbsp; Shellie is great at fixing all this food from scratch and doing
exactly what the book says to do.&nbsp; I thought I would be going to the
Health Store to buy the bread and other items I need for my diet, but instead I
am eating the foods she is fixing for herself and Jase.&nbsp; It's different,
but some is pretty good.&nbsp; The book says if they eat this way for two years,
they will be over allergies and&nbsp;their guts will be healed.&nbsp;&nbsp;They
will be able to add more foods in gradually.&nbsp; However, they will still eat
healthy and not eat junk food, pop, or much processed foods.&nbsp; With eating
this way, I am feeling good and I'm not hungry between meals like I used to be,
even though I don't eat a lot.&nbsp;They have been on this diet for 8 weeks and
Shellie has lost weight and looks great.&nbsp; Her skin is much better.&nbsp;
Nancy had commented that her skin was bad.&nbsp; She was allergic to wearing
any jewelry and now she isn't.&nbsp; The best thing is that Jase is doing so
well.&nbsp; He was very picky before and I worried that she wouldn't be able to
get him to eat healthy, but after explaining to him about what has happened to
people because of eating junk food and processed foods and how he will be much
healthier and happier if he eats this way for two years, he decided he wanted
to do it.&nbsp; He is great at it and he is doing much better with his
ADD.&nbsp; His teacher called Shellie and told her that where they used to have
a tutor for Jase to keep him on task and help him so he wouldn't fail the
tests, etc., now they don't have to and that his grades have improved
dramatically.&nbsp; The teacher said &quot;Whatever you are doing, keep it up
as it is working.&quot;&nbsp; We are all thrilled about that.&nbsp; One day at
home, I called the family and Jase answered and said <b>&quot;Grandma, I didn't
used to like the meals Mom fixed, but now I look forward to them.&nbsp; She
fixes good healthy food.&quot;</b></span></p>

</b>went into the Education Field and became a Resource teacher in Montana, but
Becky wanted more than two children and Mike knew that he would need to make
more money to support a larger family, so he and Becky decided that he should
go back to BYU and get his Master’s Degree.  He is a smart guy so was able to
get into a fast, hard Master’s program which he would complete in one year
instead of two.  It was hard, but he did it.  They have had two more daughters,
Maddi and Jessie.  Jessie was born while we were on our mission to the
Philippines.  In fact, she was born about two weeks after we left.  Mike got a
job as an assistant principle at a junior high school.  Later he was a
principal at a new junior high which had about 3000 students.  That was hard. 
The next year they changed boundaries and the student population went down
considerably so this was a much easier year for Mike, besides he knew the staff
and teachers and it was his second year there.  The superintendency wanted him
to come to the district as one of their resource directors as he knew the law
so well.  He told them he would for one year, but then he wanted to go back to
a school.  He did, and the following year was given a assistant principalship
at another junior high school<b>.  He is now the principal of Orem High.  </b>It
is a beautiful school and he is a great principal.  He loves the students, yet
they know if they don’t obey the rules he can give out discipline too, so they
like and respect him.  He supports them in all their games and activities.  He
is really busy, and it is stressful too especially as the world is becoming
more wicked.  There have been shootings in schools, so Mike took training and
has a permit to carry a gun.  He says he would use it too if he had to, to
protect his students and teachers.  I worry about him because of the stress and
because he is a big guy, he could have a heart attack.  He had told me before
that he didn’t think he would live beyond 40 years old.  He will be 44 on the
28<sup>th</sup> of this month (April 2013.), so thank goodness, he has lived
beyond that.  I hope he can live to see his grandchildren<b>.  He and Becky’s
oldest child, David</b>, served a mission to Africa and just returned home in
February.  He is working two jobs now and plans to attend Utah State this
fall.  Their 2<sup>nd</sup> child, <b>Taylor “Paige</b>” is going to Utah State
University now and getting straight A’s.  She is a beautiful and smart young
woman, and works hard.  She is going into interior design and during her senior
year, she got a job in that field, but in the summer, she received another
great opportunity to work for a contractor during interior design for the homes
he was building.  He really likes the work Paige is doing, so he continues to
use her when she comes home for weekends and even while she is in college.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Paige met and dated a neat young man, Garrett,</b> who
served his mission in the Philippines. They were married in the Timpanous
Temple. Mike is a great husband, father and son.  Becky is a great wife, mother
and daughter-in-law.  We couldn’t ask for a better wife for Mike.  Becky just
started working as an aid at the elementary school.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> David</span></b> went
to Weber State University after returning from his mission to France &amp;
Belgium.  He knew he needed to get scholarships, so he studied hard.  He wanted
to go into the medical field to become a physician’s Assistant.  He got a part
time job working at a lab.  He enjoyed the work and it helped pay for his
college.  I was glad he was living here with us as he would come home and tell
us about his experiences and what he had learned.  He met Shauna Howard in one
of his classes and asked her out.  He dated her, and they were married in the
Salt Lake Temple in 1994. He got accepted to the PA Program at Pocatello
University in Idaho.  We went to visit them one time and saw squirrels
scurrying all around the campus as there were lots of trees &amp; grass on the
campus.  A friend told him about a position as a Pharmaceutical Representative
which would make him great money and was still in the medical field.  Even
though David was doing great in the program and the professors and those over
his program hated to see him leave, he did join the Pharmaceutical team and
they moved to Idaho Falls.  They bought a nice home and lived there where <b>Tyler
and Emily</b> were born.  David did make great money as he was their number 1
representative.  He won wonderful trips and was able to take Shauna with him. 
While Ken and I were on our mission to the Philippines, they were missing
family so David was able to get transferred here to Utah.  <b>They bought a
home in Enterprise, which is close to Morgan.</b>  David continued to be their
number 1 representative and made great money &amp; bonuses. Their third child, <b>Connor</b>,
was born while we were on our mission.  In 2011, David and Shauna made the
decision for David to apply to the University of Utah to become a PA.  He
didn’t know if he would be accepted as he had already been in the PA program in
Pocatello and dropped out and David said that they usually don’t accept people
who have been in the Pharmaceutical Industry, but he was accepted.  He will graduate
with honors this August.  He has loved learning in this field and has had the
high scores in his classes.  <b>Shauna </b>graduated as a nurse before their
children were born and worked until they moved to Idaho.  A great position at
McKay Dee Hospital opened up and Shauna applied for it and got it.  She had
wanted to wait to go back to work until Connor was in school, but this
opportunity was now.  She was able to work it out that <b>her mother and I
would each tend Connor one day a week</b> and she was able to put him in the
preschool at the hospital for the other days.  I enjoyed this time with little
Connor.  He was so cute, and we had great fun going to the park, playing
marbles, and many other games.  Parcheesi was his favorite. Sometimes David or
Shauna would drop him off here and sometimes I would go there.  Shauna insisted
on paying me, but that wasn’t necessary as I enjoyed my time with him.  David
is a great husband, father and son.  We love him, his beautiful wife and
special children.  David will make a great doctor as he has a great
personality, cares about people, studies hard, knows what he is doing, and
loves helping people. (It is 2017, and David is a great PA and has almost or
more patients than Dr. Harris does.  Everyone loves him because he loves people
and wants to help them, and because he is knowledgeable and keeps on top of
everything.)  <b>David invites Ken &amp; I to their home for Christmas Eve.</b> 
They have been doing this for several years and Ken and I look forward to going
there.   </p>

align=left hspace=12>would do anything for us and he does whenever he can.  All
we have to do is mention we are doing some project, or doing something which
could require some help, and he asks if we could use his help.  He never
complains if we ask for his help, and we ask for his help more than from the
others as he lives closer to us.  He never acts like it is a burden for him, he
always acts happy to be able to do it.  Scott is so selfless.  He sacrifices
his time and energy for his family, for us and others.  If he has neighbors,
family or friends who are moving, he is right there to help them.  He has a
beautiful wife, <b>Mishelle</b>.  She is a wonderful wife and mother, but <i><u>she
has terrible and often migraine headaches</u></i>.  Scott doesn’t have much
vacation time, but when Mishelle has one of these headaches, he takes the day
off to help her and be with the children.  I have told him to call me when this
happens, and sometimes he will, but many times he won’t as he doesn’t want to
bother me.  Mishelle is very talented with crafts and has made me several
beautiful items for our home and she makes me beautiful jewelry.  I haven’t
bought new jewelry for me for a long time as Sandi used to buy Jewelry from
JaNae, when JaNae was selling “Cookie Lee” jewelry and then Mishelle started
making jewelry for me.  Mishelle can fix about anything.  Scott isn’t a
handyman like his dad, but Mishelle is, and if she doesn’t know how, she either
asks Ken or looks it up on “UTube”.  Scott &amp; Mishelle are struggling with
their testimonies but take their family to church and Scott teaches Sunday
School and Mishelle serves in the Relief Society on the activities committee.  Scott
&amp; Mishelle have four special children – <b>Kylan,</b> who is thirteen, <b>Ashley</b>,
who is eleven and <b>the twins, Kaden &amp; Kaitlyn</b> who are five.  They are
a cute family. <b>It is 2017 now so Kylan is a senior,</b> has his driver’s
license, dates some, still loves RC airplanes and goes to the fling field most
Saturday mornings and flies his planes and drones (many of which he has made
himself).  He wants to become a pilot and I hope he can, and will be surprised
if he doesn’t.  <b>Ashley is a Sophomore</b> at Layton High.  She is, and
always has been, a “Straight A” student.  Friends are a problem this year
because the Jr. High School where she attended, branches out to several
different high schools, so depending on where her friends live, is where they
go to high school.  This has made it hard since most don’t go to Layton High, where
she goes.  She has a Hispanic friend, which Scott &amp; Mishelle are concerned
about.  I sure hope she can find good friends that will pull her up, not pull
her down.  Ashley is a good, sweet girl, but shy.  <b>The twins are 9 years old
and they are very active. </b> They are loud at times and it hurts Ken’s ears. 
They invite me to go to “Grandparent’s Day” at their school, and I enjoy that
time with them.  We watch them for Scott &amp; Mishelle at times.  They haven’t
been baptized as Scott has lost his testimony and doesn’t want them baptized. 
That sure makes Ken &amp; me feel bad, as they need to be taught the gospel at
home and at church, so they can gain a testimony which will help them find
peace and happiness in this life and in eternity.  I love them, as I do all our
grandchildren.</p>

align=left hspace=12><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>JEFF </span></b>&amp;
Gail had some problems, so they separated for a few months.  Jeff was the
controller at the plant in Clearfield.  He was able to transfer to the Ohio
plant.  He rented the upstairs apartment of a home there in Greenville.  It was
cute as it had a screened in room where Jeff could go and enjoy relaxing.  It
also had a wrap-around porch with a swing.  Jeff had gotten a black lab from a
lady he worked with at the Clearfield plant and took it with him.  He had a
small car, so dad helped him pack it.  If he hadn’t had the dog, it would have
been much less crowded, but we were glad he had it as we were worried about him
going off by himself.  Jeff &amp; Gail had two children, <b>Ben and Rachel</b>,
and Gail was expecting their third.  She didn’t know she was expecting this
baby when they decided to separate, but he (<b>Matthew “Matt) is our miracle
baby</b> as he brought the two of them back together.  They sold their home in
South Weber and Gail &amp; her children moved into her widowed mother’s home. 
During these seven months of separation, they realized they really loved each
other and they viewed marriage counseling classes on the internet and discussed
them when they talked on the phone.  They listed the things they would expect
of each other and decided they would make their marriage work.  We are proud of
them as they have a wonderful marriage now.  Jeff came home for a visit and
stayed with us for a few days.  He invited Gail and the children to come here,
and their cute little son, <b>Ben</b>, <b>wouldn’t let Jeff out of his sight</b>. 
Jeff was cute to play and wrestle with him, but if he walked into the other
room or went to the bathroom, Ben was right behind him.  He loved his dad so
much and kept saying “<b>My Dad, My Dad”.</b>  It just broke my heart, as at
that time we didn’t know if they would get back together.  When Jeff walked
Gail and the children out to the car for them to go back home, little Ben kept
saying “Come with us, dad, come with us.”  Gail told him that dad couldn’t come
home with them tonight and he started to cry.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I am so thankful that they were
able to work things out and get back together – for their sakes and for their
sweet children.  They bought a beautiful home in Layton up by highway 89.  It
is perfect for them as they live in a nice neighborhood, but the best thing is
that their back yard is part of the hollow.  The people, who owned it made a
tree house for their children, part-way down into the hollow and they build a
fire pit with log benches around it.  Further down, they put their trampoline. 
It was too hard for them to bring up, so they left it there for Jeff and Gail’s
family.  Jeff needs the outdoors to get away from the world and its stresses,
and this is great for him.  Their basement has a large family room and a large
bedroom with an attached bathroom, but the great part for Jeff, was that the
owner of the home had his office, a big room with patio doors leading out into
the covered patio, there in the basement.  The patio is covered because they
have a deck above it which is really nice, and Jeff loves that too, especially
as they have such a beautiful view of the hollow with its shrubs, trees, etc.,
and the mountains on the other side of highway 89.  I love to go there and sit
out on the deck and enjoy that beauty.  Jeff works part of the time from home,
so he loves his office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Gail </b>is such a great
daughter-in-law, she is so easy to talk with and she is a wonderful wife and
mother and the best part is that she does truly love our son.  She was a school
teacher when Jeff married her, she taught 2<sup>nd</sup> grade and she invited
me to programs her class put on.  Jeff is easy to love as he is so loveable,
kind, helpful and patient.  He gives me the best hugs of all our children.  </p>

align=left hspace=12><b>JaNae</b> was our first grandchild.  Jeff is almost two
years older than JaNae, so he was a “young uncle”<span style='color:black'> Sandi
signed up JaNae &amp; Chelci for Clogging (a form of dancing).  Later, Sandi
helped teach as she has always had a talent for dancing.  She later took over
the studio when the owner wanted to sell it.  JaNae was a “natural” at this
dancing, like her mom, and she had such a beautiful smile. JaNae and Chelci
were both cheerleaders in high school and both were in beauty pageants.   They
both are married to wonderful men.  <b>Brad</b> wasn’t a member, but later
joined the church and they became active.  Brad was working for Tooele Army
Depot and made good money, so they had a beautiful home in Stockton, Tooele
County, Utah.   Brad has lots of pain from wrecking his body on motorcycles
when he was a youth, so takes pain medication.  About the time that they were
working towards going to the temple, their garage was broken into and Brad
wrestled with the guy, and he was struck in the chest causing him damage to his
neck.  He was operated on, but has lots of problems.  He couldn’t get all the
pain medication he needed, so we are certain now that he went to “drugs”.  We
are sure that JaNae went on them with him.  She denied this for a long time,
but finally put herself in the hospital and when her mom and Chelci came to
visit her, she showed them her arms where she had used the needles and told
them they were using Meth.  When Sandi came to see JaNae, JaNae said “I didn’t
think you would come to see me”.  And Sandi said “I’m still your mom”.  Before
this time, Sandi was so concerned about her grandchildren – <b>Dawson, Kennedy
&amp; Emma</b>, that she has called the Child Protective Services.  When JaNae
found this out, she was so angry and chewed her mom out so bad, and told her
she could never see her grandchildren again.  This was ugly for several years
(I don’t remember how long ago this happened) Sandi was angry and bitter with
JaNae, but finally she said:  “JaNae isn’t the girl I raised, the drugs have
changed her”.  Thankfully they are back together speaking to each other, (11/2017)
and hopefully JaNae &amp; Brad are off the drugs.   They lost their home, and
later became homeless. An LDS Bishop got them into a homeless shelter and then
into a trailer home in Grantsville.  Brad finally got on disability and they
moved to Idaho Falls a couple of months ago and are renting a home.  <u>Dawson
is 14, Kennedy is 12 and Emma is 10</u>.  This family is much happier now.  I
was able to stay close to JaNae &amp; her family.  I invited them to our home
for dinner a few times and we played games and visited.  When they were in the
trailer in Grantsville, I told JaNae we would come out and bring supper.  She
didn’t want us to come to the trailer, so we met them at the Grantsville Park,
and had a good time and took pictures.  We talk on the telephone too.</span></p>

wonderful mother. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Sandi divorced Nick Drake as he was
lazy and didn’t help her with housework or yard work; she had to do it all. He
wouldn’t go working, biking, or any of the fun things she wanted to do.  All he
wanted to do was watch sports.  When she married him, he was a sports editor at
the Tooele Newspaper and he played sports and refereed them.  I guess she
should have known that his life revolved around sports. Shellie, Mike &amp;
Jeff tried to talk her out of marrying Nick.  Her siblings knew that he was
lazy and was all about sports.  They also knew that he didn’t have any money,
so they wondered why she was going to marry him.  She told me later that she
was tired of dating and it was hard for her to be alone and to go to family,
church and other activities alone.  She thought he would be good.  After she
married him, he didn’t even show affection to her.  On their wedding night, he
went to buy groceries for a stop &amp; shop kind of store that he had been
doing this for.  When they went on a few trips, she said he just complained and
made it miserable for her.  Finally, she decided she couldn’t take it any
longer and wanted to do fun things and enjoy her life while she was young.  She
had known Gary Martinson because they both were involved with the Classified
Association from their schools.  After her divorce and Gary was already
divorced, they started dating.  Since Sandi had felt that the men she had
married, in the past, changed after she married them, she didn’t want to marry
again, especially to have to go through hard divorces.  Nick’s was the hardest
as he wanted at least half of everything and was not nice about it.  Sandi and
Gary decided to just “live together”.  She had told me before she divorced
Nick, that she probably wouldn’t be active in the church if she divorced him. 
She said she hoped I would still love her, and of course, I said I certainly
would as she was my daughter and I loved her very much and I want her to be
happy.</p>

&amp; Deanna went to Spain on their mission.  It was a hard mission for them
and their mission president wasn’t like our President Brimhall.  He wasn’t very
kind and was very strict.  He didn’t allow them senior couple privileges, like
we had, and most senior couples have.  We worked hard and enjoyed serving, but
we did have some fun times with the other couple missionaries and sometimes
with he and Sister Brimhall.  Bryce and Deanna sold their home in Clearfield
and bought a home in Willard.  They like it there.  Deanna is the Relief
Society President.  She had a cancerous tumor in her liver.  They had to shrink
it by use of chemotherapy, as it was the size of a softball, so they couldn’t
operate with it that large.  They did shrink it and then operated and removed
it.  That was in 2015. She recovered, but in 2017 they found two more.  They
were small, so they operated again in September? to remove them.  This was a
harder operation on her, but she is doing much better now (December 2017). 
Deanna had two wonderful counselors who did the leg work for Deanna throughout
these two operations and recoveries and she would communicate with them by
phone or email, and when doing better, she had meetings at her home.  Deanna is
such a wonderful spiritual lady, and I love her.  Our children love her too. 
Actually, I don’t know anyone who doesn’t.  Bryce is the same “funny” guy.  You
never know what he is going to say.  He embarrasses Deanna at times and upsets
her at times, but she loves him, and they have a good marriage.  Bryce is so
good hearted, he would give you the shirt off his back if he thought you needed
it.  I sure love him.</span></p>

color:black'>I have always been thankful for Georgia.  It is great to have
brothers, but a girl needs a sister too.  Girls can talk about everything and
anything to each other.  Men don’t need to talk like women do.  Ken and I have
moved several times and especially when we lived in Arizona, Georgia and I
couldn’t do much together, but when we moved to Layton her and I would get
together at least monthly and either go to lunch together where we could spend
time visiting, or go walking and talking together.   Just before her and Rick
left for their mission to Austria, she rented a cabin at the Coleville Camper
World and her and I stayed there for a couple of days.  We ate and talked, and
walked and talked and had so much fun.  Rich is a wonderful guy.  He was a
fabulous seminary teacher for 30 years and all his students loved him.  He has
been a Bishop for a young singles ward and they all loved him.  Most everyone
loves him, but he has a mental problem – a foiba which has caused Georgia
untold misery over the years.  It was finally diagnosed and was explained to
her why he treats her this way.  He loves her, but with this sickness, they are
good to everyone else except their spouses.  They have been to marriage
counselors and he is doing much better now, but still not all the time.  When
Georgia &amp; Rick went on their mission to Austria, after both of them
retired, they were excited to go.  I received emails from Georgia saying that
her hands and head burned so bad that she could hardly stand it.  She went to
doctors and got medicine, etc., She wasn’t able to cook and since they were on
a CES Mission where they had Family Home Evenings, activities, breakfasts and
Dinners, one of her main responsibilities was to cook meals and refreshments. 
This she couldn’t do with her hands so bad.  Another couple missionary had to
take over for awhile and Rick had to cook.  Her hands finally got better, but
her hair was coming out in brushfuls, she said, and her head burned and hurt to
touch it.  She realized it was from stress and much of it came from Rick as he
was pressuring her to do more and be a better missionary.  She was trying her
best, but because of his problems, it was hard for her.  Things got better when
they got home and they are on another mission now (2017) This mission is in
their stake and a Salt Lake stake, so they live at home.  I hope things will be
better for both of them on this mission.  It seems to be.  Their daughter,
Kristy, has such terrible health problems and has had most of her life.  She
has also had two bad marriages, so Georgia &amp; Rick try to help her as much
as they can.</span></p>

of their seven who are still active in the church – Charity, Summer and Caleb. 
The others are good kids, but misled.  Deseree, their second child, has had two
bad marriages and is now living with a man and they just had a baby.  She was
so excited to be a mother.  I hear that her guy is a good man and treats her
good and that they plan to get married when Kim &amp; Jeanenne get home from

Actually Mysha and Johnny lost a baby a few years ago and haven’t been able to
have anymore since until this year.  They adopted a baby boy and then she gave
birth to a son. Summer gave birth to a baby boy this year also.  All these
grandsons were born while Kim &amp; Jeanenne are on their mission.  I know this
was hard for Jeanenne not to be there with her daughters and their new babies,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>We decided a few years ago to

The year that we were in charge of the Bushnell Reunion, we spend these
get-togethers planning and preparing for this reunion.  Bryce &amp; Deanna have
a time-share condo and they have invited us all to go up there and spend a
couple of days which was really fun.  We went to the temple together last year
and that was wonderful.  When one couple was on their mission, we would miss
them, but still held them every three months.  It was great when Terry and

align=left hspace=12>I haven’t been home much in the last 4 weeks as I went to
Shellie &amp; Roy’s home for Garrett’s graduation from ASU and Kevis’s high
school graduation.  I had a wonderful two weeks with them.  We did lots of fun
things.  They have a beautiful boat so we went to the lake one day and Garrett,
Nora &amp; Little Maggie went with us.  Both Garrett and his mom are fantastic
on the water.  Roy is recuperating from his hip replacement operation so he
didn’t do much, but he did get out on the wakeboard one time.  Jase, Nora &amp;
I got on the knee board (at different times).  My broken elbow was still
healing so I didn’t dare do much either, so they just pulled me around as I laid
on the knee board.  Nora got up on her knees.  She was really nervous at first
to even get out on it, but she had fun.  Shellie &amp; I played lots of games
at their home.  Nora played with us when she was with us.  Neither Roy, nor any
of their sons like to play board and card games.  We watched several movies in
their theater room and Shellie and I did lots of visiting as we went shopping,
doing laundry or just sitting and talking.  We went to the Mesa Temple and took
pictures on the grounds, after the session.  Shellie is a beautiful and special
daughter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken really missed me, I missed him too and wish
he could have gone, but they needed him to take his school bus route,
especially at the end of the year as they have lots of field trips and sports
events.  Ken picked me up at the airport at 6 pm on Memorial day and we were
happy to be together again.  We went out to dinner and enjoyed the evening
together.  </p>

align=left hspace=12>I was busy doing laundry and repacking to leave on vacation
on Friday morning with David, Shauna and their family.  Her parents went also. 
Shauna is great in planning vacations and making all the arrangements, so we
had a great time.  We stayed in a home on the beach at Half Moon Bay.  It was
beautiful and so was the ocean.  It was a little chilly as it didn’t get over
62 degrees, but it was so pretty.  We were down at the ocean several times,
then going on the paths in the park across from this home where the path
overlooked the ocean and we saw lots of seals resting on the rocks or on the
beach (depending on when the tide was in or out.).  In the mornings they have
“tide pools” where you can see all kinds of animal life.  We saw star fish,
squid, snails, crabs, sea urchins, etc.  We drove down to the pier one
afternoon and went fishing for large crab.  That was a fun experience too.  We
stayed two nights there and then drove to Yosemite where Shana had rented a
cute ranch house for us on this large ranch about 40 minutes from Yosemite
National Park.  We had all the comforts of home there too, plus it has
beautiful surroundings.  Tyler, Conner, David and Ken played horse shoes and
several of us got in the hot tub.  We also hiked a mile to their fun pond where
they had paddle boats and a canoe.  That was lots of fun.  The next day we went
to Yosemite and spent the day.  It was so beautiful and the weather was just
perfect.  We all enjoyed it so much.  The only thing that was hard was finding
parking spots for all three cars as we drove from place to place.  There were
so many tourists there.  The following morning we <img width=271 height=1

align=left hspace=12>drove 11 hours to St. George.  The children took turns
riding with their parents and both sets of grandparents.  Shauna’s parents have
bought a condo in St. George so we all stayed there for two nights.  We swam in
the pool, played games, visited and Shauna, Vickie (Shauna’s Mom) and I went
shopping<b>.  Emily plays the violin very well now and is in a small strings
orchestra and they performed prior to the play “The Wizard of Oz” at tuacon</b>. 
We also had tickets for dinner there and it was very good.  I was afraid it
would be really hot as it had been 108, but the sun had gone behind those
beautiful red mountains so it wasn’t so bad, in fact it was quite nice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I drove home the next day and stopped at
Mike and Becky’s to visit them.  They had us stay for dinner and while it was
cooking we played Rook.  David, Shauna and family stayed at St. George an extra
day, but I needed to get home to teach my primary class as the other teacher
had taught 3 weeks in a row for me.  We experienced cool weather at the ocean,
beautiful warm weather in the mountains at the ranch house and Yosemite, and
then hot weather in St. George.  Quite a vacation.  We are still tired from all
the traveling (we traveled about 2,500 miles on this trip, but it was sure fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We needed to work in our garden and yard this
morning and I’ve been doing lots of laundry, so we will rest a little more
tomorrow.  We leave on the 20<sup>th</sup> to go out to Sandi’s to spend the
night as we will be leaving early the next morning to go to Lake Tahoe.  I
think I have said that Sandi had a couple of time shares there this year and
has invited Shellie and all her family and Ken and I to go with them.  Chelci,
Steve and their family are going too.  Sandi &amp; JaNae are having problems
again and not speaking much with each other, so they are not going.  Sandi
wanted to take JaNae’s children, but JaNae won’t let her.  I feel bad for both
of them and the children and hope they can forgive each other and have love for
each other again.  JaNae is a sweet girl, but too much like her dad, I’m
afraid.  Ken and I were able to go watch Kennedy, JaNae’s daughter clog in
competition at Lagoon about five weeks ago.  JaNae acted excited that we were
there, and so did Kennedy.  JaNae teaches clogging, like her mom used to do,
and she is really good at it.  I had called to see how Brad, her husband was
doing as he had neck surgery, and she told me about this competition.  They are
really struggling – financially, emotionally and Brad is suffering with health
problems.  I worry about them and their three children.</p>

Jase,Garrett, Nora &amp; Maggie and Ken &amp; I stayed in the one up in the
mountains.  Both places were great and so different.  We took turns fixing the
meals and when we were with Sandi’s group, we had delicious meals that Sandi
&amp; Chelci prepared and afterwards we would go swimming in the pool or play
ping pong and other games.  Ken &amp; Nick played Chess with big chess pieces
by the pool.  We also went shopping and to the art festival downtown.  When
Shellie, Nora and I fixed meals, the others came up to our place. There wasn’t
as much to do where we were, but the view and scenery were spectacular.  The
accommodations were great at both places.  We went on outings to the beach at
the lake one day, another day we went sightseeing and hiked some.  We saw
beautiful waterfalls; we walked down to a mansion and went through it.  We did
lots of fun things and had a great time.  However, Nick &amp; Sandi were having
problems and while walking with Sandi, she told me that she hoped I wouldn’t
hate her, but that she was going to divorce Nick as she couldn’t take it any
longer.  She said he didn’t want to do anything fun, all he wanted to do was
watch sports.  He didn’t help her with the yard or housework, he didn’t show
her affection and she said she had about 20 more good years and she wanted to
have fun and do things.  I told her that I certainly wouldn’t hate her, that
she was my daughter and I loved her very much and I wanted her to be happy.</p>

later she called to tell me that she had just blown a tire on the trailer.  She
was on the Legacy Highway by Bountiful.   A young man stopped and helped her. 
I had Shellie and Mae drive to help her but the young man drove her to
Bountiful where she bought new tires for the trailer.  Mae and Shellie got the
stove and Dutch and brought it back to me.  I had all the chicken browned with
part of it in the kitchen oven as I only the two ovens Dutch ovens.  They got
back just as I was starting to load the vegetables in with the chicken.  I was
sure busy without having Mae or anyone else to help me.  As it was they got
back just in time and I was able to get the three ovens going.  It turned out
to be a very good meal.  Mike and Becky didn’t come but Becky brought Maddi and
Jessie and met Jeff in Salt Lake and he brought them on.  Mike is still sick
but hopes to join us tomorrow.  It was interesting getting everyone’s campers
set up, as well as cleaning up the Dutch ovens and help set up a screen and
outdoor projector so that we could watch a movie tonight.  I think everything
worked out ok but it was after mid-night before we got to bed very tired.</p>

they were very good.  The children sure enjoyed the swimming pool.  Every one
enjoyed visiting, playing games of all kinds from table games to volleyball. 
Gail and Shellie bought sandwiches from Wall Mart.  Mae had thought that
everyone would enjoy going water skiing at one of the lakes or going to a water
park but they all wanted to continue visit and playing games.  The little ones
played constantly in the pool plus we had water balloons and water guns so they
were having fun all day.  Scott and Mishelle provided the evening meal of
spaghetti with homemade rolls.  Having the portable toilet was a help plus we
went through lots of water and cups but it was a great day.  David and Sierra
came for a while this afternoon and both seemed to enjoy the activities.  Some

active.  We only attended Sacrament meeting but it was sure special.  There
were a lot of visitors today as the Searl boy is leaving on a mission on
Tuesday and Jake Steadman just returned last Tuesday.  Both of them gave very
good talks.  Mike and Becky haven’t been here as Mike has been sick.  We are
glad that Mattie and Jessie have been able to be with us.  We played a lot of
table games again this afternoon.  Scott and Michelle prepared South West
Chicken for lunch and that was sure good.  This evening we just had left over’s
and hot dogs for some of the children.  Mike and Becky did come this afternoon
although Mike is some better he still isn’t up to par.  It has again been a
very enjoyable today.  We have had all our children, and many of our grand

some of their things out of the trailer.   We were sure tired when we went to
bed, but we did watch the series of WAR.  I wasn’t very impressed with the
show.  It was mid-night when we went to sleep.</p>

align=left hspace=12>I got this idea from Sister Marjory Hinckley’s book of her
life.  She had Grandchildren’s Christmas parties and I liked that idea.  I knew
the cousins would have fun together and it would make memories for all of us. 
The first time I had them, we lived in Clinton.  It was 2007 and I invited all
our grandchildren (except Shellie’s children who live in Arizona), and also
some great grandchildren.  JaNae children and even Brad’s son, Jaden, came.  It
was fun and some of the moms stayed to help me.  We played games, had a fish
pond and treasure hunt and we had pizza, pop, cupcakes (that we decorated) and
ice cream.  (I still do this with the younger Grandchildren.)   I have had them
every year since, except for the year 2010 when we were on our mission to
California.  Mike told me that Maddi had said to him “Isn’t Grandma going to
have our Grandchildren’s Christmas party this year?”  Mike told her that we
were on our mission to California and so we were not here to be able to have
it.  She was disappointed as were the other grandchildren.  The first few years
I had all the grandchildren together.  I didn’t have the great grandchildren
anymore as that was too much and Sandi said she would have one for her grandchildren. 
The last few years, I decided that there was such an age difference between the
older grandchildren and the younger ones, that I would split them.  At first I
held them on the same day, the younger ones from 10 am to 12:30 pm and the
older ones from 12:30 pm to 4 pm.  The last three or four years I have had the
younger ones on a different day than the older ones.  I did different things
with the older ones.  One year, I had us go to an Assisted Living Center in
Clinton where Kylan played the piano for the people there, and Emily played her
violin.  Afterwards, we sang Christmas carols to them.  That was a neat
experience.  We came back to our home, ate dinner and played games.  In 2015,
we ate dinner and afterwards we went caroling to our neighbors.  I had made
goodies to take around to the neighbors, so we all went to these elderly
neighbors where we sang Christmas carols to them and gave them our treats. 
Even though Tyler is 17 and they are all in their teens, they were all good
sports and sang and were cute with our little widow neighbors.  We came back
and played games.  Most years we just ate and then played all kinds of games –
minit to winit games, white elephant gift game, Pictionary, Catch Phase, etc. 
One year I gave them gift wrap, ribbon, tape, scissors, bows, etc and had the
boys compete again the girls decorating one of each of them.  They had a good
time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>HOME IN MONTE VISTA MOBILE
HOME PARK IN ROY, UTAH.  NOVEMBER 2014</span></b></p>

align=left hspace=12><b>We have moved again, we hope this will be our last
one.  We have bought a double wide mobile home in the Monte Vista Mobile Home
Park in Roy, Utah</b>, so not so far away.  Our address is 3800 S 1900 W #283
in Roy.  Ken’s brother, Bob, who lived upstairs in the Clinton home, has gone
to an assisted living center in Layton and since they had their home on a
reverse mortgage, that meant we needed to move also.  We feel the Lord has
blessed us to find this nice home in a nice community.  We loved our home in
Clinton, our wonderful neighbors and our great ward, but since we are getting
older, the big yard and garden was hard to keep up with, so I think this is a
good move.  We have a small, but beautiful yard here with trees, shrubs and
flowers.  We have a large covered deck, which I will enjoy relaxing on in good
weather.  We are still getting settled, but every day is an improvement.  Wow!
We had to much “stuff” and with downsizing, it has been a challenge to decide
what we need to keep and what we need to get rid of.  Ken is working on our
shed to insulate it and put the shelves back in plus more shelves, so I will be
glad what that is done and we can get the stuff on the back deck put in it. 
I’m sure our neighbors will be glad too.  We have great neighbors and a
wonderful ward and community.  Monte Vista Mobile Home Park is one ward, so it
is interesting – no primary, young women’s, young men’s or Elder’s Quorum.  It
is just high priests and relief society because most are retired or older
single people and there are lots of widows.  They are wonderful people.  We
went to church here on Sunday for the first time and the lady I sat by in
Relief Society invited me to come to the Daughter’s of the Utah Pioneer’s
Christmas Party, which was the next day.  I went and met more friends and had a
wonderful time.  I’m sure we will love it here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>For an update on our family</b>,
<b>our granddaughter, Chelci, Sandi’s daughter, gave birth to identical twin
sons on Ken’s birthday – February 27<sup>th</sup></b><u>.</u>  They are
crawling now and so cute.  Chelci &amp; Steve invited us to their beautiful
home in Grantsville on Thanksgiving and we surely enjoyed being there with
Sandi and this cute family.  Jacob &amp; Luke joined Nathan and Addie as
siblings.  The dinner was delicious, but I got out of doing dishes as Nathan
&amp; Addie wanted me to play “Hide &amp; Seek” with them, and that was fun. 
Sandi has a beautiful home in Tooele and works at Grantsville High.  JaNae
&amp; Brad live in Stockton and have 3 special children.  JaNae teaches
clogging and is really talented.  It was fun to watch her teach her oldest
daughter, along with the rest of the class, when we went out to visit them last
month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Our grandson, David, (Mike &amp; Becky’s son)
married a cute girl, Sierra, in August</b>.  They are living in Logan where
David is going to Utah State University, and Sierra hopes to go in the spring,
but we will see as they are expecting their first child.  Mike and Becky are
excited to be grandparents.  That will make 9 great grandchildren for Ken and
I.  Mike and Becky’s daughter, Paige and husband, Garrett, also live in Logan
where Paige is in her junior year of the “Interior Design” program.  She is a
talented young woman.  Maddi is a teenager now and a cute out-going girl. 
Jessie is 12 and in her last year of Elementary School.  We are going to her
choir concert on Friday.  Mike is the principal at Orem High and Becky works at
the elementary school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Shellie &amp; Roy also just moved</b>.  They
moved from Queen Creek, AZ to Chandler, Arizona, so not so far away either. 
They are in a mess too as they are remodeling this home.  They take a breather
to relax in their backyard as they live on a small lake.  There are several
lakes in their community.  Their oldest son, Garrett, is in a dental program,
so with school, work, church and his cute wife and little daughter, he keeps
really busy.  Shellie &amp; Roy love being grandparents, and Quint, Kevis &amp;
Jase love their little niece too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>David &amp; Shauna invited the family to
their beautiful home in Enterprise (near Morgan, Utah</b>) on Saturday, after
Thanksgiving, where we ate, played games and visited.  David is enjoying working
as a PA in Dermatology.  He and Dr. Harris keep really busy.  Shauna is in the
medical field too where she works part-time, from home, for McKay/Dee
Hospital.  Tyler plays basketball for Morgan High and loves it.  Connor plays
basketball too, but likes soccer and baseball better.  Emily is really talented
on the violin, and we love to hear her play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Scott and Mishelle moved to a
beautiful home in West Layton last year</b>.  Mishelle is very talented in many
things and one of them is landscaping, so now they have a beautiful yard.  She
was  big help to Ken &amp; I in getting our new yard here in Roy cleaned up and
ready for winter.  Scott is a computer programmer and works for a company that
does custom programming for Hill Air Force Base.  Kylan is really talented both
on the piano and with airplanes.  He flies RC planes with adults at the flying
field, not far from his home.  Ashley loves creating things on “Mind Craft” and
other sites on the computer and loves being with her cousins, Mike &amp;
Becky’s daughters, Maddi &amp; Jessie.  The twins, Kaden &amp; Kaitlyn, keep
Mishelle really busy, but she gets a breather when they are in kindergarten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Jeff &amp; Gail have a beautiful home in
Layton, close to Hyw 89</b>.  Jeff loves the mountains so he loves to sit on
his back deck and look at the, or take his oldest son, Ben, hiking up them. 
Jeff is a controller (in the accounting field) for three plants with his
company.  Gail keeps busy with their three children – Ben, Rachel and Matt, and
keeping the household going smoothly.  We enjoyed our annual vacation to Zion’s
National Park with them this summer.  Also, Sandi, Chelci and family joined us
there.  We all had a great time, even though we had lots of rain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were able to put our home together enough and
the Christmas tree up, to have our annual older Grandchildren’s Christmas party
last Saturday.  One of the highlights of the party was doing service by going
to an assisted living center in Clinton and putting on a program.  We have some
talented grandchildren, so that was fun to see them perform, plus we all sand
Christmas carols.  We will have the younger grandchildren’s Christmas party on
the 27<sup>th</sup>.  We are also looking forward to our annual Family
Christmas Party, which will be on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.  Scott and Mishelle are
hosting it this year.  Ken and I love being together with our special family,
which total 46 at the present time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>August 2015</b>     I want to record another tender mercy
from the Lord.  Irven &amp; Sandy called yesterday to see if Ken &amp; I could
go to Orem with them to hear Rand Paul speak.  Rand Paul is campaigning for the
Republican presidential nominee.  Rand is a good man and is a senator.  He has
worked hard to sponsor &amp; co-sponsor bills to lower our taxes, take power
from the federal government and give back to the states, help us keep our
religious freedom, etc.  His father, Ron Paul, ran four years ago and we were
so impressed with him too.  Ken can't go as he is doing some work for our
friends, Ron &amp; Diane Graf in Clinton, but I told them I would like to go. 
He was to speak at 10 am.  We decided we needed to leave at least by 8:30 am so
we could get a good seat.  I was over to their home by 8:10, but they were not
ready so it was 8:30 by the time we left.  Sandy drove their car and I was
glad.  When we arrived, we had to register and then we were ushered upstairs. 
There were no chairs anywhere, so we all had to stand.  We were there 35
minutes early.  It is hard for me to stand very long.  I wouldn't have come had
I known I would have to stand.  I didn't even wear my good shoes that David had
told me about, which the kids gave me money for Mother's Day, to buy them. 
They do help, but I hadn't worn them.  There were two big TV screens with the
previous debate showing.  We couldn't hear as it was so noisy in there.  We
were all excited when Rand Paul came.   I had to strain to see him.  I had my
I-pad with me and it has a camera on it so I tried to take a picture of him.  I
couldn't get a good enough picture and the man behind me could see that, so
asked if I would like him to take it for me.  I did and he got a good one.  By
the time it was over, my back &amp; legs were hurting so bad that I could
hardly stand the pain.  As we went down stairs, I saw a very comfortable white
sofa chair there in the foyer.  I got there in time before anyone else sat in
it.  Wow, did it ever feel good.  They had announced that Rand would be in the
adjoining room where they would be selling his books and he would autograph
them and you could also get a picture taken with him.  Sandy wanted to do that,
but I didn't have the money to buy a book and I sure didn't feel like standing
in a long line to get one and have it signed.  Irven didn't either and there
was a comfortable stool for him to sit on also.  We sat there until Sandy came
back and then we went home.  **I felt that was a tender mercy from the Lord
that that comfortable large chair was there and no one was sitting in it. 
There were a few other chairs, but they were just regular chairs and people
were sitting on them.  I know Heavenly Father loves us and wants to help us and
he answers our prayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>2015</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This past year has gone by so quickly, but it
seems like they all do.  When we look at our grandchildren and great
grandchildren and see how they have grown, we wonder how this could happen so
fast.  It seems not that long ago that we were holding our children in our
arms, and then we were holding our grandchildren and now we are holding our
great grandchildren, but it’s great and we have had a wonderful life.  Ken and
I still have relatively good health, so we can enjoy being with our family and
friends.  With living here in the Monte Vista Mobile Home Park, and seeing many
with health problems due to age, disease and disabilities, we feel very blessed
to be able to help ourselves, our family and many of our neighbors and
friends.  We also have several couples our age, who we have become friends with
and enjoy being with them.  We have a great ward here with a special bishop,
who is truly a “Shepherd”.  We are thankful that we live fairly close to most
of our children and we sure enjoy being with them.  We love going to the
grandchildren’s ball games, recitals, and choir &amp; band concerts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This past year has brought us two more great
grandchildren.  Mike &amp; Becky’s son, David, and his wife, Sierra, had a baby
boy, which they named <b>Henry David, born on the 15<sup>th</sup> of May</b>.  
Shellie &amp; Roy’s son, Garrett &amp; and his wife, Nora, had a baby boy, which
they named <b>Damon Bryce, born on the 5<sup>th</sup> of September.</b>  That
gives us 10 great grandchildren.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Jeff &amp; Gail</b> needed to
leave their beautiful home in Layton <b>and move to Kimberly, Idaho</b> a few
months ago because of work.  Kimberly is close to Twin Falls, Idaho.  They have
a lovely home there too on an acre of land.  We won’t see them as often as we
did, but when we go there, we will stay longer.  Jeff is a Controller over
finances in his company.  He works for Chobani in Twin Falls.  Gail is a “stay
at home mom” and loves being home with her cute family, but keeps busy as all
moms do.  Ben is 9, Rachel is 7 &amp; Matt is 6 <b>Scott &amp; Mishelle</b>
love their nice home &amp; area in West Layton.  They have done a lot of work
in their yard and it is beautiful.  Mishelle knows a lot about plants and
flowers and has helped me with our flower gardens here too.  Scott works for a
company who does custom programming for Hill Air Force Base and he works a
couple of nights a week at the DATC tutoring and helping in their data processing
classes.  Mishelle is a “stay at home” mom, but works hard there to keep her
home &amp; family going smoothly.  Kylan goes to Layton High, Ashley to Legacy
Jr. High, and the twins, who turned 7 in October, enjoy their elementary
school.  <b>David &amp; Shauna</b> have a beautiful home in Enterprise, which
is close to Morgan.  David is a PA in Dermatology and works in South Ogden.  He
is very good at what he does and loves helping his patients.  Shauna works part
time from home and she is amazing at how she juggles work, home &amp; family. 
Tyler, who is 17 and Emily, who is 15, go to Morgan High, and Connor, who is 11
goes to their Middle School.  They are all straight A students, most of our
grandchildren are.  We are proud of all of them.  <b>Mike &amp; Becky</b> have
a lovely home in American Fork.  Mike is the principle of Orem High and Becky
has been working at the elementary school so they both keep really busy with
school, home &amp; family.  Their two oldest, David &amp; Paige, are both
married to wonderful spouses and live in Logan where they go to the University
and work.  We were invited to spend a Saturday with the two couples and had a
wonderful time eating, visiting and playing games.  Little Henry wasn’t feeling
the best, but we held &amp; enjoyed him anyway.  Mike &amp; Becky’s two younger
girls, Maddi, who is 14 &amp; Jessie, who is 12 enjoy school, and being in
Young Women’s with all the great activities &amp; classes..   <b>Shellie &amp;
Roy</b> moved from Queen Creek back to Chandler, AZ and have a lovely home on a
manmade lake.  Roy &amp; Shellie did a lot of remodeling on it and it is
amazing what they can do.  Ken &amp; I went down in May and had a wonderful
time.  Jase (their youngest, who is 14) was excited for Grandpa to teach him
how to fish.  They fished from the shore and in the paddle boat and caught a
few fish.  We also enjoyed being with their older sons, Quint &amp; Kevis, and
their oldest son, Garrett &amp; His wife, Nora and their little daughter,
Maggie.  Damon wasn’t born at that time.  Roy is a good provider so Shellie
hasn’t had to work outside the home, but she has always kept really busy.   <b>Sandi</b>
<u>divorced Nick this year, and she is happier now</u>.  She still lives in her
beautiful home in Tooele and works at Grantsville High as their Registrar.  
She is planning to retire in about 4 years.  She has a cute dog named, Pipper,
and they go running most nights.  She is a leader in the classified association
for Tooele District, so keeps really busy.  JaNae &amp; Her family and Chelci
and her family both live in Grantsville.  JaNae has 3 children and Chelci has 4
and they are sure growing up fast.  <b>Chelci sings with a Country Western
Band, named “EXIT NINETY NINE</b>”, and we enjoy going out to listen to them on
various occasions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Other than spending time with our family,
extended family &amp; friends, fishing is our favorite pastime in the summer. 
We love to be out in nature and on these beautiful lakes and reservoirs.  We
love to fish and we love eating them too.  We take grandsons and other family
members and friends with us some of the time, and that is great too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We are so thankful for our Savior, whose birth
we celebrate on this holiday.  We have been studying “Jesus The Christ” in our
Family Home Evening group each week, and have gained a greater love and
appreciation for our Savior.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>VACATION TO FISH LAKE AUGUST 16, 2015</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ken and I left for Fish Lake after we left the Bushnell
Reunion.  It took us until 5pm before we checked in at the Fish lake RV
Campground.  It took us a while to get set up and was soon ready for bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Monday, August 17,</b> We slept in the next morning, and
after getting up, Ken started looking for the sewer hookup.  When he couldn't
find one and all the other pads had one, he went to the front desk and asked
them about it.  The girl there said that they had had a bad rain storm and
haven't found the hook up on that pad since.  She gave him a new spot #26 and
we moved.  Most of the day was spent relocating.  We went out fishing about
five and did catch four fish before dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tuesday, August 18,</b> We got up at five am and were on
the lake shortly after 7 am.  It was a beautiful morning.  I caught the first
fish.  By 9:15 am, we had each caught our limits.  I hooked another one while
reeling in, that we released.  It was another great morning.  We stopped at the
lodge to see if they carried any groceries, but not much.  Ken cleaned the fish
while there as they have a better cleaning station than the one at Bowery
Haven.  We then went to the dock on the south west end of the lake, but they
had the same selection of groceries as the other two.  Ken filleted and
packaged the fish while I got some lunch.  We ate and then took a nap.  I got
dinner ready for the evening, while Ken wrote in a note book for his journal. 
We went out fishing about 4:30 pm and though there was a lot of wind, we both
caught our limits, in fact, as I was bringing in my last fish, as Ken reeled
in, he caught another fish.  It was a lip catch so we released it and it swam
away.  I read President Uchtorf's talk on the Savior's Atonement.  It is sure a
great talk. Ken cleaned our fish while I went on to our camper and started
dinner.  After dinner, Ken filleted the fish and I packaged them.  We are
getting quite a few fish.  We are tired so we are soon going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Wednesday, August 19</b>. We got up early so we could
have the crockpot on before we went out fishing.  It was windy when we woke,
plus Ken wasn't feeling the best, so we went back to bed. After getting up, we
realized that the furnace wasn't coming on and it was cold inside the camper. 
Ken went to check the thermostat and realized that the crockpot was setting
right under the thermostat.  We moved the crockpot and the heat soon came on. 
About 8 am we went out fishing.  It was a beautiful morning.  By 10:45 am we
were back in with our limits.  Ken tried fishing for Mackinaws, but didn't get
a strike there.  We kept the lure out but he also fished with a 2<sup>nd</sup>
pole.  I caught five fish and Ken three.  We had a good time.  After lunch, we
cleaned and filleted the fish.  We took showers and a nap.  I made a southwest
chicken dinner for this evening.  We went to the store for some ice, but they
didn't have any.  Then we went for a walk.  After getting back, we played Rummy
Cube in which Ken won two of three games.  We got to bed before 9:30 p.m.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thursday, August 20, 2015.  </b>We both slept well last
night and were up at 5 am.  We enjoyed a nice breakfast of hot cakes and eggs. 
We enjoyed the warmth and conveniences our camper gives us.  We were on the
lake about 7 am.  Ken tried fishing deep with the down rigger and it worked
pretty well.  We both fished with our standard pop-gear with me catching my
limit before Ken did.  Ken still had one to have his limit and he hadn't had
anything go for the down rigger lures.  As he was letting his line out to try
to catch his last fish, I asked if I could hold his pole while he took a
picture of me fishing.  He no sooner clicked the picture when the pole doubled
over.  Ken kidded me that I just wanted to catch his last fish.  We were back
in the boat dock about noon.  I went up to start lunch while Ken cleaned the
fish.  After eating lunch, Ken and I filleted and packaged our fish.  We then
took a nap.  I didn't get very much of a nap as a neighbor's dog started
barking.  We went out again this afternoon and Ken again spent his time trying
to catch a lake trout.  We had quite a wind on the lake this afternoon so I
fished for regular trout and Ken spent my his time trying for the Mackinaws,
and keeping the boat under control with the strong winds.  I caught my limit
but Ken didn't have any luck.  I read some talks from the conference Ensign. 
They were very good.  When we were about back to the dock, the wind let up. 
Ken tried to just catch a fish before we finished.  he had a good strike and
for the 2<sup>nd</sup> time today, the line broke and he lost a 2<sup>nd</sup>
set of good pop-gear.  We decided that the line must be getting old.  Those pop
gear sets cost about $20 each, so that hurts.  We had a nice dinner, took care
of the fish and went to bed about 10:30 p.m.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Friday, August 21.  </b>We planned on getting up early,
but we decided we were too tired so went back to sleep.  We got up about 6:30
am.  We were on the lake shortly after 8.  By 10:15, we had our limits and then
just road around on the lake, just enjoying the morning.   There was a fair
wind, but it was still a beautiful day.  We came in about noon.  I helped Ken
clean the fish and then he stayed and filleted them.  We figure that we have
caught over 48 fish this week and used 39 worms.  When Ken cleaned the bait
box, there was 2 ½ worms left.  After lunch, Ken had me lay down, as I wasn't
feeling very well, and he packaged the fish.  he then took a nap outside as he
didn't want to wake me, but was woke up with a wind that took the canopy almost
down.  It woke both of us, so we finished taking the canopy down and put it
away.  Ken and I played games this afternoon.  This evening, after dinner, we
went for a walk.  We went north east on the lake shore trail, although it
didn't go close to the lake.  While walking, we saw a 3 point white tail buck,
still in its velvet.  A short way further, we saw a doe.  Neither deer seemed
very worried about us, but just kept their eyes on us.  It was a beautiful
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Saturday, August 22.  </b>We slept in, not worrying about
fishing today.  After breakfast we started packing.  We were glad that we had
the canopy already packed as it still took us until 11 am before we got away. 
I was amazed at how Ken was able to back up the boat with the camper on, down
that short, but steep dock.  Then he ran around, got in the boat and drove it over
and onto the trailer.  It wasn't quite on, so he had to get out on the boat
trailer and jump over to the cement edge of the dock. He walked to the front of
the trailer and again jumped from the cement onto the top of the trailer to
pull the boat the rest of the way upon the trailer.  The boat wasn't on right,
so he again jumped to the boat from the cement pavement and rocked the boat and
threw me the rope to pull it up.  Other men were standing around marveling at
how Ken, as old as he is, could do what he was doing.  One man said, I couldn't
do that; I would fall in the lake.  Ken is amazing, and I am proud of him for
all he can do.  I am not much help to him, so glad he can do it.    Our
neighbors to our right had come up last night and while we were packing, he
helped Ken carry the canopy and put it in the boat.  Ken had been worried about
that as he didn't want me to help carry it.  We stopped a couple of hours to
visit with Mike and Becky.  Mike did an excellent job with the remodeling of
the girl's bathroom.  It was 5 pm before we got home and it took us another 3
hours unpacking.  We had stopped in Layton and got some Maddox chicken for
dinner.  We did watch a movie on Netflix before showering and going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>2016 SPRING &amp; SUMMER</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>July 25, 2016</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ken and I have a busy, but great
life.  I think it was February when our son, David, asked his dad if he could
help him build a “climbing wall” in his high garage, for their family as they
love “Rock Climbing”, so they invited us for dinner one night and then Ken and
David figured out how they would do it and the materials they would need.  They
got scaffolding and Ken did most of the work.  David helped him on Saturday and
after work when he could.  The kids helped some too.  It took several days, but
turned out good.  It was hard on Ken, however, and he suffered with his legs
and feet for some time afterwards, but when our kids need or want something
done, Ken is always there for them if he possibly can.  He’s a great dad and a
wonderful husband.  He has always made our homes and yards beautiful too, he
has always done things for me to make me happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This has surely been a wonderful,
but busy spring &amp; summer.  It started in <b>March with Rachel’s baptism</b>
on the 5<sup>th</sup>.  Then the following day, after church <b>we drove to our
granddaughter, Chelci’s home in Grantsville to tend her and Steve’s children
while they went on a cruse for their 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary</b>.  It was
hard on us since we are older and not used to getting up so early to get the
older children, Nathan off to school and Addie off to preschool and get the
twins who are 2 years old up, fed and ready for the day.  However, we love
these children and it was fun being with them.  The twins were great with us
and so fun to watch and be with, all the children were.  Jacob had diarrhea,
and Ken got this from him.  He had me get Pepto Bismo for him and since he was
taking it, he didn’t think he should take his acid reflux pills as he didn’t
know if they should be taken together.  Nathan had been sick with the flu, but
was getting better, but I caught it from him, so wasn’t feeling good for
several days.  I was sure glad that Ken was there to help me as I don’t know
how I would have managed to take care of the children without him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>We left Chelci’s on Friday,
March 11<sup>th</sup>,  to drive to Shellie &amp; Roy’s for two weeks</b>.  Ken
had health problems (terrible acid reflux since he didn’t take his pills for
two days and terrible hiccups from this and taking Pepto Bismo), on the way and
we had to return home to get him to the hospital.  We had driven to our
longtime friend, Judy Giles home in Kanab (halfway to Arizona) where we spend
the night and it was a terrible night for Ken, so we headed back to Utah about
5 am.  On the way, we called our son, David who is a PA in Dermatology, to ask
him what we should do.  From the symptoms I gave him, he assumed the worst – a
bleeding ulcer, and told us to drive to the nearest hospital.  Ken was doing
better while I drove, so we kept on going.  It was snowing and the roads were
bad, so I kept praying that I could drive carefully, that Ken would be alright
and we would be safe.  David called and said he didn’t want me to have to drive
all the way, so he and our son, Mike, were on their way to take us as far as
necessary, as they were worried about their dad.  We made it all the way to
Ogden to the Ogden Regional Hospital and after the doctor took tests and
examined him, she couldn’t find anything wrong with him, so released him and
said we could continue our journey.  Ken was embarrassed that he had troubled
our sons as they had had other plans for the day.  But, we were all relieved
that he was okay.  Ken and I then drove again to Judy’s home in Kanab, spend
the night with her and early the next morning continued our trip to Arizona. 
We had a wonderful ten days playing games with mostly Shellie, but also with
Nora when she and her two children, Maggie age 3 and Damon not yet one year
came over, or evenings when her, Garrett and their children came to be with us,
Shellie, Roy and their other sons.  Garrett, Nora and their children, went to
the Phoenix Zoo one day with us, Shellie &amp; Jase.  Roy also left work and
came for a couple of hours.  We ate our meals out on the patio overlooking the
manmade lake where geese and ducks came by often.  Shellie &amp; Roy have a
paddle boat and 2 kayaks so we were on the river doing this also.  Ken and Jase
would fish either on shore or on the paddle boat and they both caught fish,
which we took pictures of and then they released them back into the lake.  I
went shopping with Shellie two or three times, we went to church with them; I
helped Shellie make Easter gifts for her neighbors and went with her to deliver
them.  I also went visiting teaching with her<b>.  We had a great time, except
for one incident</b> when Ken was so discouraged after hearing that Roy &amp;
Shellie didn’t have temple recommends now, that he went walking the next
morning and was gone for over four hours.  It was hot and he didn’t take water
with him, and he didn’t even take his cell phone.  We had breakfast without him
and finally after 2 ½ hours, Shellie said we should take her car and go looking
for him.  We drove up and down the streets for over an hour and finally went
home to call the police.  Shortly after calling the police, he turned up at
their place.  Shellie and I were upset, but Roy was mad.  I was glad Shellie
settled him down as he was ready to send Ken back home.  He told me they would
be happy to have me stay, but of course, I wouldn’t stay if Ken left.  Roy was
mad at Ken because he was this upset that he and Shellie were struggling with
their testimonies now and that they didn’t have temple recommends.  I chewed
Ken out and told him how we had all been so worried.  He said he walked so far
that he got lost for quite a while. It has been so hard on Ken and I to have
most of our children leave the church, which is so important to us.  Ken gets
so depressed, I do too especially when I read the scriptures and know what they
should be doing and they aren’t.  We love our children and want them for eternity
and don’t see how that is possible unless they repent and come back.  We hope
and pray that they will.  At this time, July 2016, Mike is the only one of our
children with a temple recommend and in 1978, all of them did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The following Wednesday, after getting
home from Arizona, Irven &amp; Sandy had invited us to go to a town meeting in
Clearfield with them.  It turned out to be a county convention and just
delegates were to be there, so we didn’t stay long.  I love to spend time with
our grandchildren so I invited Kylan and Ashley to spend a couple of days with
us.  We had fun visiting, playing games, eating, snacking and watching planes
fly in and out of the airport.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><u>On April 4<sup>th</sup></u>,
we had our Porter sibling/spouse get-together at our home.</b>  Even though
Deanna is going through Chemo for liver cancer, she came with Bryce.  It is
good to have Terry and Angela move to Idaho from Alaska this year so they can
join us for family activities and reunions now.  I don’t think Jeanenne came as
she was sick, but I think Kim came and also Georgia &amp; Rick.  We always have
a great time eating, visiting and playing games.  This time we spend all the
time eating and visiting.  We take turns doing this every three months and we
all look forward to these times together.  On Saturday, <u>April 5<sup>th</sup></u>,
I went with a good friend, Diane Graf from Clinton, to a cooking class in Salt
Lake.  It was fun visiting with her and another good friend, Camille Smith,
while we drove there and back and the class was good and the food delicious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken and I always keep busy with
home/visiting teaching our couples and widows</b>, especially <b>Marianne and
Lynn Ray</b>.  Lynn passed away with cancer in December, but Marianne has lots
of health problems, not much family support and is very needy.  She is always
calling needing us to do lots of things.  Ken has put in a water heater for
her, has done plumbing work, did work on their swamp cooler, worked on their
sprinkling system, helped her with her washing machine, put in a new swamp
cooler this summer which took him 11 hours and put him down for 3 days as his
legs and feet were hurting so bad.  I take her to doctor’s offices, get
medications for her, take her to get groceries, we both have helped her move
furniture, I helped her do other things and helped her make phone calls, etc.,
with her finances, etc.  Ken and I lose patience with her at times, but she
doesn’t have others to help her, and when Lynn was alive, he was sick so
couldn’t do much and she had to take care of him.  She has major health
problems (although we wonder if all of it is true as she does lie).  She has a
big service dog and 9 cats, so it isn’t fun to go there, and she talks
non-stop, so it is hard getting out of her house or off the phone. Oh well, we
try to have her do what she can because the Bishop has told us that the more we
do for her, the more she will expect it and want us to do for her.  She knows
now that it upsets us so she tries to do more for herself and when she hints
that we do more, and I feel she can do it herself or get other friends to help
her, I don’t take the hint. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have another couple, <b>Evelyn
and Harold Hilton.</b>  They both have poor health, but they are younger than
us.  They have a son, who is on drugs, who lives with them and doesn’t work, so
that’s a problem.  They don’t go out to church because of their health.  Harold
has dementia and Evelyn “Evie” has scoliosis and her back was leaning toward
the right, and it was so bad that she was in terrible pain and would fall a lot
because of poor balance.  She recently had a hard operation where they put rods
down her spine to make her back straight.  She had seriously broken her right
arm before we knew them and it was terribly deformed so they operated on it and
put pins, nuts and bolts in it.  After her back operation, she again fell on it
and they had to operate on it again and put mesh, etc.  She got infection in
her back where part of the incision was and she is in rehab now.  She was in
Rocky Mountain Rehab, then home, then back in the hospital several times and
now in StoneHedge Rehab.  She has had quite a time.  They don’t have much
family.  Their son had a daughter who is 16 and she comes to visit and help out
at times.  They don’t have many friends as they don’t get out much.  They are
on church welfare, but it isn’t right because they had an RV, a big truck, a
van and a four wheeler and some land at Lava Hot Springs in Idaho.  They gave
them to this son, so they could be on welfare.  The son, Mike, takes his
mother’s drugs and pain pills as he can’t get enough on his own and sometimes
he is good to his parents, but many times ornery, especially if he needs drugs
and can’t get them.  He does do a lot of the cooking.  At least that’s
something.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have a wonderful, sweet, sister
who is a widow,<b> Leah Neilsen</b>, that we go home/visiting teaching to and
we love her and love to go there.  She is my hero.  She will surely go to the
Celestial Kingdom.  She has asthma and other health problems, her husband
wasn’t active in the church and later got Alzheimer’s and she nursed him through
that until he passed away.  None of her children are active in the church, but
she is so strong and so faithful and always has a smile and positive attitude
and does everything and anything to help others and the church.  She goes to
the temple weekly with four other sisters in our park, at least when she is
well enough to do so.  She is tall and stately and an elect lady.  She always
looks beautiful and everyone loves her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We have another wonderful widow, <b>Shirley
Lemon</b>, and we enjoy going to her home and always have a good visit there
too.  We have a brother, Wendell Siglin, who married a non-member, Linda.  She
is polite, but doesn’t want anything to do with the church.  Wendell has
children who are active in the church, but he loves to spend his time fishing,
golfing and playing.  When we catch him home alone, we have a fun visit with
him, but we don’t catch him very often.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>For Spring Break, Mike had asked
Ken and I if we could come to their home so Ken could help him rebuilt the two
gates for their wood fence as they were falling apart.</b>  Becky also wanted
them to make a trellis for her grapes.  We stayed about three days and they
accomplished all this.  Becky fixed delicious meals for us and I loved visiting
with her and Maddi and Jessie.  We all played games at night.  Ken had taken
his tool trailer behind our truck so he would have all the tools and equipment
they would need, but on the way home, some of the tread from one of the trailer
tires came loose and ripped off the bumper and did damage to the trailer.  Ken
was able to pull the truck &amp; trailer off at a good spot on the freeway and
thankfully we didn’t cause an accident.  Ken took off the tire and had to take
the spare to get air in it, so he left me behind with the trailer.  He came back,
put it on and we headed back home.  Mike had passed us as he was meeting David
in Ogden for lunch, so he called as he was worried about us.  Ken assured him
that we were alright and he could handle things.  Mike insisted on paying for
the new tire since we had brought the trailer to his home.  Mike is a great
son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>On the 21<sup>st</sup> of April,
we went to support Paige at her Utah State University Program</b> “Exhibit” in
Salt Lake City.  She is very talented and it was great.  We met Mike, Becky and
the girls there and visited with them, and also Becky’s parents and siblings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken and I have great neighbors,
two are sweet widows, Mary and Jackie</b>, and we love to visit with them and
take food to them occasionally.  Tim, our neighbor to the west is divorced, but
such a nice guy.  He is always happy to help Ken with anything Ken needs help
with.  Many times he will come out and ask Ken if he can help.  Tim is probably
only in his fifties.  We take food to him sometimes too and he is always
grateful.  We have a wonderful ward and always enjoy visiting with these good
people at church, choir or other activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>We have good friends here in the
mobile home park – Lee and Glory Gifford, Pat and Dave Presnell, Judy and Klaus
Decker and Daryl and Lindsey Wayment</b>.  We play games or get together to go
places or just visit.  Bishop &amp; Ravee Mullins have become good friends.  He
visits us a lot and one day he asked if we had been to all the temples in
Utah.  When we told him “no”, he asked if we would like to go to them with he
and Ravee, so we scheduled some dates to do and it has been great.  We have
been to the Payson Temple and the Timpanogas Temple so far.  We go out to eat
afterwards.  They also wanted us to go camping with them and one day they took
us to their favorite place by Causie Reservoir – Memorial Park.  We enjoyed the
day and set the dates to go camping.  We went for three days the first part of
June</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Lee &amp; Glory Gifford went to
Africa</b> with their daughter &amp; grandsons where the daughter and her
husband were adopting three little girls.  They had to foster the girls there
in Africa for up to three years, so <b>Lee &amp; Glory asked us if we could
take care of their berries and garden</b>.  They have an exceptional yard with
strawberries, raspberries, Logan berries and black berries, grapes, all kinds
of fruit trees, however, they just planted them a couple of years ago. They
have 8 garden boxes, an herb box, and lots of beautiful plants and flowers. 
Lee used to be a landscaper and worked on temples.  Gardening and landscape are
also his hobbies.  Lee &amp; Glory said we could plant what we wanted as they
didn’t plan to be home for at least a year.  This kept us busy also, especially
Ken, but I went also to help plant and weed.  It turned out that their stay
only lasted a few months (and we were glad), but they have insisted on us
picking and having half of their berries and fruit.  We are sharing the garden
also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Also, in Clinton, we have several
friends.  I go to lunch occasionally with <b>Marna McFee</b> and we love to
visit and be together<b>.  Ron and Diane Graf</b> are probably our closest
friends at this time and we do a lot with them and Ken and Ron love to go
fishing together.  Charles and Carolyn Saunders are back from their mission, so
we have resumed our friendship by getting together monthly to play games, visit
and eat snacks.  We keep in touch with <b>Marilyn and Kelly Bodily and Morgan
and Marge Thomas</b> and enjoy visiting with them and getting together
occasionally with them.  Several of us lady friends from Clinton (they still
invite me now that I’ve moved) get together for lunch when it is one of our
birthdays.  That is so fun to be with them again.  We have friends from other
places we have lived, who we keep in contact with and also our mission couple
friends.  Anyway, good friends are very important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken loves to fish, but we have
been so busy that he has only gone three times</b>.  Once with our friend, Ron
Graf and once with our grandsons, Kylan and Connor who love to fish too.  I
haven’t even gone fishing with him this year.  We went to Diane &amp; Ron’s
home Monday night to play games with them and Charles and Carolyn Saunders and
Ron and Ken decided to go fishing today at Strawberry Reservoir.  I’m sure they
are having a good time and it is good for me to be alone so I can do some of the
things I like to do – like catching up my picture albums and writing in my life
history.  I have visited with neighbors as I was out this morning on my walk,
and Mike called when he was coming home from work today and we had a good
visit.  His back is really hurting him and he called to apologize again for not
being able to attend our Glendon Porter Reunion last Saturday at a park near
us.  I had arranged for a pavilion at this park and set up this reunion, but
Shellie and Jase were the only ones from our family there.  The others all had
other fun plans, except Mike.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Shortly after coming home from Arizona, in
April, Jeff wanted us to come visit them for a week</b>.  Gail and the children
love us to come also and we love being with them.  Rachel called to see if we
could come a day earlier as it was “<b>Grandparents Day</b>”, so we did.  Ken
was going to go with Ben and I with Rachel and both of us later with Matt and
Gail to his field trip, but Ben’s teacher allowed Ken to take Ben early and
they came to lunch with Rachel and I and afterwards Gail &amp; Matt came and we
all went to Rachel’s room to look at her art exhibits and papers.  We then went
to Ben’s room where he and his classmates put on a play.  Afterwards Ken wasn’t
feeling the bet, so he left to go to their home to rest and I went with Gail
and Matt to his fieldtrip which was to a nursery.  We went on a tour there and
they told us all about the flowers, plants and trees.  They gave a treat to the
children at the end.   We don’t talk about the church around Jeff, but we sure
love him.  He is a sweet, wonderful loving husband, father, son, brother and
friend.  They had bought kayaks and they took us to the river where we had fun
kayaking there.  It was beautiful and a peaceful place to be.  The children
were in school, but Matt was in afternoon kindergarden.  When I fixed
breakfast, if I made bacon and eggs, he always wanted some bacon.   Matt was
waiting for me to get up each morning as he loved playing games with me. 
Rachel is taking piano lessons and would play the pieces she was learning for
me.  Ken helped Gail with her garden.  Jeff &amp; Gail and Ken &amp; I played
lots of games at night after dinner each night as we all enjoy doing this.  I
played with the children during the day.  Jeff wasn’t feeling the best that week,
but kept going anyway.  One day I suggested that we just watch a video instead
of going to the river again as I knew he didn’t feel up to it.  He agreed and
we all piled on Jeff &amp; Gail’s bed, except Jeff sat in their recliner and we
all watched “Star Wars”. It was fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            On April 23<sup>rd</sup>, we had our annual
Porter Cousin’s party at my cousin, Lael</b> and her husband, Neil Walls home
in Layton.  They have a beautiful home up on a mountain.  The view is breath
taking.  The food is “pot luck” and there is always tons of good food.  We eat,
visit and then sit around in a circle and each take turns telling about our
families and what we have been doing the past year.  All my Porter cousins are
still active in the church and wonderful, faithful members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I offer to tend our grandchildren and
enjoy doing this and have always done this.  Maddie and Jessie stayed with us a
couple of days while their parents went on a trip and we also went to their
home another time when they were in school as Mike &amp; Becky hated to have
them home alone at night and we didn’t blame them and enjoyed being with the
girls.  We visited, played games and had a good time.  Even though Kylan and
Ashley tend the twins for Scott and Mishelle, we go there to be with all of
them at times since they enjoy being with us.  We used to tend Jeff &amp;
Gail’s children when they lived here.  In fact, I gave Jeff &amp; Gail and
Scott &amp; Mishelle cards for Christmas some years that we would tend their
children at least once a month during that year.  We enjoyed this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>             We went to Emily’s piano recital</b>.  She
has taken lessons for several years, loves playing and has always practiced

play.  She is 15 now.  <b>We also went to a couple of Connor’s baseball games
where Connor mainly plays “Pitch</b>” and he is really good at it.  He told his
dad that he likes it when it is a full count.  That is unusual as most pitchers
feel the pressure and are worried, but Connor says he knows he has to concentrate
and pitch a strike.  David is their baseball coach and enjoys it.  Their team
won most of their games. <b>Tyler </b>used to play basketball and was really
good at it, but didn’t want to this past year as he didn’t like the varsity
coach and he loves track so is doing that instead.  He is really good at it
also<b>.  Ken and I went to one of his track meets and watch him run the
hurdles.  He also does the long jump and the high jump</b>.  Tyler is really
tall and thin.  He is a great young man – very polite and kind.  He and his
siblings are all straight A students.  He is taking really hard honor, college
classes so spend much of his time after school studying.  He is also dating a
cute girl, but since he doesn’t go to church much anymore because his parents
don’t, her father isn’t too excited about his daughter dating Tyler.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went from there to Logan for <b>Paige’s
graduation from Utah State University</b>.  Becky had invited us also to come
to David and Sierra’s home there in Logan for lunch before the graduation. 
They also invited Garrett’s parents and we enjoyed visiting with all of them. 
Becky’s parents didn’t come as their health is too bad.  In talking with
Garrett’s parents, we found they used to live in Anchorage Alaska and were
friends with Terry and Angela.  What a small world.  They asked for Terry and
Angela’s phone number so they could stay in touch with them.  It was great to
be with all of this family – Mike, Becky, Maddi and Jessie, David, Sierra and
little Henry and Paige and Garrett.  We took pictures of Paige in her cap and
gown and then went to the graduation.  I had uncomfortable high heels and my
feet were killing me by the time we reached the gymnasium where it was being
held.  After seeing Paige walk in with her classmates and after she received
her diploma, Ken and I left as we were to be to Irven &amp; Sandy’s home in
Smithfield for dinner.  As we left the gymnasium, I was dreading the walk back,
but there was a shuttle bus there waiting for anyone and he asked us if we
would like a ride.  We surely did.  We had a nice dinner with Irven and Sandy,
played games and spent the night.  Irven wants Ken to put in a water storage
system for him similar to ours, but he wants 200 gallons of water.  He and Ken
worked on the plans for it before going to bed.  What a busy day. Ken wasn’t
too excited to build it for Irven.  Irven said he would pay Ken, but it is hard
doing work for Irven &amp; Sandy and this one was even harder.  It was very
stressful for Ken.  It turned out really good, but it cost more than Sandy
wanted to pay, so Ken lowered the amount he was charging them and called Jared
at Durk’s as he had originally given them a better price for the tank.  Jared
ended up giving it to them for his cost, as he had misfigured before.  Ken said
to me later “I’m not going to do another job for them”.  (We’ll see, but maybe
not as Ken is 77 years old now and his health isn’t as good and it is getting
harder and harder for him to do this physical work).</p>

yesterday. &nbsp;We planted carrots, radishes, bush beans, tomatoes and
peppers. &nbsp;With the good rain we had, everything looks great! &nbsp;The
strawberries are blossoming now and we are excited about that. &nbsp;Apricots
are forming on the tree. The peas haven't blossomed yet, but the vines are sure
tall and healthy, so they should be blossoming right away. &nbsp;We can see
several potato plants coming up. &nbsp;The fellow at Jerry's Nursery took me
about a different tomato plant that is supposed to be delicious, so I decided
to try it. &nbsp;We already had the tomatoes planted in the south grow boxes
with the peppers behind them, so we planted this different tomato plant in one
of the north boxes, plus a yellow bell tomato plant (the size of a cherry
tomato) in another of the boxes. &nbsp;The garlic plants are really tall, but
look healthy. &nbsp;The grapes vines look great and all the berry plants do
also. &nbsp;You sure have a beautiful yard with all your trees, flowers,
bushes, garden boxes, grapes, berries, etc. &nbsp;We planted cucumbers and
Zucchini in our two garden boxes and we plan to plant banana squash and
spaghetti squash at our place also, so we can share these also if you like
squash and cucumbers. &nbsp;</span></p>

*It does really hurt that he and also his sweet wife, and our sons, Scott and
Jeff don’t have a testimony of the gospel either.  Scott convinced Mishelle now
too, and she used to be so strong.  In fact, that was what changed Scott’s
decision to go on a mission was because she said she would never marry a man
who hadn’t served a mission.  Scott decided that maybe other girls felt that
way too, and he started preparing for his mission.  Mishelle waited for Scott
while on his mission, as she loved him.  Now, she doesn’t believe either and it
breaks our hearts (Ken and I) that we are losing our children, their spouses
and grandchildren.  Satan is working so hard on our family.  We just keep
praying for them and putting their names in the temple and trying to love them
unconditionally.  I do love them so much and that’s why it hurts so badly. 
Jeff doesn’t even believe in God.  He told us that soon after we returned from
our mission to the Philippines.  He has depression and anxiety, and I can
understand why.  If he would humble himself, repent and decide to read the
scriptures and pray again, and want to gain his testimony back, I know the Lord
would bless him and he would feel peace and happiness again.  I sure hope and
pray for that.  Gail is still strong in the gospel, thank goodness, but I worry
about their children, especially Ben.  He will be 10 on the 19<sup>th</sup> of
June and when we were visiting last month, he told me that he hates himself and
wants to jump off buildings and kill himself.  He says he doesn’t believe in
God anymore.  That broke my heart.  Maybe he is just saying that to get
attention, but I don’t think so, I think he is confused because his dad doesn’t
believe, won’t pray, have family home evening with them, won’t go to church and
doesn’t want to talk about God or church.  His mother does do these things and
does them with their children, so why wouldn’t he be confused and hurting.  Now
the children are not wanting to pray and go to church, etc.  Ben especially.  I
think Rachel might be okay, but I’m really worried about Ben and Matt.  I hope
I can help them some, and I pray every day that Heavenly Father will help this
family, and all our family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Friday, June 3, 2016</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mike, Becky and daughters, Jessie &amp; Maddi, stopped in
for a few minutes this morning on their way to Montana for a week’s vacation. 
They wanted to give me my Mother’s Day present as they hadn’t been able to be
with us and our family until now.  The gift was a huge golden “Jack”.  Mike
said when he saw it, it reminded him of me.  I had loved playing jacks as a
girl with my friends and I became quite good at it.  I taught some of our children
and grandchildren how to play them and I played with them. I thought that was
an unusual gift, but a thoughtful one.  Ken said “I know where to put it”, and
he put it on the shelf of our entertainment center between the two DVD
players.  It will be a great conversation piece.  They had a beautiful Mother’s
day card with it and Becky wrote some beautiful tributes.  It said “Dear Mom,
you are such a blessing in my life – I am so grateful for your friendship and
example.  Thank you for all the many happy memories we have shared and support
and love you have always shown me and our family. Stepping into the unknown of
being a mother-in-law, I have been so grateful I’ve had you to help me know how
to do it right.  I love you and hope you have a wonderful day. Love, Becky”. 
She is a beautiful and special daughter-in-law, and has always expressed love
and appreciation in cards for almost everything we have done for them – tending
or being with their children, family gatherings at our home or Ken doing
‘fix-up” jobs for them or helping Mike do them.  I couldn’t ask for a better
daughter-in-law.  But I am very blessed to have four beautiful, wonderful
daughter-in-laws.  I love all of them and am so grateful they love our
wonderful sons and are good wives to them and wonderful mothers, and I am
grateful for their love for me.  I hope and pray that we will always be a close
family and love being with one another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I texted Mike and Becky after they had left this morning to
express my appreciation for them stopping in and also the special, thoughtful
gift and card and told them that I loved them and their family.  Becky texted
back saying: “Love you too and grateful for your love and example in my life.” 
I texted back telling her what a great wife, mother, friend and daughter-in-law
she was and that I loved her very much  She texted back saying; “Thank you mom
that means a lot to me, and I am grateful for all the love and support you have
always shown me.”  Ken texted back telling her that he loved her and was
grateful for the love and support she had always given Mike, and that they were
the only ones, in our family, who were working for an eternal marriage.  She
texted back saying: “You have raised wonderful children and I am lucky to be
part of your family.”  I texted back telling her that we did have a wonderful
family and that we love each of them dearly”, and I sure do love each one of
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We had our <b>traditional Memorial
Day Celebration where as a Glendon Porter Family</b>, we meet at the Morgan
cemetery on the Saturday before Memorial Day, to decorate the graves of our

Great Grandparents and Great Great Grandparents – Byron &amp; Mary Elizabeth
“Mae” Robinson Porter, their son, (our uncle) Royal Porter and their daughter,
(our aunt) Mary Maurine Porter.  We then visit and take pictures and then go to
the Morgan Park where we eat lunch and visit and the guys play Frisbee or other
lawn games and the children play at the playground or the splash pad.  Kim had
reserved a pavilion for us as last year they were already taken, so we ate in
lawn chairs and on the grass.  Usually it hasn’t been that busy, but since they
put in the splash pad, it’s getting more people out.  We all had a good time. 
Georgia and Rick were on vacation in Austria, so they couldn’t be there, so
none of their children came either, but we had good representation from the
other families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Ken’s brother, Roy, called to
see if he could come and stay with us for two or three weeks.</b>  He wanted to
go to the Browning Reunion on the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> of June,
2016 at the camp grounds in Paradise, near Logan and then stay and visit us and
others while here.  Irven &amp; Sandy’s daughter, Jennifer planned and
organized this reunion with the help of other family members, especially Irven
&amp; Sandy.  We told Roy that he was welcome to come and stay with us.  His
granddaughter, Joylynn, drove him up in his car.  She stayed with us that
Saturday night and then Ken &amp; Roy took her to the train station the next
morning where she rode the train back to her home.  It was interesting having
Roy here.  He has dementia pretty bad, and was always forgetting where he put
things, especially his medicine and insulin.  We had to keep reminding him to
take his pills and insulin shots.  The first week, he mainly stayed here and
helped Ken some when Ken was working on our home.  Thursday night, Sandi and
Gary came and had dinner with us and spend the night in their new toy hauler as
they wanted to follow us to the reunion.  Roy also followed us in his car to
Jennifer’s where he left his car and rode the rest of the way to the camp with
us.  We all left early so we could spend that day visiting with those who would
be there, especially Irven, Sandy and their family as most of the Brownings,
including our son, David and his wife and children and Scott, who would only be
bringing Ashley with him, were coming on Saturday.  Sandi and Gary had some
damage done to their new toy hauler since the road around the reservoir was a
dirt road and narrow and lots of vehicles were coming down since they had 300
girls for Young Women’s camp up there during the week.  It was difficult for us
to get around those vehicles, but especially for Gary &amp; Sandi.  At one
point, a lady in a truck would not get off to the side, so Gary had to get his
truck with toy hauler up on the side of the hill to let her go by.  This caused
damage to their toy hauler and they were not too happy about that, but they
were better about it than many would have been.  When we finally reached our
destination, we found it was very beautiful there and it had a nice pavilion
and lots of grass and nice restrooms, which was a plus.  Sandi and Gary sat up
their toy hauler and we sat up and leveled our camper and then we went to visit
family members, sign in, get name tags and get signed up for various games and
activities.  I won at Bonchie Ball as we were set up in couples competing
against each other.  I played against several and Sandi won the ones she played
against, so her and I competed and I won.  I also played Sandy Browning and
beat her.  I was surprised as I am usually not that good at it.  We played
Rummikub and other games, visited, ate good food and relaxed in that beautiful
surroundings.  In the evening, Ken and I went for a walk and saw a couple of
small waterfalls and other beauties of nature.  They had the “Iron Rod” set up
for girl’s camp and it was great!  Roy realized that he had left his medicine
and insulin in his car, so that was a worry.  He told us he would be fine for a
couple of days and he seemed to be.  David and his family and Scott &amp;
Ashley arrived in time on Saturday morning, for us to visit with them a few
minutes before we had to leave for home.  Sandi &amp; Gary and Ken, &amp; I
left soon after breakfast on Saturday morning as we needed to go to our church
and set up for the Bushnell Cousin’s Reunion.  I had this planned way before
Irven’s family set this date for the Browning Reunion.  However, Aunt Joy
passed away a week ago and her funeral was on Wednesday, which my siblings and
Ken and I went to in Fillmore, so we cancelled the Cousin’s reunion, since we
would all be at Aunt Joy’s funeral and it would be hard for those who have come
from far away to have to come that same week up to Roy.  I had arranged for a
business to cater the food and it was too late to back out on them, so my
siblings and spouses said they would come and we would all divide up the cost
and take the leftovers back to our homes to share with others or eat later.  We
did this and still had a good time.  When we decided to have Bushnell cousin’s
reunions, they told me and my siblings to host the first one since Mom was the
oldest child of Grandma and Grandpa’s.  Well, I did my part and arranged for
this one, so if they want another one, then other cousins will have to host
it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Roy stayed at the reunion as he
went to Irven and Sandi’s to spend 3 or 4 days with them.  They called us that
night when they got home to say that the medicine and insulin was not in his
car, that he must have left them at our home.  I saw a plastic bag with
medicine in and a black case which I figured had his insulin in, so we decided
that we would all meet in Brigham City and we would give them to him.  We did
and had just arrived back home when they called to say that he still didn’t
have his insulin and that he thought it was in his black upright bag.  I looked
in it and found some insulin needles and papers and didn’t see anything else,
so again we took off to meet them in Brigham City.  Roy looked at the needles
and said he still didn’t have the insulin.  We were worried about that, so had
tried to call Irven and Sandy on their cell phone before we left home and
different times on the way, but no answer.  We were all frustrated by this time
and it was late and we were all tired.  Ken and Irven decided to take Roy to
the nearby Walmart store to see if the pharmacy was still open to see if he
could get another bottle of insulin.  The pharmacy was closed, but Roy bought
some bags of skittles candy as he heard he could use that in an emergency. 
That didn’t sound good to us, so we had them follow us to our home so we could
search and hopefully find his insulin.  We got here before them and I again
went to his upright case and felt it all over and saw a zipper at the top on
the backside.  I unzipped it and found the bottle of insulin.  Since it was so
late, we had them sleep here.  Roy slept in the guest bedroom where his things
were and Irven and Sandy slept in our recliners.  The next morning was Sunday
and they wanted to leave before I could get us all some breakfast, so they
could get them in plenty of time to go to church.  Roy came out of the guest
bedroom carrying is black case and said he had everything he needed now.  As
they left the house, I glanced at the counter and Roy had left his wallet,
keys, etc., there.  I ran and told them to stop and then I ran back and grabbed
them and handed them to Irven and told him that he and Sandy would have to
watch Roy closely since he is very forgetful with the dementia.  They just left
when I was going in the bathroom and the door was open in his bedroom and I saw
(of all things) his bottle of insulin sitting on the dresser.  I was upset.  I
was in my pajamas, Ken was still asleep.  I grabbed the insulin and keys to the
car and took off after them.  I didn’t even grab my purse, but I did my cell
phone and kept trying to call them to tell them to stop as he had left his
insulin.  Wow!!  We had gone through all that time, gas for cars and
frustration the night before and he had still left the insulin.  No one
answered the cell phone and I chased them as far as 12<sup>th</sup> street, but
couldn’t find them, so had to turn around and come home.  I left them frantic
messages on the phone.  When they arrived home, they found the messages I had
left, but they were on the home phone, not their cell phone.  They called and
said they would talk about it and decide what to do.  Irven later called back
and said that Roy had found another bottle of insulin which he had had all
along, even at the reunion.  Oh my!!  I know it’s hard on Roy to be so
forgetful and cause problems, and it’s hard on family and others who he is
with. I sure hope Ken and I don’t get dementia or Alzheimer’s which their
mother had.   Roy drove back to our home and arrived here safely.  We had been
worried as to whether he would get lost or not.  We took him to visit Bob and
he met with a friend and had lunch one day and he helped Ken when Ken was
putting in the new swamp cooler for Marianne Ray.  He mainly sat in a lawn
chair at Marianne’s in the shade and handed Ken tools when he needed them.  The
Following week, we had planned with Scott, Mishelle and their family to go
camping with them up at Memorial Park where we camped with Bishop &amp; Ravee
Mullins.  We thought Roy would want to go back to his home by now, but when Ken
told him we were going camping, he wanted to go with us.  We made sure he had
his medicine, insulin and what he needed with him this time.  We went on
Wednesday morning so we could get the double campsite we wanted as it was the 4<sup>th</sup>
of July weekend and we knew it would be really crowded by Friday when Scott,
Mishelle and family could get here.  We were glad we did as people started
coming in that night and we wouldn’t have gotten this nice place.  It was shady
all the time in these two spots and we had lots of room there and lots of
grass.  You can’t reserve a campsite here, it was a first come, first serve
campground and the camp hosts just came around and collected the money after
you were set up.  We had an enjoyable time.  Roy wanted to go fishing, so Ken
got him set up with the fishing pole and off he went.  I asked Ken if it was
safe for Roy to go alone and he said “yes, he’ll be fine.”  Well, he came back
awhile later with a skinned up arm and wet shoes and clothes.  He had slipped
on the bank and fallen in.  We took care of his arm, and he seemed ok.  Ken and
I went for a walk while Roy took a nap.  We met some people who were camping
nearby and visited with them.  We enjoyed the beautiful scenery and just
enjoyed relaxing in the out-of-doors.  Scott, Mishelle and family came up
around noon on Friday and we helped them get set up.  They have a new, very
nice trailer with a pull out. They were happy that we had this nice camping
spot too.  We enjoyed visiting, playing games, going for walks, eating
together, etc.  Roy enjoyed being with us too.  As we sat around the campfire,
Ashley asked if we could make up stories, like we do sometimes.  Someone starts
a story and the next person adds to it and it goes around the circle of
people.  This was fun and some really had a good imagination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Saturday, July 3<sup>rd</sup></b>,  Ken, Roy &amp; I left

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Sunday, July 4<sup>th</sup>,</b> we enjoyed our church
meetings, had a nice dinner and then that evening, Roy’s son-in-law flew up, so
Ken and Roy went to get him at the SLC Airport.  When they got here, I fixed
him a plate of food (leftovers from our Sunday dinner).  This evening Roy,
Russ, Mae and I went up to the hospital to visit Bob.  We had a nice visit with
him.  He told the Dr. that he didn’t want to do anything that would prolong his
life.  I had to agree with him.  Like he said, if they could make him well that
would be one thing but just to prolong his life he is not in favor of that. 
Roy, Russ and I gave Bob a blessing before we left.  We soon went to bed after
getting home but it was still after 11pm before Ken and I got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Monday, July 5<sup>th</sup></b> - I didn’t slept very
well so Ken got breakfast and Russ and Roy left for California about 8am.  I
said goodbye to them, ate breakfast and then started the laundry and house
work.  I have been busy all day and Ken have got quite a lot done also.  Ken
and I went down to Gifford’s and picked Logan Berries and Raspberries.  We
pulled almost all of the Radishes although they are getting quite large and
will not be as tender.  Lee invited us to come back and watch the movie “The 4<sup>th</sup>
of July” with them.  It was a good movie but there was more strong language
than we normally watch.  It was almost midnight when we went to bed.</p>

in the back yard and we watched a show.  It was a science fiction movie, so
that didn’t interest Ken &amp; much, but it was good to be with our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Saturday, July 9, 2016</b> - For breakfast
Scott and Michelle prepared pan cakes, sausage and eggs.  Most of the day was
spent at the river on kayaks, paddle boards and rafts.  Lunch was Hoagies from
Wall Mart, furnished by Jeff and Gail.  For dinner this evening Ken and I
cooked Dutch Oven Chicken.  After dinner Mike, Becky, Paige, Garrett, Mattie
and Jessie left for home, as Mike had responsibilities Sunday morning.  The
rest of us played games and visited.  While Ken was visiting with David somehow
in the conversation he mentioned that he would like to go into Twin Falls to
get a Frozen Yogurt.  David immediately picked up on that and so some of us
drove over there.  That was a great treat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Sunday, July 10, 2016 - </b>Sandi and Gary prepared
breakfast of Dutch oven Hungry Man’s Breakfast along with muffins.  After
breakfast Sandi and Gary packed up to go home.  Some of us got ready to attend
Church.  Just before leaving for church Grant called Ken to inform us that Bob
(Floyd Robert Young) had gone into a coma.  Hospice was there, and they said
that it would just be a matter of time until he passed away.  Ken thanked him
for letting us know and told him that Ken would call later.  Shellie, Gail and
her children, Mae and I attended Sacrament meeting.  By the time we got back
home Sandi and Gary had left for home.  After getting home, Shellie prepared
Chicken Enchiladas and tossed salad for lunch.  Ken helped Scott and Mishelle
get packed to go home.  They left shortly after 3pm.  The rest of us played
some table games this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Monday, July 11. 2016 - </b>Shauna prepared a
tater tot breakfast casserole that was very good for breakfast.  She had made
enough for all the family but due to many already gone home there was quite a
bit of it left over.  David, Shauna, Shellie, Roy, Ken and I then got packed up
to leave.  Shellie, Roy, Ken and I went to Twin Falls to get gas in our truck
and a Frozen Yogurt<b>.  We got home about 2:30pm</b>, there was a Thank You
card from Sister Neilson on our door.  <b>After some lunch we took Roy to the
Ogden Air Port where he flew back home.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b> </b><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Shellie &amp; Jase
will stay with us for a couple of weeks</span>.</b>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken went over to Chancellor Gardens assisted
living and saw Bob and spoke to Bob for a few minutes before coming home.  <b>Grant
called Ken at 4:40pm to tell us that Bob passed away at 7:35pm</b>.  Ken spent
some time this evening trying to help Grant and Stacy notify family and friends
about Bob’s passing and funeral plans.  We watched a show on TV and visited
late into the night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Tuesday, July 12</b> - Shellie and I went
shopping this afternoon.  Ken was asked to speak at Bob’s funeral, so he worked
on it and Jase played games or did “Mindcraft” on his computer.  This evening
we played games and watched “Yours, Mine and Ours” before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Wednesday, July 13</b> - Ken made egg omelets
for breakfast.  Shellie and I washed the car and stopped at Harmon’s for a few
groceries.  Shellie &amp; I played games and visited, and this evening Shellie
played Ken a game of chess using the timer.  Shellie, Ken and I played a game
of Racko and then we watched the show “Trouble With Angels” before going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Thursday, July 14 - </b>This morning we got
up early so that we might leave for Salt Lake by 7am.  We did have one traffic
slow down but made it to S.L. in time to let Jase and Shellie off at Temple
Square.  Then Ken and I went up to the V.A. hospital to the Audiologist where
Ken had a hearing test.  Their test results look about the same as the other
tests he has had.  The Audiologist wants more tests and would like Ken to bring
the other tests that he has had, so that he can get a comparison and try to
find out why his hearing keeps changing.  We met Jase and Shellie and the four
of us then went through the Church History Musician.  Following that we went to
lunch at JB’s where we all had a great meal.  We then went to the Conference
Center and really enjoyed our time there.  We were all very tired and ready to
come home by 3pm.  After getting home we watched a show that Jase had.  I think
between Shellie, Ken and I we slept through most of it.  For dinner we enjoyed
grilled hamburgers.  We played games until bed time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Friday, July 15</b> - After getting up with
the normal morning routine, Ken and I went down to Gifford’s and picked beans,
raspberries, black berries and Logan berries.  Shellie and Jase were already up
and had found them some breakfast.  I then cooked us some hot cakes and we
enjoyed them with Yogurt and fresh berries on them.  <b>Shellie and Jase are
meeting Sandi for lunch in Salt Lake and will stay with her tonight.  </b>At
5pm this afternoon Ken and I went to a <b>back-yard party for the choir members</b>
and their spouses, put on by the choir director sister Barbara Dainard.  We had
a very nice time.  After returning home Ken worked on his talk for Bob’s
funeral tomorrow.  I helped him some.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Saturday, July 16 – </b>Ken worked on his
talk again, he is really struggling with it.   We left for the viewing and were
some of the first to arrive at the chapel.   Shauna had ordered a beautiful
spray of flowers from the Ken Browning Family.  Later when we went to pay our
share for them David refused to have us pay.  We had the Knutson’s, the
Neiderhauer’s, Morgan and Marge Thomas, Glen Higley and Dian Graf plus those
from the Relief Society Presidency, who took care of the lunch.  Cole’s
grandparents, members of Carroll’s family members were there.  I believe that
all of Bob and Carroll’s family were there, most of Irven’s family were there,
as well as all of our children and most of their spouses and children.  Of
course, Lois, Janet and Elise came.  They are always so supportive of the
family.  Also, the owners and other staff members of Chandler Gardens came to
show their respect for Bob.  The services were appropriate, but the only music
was an opening song and a closing song.  We were very pleased with the
dedication at the cemetery.  Full Military Rites were given in Honor of Bob
having retired with 20 years of service in the U.S. Air Force.   Shortly after
we returned home from the funeral, Ken got a call from Barbara Smith asking
about Bob.  Evidently Roy didn’t remember Ken calling him to inform him that
Bob had passed away.  Ken believes that Roy was the first one that he called
after Grant informed him of Bob’s death.  Ken also called Roy back when Grant
informed him of the funeral date and time. When Ken informed Barbara that we
had just returned from the funeral, she was so sorry that Roy hadn’t remembered
Ken’s messages.  Barbara told Ken that Roy called them Saturday morning and
said that Ken had called him about Roy, but he didn’t remember what Ken had
told him.  She said that had they known, they would have gotten Roy here as
well as some of their family.  She wanted Ken to express apologies and their
love to his family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Right after the funeral, Shellie &amp; Sandy
left to meet Gary and they were going to Gary’s property and then to Roosevelt
to meet Shellie’s best friend, Angie, when we lived in Grantsville and her
husband and go to Roy’s sister, Carolyn’s and husband Todd’s restaurant in
Roosevelt to have dinner with all of them.  Angie also invited them to her home
for a barbecue on Sunday.  Jase wanted to stay with us.  He just likes to be on
his computer.   This evening Ken and I just collapsed and relaxed.  Jase did
play a couple of games of “Spot It” with us, before we went to bed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.           <b>Sunday, July 17 – </b>We slept later than we
hoped and when I realized how late it was, I jumped up and got dressed.  Jeff
called and said that Gail had to be home for Church as she is giving the lesson
in Relief Society today.  They therefore didn’t stop.  Ken prepared breakfast
of eggs and bacon.  After breakfast Ken went into the bathroom and became quite
dizzy and almost fell.  He finally laid down and went back to sleep.  This
morning when he got up his hearing was very good but after becoming dizzy his
hearing went away and the ringing in the right ear returned also.  After church
and dinner, we tried to visit Sister Hilton and Brother Siglin but neither were
home, so we stopped and visited Brother and Sister Sheers for a few minutes.  
I started working on the presentation which Verla has asked me to give at the
Porter Family Reunion.  She asked if I would give memories I have of Grandpa
&amp; Grandma.  Ken has been concerned that maybe his stories were lost when our
computer crashed, but I was able to find them on the External Hard Drive.  We
were both so happy that I was able to find them.  Ken has great stories of his
life, his family, his dog, etc., etc., and we don’t want to lose them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.           <b>Monday, July 18 We</b> got up about 7am and
then went to go pick berries at Gifford’s.  There weren’t very many berries but
that was ok.  After breakfast Ken started filling water bottles and then took a
3-gallon bottle over to Jackie.  Ken took water over to Jackie, our 90-year-old
widow neighbor, who we love.  Ken stayed and visited with her quite a while and
then Assenacio was outside and he got talking with him and that turned into a
lengthy conversation.  Ken isn’t feeling the best.  Shellie and I did laundry,
visited and played games.  This evening we played Racko.   It was mid-night
when we finally quit to go to bed, but Shellie needed to vent so her and I were
up until after 2am.  I love this beautiful daughter and feel so bad that her
life hasn’t gone how she was hoping, and we were hoping, but life doesn’t
always turn out as we hoped and planned.  Roy and her boys don’t have a
testimony either, like 3 of our sons. (Don’t know about Jase).  They don’t go
to church and don’t pay tithing, so she is depressed.  She wants to get her temple
recommend back, even though Roy doesn’t – so I hope she is strong enough and
will ask her Bishop for one.  I can’t see how why she can’t get one.  She says
that because Roy doesn’t want to pay tithing, that she can’t – but other
sisters are in the same boat and they can get recommends, because they would
pay if they had jobs and earned money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Tuesday, July 19 -</b> After breakfast,
Shellie and Jase got ready to go to Lagoon.  This is the first year that I
haven’t gone with them, but I didn’t for two reasons.  First, they used to let
seniors go in for a minimal fee if they didn’t plan on going on many rides. 
Also, Shellie has paid for my ticket some years.  The second reason is that
since none of her other family came this year and Sandi wasn’t going with her,
that meant that there were just two of them and they could go on rides
together.  Other years, with having more family, I went on rides with them.  It
is our ward temple day and Ken is in charge of it, so he and I went into the
Ogden Temple this afternoon.  We met Brother Fife and Dave &amp; Pat Presnell
at the church.  Brother Fife didn’t want to eat afterwards, so he drove alone. 
Another couple from our ward, the Wimmers met us at the temple.  They are one
of the “Transplant couples who come to help our ward for three years as we
don’t have enough leadership in our mobile home court.  They are all wonderful
couples and we are thankful for them, but it’s hard to say “Goodbye” when their
three years are up.)  We enjoyed visiting with the Presnells as we ate in the
cafeteria.  Shellie, Ken and I played a couple of games before going to bed and
Ken lost every game.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Wednesday, July 20 Ken</b> woke before 6am
and was up for a few minutes when I woke.  We both went back to bed and slept
for a little longer.  Later I was going to go run an errond and I couldn’t find
the keys, they were not hanging on the hook where we keep them.  I asked Ken if
he knew where they were, and that started a search that both of us were 
looking off and on throughout the day, without success.   Ken talked with
Shellie for quite a while and I was worried that Jase was hearing it.  He was
in the front room with his computer and he did have his ear buds in, but
Shellie &amp; Ken were getting loud, so I suggested they go into the bedroom. 
I got in on some of the conversation, but Shellie was so upset, and Ken wasn’t
helping (I didn’t think), so I told them I was leaving as the spirit of the
Lord wasn’t there.  I shut the door and was upset.   Shellie has certainly gone
through her share of challenges, even more than anyone should, but I guess the
Lord knows she can and maybe there’s much to be learned for all of us in this. 
Later, Shellie and I went to visit Deanna.  We sure enjoyed our visit with
Deanna and Bryce.  Bryce kept giving us all kinds of food – fruit, nuts, dried
fruit, banana nut bread, etc.  When we got home, we fixed leftovers for Ken and
Jase as Shellie &amp; I weren’t hungry.  Shellie and I had a good talk on the
way to Deanna &amp; Bryce’s and on the way back.  Ken got Jase to help him and
they hauled some trash away for Sister Marianne Ray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Thursday, July 21</b> When we got up this
morning Shellie had breakfast almost ready for us.  We ate and then went to the
Viewing and Funeral for Eugene Tew’s, Rick’s Father.  It was very nice and had
beautiful music too.  We left after the funeral, so I could stop at the
Distribution Center in Layton.  When Shellie and I were there quite a while
looking at books and tapes, so Ken got tired and I suggested he go sit in a
comfortable chair they had there. He did and took a short nap.  Mae and I took
a nap for almost an hour after getting home.  Shellie loves working with the
Banamagrams we have.  You make words out of the chips and it is like a
crossword puzzle.  We bought her a set when we were at WalMart the other day,
so she put the chips from both games together and spelled out the names of all
our family.  I took a picture of her with them.  Ken has been hurting through
his legs and feet most of the day.  I had chicken thawed when we got home so
Ken grilled those and hamburgers for Jase.  This evening we watched a show on
TV until quite late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Friday, July 22 After</b> breakfast this
morning Ken went to Dr. Gray’s and had his teeth cleaned.  He then went to
Murdock Chevrolet and got a new transmitter, two new keys and a key ring, which
was a total of $235.05.  I wasn’t too happy that he did that as I thought we
still might find the keys and that’s a lot of money to spend right now.  We ate
lunch and then Ken, Shellie and I played a couple of hands of Rackco and then
Shellie went up to visit Georgia.  I made a potato salad for our Glendon Porter
Family Reunion that we are holding tomorrow.  Ken installed a new print
cartridge into our printer this afternoon.  It has been indicating that it
needed a new one for about three months now but finally quite working.  We
watched a show on Netflix this evening that was ok but had quite a different
outlook on death and heaven that any we have seen before.  Ken, Shellie and I
played a few hands of cards before going to bed late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Saturday, July 23   Ken </b>prepared
breakfast this morning of egg omelets.  We basically prepared for the reunion
that we will hold this afternoon.  Ken has been quite dizzy today and, so he
took a nap.  This afternoon we set up for the Reunion and had a fair turn out. 
Mike had planned on being there but somehow hurt his back and so called us to
say that they weren’t coming.  Except for Shellie and Jase being there, none of
the rest of our family came.  We had a pretty fair turn out.  All of Georgia’s
and Rick’s family were there and they were disappointed that our families were
not there.  Terry, Angela, Maleah and children came from Idaho.  Maleah had
been to Alaska with her husband, Troy, who works there most of the time, but
make sure she was home to come to this reunion.  Kim, Summer, Daniel and their
daughter came late and even later, Dezeree, Joshua &amp; His partner, Calab,
Mishelle and their children came.  Most of that generation played volleyball
after dinner and everyone seemed to enjoy the event.  It was almost 10PM before
we got home.  Terry and his family have to travel back to Chubbuck, so they
will be lucky if they make it by mid-night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Sunday, July 24 We</b> got up about 6:30am to
get breakfast for Shellie and Jase and see them off.  They left for home about
7:30am.  We have sure enjoyed having them here.  We just hope and pray that
Shellie can find more satisfaction in life.  She is one person that is sure
trying to live the Gospel and teach it to her children, and is depressed that
they and her husband have dropped into inactivity now.  We pray for all of
them.   After Shellie and Jase left, we had some breakfast and then took
showers and laid back down for a while.  Today Bishop Mullins and his
councilors were released from their calling and a new Bishopric was sustained. 
David Presnell was sustained as Bishop with Sam Hess as 1<sup>st</sup>
councilor and Gary Johnson as 2<sup>nd</sup> councilor.  We certainly agreed
with the choice of the Stake presidency and feel that we could and will sustain
them in their callings.  Ken hasn’t felt the best today.  I fixed dinner and
then we were going to take a ½ hour nap and then go visit Evie Hilton at the
rehab.  Ken laid down and the phone rang.  It was Marianne Ray, so I talked
with her while I did the dishes and Ken took the nap.  I called Evie and she
was too tired for us to go visit her, so we will another night.  I was still tired,
so I took a short nap while Ken played a game of Hearts on the computer.  I
needed to do some work on the ward history, so Ken let me use the computer. 
After that we planned to watch the BYU channel to see if they had something on
the Pioneers.  I had seen that there were some videos and information on
Pioneers on Family Search, so thought we could watch them, but they had been
removed (not sure why as today is the 24<sup>th</sup> of July to celebrate the
Pioneers arriving in the Salt Lake Valley).  As Ken turned on the TV, it had a
show starting with Jimmy Stewart and both Ken and I really like him.  It was
titled “Bend In The River” and was a Western Movie.  It was good.  We are going
to bed early – first time in many days since Shellie has been here.  We
received a text from her when we got home from church saying she was in Flag
Staff and another at 7:30pm saying they were home.  We were happy to hear that
she and Jase made it home safely.  We are grateful to the Lord for answering
our prayers and watching over her, as she didn’t get much sleep last night, so
was tired and had 12 to 13 hours of driving to reach their home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Shellie texted the next morning after
arriving home and said “Thanks for a wonderful time in UT</b>.  Can’t believe I
was gone for 24 days!  Time flies when you’re having fun.  It’s good to be back
though.  I almost forgot how much I love my home and the beautiful lake.  Our
backyard view truly is gorgeous and it’s not any hotter right now than it’s
been in UT though our evenings don’t cool off.  Garrett and Nora came over last
night to welcome us home &amp; Nora wanted to spend some time outside, but I
choose to pass as it was way too hot.”  She texted again saying “My little
Maggie missed me.  She was hugging on me all night –I loved it!! So cute!”   I
had asked her to text us when she got to Flagstaff and again when she arrived
home – and she did.  I was relieved as she was tired when she left her as she
hadn’t had a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            Monday, July 25</b> I didn’t sleep much last
night, so Ken let me sleep in later this morning.  I had wanted to get up early,
so I could work in my flower gardens and yard.  I did that anyway, for a while,
before breakfast as it would be hot soon.   It has been a “hot” summer – over
100 degrees many days.  At 11am I came in and fixed us some breakfast and we
just set down to eat when the door bell rang.  We thought “I wonder who that
can be this morning because Bishop Mullins has been released, so it couldn’t be
him”. So, I answered the door and guess who, but Bishop Mullins.  I think he
just wanted to visit.  That is ok, as we sure love and appreciate him.  Ken got
water bottles filled and one taken to Jackie, across the street.  He got all
the coolers, chairs and games that we used at the Family Reunion Saturday, put
away.  He made up a batch of Almond Butter.  I did laundry all day as I had
sheets &amp; pillow cases from all the beds and towels along with all our usual
laundry.  I cleaned the house, made meals, made Ken’s smoothie drink, etc.  We
were both tired, so we watched part of a Western show on TV this afternoon.  
Charles and Carolyn Saunders and Ken and I were invited to Graf’s to visit play
games and have refreshments.  We had a good evening, getting home after 10pm. 
We soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Sunday, August 7, 2016.</b>  Other than going
to church, I have been working on my presentation for our Porter Family Reunion
tomorrow night at the Layton Park and “Surf &amp; Swim”.  I hope it won’t be
longer than I should take.</p>

style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>Following our meetings, I
went with Brother Okey to take the Sacrament around to the shut-ins, those that
due to health and/or age are not able to attend meetings.&nbsp; We visited two
widowers that have lost their wives due to death, the one is in his late 70’s
and his wife passed away 2 years ago, and the other lost his wife to death
three years ago.&nbsp; He told us that he is reaching close to 88 years
old.&nbsp; Brother Okey asked him what he was planning after reaching age 88
and he just said, with a twinkle in his eye, I have got to first reach that and
then we will see.&nbsp; A third couple did not let us in because he has been
sick for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; His wife has severe osteoporosis and has been
operated on two or three months ago and the doctor’s have put steel rods up her
back to hold her spine in place.&nbsp; The operation so far has not healed
properly and she has had to return to the hospital for additional
operations.&nbsp; Doctors cannot find anything wrong with the husband except
they feel he has Dementia and due to his wife’s condition, he is reacting to it
emotionally.</span></p>

had a very special experience this last month helping those people in our
neighborhood that weren’t able to help themselves -a very special insight on
what it means to rescue and be rescued. I believe that we will all experience
or have experienced both sides of a rescue and it helps each us better
understand the mission of the Savior. I also have a strong testimony of eternal
families and free agency, very grateful for both--thank you for adding your

With the latter, it also tells me that I can have my family also with us;
however, I cannot take their agency from them.&nbsp; With all the theories in
the world, I can’t find anything else to place my bet on!</span></p>

style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>&nbsp;I don't speak
arabic, but I have read the Qu'ran in French and it explicitly states that
families who are faithful will be reunited in the afterlife. Forgive me
grandpa, but to me the claim the LDS church's doctrine is unique in this
respect seems uninformed. 1.6 billion people are both&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>members
of the LDS church&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>believe in continuing relationships
after death. Also of note: the judge that married my wife and I used the
language, &quot;as long as you both shall live&quot;. To me this has any sort
of afterlife covered.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:31.3pt;line-height:normal;background:
white'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#500050'>&quot;I can’t
find anything else to place my bet on!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>I really appreciate the
language in this phrase. It explains my stance almost perfectly. The afterlife
is indeed a gamble. There is no way to be certain of the outcome!! Personally,
I consider myself an agnostic atheist. This means that though I remain unsure
on the matter of god and an objectively true religion I tend to find their lack
of existence more plausible than their existence (See Occam's Razor). The
bottom line for me is that we can't&nbsp;<i>know</i>. Since we can't know, I
find it a much better use of my time to spend it with my family and bettering
myself than to lose what little time I have worshiping a deity that may or may
not exist and trying to figure out what he/she/it wants me to do. People have
been trying for thousands of years, and I personally don't believe we're any
closer than we were 4,000 years ago.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The global population is 7.4 billion. Church membership is 15,634,199. This
means that for every 1,000 people, 2 are LDS. From a gambling stance 500:1 odds
are not very good!!! I find it much more likely that god, whatever it may be
will be much more appreciative of the fact that I looked, I searched, and that
ultimately there was no reliable means by which I could determine what the
outcome of death was so I decided instead to try and be a good person, improve
myself, and treat my family right.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>Consider the following: I
die tomorrow. The LDS church WAS indeed THE single path back to God!!&nbsp;<b>Why
would an all powerful god punish me for the rest of eternity when he/she/it
didn't actually make him/her/itself or desires known to me in this life?</b>&nbsp;note:
the spirit is purported to convert followers of almost every religion to said
religion. I have explicitly replicated what I believed growing up to be
'feeling the spirit' I can do it on command. I believe the devout catholic has
every thread of conviction a devout mormon does. This is not a statistically
nor repeatably reliable means by which to receive important
information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal;background:
white'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>The call to
action you ended with was somewhat hurtful. I'm going to man up and call it
out. That was a deliberate attempt to guilt those of your children and
grandchildren who have chosen to leave the LDS religion into conformity. I know
I have several family members behind me when I say we don't plan on it. I know
that isn't what you'd like to hear, but for those of us who have left, we don't
like to be belittled either.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222'>There is a line when it
comes to religion. Whenever it is crossed with myself or my family, you can
expect a response similar to this one. If we can maintain that line, no more
feelings need be hurt. Just to clear up any confusion, unless you are willing
to come at a religious conversation willing to accept the possibility that you
may be wrong (I'll do the same), please don't start a religious conversation
with me. (This includes passive aggressive email activity). If you would honestly
like to have a discussion on the subject, I need a brief summary of what it
would take to convince you that LDS doctrine is not true. For me to convince me
of the truthfulness of the LDS gospel, I would need God himself to come down,
shake my hand, and ask me for the first couple tokens. (It happened to Alma the
younger, and I'm not trying to bring down the church, besides, an all powerful
god who lives outside of time and who actually does care about each of his
'lost' sheep would deem it a menial task in my opinion). In fairness, I think
witnessing a priesthood blessing restore the arm or leg of an amputee (no
surgery) would also suffice. The evidence against the church being the one and
only true church on the face of the earth is too damning to concede anything
less in my honest opinion. The interesting conundrum being that if that
actually happened (miraculous vision), almost no one in any LDS ward would
believe me. I'd probably be excommunicated for preaching false doctrine.&nbsp;</span></p>

work the other day.  He does this every so often and we appreciate it.  Anyway,
in the course of the conversation, this email came up and Mike told his dad
that if anyone writes more than three lines in an email, it can get
misconstrued.  He says he never does, that if he wants to communicate feelings
and emotions, he always either talks to them over the phone or in person. 
Guess that’s good advice for us. Mike is the only one of our sons who still
believes and is strong in the church.  We are thankful that he and Becky are.</span></p>

email, when he noticed that his nephew, Dave, had sent this one, so he opted
not to send his.  His might have been similar to Dave’s as he, Jeff and Scott
all feel about the same.  They all don’t have testimonies of the church, the
prophet, Joseph Smith, our current prophet and the Book of Mormon.  David and
Scott still take their families to church, when they don’t have other plans,
and we are grateful for that and they still believe in Heavenly Father and
Jesus Christ, when Jeff and Dave don’t.  It breaks our heart to see how so many
of our family are leaving the church, as it is so important to Ken and I and we
know it is all true – but they are very good people who love their wives,

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mae’s journal January 17,
2017</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(From Ken’s journal on Jan 1, 2017) Mae came home about
11:00 am, from the Hilton’s, all upset.  She wanted to be there when the lady,
who was hired by the Treso Assisted Living Center, came.  She was there to help
the Hilton’s sort and pack since Harold can’t do much with his bad back and he
has Alheimers disease.  Evie is in so much pain from her back and hips and has
to use a walker when she does get up, so they haven’t packed much.  Mae has
packed their books, their dishes and glasses from the kitchen and taken down
their pictures and bubble wrapped them.  The lady, Suzanne, was just getting
out of her car when Mae arrived.  They went in together and Mae introduced her
to Harold &amp; Evie.  Suzanne explained things to Evie and tried to start
packing and sorting and asking Evie if she wanted to take this or that, and
suggested they give things to charity and asked what Mike wanted.  (Mae’s words
now)  I was helping her and Mike (who was in his bedroom with the door closed)
started yelling that they didn’t want her or need her (Suzanne) there and that
his mother didn’t have to do what Suzanne was telling her.  He was yelling,
swearing and ranting and raving.  Evie went in to calm him down and apologized
to Suzanne.  Suzanne said that it was hard for people to move and she could
understand and that she had had people yell at her before, but that she was tough
and could take it.  But Mike wouldn’t stop and it got worse until Suzanne told
me she was scared and asked if Mike had a gun.  I told her I didn’t know.  I
was getting scared and upset too.  Finally, Evie came out, after talking to
Mike, and told Suzanne she needed to leave, that they were not moving to the
Treso after all.  I was shocked as Bishop had told us to hire a couple of
movers and schedule a U-haul truck and the ward would pay for it.  I </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>did this and asked other men and women from our ward to help
and told them to be at the Hilton’s at 8 am on Monday morning.  I asked Evie
what they were going to do then?  She said they were going to live in their 5<sup>th</sup>
wheel trailer.  I told her that they had put a $500 deposit down on their
apartment at the Treso and would lose it, plus she had signed the agreement
when Carol had come.  She said she could get out of it.  I was so upset with
all of this, and it was time for us to go to Irven &amp; Sandy’s, so I put on
my coat and was leaving too, when Mike called to me from the Living Room.  He
had gone in there.  He asked if he could talk to me.  I went in and he
apologized to me and said he wasn’t mad at me, that they loved me and Ken and
appreciated all we had done for them, but he wanted the lady gone as they didn’t
want her there as she was telling his mom what she had to do.  I told Mike that
she was hired by Treso to help them sort and pack and his parents couldn’t do
that and that she was a nice lady and was just there to help.  I told him that
it would be so nice for his parents to be at Treso as they both have bad health
and can’t take care of themselves.  He said that he could take care of them
like he had been doing.  Oh brother, he is just living off them.  He spends
their money and takes Evie’s pain pills which she needs.  He doesn’t have a
job.  I know he talked his mom out of it as he doesn’t want to have to get a
job and pay his own way.  I came home and told Ken that we needed to talk to
the Bishop.  We went there, and I explained the whole thing to him and he told
us to cancel the moving truck, the hired help and those who were going to help
from our ward, on Monday.  He said until they know what they are doing, we
can’t help them.  Ken and I went home, and I got on the internet and phone and
cancelled it all.  We then went to Willard and picked up Bryce and Deanna and
drove on up to Smithfield where we spent the rest of the day and evening,
eating, playing games and visiting until about 9 pm when we came home.  Their
son, Mark and his wife and their daughter, Jennifer and her husband and two
children came too and it was good seeing and visiting with them also.  I am so
concerned about the Hilton’s and upset that it will be hard to sleep tonight,
but I’m glad that Ken and I could get away and be with family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I were assigned to Home Teach/Visit
Teach Harold and Evelyn “Evie” Hilton soon after we moved into the ward.  They
are good people, but have health problems and other problems.  Evie has
scoliosis, like I have, but she didn’t go to chiropractors like I did.  I also
got help from Randy Porter (my cousin) &amp; Deanna Clark, who are massage
therapists and they don’t just do “feel good” massages, they do deep massage
and they, especially Deanna.   straightened me out.  She said that if I hadn’t
gotten help, that in ten years my body would have gone to the right.  When I
saw Evie, I cringed thinking that I could have looked like that.  Evie kept
falling so her doctor operated and put rods down her back.  It had a hard time
mending.  She still falls and she cracked her hip and is in so much pain now. 
Harold has back problems too and dementia.  Their main problem is her son.  It
is a second marriage for Evie and Harold.  Mike, her son, was on drugs, stole
items and was in prison 14 years ago.  He is tattooed all over and has
piercings, and is missing his two front teeth, so looks scary.   I have been
nice to him, so haven’t had problems with him, but I am sad at what he has done
to them.  They had good money at one time and a beautiful home in St. George, and
they get almost $1,000 more a month than Ken and I do, but now they are being
evicted out of their mobile home as they haven’t paid their lot fees and owe
the park over $5,000.  It is because Evie gives in to Mike and gives him her
credit card and gives him her pain pills.  I don’t know what they will do and
Ken and I don’t know what to do for them except pray for them and show love to
them.  The owner is supposed to meet with them.  Perhaps he will give them more
time.  Mike was supposed to be evicted two weeks before they were, but because
of the holidays, they let him stay.  If they had made him get out, we could
have gotten Evie &amp; Harold into Tresco and their lives would have been so
much better and easier for them.  Oh well, they have to make their own
decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I called Shellie this morning to ask when would
be a good time in March to come and visit them.  Jase has spring break for a
week, so she said it would be great if we could come when he is out, and I
agree.  She then said she needed to talk to me about one thing and that is that
when we come down, dad can’t pout or be upset because of the way they are
living their lives now.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We knew before we went down last year that
Shellie and Roy were having a hard time because their two sons, Quint and
Kevis, had lost their testimonies and were not going to church.  Quint had gone
on a mission and had loved the MTC, but was sent to Washington DC and had a bad
experience and wanted to come home, so he did.  He has quit everything about
the church now and Kevis has followed him.  Kevis went “Goth” and wore black
and chains and when he moved out of their home, he died his hair black and put
on black makeup.  The first time Shellie saw him that way, she lost it and
almost had a nervous breakdown.  She quit going to church for a while.  It had
been hard on her before to go to church as there were so many young people
going on missions and coming home from missions so about every week, she said,
those young people were speaking.  She had always thought her sons would all go
on missions.  She was excited when Garrett went and thought the others would
follow suit.  She even blamed the Lord at first as she said her patriarchal
blessing said (to the effect that they would go on missions and raise righteous
families) That has been so heart breaking for her.  When we were down last year,
and Ken and I wanted to go to the temple and asked Shellie about going with us,
she told us that her and Roy didn’t have temple recommends, so she wouldn’t be
going with us.  She has always gone with us in the past and Roy has gone with
Shellie &amp; us at least once each time we came down.  Anyway, it was too much
for Ken as we had both felt that all our children would stay in the church and
raise righteous families who would have strong testimonies and we would be a
“Forever Family”.  Shellie has been our child who has had the strongest
testimony and always tried so hard, even when Roy didn’t support her, to have
family home evening, family scripture study and family prayer and tried to
teach her children the importance of living the gospel and the blessings that
come when we obey the commandments and follow the prophet and our savior. 
Anyway, Ken went walking and was gone for over 3 hours.  Roy was mad that Ken
was acting this way and was ready to ship him home.  Shellie was hurt that her
dad did this too.  I could understand both sides and it was hard on me too and
I even chewed Ken out when he got back as I had been so worried about him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>          </span>Back to our
phone conversation, I told Shellie I didn’t think dad would do that again, that
he is doing better. I told her I would talk to him.  She said she couldn’t have
us come if dad would do that again as she didn’t need that since she is dealing
with a lot already.  She had told me before on a phone conversation that Roy
doesn’t go to church anymore and he is happier now that he isn’t and when she
comes home, he has made the bed, straightened the house and fixed dinner
sometimes.  He won’t pay tithing now and won’t let her.  He gets angry if she
wears her temple garments, which her Bishop told her to start doing, so she is
between a rock and a hard place.  She wants to get her temple recommend back
and go to the temple again, but feels she needs to keep Roy happy.  She says
that Jase doesn’t always go to church with her either and if he does, he only
wants to stay for Sacrament Meeting, so she brings him home afterwards. Wow!
What a trial she is going through.  We are happy that Shellie still has her
testimony and goes to church, when Roy and her sons don’t.  Garrett is
struggling some too, but Nora is strong, thank goodness.  We thought Garrett
was so strong too and he used to be, sure hope he is doing okay now.  Roy came
home for dinner, so we ended our call.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Shellie texted me to tell me that Jase has
spring break from March 10<sup>th</sup> to the 17<sup>th</sup>.  I texted back
saying “Okay, that is when we will come.  Does Roy want us to come?  If he
doesn’t, then we better stay home.  Both he and dad need to be okay with it,
and both need to try hard to make us all have a good time together.  We maybe
just better stay a week.”  I sent another text soon after saying: “I’m sorry I
really want to see and be with you and your family, so hopefully both husbands
will be okay with it.  I will talk to dad, but I know he wants to come as he
was asking me when we were going.  We have always had a great time together in
the past, but I guess it was more than dad could take at that time, to think
his strongest child was leaving the church too.  We are both so thankful that
you aren’t, and we can understand why you were having a rough time last year. 
I hope you can forgive us for the mistakes we have made in the past.  We are
human, but we have always loved and cared about you.”  She texted back and
said: “I’ll talk to Roy.  When I go to Utah, I like to go for two weeks cuz the
drive is so long.  I know last year Roy was thinking it was nuts that you left
our beautiful weather after only a week when it was snowing in Utah, so I think
he’ll agree that you ought to come for two weeks.  He did want me to make sure
dad understood he’s not to pout while he’s here, but as long as we all treat
each other with respect, Roy’s usually a great host.  We had a wonderful time
with Gary and Sandi, and Gary sounds pretty excited to come back again.”<b>  </b></p>

align=left hspace=12><b>ARIZONA VACATION</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On March 9<sup>th</sup>, we left for our vacation to
Shellie, Roy &amp; family’s home in Arizona.  Ken got home at 12:15PM and we
got away at 12:30PM.  Ken drove until we got past Provo and then switched and
let me drive while Ken took a nap.  He slept for over an hour then we switched
again.  We called the Class’s before getting to St. George and they met us at
the Golden Corral where we enjoyed eating dinner and visiting.  We then
followed them to their home.  We enjoyed our visit with Maggie and Bill, and
then Maggie put a cartoon DVD on the TV.  Ken was dozing off so Maggie offered
him a blanket and within seconds he was out.  When the show ended we soon went
to bed.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            Billie cooked us a wonderful breakfast.  We pack
the car and left at 9AM<b>.  With the use of the GPS we found Tammy
Braithwaite’s home.</b>  We were just a little concerned as to what reception
we might get, but when Tammy opened the door, she just starred for a few
seconds and then throw her arms around me and we both just cried.  We had a
wonderful visit with Tammy leaving there just before noon.  Before getting on
the freeway we fueled up the car and got us a Hot Dog for lunch.  From St.
George we drove straight through to Chandler with just a stop to switch driver,
so Ken could take a nap.  We arrived there at 6:30PM in time for dinner.  We visited,
and Roy and Ken argued some and I was worried about how this vacation would
turn out and I wondered if we should have come.  We soon went to bed. I prayed
it and it went okay the rest of the time between them.  I talked to Ken and
Shellie must have talked to Roy.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We slept well getting up about 7AM.  <b>After breakfast
Shellie &amp; I dressed in cute medieval dresses that Shellie had made for us.
Wow, both she and Sandi are so talented in about everything.  They surely amaze
me. Shellie had told me by phone to come a day earlier so she could take Maggie
and I to the Renaissance Festival</b>.  She paid for our $20 tickets.  Shellie
and I got on our way and stopped to pick up Maggie at Garrett &amp; Nora’s cute
home.  Nora fixed Shellie’s hair and I looked around their cute home and played
with Maggie &amp; Damon. We then went to the Renaissance up by Apache
Junction.  It was great, and we had such a good time.  The only problem was it
was “hot”. It was in the high 90’s and it is supposed to be in the “70’s” in
March in Arizona. It was still fun, and I sure enjoyed being with Shellie &amp;
Maggie.  Maggie was so cute and so good.  Shellie spoiled her by buying her
fairy wings to go with the cute costume she had bought for Maggie to wear.  She
also bought her a cute ceramic fairy and other things.  There were all kinds of
things to see, food to buy and things to do there depicting the Renaissance
period of time.  They had a lot of entertainment including Jousting performed
by a theater group.  It really looked authentic.  Ken later told me that he
didn’t have a great day, that he had gone with Roy &amp; Quint to the park where
Roy and Quint flew Roy’s drone.  He said that Roy didn’t even offer to let him
fly the drone.  Shortly after returning home Roy and Quint went bike riding. 
He felt uncomfortable around Roy, so glad they left.  He watched a John Wayne
movie, and after getting himself some lunch, he took Jase with him to get
frozen yogurts.  When they returned home, Roy and Quint were playing video
games on the TV and Jase went to doing his thing on his computer.   He said he
got himself some more leftover Lasagna and waited for Shellie &amp; I to
return.  He wasn’t very happy when I got there as he didn’t expect us to be so
long.  It was about 8:30 pm after taking Maggie to her home and then getting
back here.</p>

align=left hspace=12>            After a good breakfast that Shellie made, Ken,
Shellie and I attended Block Meeting this morning but no one else attended. 
This is sure a heart ache for us..  Mike is the only one of our children that
is active in the church now although Shellie is trying but does not have her
spouses support.  This evening Quint and Roy got quite involved in a discussion
of the future of the earth and the destiny of man.  Ken said he wanted to yell
at them “Where is your faith in the Gospel?” but he just remained silent and
went into the other room.  Garrett, Nora, Maggie and Demon came over this
evening and had dinner with us.  It was sure good to be with them, but there
again Nora is trying to stay active, but Garrett is doubting his faith.  He
still goes to church with Nora and the kids and has a calling, thank goodness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were late getting up but what a beautiful
morning.   Shellie, Ken and I played Rummy Cube for a while.  It has been a
very relaxing day.  After dinner this evening we watched a show on DVD titled
“The Express” a show taken from a true event.  An African American, Ernie Davis
in the early 1920’s chose to become a Foot Ball Player and succeeded to be a
Huysmans Trophy winner.  Though he succeeded in football the sad thing is that
at age 23 he dies of Leukemia.  It was a good show although occasionally
profanity came out and especially the Lords name was used in vain.  We were late
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in late and had a late breakfast. 
After getting up, Ken and I enjoyed breakfast on the patio.  Shellie had gone
for a bike ride before we got up.  This afternoon Ken, Shellie and I took our
car to a car wash and then we went groceries shopping.  After returning home
the three of played Three Handed Rook at which I won.  This evening we all
watched “Man from Snowy River” before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I got up about 8AM and went for a walk. 
The citrus is out in blossom and they sure smell good!  It looks like there are
so many trees that the fruit is just being left to spoil and fall off.  Anyway,
we had a enjoyable walk to start the day.  Ken has worked on “Indexing church
records” some while we have been here.  Shellie, Ken and I went shopping at
Wal-Mart, then to Home Depot so that Shellie could give me some ideas about
painting the exterior of our home.  We then went over to a Frozen Yogurt store
and enjoyed eating a treat there.  Most meals are enjoyed eating on the back
patio and in the evenings, we usually watch a movie before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After breakfast and straightening the house,
Shellie, Ken and I played some table games.  I have been getting calls from the
Hilton’s nurse, Fran, Harold’s daughter, Rae and others. Evelyn &amp; Harold
Hilton don’t seem to be doing very well but at this time Fran, Millie at
Woodcrest Rehab and Rae are working on getting them a State Appointed Guardian,
get them on Medicaid and into an assisted living facility.  That will be good. 
This afternoon we watched the movie “How to Steal a Million” and then before
going to bed we watched the movie “Book Thief”.  Both movies were very good. 
Jase cooked dinner this evening of Hamburgers.  He seems to quite enjoy doing
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As normal it is a beautiful morning in Arizona
and the weather is very nice.  Ken called to see how Roy is doing.  He told him
that Tita flew back to the Philippines yesterday so that she can be home when
she dies.  It is sad but as he said, “There is not anything you can do, but accept
it.  Roy, Shellie, Ken and I played Sequence this evening before watching the
movie “The Martian”, which we quite enjoyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I got up early so that Shellie and I could go to
the Swap Meet in Apache Junction. We met Shellie &amp; Georgia’s friend “Roche”
and her mom there.  There were 4 large warehouses with tables set up on each
side of the walkway with all different things to buy.  Nora called and asked if
she and the kids could join us, and they did.  We had a good time and were
there from 8 until noon.  We then met Garrett at Crown Burger and Shellie paid
for our lunch.  Ken asked Jase if he wanted to go fishing, but Jase didn’t want
to.  We thought he would be excited to go fishing on the lake with Grandpa
again this year, but since he has “Asperger Syndrome”, he isn’t very social and
mainly wants to do “Mindcraft” and “Blenders” on the computer when he isn’t
doing his school work.  Garrett, Nora &amp; the kids followed us to Shellie
&amp; Roy’s home.  Nora loves to play games to so we decided to play “Hand
&amp; Foot”.  We asked Roy, Quint &amp; Garrett if they wanted to play with
us.  They really didn’t want to, but wanted to make us happy so they played one
hand of it and then quit to play video games on the TV. So the rest of us
played it.  Nora put the Maggie &amp; Damon down to sleep as Shellie has
pajamas for them and tooth brushes, so they usually do this so they can stay
later.  They stayed until late, but after they left Roy and Quint made some
popcorn and Shellie put the animated show “Moana” on to watch.   Ken and I had
seen it at Maggie &amp; Billie Klass”s home so we ate some popcorn and watched
part of it, then went to bed as it was late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were up about 7:30AM and started getting
ready for meetings.  After a wonderful breakfast, we got ready and Shellie,
Jase, Ken and I attended church.  Following Sacrament meeting Shellie took Jase
home.  Following meetings, the three of us set in the car and visited for a
while.  Shellie is so concerned at to what she should be doing.  Her family is
falling away from church activity and Roy is resenting any encouragement from
Shellie.  He won’t participate in prayer, attendance of meetings or any church
activity.  He won’t encourage any of his boys in their church participation. 
He leaves total responsibility for helping Jase with church or school activity
and most of his activities up to Shellie.  We have to be careful with advice as
it has backfired in the past.  We sure do sympathize with her, however, and
wish things could be better.  She does feel that she was supposed to marry Roy
as she had fasted &amp; prayed about it and had a good feeling.  So, she says
she will just love him and her boys and make the best of it.  We sure hope she
can.  This evening Shellie prepared a wonderful dinner.  She invited Roy’s
parents over to join us for dinner.  We enjoyed the evening visiting and we
played a game of “Mormon Bridge” in which on the last hand, Ken won.  After
Roy’s parents left, we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I didn’t sleep very well last night, but that’s
par for the course some nights.  Garrett, Nora and their children came over for
a couple of hours.  They sure have a cute family, but we sure feel badly that
Garrett has become discouraged and weakening in his testimony.  It is sure
discouraging as we watch so many of our family who are losing their testimonies
of the Gospel.  Nora, Shellie, Ken and I played some table games, while Roy,
Garrett &amp; Quint played video games and visited. At night we watched another
movie before Garrett, Nora and children went home.  It is great to be with all
this family which we don’t get to be with often.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After breakfast, Shellie, Ken and I played a
couple of games of Rummikub and Ken won.  Usually it is Shellie that is so
quick to recognize a play and most of the time she wins.   Shellie &amp; I went
shopping.  Ken had a headache so took some Tylenol and took a nap.  This
afternoon Ken and I helped Shellie with preparations for dinner in which she
had invited a Rockel and her parents over.  The dinner was wonderful, and we
enjoyed the evening getting to know them.  Lyle, the father, especially enjoyed
the tricks that Shellie has taught Tasha, Shellie’s dog, to do.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After breakfast, we played a couple of games
again and then went shopping at Smart &amp; Final for groceries and to Home
Depot for light bulbs.  We went for lunch at Schlotzsky’s where they serve
great sandwiches on special buns.  This afternoon the three of us again played
table games.  This evening Jase grilled hamburgers for dinner.  He seems to
really enjoy grilling.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken and I got up and got ready to go to the
Gilbert Temple this morning.  However, I hadn’t put his temple socks in his
suitcase nor his white tie.  Knowing that the Gilbert Temple doesn’t have
clothing to rent we called to see if they had just those two items.  They
didn’t but told us that there was a Distribution store in the Deseret Book
store that we could purchase those items.  However, as we thought about that we
realized that the store wouldn’t open until at least 10AM.  We wanted to be
back to Roy and Shellie’s before 1PM as Roy and Shellie have a salesman coming
at 1PM to show them a program about changing their windows in the home.  Ken
wanted to be there to see what was being offered.  We, therefore, went to the
Mesa Temple and rented those items there.  We enjoyed the session and then we had
time to eat lunch in the Temple cafeteria, something else the Gilbert Temple
does not have.  When we looked at the menu Ken noticed that they had Frozen
Yogurt and ordered some. We had a nice dinner.  The salesman came shortly after
we got back.  Their windows were impressive, but Roy and Shellie decided
against doing it right now.  This afternoon we watched the show “Australia”
which was pretty good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This morning Ken, Shellie and I went to the Swap
Meet where we bought more than we had planned.  On the way home we stopped at
the Frozen Yogurt shop for a treat, which we especially enjoy.  After getting
home, Roy’s sister, Cindy her husband Dug and some of their daughter came
over.  We visited with them and ended up getting the paddle boat and kayak boats
out for them to use.  After Cindy’s family left, Ken and I took the paddle boat
out for a few minutes.  Roy soon got home, and Roy took us out to eat. 
Garrett, Nora, Maggie and Damon also met us at Home Town Buffet, and we sure
enjoyed being with them also.  Roy had stopped by a window dealer to look at
their window replacements.  They gave him a sample and after getting home from
dinner we looked at what might be done to install them.  Ken and I went to bed
about 11PM.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             When we woke, Ken asked me what I thought about
the idea of him telling Roy that if he decided to install the windows rather
than have them installed; he (Ken, &amp; I) would be willing to stay another
week and cut the old windows out.  We then went down to a neighbor that had had
the windows installed.  After a little more figuring and discussing it with
Shellie &amp; Roy, they decided to have the windows installed for them.  They
were impressed that Ken would offer to do this for them and thanked him, but
said that they didn’t want him to have to do that for them.  We spent most of
the day playing games with Shellie.  Ken did help Roy with the installation of
a light and made suggestions on three other lights that he will still install
later.  This evening we watched a show on DVD before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended meetings this morning and Roy &amp;
Jase went with us as their friend’s son was speaking as he had just returned
from his mission. After coming home and having lunch, Roy, Shellie, Ken and I
took the boats out on the lake for a little while.  Afterwards we played a
couple of table games. This afternoon Garrett and his family came over for
dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, March 27, 2017</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up about 7AM and started packing to go
home.  Quint and Jase also helped us carry our bags out to the car.  Shellie prepared
breakfast for us, and we enjoyed eating on the patio for the last time.  We
have sure enjoyed that privilege and the beauty of their backyard.  We got away
about 10AM, stopping for gas.  We drove to Flagstaff where we filled up with
gas.  I drove from there and let Ken take a nap.  At the Gap we traded places. 
We stayed at the Motel 6 in Page as Judy called us a couple of days ago and
said that she was quite sick.  We went down to Wal Mart where we bought some
chicken and a couple of other items for our dinner.  These we ate while we
watched a show on TV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left this morning before 10AM and ate left
over from last night as we drove, Ken and I traded back and drove as we
traveled to American Fork.  We visited with Mike, Becky &amp; the girls for a while,
and then Mike and Becky prepared a very nice dinner of grilled steak with the
trimmings. Paige came, but Garrett didn’t as he wasn’t feeling the best.  It is
Jessie’s birthday. After dinner, we said our good-byes and drove on home
getting there after 9:30PM.  We did some unpacking, reset the clocks for
Daylight Savings time and went to bed, tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>SIBLING &amp; SPOUSE GET TOGETHER – JUNE 17, 2017</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was our turn to host my siblings/spouse get together
which we have every three months.  Kim &amp; Jeanenne are on their mission to
South Africa, so of course, they were not here, but the rest of us were – Bryce
&amp; Deanna, Terry &amp; Angela, Georgia &amp; Rick and Ken &amp; I.  I made
twice cooked potatoes, mixed vegetables, fruit salad, tossed salad, my delicious
cake/Danish desert/strawberry desert, and I bought &amp; warmed up the rolls.
Ken grilled big trout, chicken breasts and steaks.  We enjoyed visiting as we ate,
and we sat at the table quite a while and kept visiting, then us ladies went
into the living room where we continued to visit and the guys went out on our
patio and played games on the patio table &amp; chairs as it was cooler out
there.  Then we all got together and played Mormon Bridge and Catch Phase.  It
was an enjoyable day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Surprise Time:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I used to like to surprise the children with a small gift or
treat.  I would hide it behind my back and go into the room where the children
were and say &quot;Surprise Time&quot;  They would close their eyes and hold
out their hands and I would put the gift or treat in their hands and then they
could open their eyes.  They were always happy when they saw the treat and were
appreciative.  I've always liked to do special things for my special children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Put up your dukes:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the children would argue, quarrel or fight, sometimes I
would go to them and say &quot;Put up your dukes&quot; and I would dance around
them with my hands quenched and being in a boxing position.  They would usually
start laughing and this would end the quarrel.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I tried all different methods to have peace in our home.  I
liked this one the best.  Sometimes I would send them to their rooms, sometimes
I had them sit on the couch or a chair, sometimes I would have them apologize
to each other, sometimes I would lecture them.  I tried all different ways. 
Sometimes, I lost my temper and I didn't like myself when I did that, and I
would try to go back to them afterwards and apologize and explain the problem
we had and how we should have handled it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tucking the children in at bedtime:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I always liked to tuck the children in at bedtime, give them
a hug &amp; kiss, tell them I loved them and to sleep well.  When I was growing
up I always wanted my mother to do this for me, but I don't remember her doing
so.  I would usually go to her and give her a hug and go off to bed alone. 
That isn't such a terrible thing, and I knew Mom loved me, but I always wanted
to be tucked in.  When we were living in Idaho and Mike was a Junior in High
School and David a Sophomore, they still liked me to tuck them in.  Ken's mom
was visiting us at one time, and David yelled up &quot;Aren’t you coming to
tuck us in, Mom?&quot;  I called back &quot;I'll be right down&quot;.  Ken's
mom said &quot;Oh, those boys are too big to be tucked in, you shouldn't have
to go down those steps and tuck them in at night.&quot;  I said to her
&quot;Mom, as long as they want me to tuck them in, I will be glad to do it. 
That's the time when I get to talk to them and express my love for them.&quot; 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>12 days of Christmas;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second Christmas when we lived in Firth, Idaho
was one of the hardest (financially) for us.  Ken had been very successful as a
building contractor.  With just word of mouth, he was kept very busy with
building new homes, &amp; remodeling<b><u> </u></b>others.  He had work
scheduled for several months ahead and had to turn work down.  We were very
blessed, but when November came and the farmers found out that the potatoes in
their cellars were spoiling because of frost when they were harvested, and they
would have to throw all of them out, many went bankrupt, and others were
holding on just by a thread as this was the 3rd year in a row that they had
crop failure.  All of a sudden, Ken was without work.  The people could no
longer afford to build new homes or remodel old ones.  Ken called other
contractors to see if they had work and they did not, many were leaving the
state.  I could see as Christmas drew near that we were not going to have a
very big Christmas.  I had purchased a few gifts earlier on sale as I usually
do each year, but it still wasn't very much.  I wondered what to do, and
finally decided to purchase small gifts or treats for each of the children and
do the 12 days of Christmas for them - to make this Christmas special even
though they would not receive much on Christmas Day.  Each day just before they
came home from school, I would put a small gift or treat on their pillow with a
note.  It was fun to watch them.  The first day, one of the children went to
their room and happened to find the treat, was excited and came out eating it. 
When the others saw it, they asked where he got it.  When he told them, they
ran to their rooms and were excited to find the treat.  From that day on, each
day they were excited to go to their rooms when they got home from school to
see what was there.  It brought fun, and happiness into our home and joy to me
to see my children happy.  I feel the Lord inspired me to do this as I had
prayed to him about Christmas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Waking up the Children in the Mornings:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many mornings to wake the children up, I would go into their
room singing &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning, How are you this Morning.  Good
Morning, Good Morning to you.&quot;  or &quot;Good Morning to you, Good morning
to you.  We're all in our places with Sunshiny faces, oh this is the way to
start a new day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the children were easier to wake up than others. 
Some I would have to call several times and others, especially, Scott, woke up
usually on their own.  If Scott didn't wake on his own, I would only have to
call him once.  I know, from experience, that they liked me to wake them gently
and show love.  Sandi, for example, asked that I not have Larina wake her in
the mornings as she was unkind to her.  Jeff, on occasion asked that I sing as
I woke him.  I wasn't a good singer, in fact, it was usually funny, but most of
them liked it anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Children’s Days:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was at Relief Society one day when we lived in Ogden and a
friend was sharing how she had “Children’s Days” and she explained that she
would spend at least one hour and longer if she could, with each of her
children on a different day.  The older children would tend the younger
children while she spend a one-on-one time with each of her children doing what
they wanted to do.  I wanted to incorporate that into my children’s lives.  I
was just starting our family at that time so we had Sandy and Shellie.  As we
had more children, I kept trying to do this.  They would each have their day of
the week (not the weekends when Ken was home) and I would spend at least one
hour with that child.  Sometimes the boys wanted to go exploring, play marbles
or other games, go bike riding, go get an ice cream cone, or go for a walk. 
With the girls, they wanted to ride bikes, play barbies or other games, go for
walks, get ice cream, make cookies, etc.  I enjoyed this time as much as they
did, and I felt it was important as we could have good talks sometimes while
having their day and I could find out if they were concerned about friends,
school or other things and they could also share the things that made them
happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>MAE'S FAVORITES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FAVORITE SONG:  &quot;LOVE AT HOME&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FAVORITE COLOR:  PINK</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FAVORITE SCRIPTURE:  1 NEPHI 3:7  &quot;I will go and do the
things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no
commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them
that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FAVORITE DAY OF THE WEEK:  Sunday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I look forward to Sunday to rest from the daily cares of the
world and focus on the Lord and the blessings he has given me.  I enjoy going
to church, feasting on the good word of the Lord, &amp; taking the Sacrament. 
I enjoy relaxing &amp; being with our family on this special day.  My mother
taught me to wear a dress or skirt &amp; blouse on this day - which shows more
respect to the Lord.  I am thankful for her example and I do dress up some
instead of being in my casual clothes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Some have said Keeping the Sabbath Day Holy is
one of the most important commandments to observe.  I sometimes worry that I
have not fully taught our children the importance of strictly obeying this
commandment.  They observe this day as the Lord's, some of them more than
others, but I wish all of them would realize the important of studying the
scriptures and pondering them on this day, and of doing all that the Lord would
want us to do on his day.  I would hope that they all would realize that there
are 6 other days to clean, do laundry, press clothes, go to the store, go to
places of recreation, watch TV, etc.  <b>I need to practice what I preach and I
don’t always observe the Sabbath as strictly as I should and I need to do
better. I am trying harder.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So let the sunshine in, say it with a grim, so open up your

<p class=MsoNormal>            My parents are expecting their mission call
today, June 30, 1979.  I've written most of my life story as I've lived it, but
now I'm typing it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dad &amp; Mom went to the Boston, Massachusetts Mission. 
They loved it there in many ways, but because of the roads, turnabouts &amp;
traffic, it was easy for dad to get lost, so they went with the young Elders
some of the time.  Mom &amp; Dad did convert at least two families and they
stayed friends with them.  They also became great friends of a lady whose
husband had passed away and she had a terrible phobia that she couldn’t leave her
highrise apartment.  She had too much anxiety, so mom &amp; dad would get her
groceries, pay her bills, get her medicine, etc.  This lady loved my parents,
especially mom.  Everyone loved mom and dad too as they are great people and
love the Lord and his children.  This lady wanted to join the church and be
sealed to her husband, so asked Mom if she would have hers and her husband’s
work done after she passed away.  They didn’t have any children.  Mom and this
lady would call each other frequently and when this lady passed away, Mom kept
her promise and got the work ready and Ken and I went to the temple for mom to
act as proxies for this good sister and her husband.  Mom had woman problems,
while on her mission, and had to have a hysterectomy and other surgery.  They
felt this was a blessing from the Lord as the Mayo Clinic is in Boston, so Mom
had good care.  While mom was recuperating, she could make phone calls and set
up appointments for dad and the young Elders.  Mom &amp; Dad set a great
example for their family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Fish Lake by Zion’s Canyon</b> - when we went with our
family (Shellie, Roy &amp; family went also).  We had never been to Fish Lake,
but heard it had beautiful campgrounds and a beautiful lake.  I’m not sure if
it is the same Fish Lake that we go to now with Sandi &amp; Nick.  If it was,
we missed the campgrounds and ended up in some mountains north of the lake and
it was not very pretty and not a good camp site, but we had fun anyway.  I
don’t think we even went to the lake as we didn’t have a boat at that time. 
One day we found a skunk in camp, so we all took off for a walk hoping that
when we got back, it would be gone.  We had mice climbing all over in our tent
trailer at night, so that wasn’t fun. Ken and I had to go into the nearest town
to get some Decon to kill the mice.  We took some of the kids and their spouses
in the back of our truck to the narrows at Zion’s Canyon.  They had a fun time.
We watched the grandchildren.  We didn’t have a desire to go to Fish Lake again
until Nick wanted us to go there.  We are glad he did as we have loved it, so I
don’t think it was the same Fish Lake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Betsy Browning, Ken’s nephew, Devin’s wife, loves Family
History.  She has put in so much time, and has done so much for the Browning
lines and her lines.  There is a park, west of the train via dock, where she
was able to get the original Steven Abiel Browning’s home (Ken’s grandfather)
and put it in this park</b>.  She told us about all the interesting things
there and how beautiful it is.  She takes people on tours there, so we set it
up for her to take our family on a tour there.  I should have written this down
earlier as I don’t remember how many of our family went. It seems like David’s,
Scott’s and Jeff’s families went.  We went on a Saturday and took our lunch. 
It was beautiful there with lots of tall trees.  There was an Indian village
with the teepees and clothes they wore and items they used.  I think we all
enjoyed the time we spent there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Events at Tabernacle and Conference Center in Salt Lake –

Kathleen Clark went with us to a Christmas Concert at the Conference Center and
afterwards we walked around the temple grounds to see the beautiful Christmas
lights.  We also did that with Ken’s brother, Roy, and his wife, Linda one year
when they were up visiting from California where they live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>REUNIONS:</span>   </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Hill Reunions</b> (Ken’s family) These were usually held in
the canyon above Victor, Idaho<b>.  </b>Each family had their own campsite, but
there was a big area with logs around a fire pit where we met for our campfire
programs.  They usually asked me or Jackie to lead them in some songs and Ken’s
mom and her siblings would tell memories of growing up with their parents. 
Sometimes they had a talent night around the campfire and I remember Uncle
Irven &amp; Aunt Bernice doing “Hole in the Bucket, Dear Lisa, Dear Lisa”. 
They were dressed up in hill billy clothes and Uncle Irven had a bucket with a
hole in it.  I remember Uncle Albert telling stories.  We always enjoyed being
together and Ken and his cousins were glad to see each other again as they had
grown up together and stayed at each other’s homes during the summers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Browning Reunions – </b>The first Browning reunion that I
went to was held shortly after Ken and I were married and was held at the park
in Pocatello, Idaho.  These first reunions were the Steven Abiel Browning Reunion
(Ken’s grandfather, who he never knew in this life, Charles’s father) When we
got there, dad Browning’s children, from his first marriage were all there with
their families and Cleo came up to me and gave me a hug and said “Welcome to
our family, Mae.”  He was old enough to be my father, but here he was Ken’s
half-brother.  Dad Browning’s children from his first marriage are Geneva whose
husband was Clyde.  Geneva was about the same age as Margaret, Charles’s second
wife and Ken’s mother.  Cleo was the next oldest and his wife was Norma.
Florence, they called her Floss and her husband Keith, and Richard, everyone
calls him “Rich” and Lois.  Rich and Lois are the ones we have been close with,
but the others are all wonderful people who have raised wonderful families. 
They have all both since passed away, except Lois, as I am writing this in
2013.  Anyway, we had a great time getting acquainted.  It was just an
afternoon reunion.  We all brought food and shared it and we took family
pictures.  Ken’s sister, Margaret, had gone to the restroom at the park and no
one realized she was missing when we took the pictures and when she came back
and found out we had already taken the pictures without her, she was very upset
and went off by herself.  Ken’s mom ran to her, but she couldn’t be consoled
and thought we had done it on purpose.  Why would anyone do that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had other Browning Reunions held at the park
in Pocatello.  I don’t remember a lot about those other than Ken’s second
cousin, Kay browning and his wife were there.  They are great people and they
live in Sunset.  He was an Allstate Insurance salesman.  .Also, there were
those I did know which were Rich, Lois &amp; their family, Roy, Linda &amp;
their family, Irven, Sandy &amp; their family and our family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Charles Browning Reunions</b> - We hosted a Browning
Reunion at our home when we lived in Firth, Idaho as we had five acres there so
there was plenty of room  for tents, etc.  We played relay games, and other
games, had lots of activities for everyone, good food, and lots of visiting. 
Irven &amp; Sandy hosted one at their home in Goshen also.  We didn’t have them
for a couple of years and then Irven &amp; Sandy hosted one up a canyon in Salt
Lake, I believe.  Lots of the family came.  That’s the time I mainly grew to
know Larry, Ken’s nephew, who is older than Ken.  He is Cleo &amp; Norma’s
son.  Ken said that one time he was with Larry and they ran into Larry’s
friends and Larry introduced Ken to them as his “Uncle Ken” and he was much
younger and smaller than they were.  He said he was embarrassed.  Again we had
lots of good food, visiting and evening programs around the campfire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The next three or more years, the reunions were
held at Ken’s niece, Carla and her husband, Craig’s home in Victor as they had
a large home with huge lawns.  Most of us came on Friday night, stayed the
night either in their home or in tents on their lawn and the next day was
filled with good food, laughter, visiting, games, etc.  It’s always good to be
with family.  We haven’t had a Browning Reunion since that time.  Irven &amp;
Sandy were talking to their daughter, Christine, and she knew of an area where
we could have one, but she was too busy this year and so were all of us, so we
didn’t have one. Linda cornered David this summer and asked if he would head
one up.  He said everyone would have to help him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>BUSHNELL REUNIONS:  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My mother was the first of her family to get a reunion going
for her parents and Mom’s siblings and their families, a Bushnell Reunion.  I
remember helping her with it and we held it at the Sunset Park, just below Mom
&amp; Dad’s property in Sunset, Utah.  The family came on Friday and part
stayed with Uncle June &amp; Aunt Marilyn in Bountiful, some stayed with
Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell and some stayed at our home.  The next day was spent
at the park with good food, games and activities and a talent show in the
evening.  After church we had a great meal and then we had family pictures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             The family decided to hold the reunions every
three years.  Since Mom is the oldest of Grandpa &amp; Grandma’s children and
she held the first reunion, they decided to go to the next oldest, which was
Uncle Elmo and his family would do the reunion in three years.  It was held in
Tropic at the park.  Many brought tents and were able to pitch the tents on the
lawn at the park.  They had a log building at the park and we held some of our
activities there.  One that this family added was a family auction, where every
family was supposed to make at least one or more items to sell at the auction
and the money would be used to help with reunions.  Koye and Keela helped their
parents.  We all had lots of fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Uncle Van was a professor at the college in
Cedar City and the college owned property and a lodge up Cedar Canyon.  The
faculty were able to reserve it, so that is where we held most of our Bushnell
Reunions after that until it was our turn again.  Uncle Farrell had passed away
and Aunt Joyce, his wife, didn’t want the responsibility of doing a Bushnell
Reunion, so it skipped to Aunt Joy and their family held it there at the lodge
in Cedar Canyon.  Uncle Van’s family was the host family for the next reunion
and of course, he held it there.  It had plenty of space for RV’s, tent
trailers, tents and the lodge had a nice large room with a fireplace, a
kitchen, bathrooms and a few bedrooms – some downstairs and some upstairs, so
that generation stayed in the lodge.  Uncle Van loved a big breakfast with
pancakes, bacon, eggs &amp; juice and the lodge had big grills to cook on.  We
had the same things as the other reunions with the auction, talent show and
other activities and good food.  I think Uncle Van had some of the meals
catered.  I know he did at the later reunion they were over and held there. 
Jeff, Chad &amp; Brady were just little guys at that reunion and we have a cute
picture of the three of them together as they came back from climbing partway
up the mountain.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Uncle June’s family helped our family put on one
reunion and we added colored T shirts. A different color for each family and it
said, “Bushnell Reunion” and the date on the back of the shirts.  Uncle June’s
family was over the T shirts and helped us with other activities, especially
the auction.   That’s the only reunion I remember Uncle June’s family doing. 
They were planning on doing one six years ago, but they were going to do it
together with Uncle Farrell’s family.  Aunt Joyce had passed away and so had
Dwaite, their only son, but Pat &amp; Bonnie said they would do it.  The two
families had problems as Uncle June’s family, Paula &amp; Nancy mainly, wanted to
have it in Idaho, but Pat &amp; Bonnie wanted to hold it in Meadow at the park
and church there.  I guess Paula &amp; Nancy became so upset about it, that
they just said to themselves, then let them do it themselves and they didn’t
come to the reunion, none of Uncle June’s family did.  Uncle June had passed
away by this time too.  Pat &amp; Bonnie hosted the reunion in Meadow.  They
had wonderful meals with a big breakfast like Uncle Van and everyone likes. 
They changed things some, they had Uncle Van take us on a tour to the white
sands and the warms springs where Mom and all her siblings were baptized.  She
had Uncle Van and Aunt Joy tell us about their lives and what they did here in
Meadow as they were growing up.  They then turned it over to all of us if any of
us wanted to tell memories of being with grandpa and grandma.  We did have a
wonderful time and they did a great job of hosting it, but we all felt bad
about the problem and that Uncle June’s family didn’t attend.  I don’t think
they attended the one which Keela hosted in 2009 either, so Uncle Van asked me
if our family could host the next reunion and they would do the following one. 
He asked me if I would make a special effort to get Uncle June’s family to our
reunion including Uncle June children from his first marriage –  Danny &amp;
Kristy’s family.  Danny had passed away recently with a heart attack, so I
called his wife, Ann and talked to her.  She was nice, but said they wouldn’t
be coming.  There are problems with that family as Danny &amp; Kristy were not
included in Uncle June’s will and Danny was very close to his dad and would
visit him often, yet his second wife’s children – Paula &amp; Nancy and his
children by his second wife, Steve &amp; Jana, got everything.  This was very
hard on Danny and also his sister Kristy.  They and their families don’t want
anything to do with the other family now.  I think that is so sad.  I don’t
know why Uncle June didn’t include Danny &amp; Kristy.  I guess Uncle June has
had to face Danny now that they are both dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Mom was still alive when it was our turn to put
on another Bushnell Reunion.  We decided to have it up our way since it had
been down in Southern Utah for several times.  Mom knew a lady who had a ranch
up past Huntsville.  They rented it out for family reunions I helped Mom a lot
with this reunion.  She got the place and helped me plan some of it, but I was
mainly in charge and felt the responsibility of it.  Ken, Mom and I went up to
the ranch to look at it and I was excited as there was plenty of room for RV’s,
trailers, tent trailers, tents, etc.  It had a covered cooking area with
grills, etc. It had a pond with canoes.  It had corrals where we could have a
children’s rodeo.  They had a large covered pavilion where we ate and visited,
and Sandi taught line dancing to most of us and the older ones sat around and
watched.   It had a huge shade tent where we visited, and had programs.  I was
able to contact a man who belonged to a group which loved Mountain Men, so they
had the costumes, rifles, etc. and he came and demonstrated everything
including Indian memorabilia.  He told us all about the Mountain Men.  He was
very good.  The couple told us that he could take whoever wanted on a wagon
pulled by horses, up the mountain and around the ranch.  I contacted all my aunts,
uncles &amp; cousins and asked them to write a paragraph or a page telling
about their family and send it to me as I was making a book with all this
information and I added camp and other old songs for us to sing, histories of
Grandpa and Grandma, etc.  We did a Dutch Oven Dinner for the Saturday night
meal.  Sandi was still married to Dave at that time and he is great cooking
Dutch oven meals, so he was a big help.  Sandi was right there alongside him
doing tons too.  All our family helped with the meals and other assignments I
gave them.  I was worried about one main thing and that was if it rained, it
would wash out the dirt road leading up to the ranch as it was up a hill.  We
kept praying for good weather for the reunion and it was.  I was very grateful. 
The reunion was a success and everyone had a great time.  I was glad, but
relieved that it was over as it had been a lot of work and worry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bushnell Reunion in August of 2009 – </b>Uncle Van asked
Keela if she would host this reunion so since her and Pete own the Trail Canyon
Rides into Grand Canyon, Zion’s and Bryce’s Canyon and have land to raise the
feed for the horses and mules, she decided to have the reunion on that land. 
They had built a nice, large barn, cabins and a nice grassy area for volleyball,
etc.  The barn has a stage and tables all around the outside with chairs, so
the chairs can be moved into the center for people when entertainment and
programs are being presented on the stage.  Keela has decorated the barn so
cute with even a buggy hung up above the stage.  She has red and white
checkered tablecloths on the tables.  They have 25 cute log cabins with
porches.  They built all these as they have people from all around the world
come here and stay for a week and each day they take them to different trail
rides, then bring them back for wonderful catered dinners and entertainment. 
She did a great job hosting this reunion and gave family members free rides
into Bryce Canyon.  She had crafts, games, wonderful meals, etc.  We had a
wonderful three-day reunion. The only ones from our family who went were Ken
and I, Sandi &amp; Nick and David, Shauna and their family.  We all had a great
time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bushnell Reunion in August of 2012 – The Glendon Porter
Family were to host this reunion</b>, so me and my siblings and spouses were in
charge of it.  Keela had told me at the last reunion that if we wanted, we
could come to Tropic again and have it on her &amp; Pete’s land.  I was excited
as that is one of the main hard things is finding a place to accommodate that
many people.  My siblings, spouses, Ken and I get together every three months
and have dinner, play games, visit, etc.  We take turns hosting it.  With this
reunion coming up, we spent most of a year planning and preparing for it. 
Since I am the oldest, my siblings expect me to take the lead so I did a lot of
planning and making handouts with my ideas prior to us getting together for our
get-to-gathers.  After our dinner, we would spend the time making plans for the
reunion.  They appreciated all the work I had gone to in preparing for it.  I
gave them all a category to choose from.  Deanna &amp; Bryce choose the
children’s activities.  Kim &amp; Jeanenne choose the youth &amp; adult
activities.  Georgia &amp; Rick choose the night activities and Sunday Meeting,
and me and Ken had the meals.  I asked Terry, who lives in Alaska, if he would
also help us by getting the e-mail &amp; other addresses and getting the
information sent out advertising the reunion and encouraging everyone to come. 
I got him the addresses that I had.  He did a fantastic job and I was sure
grateful to him for doing this.  Georgia &amp; Rick with the suggestions of all
of us choose to have a family dance for Friday night and a Talent night for
Saturday night.  We all worked hard, and it turned out great.  I did a lot of
pricing for the foods to get the best deals for the food we would need.  So
when we packed up our camper, we went to Costco, Winco, Macey’s, and the
Hostess thrift store.  Keela and Crystal (her daughter in charge of the trail
rides) still wanted to give the family free three-hour rides into Bryce Canyon,
which was special of them.  Volleyball was a hit and that was going a lot of
the time.  The meals turned out great, with all my siblings &amp; spouses
helping.  I gave them all special assignments.  Other family members helped
too, which was great!  We had 150 in attendance.  I was praying that it
wouldn’t rain during the time of the reunion, and it didn’t.  It started
raining as we were cleaning and packing up to go home.  We had most of our
family come for this reunion, so we had great support.  Sandi, Nick and Sandi’s
daughters, JaNae, Chelci and their husbands and children came.  I think Nick’s
son, Logan, came also.  Shellie, Roy and Jase came.  Quint &amp; Kevis have
jobs so they didn’t come.   Scott, Mishelle and their children came as well as
Jeff, Gail and their children.  David, Shauna and their family didn’t come this
time as David is doing his internship for medical school.  August isn’t a good
time for Mike as he is principal of Orem High and he is in meetings usually
starting the first of August, so they didn’t come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Robinson </b>Reunions in California, Arizona &amp; Idaho. 
These were large reunions. They were several generation reunions.  The main
families lived in California, Arizona and Idaho.  The first one that I remember
going to was held at Max Inn at Island Park.  We all camped in the campgrounds
or stayed at the Max Inn cabins.  Elder LaGrande Richards of the quorum of the
twelve apostles is my dad’s second cousin and dad was able to get him to perform
Ken &amp; my marriage ceremony at the Salt Lake Temple.  He always came to the
Robinson Reunions and at the Sunday Meeting, he would always speak.  Everyone
loved to listen to Elder LaGrande because he told such great stories.  In
conference, when it was time for the speakers to stop, a little red light would
come on, on the pulpit.  I remember him saying “I think this little red light
is trying to tell me that my time is up, but I have one more story to tell
you.”  Everyone would laugh, but be excited to hear another of his stories. 
They were great spiritual experiences.   At the close of his talks at the
reunions, he would tell us that he didn’t know if he would be around for the
next reunion, but he was.  He was getting up in years. They had paddle boats
which you could rent and use on the river which was close by Max Inn.  We
didn’t go to the one in California, but we did to the one in Arizona.  It was
held in the White Mountains area, up where Roy, Shellie’s husband, is from.  It
is much cooler up there.  They had a rodeo, lots of activities, great food.  I
remember all the good corn on the cob, watermelon, etc.  At the last Robinson
Reunion that I remember them holding, was held again at Max Inn.  We were
living with Ken’s Mom in Layton at that time and Shellie was working at Max Inn
as a waitress and also in our friend from Firth’s gift shop.  She was earning
money to go on the “Studies Abroad Program to Israel” which was at the new
Jerusalem Center.  She was able to go with us to the reunion and again Elder
LaGrande spoke and everyone was thankful he was still around to be able to
speak to us again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b> Swallow Reunions</b> held in Meadow<b> – </b> I’m not
sure how many Swallow Reunions they have held, but the one I remember was after
dad had passed away and Mom really wanted to go to see her Aunt Lara and Aunt
Noreen and her cousins.  These reunions were held in Meadow and dad had passed
away, so Bryce and I were able to take her. Georgia and Kim were not able to
nor, nor were our spouses, but we had a great time visiting as we drove down
and back and it was fun to see how happy it made mom to see her relatives on
this side of the family again.  We took pictures of her with them.  It was just
a Saturday Afternoon reunion held at the church.  They had a good dinner and
program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Clark Reunions</b> – usually held in Farmington, Utah in
the old historic rock chapel.  It was the first chapel in Farmington when the
Clarks, my great, great grandfather, Ezra T and his family settled Farmington. 
That is the same chapel where the first primary was organized with ???? as the
president and my grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Robinson (May) was one of her
secretaries.  We still have a letter she wrote to May expressing her sympathy
when May’s mother passed away.  These reunions were well attended, and they had
lots of delicious food too and wonderful programs.  They were just Saturday
afternoon reunions as well.  I remember my dad introducing me to his cousins
and saying, “This is my daughter, Iva Mae, and she is 40 years old.”  After this
happening 2 or 3 times, I said to dad “You can introduce me to your relatives,
but you don’t have to tell them how old I am.”  He replied that I should be
thankful that I am as old as I am that he was 71 and he was thankful he was
that old.”  Now that I am 72, I am thankful that I am as old as I am also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Porter Reunions</b> <b>(Sanford – </b>usually in
Porterville<b> </b>at the church and adjoining park there.  The first ones I
remember going to were great, with lots of people attending.  They had
wonderful food with Sloppy Joes, chips, lots of corn on the cob, watermelon
&amp; cantaloupe, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and lots of delicious salads and
desserts.  This reunion seemed to dwindle down until few were coming.  My
brother, Kim, lives in Morgan and they nominated him for President for the next
year.  He did and tried hard to get more people coming.  He asked me to and
Aunt Beth to tell our experiences of writing the Byron Porter books.  I did the
first one and she did the second one which had more of the Porter ancestors. 
He had a 5K run, but few participants.  He even went to the work of getting T
shirts for each to wear and prizes for the winners.  He asked Ken and I and
Georgia and Rick to help him by being at different stops along the way to give
them cold water and encouragement.  We had good food, Jeanenne had made lots of
barbecue and they had lots left over.  Everyone was to bring salads or
desserts.  Kim had gotten lots of watermelons.  When it came time to nominate a
new president for the next reunion, no one would accept the nomination, so they
asked Kim to take it another year.  He ended up taking it 3 or 4 consecutive
years and now they are on their mission so there wasn’t one this year and I
doubt if it ever happens again.  The older generation has passed away and the
young ones don’t know all the people and they don’t want the responsibility of
taking it on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Byron</b> <b>Porter Reunions</b> held at the West Point
Park in early years &amp; later at Layton Park &amp; Surf &amp; Swim</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Dale was the one who first started these reunions and
he held them at the West Point Park which was just across the street from his
home.  It was a Saturday afternoon reunion also.  We had good food which
everyone helped with.  We had a short program, some played volleyball or
softball while the younger children played at the playground and the older ones
sat in lawn chairs and visited.  Uncle Verle and Aunt Beth held these reunions
at their home in West Point a couple of times also.  They had lots of acreage
and a large old home.  I remember standing around the piano singing with
Georgia and my cousins, mainly girls, while Jeannie, my cousin who is Georgia’s
age, played the piano.  They had a children’s pool for the young ones to play
in, they had volleyball, etc., and lots of good food.  Aunt Beth is a great
cook and makes lots of yummy desserts.  Later, Uncle Dale was able to rent the
Layton Pavilion at the Layton Park and the Surf &amp; Swim.  He paid for it. 
We rotated family turns to host it and reserve the Pavilion and Surf &amp;
Swim, but the money always came from him and still does even after his death. 
He told his kids that he would like this reunion to continue here at the Layton
Park &amp; Surf &amp; Swim as we have lots who come even though many of the
later generations don’t know each other; they bring their families as they can
swim free and have a great meal.  Many sat with their parents and grandparents;
we do too, but us older generation love to visit with our cousins.  We are the
older generation now; our parents have all passed away.  They were all great
people, Grandpa and Grandma Porter raised a wonderful, righteous, humble
family.  They were all great examples and so were their spouses.  Aunt Beth was
the last to go, and she was a “jewel”.  She was a special aunt and one of
Heavenly Father’s choosiest daughters.  It was the Glendon Porter Family’s turn
to host it when we went on our mission to California, but I was able to arrange
with my cousin, Diane, for the checks to reserve the Pavilion and Surf &amp;
Swim for that reunion and had Scott take it and reserve it, since he lives in
Layton and you have to be a resident of Layton to get it for that price.  It is
our turn again.  Wow! Aunt Merlyn’s family has never taken a turn and her two
daughters hardly ever came.  LaDean, the oldest, has passed away so there is
only Lois.  But this next year, it will only be Bryce and I and our spouses and
families to do it since Kim and Jeanenne and Georgia &amp; Rick will be on
their missions and Terry &amp; Angela are still in Alaska.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Glendon Porter Reunions</b> –usually held at <b>Georgia
&amp; Rick’s home</b>.  Georgia &amp; Rick have a beautiful large home with a
large back yard.  It has playground equipment and a trampoline, not only for
their grandchildren, but she taught pre-school for several years and needed
these for her students.  They also had volleyball standards, net &amp; ball, so
they would invite all the Glendon Porter Family one afternoon/evening in the
summers.  Samantha (Cindy’s daughter) would usually come also.  Her adopted
father, Bryon Dugan would bring her and they would stay with Georgia and the
rest of us for a few days.  Now that Samantha is in college, she comes by
herself or with her boyfriend.  Georgia finally quit having them at her home as
the family had grown so large and some of the children were destroying her
pre-school equipment or other items, plus tracking dirt throughout the house. 
She said that after everyone had gone, she would go into her the room where she
held her pre-school and it would be a mess.  The parents hadn’t checked and had
their children clean it up.   The same thing was true of the Christmas parties
she had for all the family, so they finally discontinued too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            After a couple of years, <b>I decided we needed
to have another one and I had heard of the Heber Valley Campgrounds,</b> which
the church owns.  They have it for a Young Women’s camp, but on the weekends,
families can reserve it for family reunions.  I was able to get it for a Friday
night and Saturday.  Georgia helped me plan it and we contacted all the
family.  Bryce &amp; Deanna were on their mission to Spain, but their children
acted excited as did everyone else.  I did a lot of planning and preparing,
Georgia &amp; our husbands helped too and we were disappointed that we didn’t
have more come to it.  It is a beautiful camp with cabins, large pavilion with
lots of tables with benches.  There was a room at each side of the pavilion
which has shelves, a fridge and grills.  They have a campfire area with lots of
logs around it, they had a volleyball court and a small lake with paddle boats
&amp; canoes on which we could use.  They have a camp host who looks after the
camp.  We had good meals and those who came had a wonderful time.  Chad &amp;
his wife some of the others didn’t come up until Saturday afternoon.  Nolan
&amp; Brandy came Friday night along with some of our family, some of Georgia’s
family and I can’t remember whether any more of Bryce’s family or Kim’s family
came.  I just know that for all the work and worry, I didn’t know whether it
was worth it for the few that came.  I wasn’t eager to do it again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>Ken and I held a Glendon Porter Family
Reunion in our big backyard in September of 2012</b>.  Everyone thought I was
crazy to do it especially since we had been so busy with the Bushnell Reunion
and had just held it in August, but this was just an afternoon/evening reunion,
so it wasn’t very hard.  We put up our big shad tent and we had everyone bring
their own meat to grill and then a salad, dessert or vegetable or fruit tray. 
We played volleyball, corn hole, some of the children played on our playground
plane or tree swing and some went over to the park.  We enjoyed visiting and
being together.  It turned out great!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Pat, myself &amp; the
Savior</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I was about 14, my best friend, Pat
Kleitches and I were babysitting for a family in the ward.  They had asked me
to tend their children and I asked if Pat could come along.  Pat’s parents
weren’t members of our church, so, of course, she wasn’t either.  They were
antagonistic to the church and forbid Pat to join.  They had allowed her to go
to church with me.  She had always gone to Sunday School, Primary, M.I.A. and
sometimes Sacrament Meeting with me.  They had moved from Pennsylvania to
Sunset, Utah when Pat was seven years old.  She lived on the highway about 4
houses away from me.  We had become best friends.  Pat and I had discussions
about the church many times.  On this particular night, after the children were
asleep, Pat and I began discussing the church again.  I bore my testimony to
her and we began to feel the spirit of the Lord.  All of a sudden, I looked
over at the big chair which was to my left.  It was aglow.  There was a
beautiful brightness and in the middle of it was Jesus Christ - or an angel. 
I’m not sure which, although we felt it was Christ.  I was so filled with the
love of this being that I immediately began to cry.  Pat began crying almost at
the same time.  When I looked again, he was gone.  We cried and cried for a
long time.  When we at last gained composure, she said, “Mae, did you see Christ?” 
I nodded yes, and we hugged each other.  She had seen him the exact same time I
had, but he didn’t stay long, just long enough for us to see him sitting in
that chair and to feel his presence.  It was such a beautiful experience and I
know it helped to instill the desire in Pat’s heart to join the church. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Pat married Ron Bradfield in February of 1959,
our senior year.  Ken and I witnessed their marriage at Pat’s parents home. 
About a year later when Ken and I were living in Sunset, renting Mom and Dad’s
apartment behind their home, I got a call from Pat.  She said the missionaries
had finished teaching her the lessons and she wanted to be baptized as she had
a testimony that it was true, but was afraid that if she did, her parents would
disown her.  I went over to her apartment to talk with her.  I told her that
many had joined the church even though it meant their folks would disown them. 
She decided to join as her husband wanted her to do so also.  Her parents did
disown her and made it very miserable for Pat.  They even came to her apartment
and took back everything they had ever given her (at least the things she still
had).  Finally, after several months and much heartache, they did reunite.  
Pat &amp; Ron wanted to be married in the temple, but Pat was having a hard
time with the law of tithing.  We had another good talk.  She explained to me
that she wanted to pay tithing, but there just wasn’t enough money.  She had
figured and refigured and when she paid the bills, and bought the food, there wasn’t
money left to pay tithing.   I explained that if they would pay their tithing
first (before paying their bills) the Lord would bless them, and they would
have enough money left over to pay their bills and buy their food.  I told her
it worked for us and I was sure it would for her.  I told her to at least try
it.  I really prayed hard for her that she would have the faith to try it.  She
did, and it did work.  She called and told me that she didn’t know how it
worked, but it did, and she was so happy.  They were able to get a temple
recommend and go to the temple.  I was able to be the one to go through with
her - since her mother wasn’t a member and she didn’t have a sister or any
close family member.  I was thrilled to be with her.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We have always stayed close.  She has thanked me
over and over for being her best friend and fellowshipping her into the gospel
and setting the example for her. Pat is a very special lady.  She has raised a
wonderful family.  She is a wonderful wife, mother and grandmother.  She has
been a YWMIA President and loved the girls.  She has done a lot for so many
people and loves the Lord and continues to serve him and her fellow men.  I am
thankful that Pat was my best friend.  My husband, Ken, is now my best friend,
but she continues to be a very dear friend.  I know that I was just an
instrument in the Lord’s hands to help Pat into the Church, and it was him, not
me.  I don’t want the credit, but I am thankful to my Heavenly Father for the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessing she has been in my life.</p>

BEFORE READING THE SCRIPTURES:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I had been to a lecture by Bro. Covey who told
us that we should pray before studying the scriptures and this would help us to
understand the scriptures better and to gain more from them.  I did this, and I
enjoyed reading and pondering the scriptures so much.  I would cry many times
as I read about the Savior and felt the spirit. I enjoyed this time as I took more
time to read the scriptures and ponder them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>My Guardian Angel</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I am a little nervous about telling this
experience, but I need to.  I have told some, or maybe all, of our children as
they were growing up, to impress upon them the importance of praying for
protection both spiritually as well as physically, and also the influence of
Satan in our lives and how we need to not put ourselves in a position to be
tempted like that.   Ken and I were engaged, and we were very much in love.  We
were engaged 8 months and that is a long time, but I wanted to graduate from
high school before we got married and Ken gave me my engagement ring in October
of 1958.  Our wedding date was set for June 19<sup>th</sup>.  One evening after
going to a formal dance, I invited Ken into my house.  It was late and everyone
in my family was asleep, so we didn’t turn on any lights.  We stood together
kissing and Ken started unzipping my formal at the back.  He had never done
this before.  All of a sudden, we saw mom walk from her and dad’s bedroom into
the bathroom.  Even though the lights were not on, we could see her clearly. I
guess from the street and other lights reflecting in the windows.  She was
wearing her long pink nightgown and had her cap on her head.  She always went
to the beauty shop to have her hair set each week and so at night, to keep it
from being messed up, she would wrap toilet paper around her hair and pin it
with bobby pins and then put on a mesh cap to hold it.  Ken quickly zipped up
my dress and we stood there waiting for the bathroom light to go on or for the
toilet to flush or to hear the water in the sink – but we heard nothing.  We
waited for several minutes and then I went to the bathroom and spoke softly to
her as I wondered if she was alright.  When she didn’t answer, I opened the
door, but no one was in the bathroom and we had not seen her leave.  The only
thing Ken and I could think is that it was my guardian angel who was there to
protect us from Satan’s influence.  Ken and I both are in a habit of praying to
the Lord both night and morning for safety and protection among other things,
and as we realized what could have happened that night, we knelt down and
thanked the Lord for answering our prayers and sending my guardian angel to
protect us.</p>

for Thanksgiving and I woke in the middle of the night with terrible pains in
my stomach.  At first, I thought it was just indigestion, but it got worse
&amp; worse.  Ken was sleeping, and I didn’t want to wake him, and I knew that
dad got up several times during the night to go to the bathroom, so I waited
for him to give me a blessing.  Finally, Mom got up to go to the bathroom and
found me in such pain, so she woke dad.  As soon as he put his hands on my head
and gave me a beautiful blessing that the pain would stop – it did stop, and I
have never had that pain return.  I was so grateful for the power of the
priesthood and that dad honored his priesthood and was worthy to give me that
blessing.  Ken felt bad, the next morning, that I hadn’t woke him, so he could
give me the blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dad – in hospital prior to
passing away.</span></b>  Mom had been hanging on to him, she wouldn’t let him
die.  He had Anti-Tripson Deficiency and had been getting worse and worse.  He
was on oxygen 24/7.  He didn’t feel like eating.  Mom kept trying to get him to
eat, but he said he wasn’t hungry.  He was miserable.  He had always been so
healthy as he took good care of himself by eating right, taking vitamins and
minerals, working hard and after retiring, he walked every day.  He had good
posture, etc.  This Anti-Tripson Deficiency is an inherited disease.  Anyway,
he had pneumonia along with his disease, so was taken to the hospital.  Mom had
been with him and was really tired, so Georgia asked Rick if he would take her
home.  She didn’t want to leave dad, but we convinced her that she needed to
get some sleep, or she would get sick.  Soon after they left, Georgia &amp; I
went over to dad’s bed and told him that he could pass away now.  We told him
that Rick had taken Mom home to get some sleep.  Dad bore his testimony to us
girls and told us how much he loved us and were proud of us and that he loved
all of his family.  I told dad that I had always knew he had a testimony.  We
told him we loved him, we gave him a hug and right after, he passed away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I was walking into Relief Society one morning<b>, </b>I
saw a sister sitting by herself at the back of the room.  I had a strong
feeling that I should go and sit by her, but just at that moment my friend,
Mishelle Killian, motioned for me to come sit by her.  She was sitting towards
the front.  I stood there trying to decide what to do and Mishelle kept
motioning for me to come and sit by her, so I gave in and went there.  I had an
uncomfortable feeling and wished I had gone with my feelings as I noticed no
one sat by this sister.  I didn’t know her very well, but knew the spirit had
wanted me to sit by her.  I thought I would speak to her after R.S. but I
didn’t get the chance.  A few days later, I found out that this sister had
moved on Monday and that she was in the process of divorce.  Her husband had
left her and her children.  I felt so bad that I had not listened to the
Spirit.  If I had, I probably could have visited with her before and after R.S.
and found this out and could have offered to help her or tend her children, or
whatever the Holy Ghost directed me to do and say.   I hope I can listen and
act next time.</p>

gave a couple of presentations, almost got one closed, then he changed his mind
for the time.  I went to sell another that we had already given the
presentation to, but they want to wait for a month.  I was pretty discouraged
and upset because of the pressure.  Dave had asked me to call him around noon,
so we could meet, and he could give me some more cards he was getting from
another representative.  I finally got a hold of him and we met.  He gave me
lots of cards and supplies he had gotten from Norm Thompson, the Mesa representative who just went into another business because he needed more money to
support his family.  Dave invited me to go to lunch with him and even though I
trust him (he loves his wife, is strong in the church, good friend to Bryce
&amp; Irven, etc.) and even though I hadn’t eaten lunch, I declined as I wanted
to get to work and make some sales for the day.  I drove to a shaded area,
sorted the cards, drove off to Mesa to begin work again.  I reached for my kit
as I got out of the car and it wasn’t there.  I looked all over the car and no
kit.  I started to panic because it had the checks in from the sales I had made
this week.  I got out and frantically looked through the boxes that Dave had
given me, that were in the trunk.  It was nowhere to be found.  I was so upset
and scared.  I drove to a phone booth and called Dave.  He was there, thank
goodness.  I asked him if I could have left my kit in his car.  He ran out to
check, but no, it wasn’t there.  He asked if my kit had checks in it and I said
“yes.”  He could tell that I was really upset and worried, so he tried to
console me by telling me how others had done similar things, tried to tell me
funny things to get me to laugh, and told me not to take it personally – that
things like that happen to lots of people and some things are lots worse.  He
was so understanding, I could hardly believe it.  I told him at the first
(after he told me it wasn’t in his car) that he should fire me.  He said, “I
can’t, you’re one of my very best people.”  He is always complimenting me and
encouraging me.  He’s a great boss – all his people think so.  He told me to
drive back to where we were parked – that maybe I had sat it on the trunk or
the top of the car and forgot and driven off.  That it might be there.  I did. 
It was ½ mile away, but I drove fast.  It wasn’t there.  I went into businesses
close by and asked if anyone had turned in a brown binder, but no one had.  I
wondered if I could have put it on the trunk when I sorted my cards, so I drove
there.  It wasn’t there.  That was the same place (shopping center) where I had
called Dave before, so I decided to go over and call him to tell him the bad
news.  He had told me that I could go back to the businesses who had given me
checks and get them to stop payment on the checks and write me out new ones.  I
hated the thought of doing that, but I knew I would have to – but there was
another problem.  I couldn’t remember all the businesses that had given me
checks – and I had no way of finding out as the receipt was with the person,
and the membership card was with the checks in the kit.  As I came up to the
phone booth, it dawned on me (the Holy Ghost) that the last time I remember
having my kit was when I gave a presentation to a jeweler in that shopping
center, so I might have laid it on top of the phone booth while I made the call
four hours earlier.  That maybe someone had turned it in to one of the stores,
so I checked, and no one had.  I went back and called Dave.  We discussed it
some more and he again tried to console me.  He told me that he had another
copy of the membership list and Craig in Phoenix would make me up another kit
and get it to me early the next morning.  He said he wished he could help more,
but he had so much to do.  He had already helped so much, and I sure
appreciated it.  He told me to cheer up and go sit in the car and think and let
the Holy Ghost prompt me, that maybe I could still find it.  If not, to go home
and have a good evening and tomorrow would be a better day.  As I went to leave
the phone booth, I remembered that I better call home, so the family wouldn’t
worry.  I noticed a man waiting to use the phone, so I asked if I could make
one more quick call.  I told him something devastating had just happened.  <b>He
looked at me funny and said, “You look familiar.”  He had a business card in
his hand.  He said, “You aren’t Mae Browning, are you?”  I said “yes, do you
have my brown book?”  He did.</b>  We walked to his big rig (he was a trucker)
and he explained how he had found my book, and going through it, he saw the
checks, etc., and knew the person who owned it might lose their job if they
didn’t find it (most bosses would fire their people for this reason), so he
found my business card and called our home.  Scott answered, and this man left
his name and number in California.  But then he knew that if I called California, his brother-in-law (his partner wouldn’t know anything about it and wouldn’t be
able to help me.  He also knew that he couldn’t just leave my book at a store,
etc., nearby as they might be dishonest and cash the checks.  He knew he
wouldn’t be back in Tempe for another week, and that I’d need it now.  He waited
around trying to figure out what to do.  He looked on his map for my address,
to take it there, but knew he couldn’t fit his rig down the roads in a housing
division.  He was to pick up a load at a certain time, but didn’t, as he felt
he had to work something out for me.  Four hours later, at the same phone
booth, he was waiting to use the phone to call my home again to see if I was
home by now and to see if I could meet him somewhere to get my book.  Wow!!! I
knew the Lord had used him as an instrument in answering my prayers.  Here he,
a good, honest, man (he didn’t look like one and a lot of truckers might not
be) and he really went the extra mile to help me.  I wanted to repay him
somehow so gave him four dollars I had in my purse and asked him to give me his
name and address and I would send him more money.  I explained that we were
having financial problems and that’s why I had gotten this job, but I didn’t
tell him that to get out of paying him a reward or something, I was just upset
and grateful and blurted it out.  He said “no, I’m just glad I could help
you.”  I told him that I didn’t know if he was a Christian or not, but I was,
and I knew the Lord had used him – a good, honest man to answer my prayers.  I
also told him that if I couldn’t repay him for his extreme kindness, that I
would help other people.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It really makes me realize that lately I haven’t taken time
to help others or show love like I used to and should.  I’ve felt so pressured
lately that I haven’t.  I will do better in the future. (I put a copy in 1987

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Spiritual experience
involving Scott</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were still living with Mom Jensen and Scott was a
teenager.  He had great friends, but one night they wanted to go to a rock
concert in Park City.  I didn’t really want him to go to a rock concert, but we
let him go.  He drove our little Sprint and took his friends.  I had recently
had an operation – hysterectomy and I was recovering.  I wasn’t feeling good. 
I couldn’t go to sleep and I remember sitting up waiting for Scott.  He didn’t
come when I thought he should have.  I began to get more and more anxious. 
Finally, a dark despairing feeling came over me and I knelt down and prayed.  I
asked Heavenly Father to please protect Scott and bring him back home safely
and soon.  At that moment, I had a warm, wonderful, peaceful feeling come over
me and I knew Scott was alright.  It wasn’t long until he came home.  Last
night, Saturday June 14<sup>th</sup>, as Ken, Jeff, Scott and David were riding
together coming home from a restaurant in Salt Lake where we met Sandi and Mike
to be together and pay for their dad and my dinners for Father’s Day; I was
telling Scott about this experience.  He was sitting next to me in the back
seat.  Ken was on the other side and Jeff was in front with David who was
driving.  When I finished telling Scott this experience, he told me that that
night as they were coming home from the concert, he was starting to pass a semi
truck when it came over and started to push him off the highway.  He was able
to gain control of the car and they were ok.  I now know why I had that dark
and despairing feeling and felt the need to pray for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>My friend from the
pre-existence. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This experience happened while at the Salt Lake Temple.  I
can’t remember the date or how old I was, probably in my thirties.  Ken and I
had gone to the temple one morning and as I was sitting in the first room, my
eyes focused on a woman about my age who was sitting two or three rows up from
me.  I felt such closeness to her that I could hardly take my eyes off from
her.  I remember that she had long brown hair.  I had a hard time concentrating
on the session.  As we progressed to the next room, she was only one row ahead
of me and I felt such a love and warmth radiating from her that I wished I was
sitting next to her.  As we progressed to the third room, I found that I was
indeed sitting next to her.  As I did, she looked at me with such a beautiful
smile and put her hand on mine.  I have never felt like that before – like I
knew her – like she was a very close friend.  When we went into the Celestial
Room, she was waiting for me and we hugged.  We both started talking at once,
trying to figure out why we felt this closeness for each other.  She and her
husband were on a vacation from another state back east.  They had never been
out here before.  As we talked, we found that we had many things in common. 
The only thing we could figure out is that we must have been close friends in
the pre-existence.  That is the only way we could explain the love and
closeness we felt for each other.  She said the first time she saw me in the
first room, she felt an overwhelming feeling of love for me too.  As our
husbands came through the veil, we introduced them.  We met again, after
dressing, before we left the temple and visited some more and got each other’s
address and phone numbers.  With us moving like we do and maybe they did also,
anyway we lost tract of each other, but I know that I will see her again after
this life and we will be close friends again.</p>

Philippines</span></b> when Tina Linderman woke up in the night having a
terrible feeling that something bad was happening to us and that she needed to
pray.  She did pray for our safety and that was when Ken and I were dropping
off the zone leaders after being to zone leaders conference in Angeles.  Ken
usually dropped them off on the side of the road and let them walk across the
road to their home, but this time we had two boxes of Book of Mormons for them,
so he looked both ways and started to do a U turn to let them off in front of
their home, when at that moment a black car without his lights on was right
there on us.  It was a miracle that he didn’t hit us.  We all screamed, and the
Elders dove for the floor of the car and I threw myself over to Ken as the car
would have hit me broadside.  The Lord just put out his hand and stopped that
car.  Ken drove off the road and stopped and we all shook, and the black car
didn’t move for some time and finally went on.  I’m sure he was as shaken as we
were.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had been in to get my mammogram and the technician noticed
my mole and asked if my doctor had noticed it.  I said the doctor I had before
we went on Medicare didn’t seem concerned about it and my doctor now probably
hadn’t noticed it or at least he hadn’t said anything.  She was concerned and
felt I should have it looked at right away.  I decided I better call my doctor,
but when I told the nurse the reason I was making the appointment, she told me
I needed to see a dermatologist.  I looked one up in my provider list and
called him.  The nurse said I wouldn’t be able to get in for two months.  I had
the thought that I should call Jeanenne and see about doing the alternative
medicine way that she has taken care of moles.  I am doing that at this time. 
My special friend, Noma tew, in Idaho (our 2<sup>nd</sup> mother) did this same
thing with moles and she is still living.  Another friend and neighbor in Layton, Sister Fluckiger, went the medical way.  Hers kept getting worse and worse as it
kept spreading and she really suffered before she died.  They were both about

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, April 18, 2008</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This morning Ken is going to the transportation Dept at Davis
 School District to take his LCD Test (bus driving test).  He is nervous about
it, but he is prepared.  As he went to leave this morning, he couldn’t find his
keys.  He looked all over.  I stopped what I was doing and helped look for
them.  We looked in his coat and clothes he had on yesterday, we looked on
everything throughout the house.  We went out to his truck and looked there as
well as all around the ground.  It was time that he needed to leave.  He could
have taken my keys as I have a key to his truck on my key ring, but he has the
key to the buses on his key ring and needed that.  As soon as I came back into
our home, I knelt by the couch and said a prayer asking Heavenly Father that he
would help us find the keys as Ken needed to go.  I started looking again, and
I went to our recliner and felt down around the sides of it and felt the keys
way back down there.  They must have fallen out of his pocket when he laid in
the recliner yesterday to take a nap.  I know for sure that the Lord guided me
there, as I don’t think I would have thought to look there if I had not
prayed.  That is another testimony of the power of prayer and the love Heavenly
Father has for each of us if we try to keep his commandments and ask sincerely
and with faith.  I am so thankful for his love and for my membership in his
church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>VIRGINIA JOHNSTON -
Tuesday, May 6, 2008 </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Ken has been really busy the last while
(although he usually keeps really busy as everyone wants him to help them with
one project or another, since he knows how to do everything) as he has been
training to be a bus driver.  Since he is getting older (69 now), he gets tired
easier and gets in pain if he works too hard or too long or if the project is
stressful – so he has decided he wants to phase out of doing construction jobs
except just for our immediate family, and Bob since we live here.  Although, he
will help others in an emergency, if needed, I’m sure.  We can’t make ends meet
just with our social security checks &amp; my small retirement check, so he
needs to bring in extra money some way, so he decided to be a school bus
driver.  He applied, and they need bus drivers, so were excited to have him. 
The training has been lengthy and several tests, but he has completed them.  He
is to work as a substitute for 6 months and then he can apply for his own bus
route if he chooses to.  Anyway, my brother, Bryce and his wife, Deanna,
brought a home in Perry, but it needed a lot of work done to it, so Bryce asked
Ken if he would help him.  My sister, Georgia and her husband need him to help
them do a project, our son, Scott and wife, Mishelle, need him to fix their
bathroom, my cousin, Randy needs him to do projects on remodeling their home,
etc., etc.  On Tuesday, after morning school bus training, he had planned to go
to Bryce’s home to work there again, but realized he wouldn’t have enough time
as we had a meeting that evening with the High Priest Leader in our ward about
family history work, so he worked on projects for Bob &amp; Mark on the yard
and garden.  While we were eating supper, a neighbor called and asked if he
would go to Sister Virginia Johnston’s home and install some hand safety
railings in her shower for her.  He explained that he didn’t have time and she
needed it done right away.  Ken accepted, and we stopped at her home on our way
to the meeting to see what it entailed.  After the meeting, Ken asked if I
would go with him to Virginia’s home while he installed them.  I had hoped to
stay home and do more on-line training on the internet since Irven &amp; Sandy
had been to our home all day while we cooked a meal in our solar oven.  They
hadn’t planned to be there all day, but her and I kept visiting about different
things and the day was gone.  Time sure flies by so fast.  I started to object
about going with him but then I realized that it was hard for him to spend the
time doing this for her, since he was tired from working so hard all day, but
he was willing to do it and besides it wasn’t appropriate for a man to go into
a single woman’s home alone.  Virginia was a widow – so I went with him.  I was
glad I did because as I visited with Virginia, she told me several spiritual
experiences she had with raising her family.  I felt the spirit and my love and
admiration for this special lady and her family grew in my heart.  I felt the
Lord gave me this blessing since I was willing to go with Ken.  Virginia was happy for my visit too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>DENTIST - May 2008 </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I went to the dentist in May for a checkup and to have them
cleaned.  I found out after I got there that Dr. Cottle had retired and a new
young dentist was taking his place.  They took x-rays and the dentist told me
that the roots of a tooth on the back top right side were crumbling and because
I had had a root canal in that tooth, I couldn’t feel any pain.  He said the
tooth couldn’t be saved and I would need to go to an oral surgeon to have it
pulled as he didn’t have the equipment needed to get it out.  He also said I
had a cavity which needed filling and that I needed three new crowns in order
to save those teeth.  They gave me a paper itemizing the cost of the work which
needed to be done and it was $3,000.00 plus the cost of the oral surgeon.  Each
crown was $670.00 plus $150.00 for some other procedure they do with crowns. 
Needless to say, I was pretty discouraged when I left that day as $3,000.00 is
a lot of money even in today’s world, and we don’t have any dental insurance. 
They wanted to make an appointment for me to have the work done, but I decided
to call other dentists and get a second opinion.  <b>I did make an appointment
with the oral surgeon.  I was nervous about going there since the dentist said
the roots were crumbling, I knew he would have to dig them out and it would be
a painful and stressful experience.  I prayed hard to Heavenly Father that the
tooth would come out ok and to bless the oral surgeon as he took it out.  He
deadened all around the tooth and I felt it being numbed even up into my right
eye.  When he pulled the tooth, it came out all intact.  I was surprised and
asked him about it and he showed me the tooth.  I told him Dr. Harris had told
me the roots were crumbling.  He said I know, I am very surprised myself.  I
knew my prayers had been answered.  I got along great and didn’t even have to
take a pain pill that he prescribed.  I only took Tylenol.  Mark Hulet. Ken’s cousin
had been a dentist and he kept asking me how I felt and how I was doing.  He was
surprised that I was doing so well</b>.  Ken had been with me as he wanted to
know how the oral surgeon felt about me having dentures instead of having all
this work done since my teeth have always been soft and I have always had so
many cavities, caps, bridges, root canals, crowns, teeth pulled, paradonel
disease, etc., and I take fairly good care of my teeth.  We have spent a lot of
money on my teeth, plus what the insurance would pay.  I always liked Dr.
Cottle, but I don’t think he took as good of care of my teeth as he should as
prior to going on our mission to the Philippines; Dr. Cottle had checked my
teeth and said they were good.  But soon after I got there I had an abscessed
tooth and had to go to a dentist that the mission president referred me to in
Angeles.  She did a lot of work and also had to put on three crowns.  Now here
we are again.  The oral surgeon told me that if he were me, he would have the
new crowns put on and keep my teeth as long as I can.  He said “If you even
decide to have dentures, only do it on the top as you have a ridge on the
bottom and the dentures would slide back and forth and wouldn’t work.  I had
other dentists tell me that since I had had paradonal disease my gums would
never adjust to dentures and I would be miserable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>GRANDPARENTS BINDERS - November
5, 2012</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On November 29<sup>th</sup>, while doing laundry and
cleaning house; I was cleaning our 3<sup>rd</sup> bedroom storage room with two
purposes.  1 – it needed to be cleaned &amp; better organized and 2 – to find
my 4 plastic accordion envelope binders.  I had bought them several years ago
as I wanted one for each of my grandparents.  The first was for my grandfather
George Bushnell, second for his wife, my grandmother, Iva Swallow Bushnell. 
The third for my grandfather, Byron Porter and the last for his wife, my
grandmother, Mary Elizabeth “May” Robinson Porter.  My mother, Mildred Bushnell
Porter, had passed away and with me being the eldest living child, and loving
Family History, I was the one to take Mom’s genealogy, special papers, cards
and pictures.  As I went through these boxes, I found birth, marriage and death
certificates.  I found paper awards, newspaper clippings, other certificates,
histories, etc., so I was able to put these, where they belonged, in these
binders.  Anyway, they were not on the shelf where I usually kept them so as I
was cleaning, I was looking for them, but I couldn’t find them.  When I was
saying my morning prayers, I asked God to help me find them.  When I finished
cleaning the entire room, I prayed again and told the Lord that I couldn’t find
them, but I knew that he knew where they were, and I sure would like to find
them.  I then decided to clean the other storage room as I thought that maybe I
had put them there.  They were not there either.  I then looked through all the
bookcases and every other place that I thought they might be, but to no
success.  I was worried as I surely hated to lose those binders with those
important documents, papers &amp; pictures.  I said another prayer in my mind
and just then the thought came to me “They are at your sister, Georgia’s
home”.  I know that message came from God or his messenger.  I then remembered
that several months ago, Georgia &amp; I went through the boxes of genealogy
and other papers, cards, etc., that I had taken to her house prior to Ken and I
going on our mission.  She has a big home and I have a small one and with us
being gone, I wanted them to be in safe keeping.  I had taken these binders
over that day as I thought we could go through them to see if there were
documents or papers that she would want a copy of.  We hadn’t had time to do that,
so I just left them with her and told her I could get them later.  Well, she
forgot about them and I forgot about them and forgot that I had taken them to
her house.  The Lord knew where they were and after I had done all I could to
try to find them, he gave me the answer.  I knelt and offered a prayer of
thanks as I was very grateful to know where they were.  I called Georgia and
she brought them to me when we went to a meeting together on Thursday night. 
Another good thing is that I got both my storage rooms cleaned and better
organized, so I was glad about that too.</p>

     they were married in our home in Ogden.  They had a nice reception at Mom

     She talks 90 miles an hour, but is very knowledgeable.  She put him on a

     overgrowth of yeast.  When the Nystatin killed the yeast and he was on the
     strict diet for only a day or two, most of the pain had gone away and soon
     all of it was gone.  He had to stay on the diet for 3 months.  He has been
     on this diet several times over the past 20 years.  It is now 2008.  He
     can’t eat sugar, although he had been eating frozen yogurt for the past
     few years and it didn’t seem to bother him.  We began drinking a special drink
     Uncle Wayne drinks which he claims has kept him very healthy all his life
     – not even a cold.  We took it for 10 months and we did not get sick
     either, but all of a sudden in late July 2008, he came down with terrible
     pain – the yeast problem was back, and we found out it was because of the
     drink we had been taking – 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar with mother, 1 tsp
     of honey and 3 shakes of cayenne pepper in a glass of water.  The vinegar
     and honey had mounted up in his body and caused the yeast to explode.  We
     went again to Nancy, got on the strict diet and lots of nutrients, but it
     took 4 weeks for the pain to leave this time.  I am also on the diet and
     also have the yeast problem.  I don’t have the pain, but maybe had
     attributed to Ken’s problem as we passed the yeast back and forth.  We
     have been on this diet 2 months and it is not fun, but always his pain has
     left, and we have both lost weight and are feeling pretty good.  Although,
     I got sick with a virus caused by stress when Jeff attempted suicide on

     diagnosed with being allergic to gluten and dairy and both of us are not
     supposed to eat sugar, although I’m not as good about that as Ken is.  It
     brings him immediate pain, so he can’t even have frozen yogurt anymore.  I
     don’t sleep as well usually if I have eaten much sugar and I know it’s not
     good for me, but it sure tastes good and sometimes I just say, “It might
     be worth it.”  It was hard at first to eat this gluten &amp; dairy free
     diet and hard for our families and others to fix meals for us, but as the
     years have passed, it has gotten easier and we usually take some food with
     us when we got stay with our children and their families. We don’t have

life and that has really helped along with exercise.  <b>Dr Dale Bennett</b>
helped me a lot and when he took my x-rays to the Palmer College of
Chiroprictic for a conference and showed them to his colleges, they asked how I
even got around.  He told them I did great! And I do.  <b>Deanna Davis</b>
helped me the most.  I met her in about 2012.  I went to Jenny Porter for a
class and she had Deanna tell about her massage treatments.  I went to her and
she “saved me” from what would have been severe pain with my scoliosis causing
my body to pull to the right.  It was starting to do that and had I not found
her, in ten years she said I couldn’t have gotten help and I would be bowed to
the right and in so much pain &amp; misery.  I know the Lord blessed me to find
her.  She took so many classes and had a gift.  Hers was not the “feel good”
massage, but the deep massage, like Randy does, but she was much better than he
was.  I loved talking to her as she was such a good person and had such
knowledge, skill and perception. I have a friend in the Monte Vista Ward (we
moved here in November 2014), who had this same problem.  She is about 10 years
younger than me and when I met her, she was severely bowed to the right and it
was so painful for her and she kept falling and having problems.  The doctor
finally told her that she needed to have the rods put down her spine.  She did,
and she has had problems ever since with terrible health conditions.  She is on
lots of medications so that her mind doesn’t work clearly most of the time. 
She is in the hospital or rehab most of the time now and I wouldn’t be
surprised if she doesn’t pass away within a short time. We home taught her
(Evelyn Hilton) and her husband, Harold from the time we moved here.</p>

mainly vegetables, chicken, fish &amp; some fruit, so we took away gluten &amp;
dairy too.  I lost so much weight that I called up Nancy and told her that I
only weighed 108 now and I was too thin.  I asked her what I could eat to put
on some weight and not keep losing and she said to eat avocados.  I didn’t like
them at the time, but I have learned to like them, and it worked.  We went down

<b>and restless legs</b> –  I had lots of pain in my body and my legs and feet
were driving me crazy.  I got an appointment with Nancy Litchford and after
talking to her, she asked me different questions and I answered them in the
affirmative.  She said I’m sure you have Fibromyalgia and restless leg
syndrome.  She had me take some nutrients, but I still suffered with it.  I
remember sitting on the couch visiting with people and my legs were so jumpy
and nervous that I had to keep moving my feet and legs and I thought I would go
nuts.  I couldn’t sleep well at night because I would lie on one side and my
hips would hurt so bad, I would have to change to the other side.  I finally
found that sleeping on my back was the best even though that was not the way I
had slept all my life.   After Ken and I had been on the gluten free, dairy
free and sugar free diet for a few months, I noticed that I didn’t have the
pain in my body and the nervousness in my feet and legs, like I did before. 
The diet had helped so much.  I wish I could eat the way I used to, but it is
worth it to get rid of these health problems.</p>

treated my periodontal disease told me not to as I would really regret it and
my gums would get irritated and get worse.  I was going to my dentist every 6
months and my periodontal specialist every 6 months at one time – so you can
see I spent lots of money.  My gums got better, thank goodness.  The straw that
broke the camel’s back and made me decide to pray about dentures was when the
dentist, I was going to at the time, and he had already worked on my teeth to
the cost of over $1,000, told me that my bridge on the left of my upper teeth
was gone as were the teeth under it and I would need to have “posts” put in
which would cost $1,000 for each post.  Also, my caps on my front two teeth had
to be replaced, he said and the tooth he had been doing a root canal on and
couldn’t find the last canal would need to have more work done and then a
crown.  Anyway, I could see I couldn’t afford to have all this done.  Ken had
wanted me to get dentures years ago because of the cost and pain with my teeth. 
I talked to Banita, Uncle June’s 3<sup>rd</sup> wife, and she said she loved
her dentures (she had had teeth like mine).  I talked to a neighbor when I
found out she had dentures and they were beautiful and she loved them, so told
me to go to Dr. Gray in Kaysville.  I did, and he realized that I should have
top dentures, but not the bottom.  I have loved them.</p>

operation.  My doctor came in to see me and asked how I was doing and if there
was anything that he should know about that might be going on in my body that
might prevent this operation.  I mentioned a rash that itched which was on my
back.  He looked at it and said, “You are not going to be operated on in the
morning, you have “shingles”.  I called Ken and he had to come get me and we
had to reschedule the operation.  The shingles were not terrible, like Ken’s
mom and many others have; they just mainly itched and burned some.  They
finally cleared up and I went in for the operation.  They gave me a spinal for
the anesthetic, and neither the doctor, nor the anesthesiologist told me to
stay down and not move around for the 3 days I was in the hospital, which I
found out later, I should have done.  In fact, the doctor came in to check me
later that day an asked how I was feeling.  I told him I was feeling good, so
he told me I could get up and go to the restroom whenever I needed to – so I
did.  The next morning, he came in again to check me and asked how I was
doing.  I told him, great! He said “Good! Then you can get up and move around
more and walk the halls”. So, I did, in fact, I stopped in the rooms and
visited with other patients and went to the gift shop, etc.  When I got home, I
got <b>spinal headaches</b> which were so bad that I had to lie on the couch
and not move.  Mom &amp; dad came to help take care of the family.  Dad brought
me his dramatized church history tapes which helped me so much.  It hurt so bad
to even move my head a little and it was practically torture, to get up and go
to the bathroom.  Mom talked to her friend, who was a nurse about it and that
is when she said “What, they didn’t tell her to lie quiet and let the hole in
the spine close up.” She told mom that by my getting up and walking around, it
let air go in the hole and caused these terrible spinal headaches.  I sure
wasn’t happy with the doctor and anesthesiologist when I found that out.</p>

who died when I was 7 months along.  She had water on the brain.  We were
living in Arizona when I got pregnant.  I didn’t feel much life, like I had
with the other babies, so I asked the doctor about it and he said not to worry
as she was just a petite little gal.  When we moved to Grantsville and I went

so sad.  I had been worried, when I got pregnant, about having another baby as
we had moved to Arizona the 2<sup>nd</sup> time since Larry Braithwaite had
convinced us that the building industry was booming, but a few months later a
recession hit again, and Ken didn’t have the work that he needed, and I was
worried about another mouth to feed and how we could afford this baby.  The
baby wasn’t planned, in fact, I had a birth control coil inserted after having
Jeff.  But after we found out we would be moving to Grantsville for Ken to
manage the Grantsville Stake Farm, I wasn’t worried anymore and was excited to
have another baby, especially since it was a girl.  Anyway, they had me come in
and they checked my blood every few days.  That was also hard because they
supposed that she would have shriveled up since I carried her for almost a
month before they had me come to the hospital and induce her. They didn’t give
me any pain killer, just the medicine to induce me.  I asked if they were not
going to give me anything for the pain and the doctor said “No, we don’t need
to.” Well, she came breach and her head was huge, so it was terribly painful,
and I went into shock. I was freezing and shaking so hard.  They piled warm
blankets on me, but it took quite a while for me to get over it.  When I went
into the <strong><span lang=EN style='font-weight:normal'>obstetrician</span></strong><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>,</span> for my
3-month checkup, he told me that I was in great shape for a 40-year-old and
that I should try to have another baby.  Since Ken, the children and I were
disappointed that I lost this baby, I did get pregnant again, but I lost it at
3 months.  Again, I went in for my checkup and again he told me that I should
try again to have a baby.  I was upset that he would even suggest such a thing
now and I told him “If I got pregnant again and lost it, you would lose me. 
You don’t know how hard this has been on me and my family to lost both these
babies.  No thanks, I will raise the 6 I have.”</p>

2017) He said what Dr. Flinders said about if I should fall and break my hip or

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandpa was a big man both in height and
stature.  He had a beautiful tenor voice and was in the Clearfield male chorus
lead by a Mr. Christensen who was also my Jr. High chorus teacher.  Grandpa was
asked to sing at funerals and weddings a lot.  Especially down in Millard
 County where he was from.  Grandmas health wasn't too good, and she felt she
had too many home responsibilities - so many times grandpa would take one of us
grandchildren with him.  I loved to go.  We'd visit along the way and he would
always stop at a drive in and buy us a hamburger and malt.  I always looked
forward to that and to being with grandpa on a trip.  Grandpa sang at my
wedding reception.  Grandpa had a sweet tooth, so he always had candy and other
sweets and pastries in his home, and carried white mints in his pocket.  He was
always sharing them with us.  Grandpa sat up a tradition for us children. 
Every Sunday morning as long as I can remember after they moved next door, he'd
come over and give us a Sunday nickel for each of us grandchildren.  When we
got older, it was a dime.  I thought that was special.  Our family didn't have
much extra money and I hated to ask Mom or Dad for money - so I looked forward
to this Sunday nickel or dime, so I could buy me a treat at the corner gas
station during the week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandpa had a temper, so we tried to steer clear
of him if we'd misbehaved or if he was in a mad mood.  I can remember riding
with him and grandma in their car and grandpa would get out of patience with
the other drivers and say to grandma &quot;Get their license number, I'm going
to turn them in.&quot;  Little grandma would say &quot;Now dad&quot;. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             Grandpa also had a heart of gold and he loved
visiting the sick and going to rest homes to cheer up the aged and afflicted. 
He did this a lot in the evenings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Thanksgiving at Grandpa &amp;
Grandmas.  Uncle June and Aunt Marilyn and sometimes Uncle Van, Aunt Allison
&amp; family and sometimes some of their other children and family and always
our family would be there.  Mom would always go over the night before and help
grandma made the stuffing and stuff the turkey.  Grandma had the best stuffing
recipe.  Ken loves it, so he helps me make it every year for our family and
others.  Then Mom &amp; grandma would fix a delicious dinner with all the
trimmings Thanksgiving morning and the others would bring food if they came. 
Grandpa would always make delicious lime punch.  That was one of the highlights
of the meal for me.  We didn't have punch a lot as Mom &amp; Dad were very
health conscious and didn't feel punch was good for us.  We mainly drank milk
and water.  Even now when I make punch, I think of Grandpa's lime punch.  Mine
never tastes as good as grandpa's did.  After dinner and the dishes were done,
Mom and her brothers and wives (sometimes Grandma &amp; Grandpa, but hardly
ever my dad as he didn't like to play card games except &quot;Authors&quot; and
he was really good at that.  So, dad would usually go over home and read) us
children would usually sit around and watch them play.  Mom loves to play games
and she'd laugh and have such a good time.  I can remember Uncle June with all
his swear words.  He was a truck driver and had gotten into a bad habit of
swearing, but he had such a sense of humor that we all overlooked (or tried to)
his language even though it shocked us many times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Soon after Ken &amp; I were married and living
in the Duplex apartment, we liked to sleep in on Saturday mornings as we both
worked during the week, but often Grandpa would pound on our door at 7 am, and
when we sleepily went to the door, Grandpa would say “Aren’t you up?  It’s time
you were up as it’s 7 am and I need your help”.  We were not so happy about
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I remember one time after Ken &amp;
I were married that our family and Grandpa &amp; Grandma were going up to
Logan.  Mom asked Ken &amp; me to ride with Grandpa &amp; Grandma since their
car was full with them and my younger brothers &amp; sister.  We did, but
grandpa kept getting mad and complaining about the other drivers until it
really upset Ken and me.  While we were at Logan, we asked Mom if some of the
other children could ride home with Grandpa &amp; Grandma as we had had our
fill of Grandpa and his complaining.  The other children didn't want to, so we
had to return home by way of Grandpa's car.  I think Grandpa realized how upset
it had made us, or maybe Grandma got after him - anyway he was much better
going home.  In fact, he stopped and bought us a malt.  (I think to make up for
his bad behavior)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            My dad and grandpa Bushnell had such a good
relationship.  When grandpa had his second heart attack and Dad was driving him
to the hospital, he told dad he wouldn't make it this time, that he would die. 
Dad was really sad.  And after grandpa died and his casket was in the church
down in Meadow (as that was where he wanted to be buried) dad said he was alone
with grandpa and he suddenly felt grandpa's presence and felt grandpa was about
to speak to him when someone walked in and interrupted it.  He felt bad as he
felt grandpa had something to say to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Grandpa Bushnell died December
29th, 1962.  Mom had invited Ken and I, and Grandpa and Grandma Bushnell out
for my birthday supper.  Grandpa had said the blessing on the food.  After
supper Ken and I went home, and Mom, Dad, Grandpa and Grandma went to see a
show &quot;The Big Country&quot;.  After the show and Mom and Dad were in bed;
Grandma called Mom and told her that Grandpa was in a lot of pain and she was
afraid he was having a heart attack.  Mom and Dad went over and finally Dad
took Grandpa to the hospital.  Dad said he knew he wouldn't bring Grandpa back
home.  Grandpa died a few minutes after he arrived in the hospital.  Grandpa's
funeral was beautiful.  The choirs which Grandpa sang in with Brother
Christensen conducting sang two numbers.  Dad talked, Bishop Nicholas talked,
etc.  Our young Marrieds Group here in the ward sent a bouquet of flowers out. 
Blaine and Launa Barrows were the leaders.  Dick &amp; Barbara Brower and Kent
and Deon Horton came out to the mortuary which I thought was very sweet and
thoughtful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>From Grandpa's obituary: Sunset -
George Labrum Bushnell 1741 N. Main died this morning in the Dee Hospital in
Ogden of a heart attack.  Mr. Bushnell was born June
 12, 1892, in Meadow, Utah a son of Howard B. and Mary Elizabeth Labrum
Bushnell.  He was educated in Meadow and Fillmore.  He was retired from Hill
Air Force Base as a warehouseman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            He was married to Iva Bell Swallow on Sept
 29, 1915, in the Manti Temple.  He was a high priest in the Sunset Second
Ward.  He served a mission in the Western States and four stake missions.  He
had been a member of the Clearfield-Sunset Priesthood Chorus, was past Sunday
School superintendent and stake mission president and had been a temple worker.

<p class=MsoNormal><b>GRANDPA BUSHNELL'S PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE</b> - written 11 Oct.
1958 while convalescent after a heart attack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I AM NOT AFRAID&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>I'm not afraid to die.  This is not
boasting.  I am not brave, I fear a lot of things.  I often cringe before the
threats of life.  In the face of great calamity, I might play the coward, but I
am not afraid of death.  I fear it only for the ones I love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When they die the sun will set at noon
for me and I shall limp about in darkness.  And when I die I fear for them. 
For no man has lived so worthless but someone adored him over much and mourned
him when he was no more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            But for myself alone I am not afraid of death. 
Why should I be?  It's just as natural as birth.  I do not know for sure what
life may be after death.  But I am sure I shall try to live the best I can, so
I may receive the reward I am deserving of.  I do not know for sure what it was
before birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            If life is everlasting which I am sur.  I lived
many years ago before my spirit entered this earthly body.  My spirit mingled
and associated with many numbers of spirits, many who have had the privilege of
coming to earth and entering earthly bodies as I have done.  Then after this
spirit of mine leaves this earthly body it shall go back to mingle again with
those spirits who have lived true honorable lives while here upon the earth. 
There they shall be given Celestial bodies and shall live for time and
eternity, even endless days.  For eternal life must be without beginning of
years as well as without endless days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Nothing proves that I see not beyond the ground
walls of the grave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This I know as far as human mind may know that I
shall live always.  This is my faith.  It presents no tangible evidence for
human courts of inquiry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have what Prophets name as inner witness to
eternal life.  But this is not easily geared down by chains of logic to solid
traction wheels of demonstrable truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also have a most convincing record &quot;The
Bible&quot; which tells of one who conquered death and was resurrected proving
that we will live again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I was not there to prove it myself, nor have I
ever met a man returned from out the boundless deep who has been resurrected
who verifies my faith.  I only feel through inspiration within myself that it
is true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            That satisfaction, that knowledge, that faith,
nothing can destroy.  This life is on the duller side of death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            And even though this faith were vain, I am not
afraid.  If death was all the nothingness could do nothing to me.  But this I
know this life is but the beginning and can do everything to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I'm so afraid of so many things, life's problems
frighten me.  I hide from quite imaginary foes.  But I am not afraid of death. 
I know that my Redeemer lives, and if I conduct my life as our Savior has set
the example and plan I shall be able to mingle with him and my loved ones who
have gone before.  For they are not lost, but gone to a better place to live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I want to live honorably among my fellow man. 
My desire is to make others happy.  THIS TO ME IS TRUE HAPPINESS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            And I can say with all truthfulness as Job said
&quot;I know that my Redeemer lives and that he shall stand at the later day
upon the earth, and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold
and not another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I want to live that when death does come that I
will e able to meet my Mother and Father, put my arms around them and thank
them for teaching unto me the true plan of salvation, and for instilling unto
my soul a testimony of the Gospel.  That I with my lovely wife who has been
true and a real Latter-day Saint Companion, and also our family may be exalted
in the kingdom of our eternal father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I do know it shall be if I and they live the
commandments and teachings given through our Savior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            THIS IS MY SOUL DESIRE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>GRANDMA BUSHNELL: (find
her pictures)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grandma was such a sweet tiny little lady.  Her back was
humped over.  I'm sure she had scoliosis like my mother and I have inherited. 
She probably also had osteoporosis like my mother has.  Grandma didn't go to
chiropractors (not sure if they had them at that time) so her back hurt most of
the time.   She was a hard worker.  She enjoyed working in her garden and
flower garden.  She raised seven children.  She didn't have the modern
conveniences we have today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma worried a lot, so I think her nerves
caused a lot of her health problems.  She also had numb spells where her arms
and other parts of her body would go numb at times.  The doctors couldn't find
out what caused them.  Since I go to Chiropractors, I wonder if she had pinched
nerves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We always figured grandma would die first
because of her bad health. Because Grandma had a lot of health problems, she
had to take tea as one of her medications.  She argued with the doctor about
taking it - as she said it would make her break the Word of Wisdom.  Grandma
was very active and faithful in the church and she had always kept the Word of Wisdom. 
The doctor told her she could take pills instead, but they wouldn't do her near
as much good, and they would have the same nutrients in that tea did - that tea
was a medication.  She did finally consent to take it, but she wouldn't put any
sugar or milk in it.  She told us that if it had to be a medication, it would
have to taste like it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Grandma moved from Meadow to Sunset, she
had long hair and she wore it in a braid which she wrapped around the back of
her head.  She let me brush her hair and even braid it as I got older.  She
finally got it cut off and she looked really nice with her short haircut and
perm.  I had a talent of fixing hair so many times when I was a teenager and
young married and lived close by, I would wash and set her hair and comb it out
for her.  Many times, she would ask me to straighten it so it would still look
nice when she was going someplace or having company.  I did the same for Mom,
however, Mom had a hairdresser and had it washed and set every two weeks, so
she would have me straighten it during that time.  If Marie couldn’t take her
or she was ill and had to cancel, she would have me do it.  Later when we moved
back to Utah and were living in Sunset or Layton, I would cut dad’s hair.  He
would say afterwards “Do I look 10 years younger?”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma loved her family and enjoyed her
grandchildren.  We loved going to her house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma Bushnell had a very hard time after
Grandpa died.  She had so many things wrong with her health and she worried so
much that she went downhill very rapidly.  In October of 1964 she passed away. 
The doctors had thought she had pernisha Anemia.  Her blood was very low and
due to this she would faint easily, was very weak, and felt lousy.  Finally,
they put her in the hospital.  They took tests &amp; X-rays and found she had
cancer.  They hadn't found it before as the shadow of her heart covered the
tumor.  At that time Bryce was down at B.Y.U. for his three months schooling in
the Spanish language prior to leaving for his mission to Uruguay.  He phoned Mom and told her that since his plane would be leaving at 6:00 a.m. on
Tuesday morning they had received permission (all the missionaries leaving for
Uruguay) to have their parents and families come down to the Y on Monday
afternoon and visit with them.  When Grandma heard this, she started to get
better for she loved Bryce so very much (he was her favorite) He loved grandma
and had always teased her and gotten extra close to her.  She wanted to go down
with us to see Bryce before he left.  She did get better, at least enough to be
able to go with us.  Julie, Bryce's girlfriend, went down also with us.  We had
a wonderful time being with Bryce and seeing him off the next morning.  <b>One
thing I regret</b> was that Grandma had asked me if, when we were at the park
before Bryce came, would I straighten her hair as it didn’t look very good with
being in the hospital.  I told her I would, but I forgot.  She mentioned to Mom
after we had gone home, that she wished I would have fixed her hair so that she
could have looked nice.  The next day Grandma was back in the hospital and she
continually got worse.  Mom, Aunt Joy, and myself took turns staying with
Grandma.  <b>Another regret</b> was the morning that Grandma passed away, I had
stayed with her from 6:00 in the morning until 10:00.
Grandma was very sick and had pneumonia.  She was in an oxygen tent.  She could
hardly breathe and was so miserable.  At one time, she asked me if I would ask
the nurse if she could have some more pain medication.  I found the nurse and
asked her, and she was rude and said “Oh, these old people, they just think
they can be waited on all the time and have whatever they want.  No, she can’t
have any more pain medication at this time.”  I felt bad, but didn’t stand up
to her like I wish I had.  When I told Grandma, she just sighed and looked sad
and miserable.  I don’t know why they couldn’t have given her more to make her
more comfortable as she was dying.  I get angry at that nurse whenever I think
of the last days with Grandma.  Sister Blaine, a friend and neighbor, came to
relieve me. I went home never to see grandma again in this life.  I had just
gotten home when the nurse called and said Grandma was worse and for me to come
up.  By the time I got there she had died.  I thought they had called Mom, but
they hadn't so I had to call her and break the news.  When Grandma's body was
in the casket, Mom &amp; I didn't like the way they had fixed her hair - it
didn't look like her, so Mom asked me to straighten it, which I did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved her very much and I have surely missed
her.  We have all missed her, especially Mom.  They lived next door, so Mom
&amp; Grandma did a lot together.  They were very good friends.  Georgia
had been spending the nights (sleeping there with her) so Grandma wouldn't be
alone at night as Grandma was frightened of the dark, so Georgia
was surely saddened.  Bryce, when he found out, was very sad.  He said he had
surely hoped that she would still be alive when he returned home and that had
been Grandma's wish that she could be alive to see Bryce when he returned from
his mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            From Grandma's obituary: Sunset - Mrs. Iva Bell
Swallow Bushnell, 70 of 1741 N. Main, died Thursday in the Dee Hospital in
Ogden of natural causes.  Mrs. Bushnell was born Aug.
 6, 1894, in Meadow, Ut, a daughter of Charles &amp; Isabell Deardon Swallow. 
She was married to George L. Bushnell on Sept.
 29, 1915, in the Manti Temple.  He died Dec.
 29, 1962.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            She came to Sunset 23 years ago from Meadow.  A
member of the LDS Church, she worked in the Primary and had been a Relief
Society visiting teacher.  She was active in Daughters of Utah Pioneers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Surviving are four sons, Howard Elmo Bushnell,
Henrieville, Utah, Dean Charles Bushnell, El Cajon, Calif.; George Junior
Bushnell, Bountiful, Van Ladd Bushnell, Cedar City, two daughters, Mrs. Glendon
(Mildred Hope) Porter, Sunset, Mrs. John C. (Elaine)(goes by Joy to family)
Ashman, Fillmore, 24 grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, 4 brothers &amp; 5
sisters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <b>I REMEMBER -</b> grandma praising me for the
way I have frosted and decorated cakes after Ken &amp; I were married.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma asked me to wash down her kitchen walls
and ceiling and she paid me $5.00.  She had wallpaper on the front room walls
so when I cleaned them I would use a cake of cleaner to do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma was a good cook and a good housekeeper. 
She gave us grandchildren pie, cake or cookies many times when we would go over
to her house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Several times when Mom &amp; I were planning to
go shopping in Ogden for clothes, etc., Mom would ask Grandma if she felt like
going with us and she would say &quot;Oh, you and Mae just need to be by
yourselves, you don't need me tagging along&quot;.  I told her that if she felt
like it, we wanted her along - that it made it more special, which it did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When I would invite Mom, Dad &amp; family over
for Sunday dinner or Family Night, etc., I'd also invite Grandma as Grandpa had
passed away and she'd say &quot;Oh, you don't have to feel that you need to
invite me every time.&quot;  But we enjoyed having Grandma.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember listening to Grandma &amp; Grandpa's
old records on their old record player.  I enjoyed that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Christmas morning was also special as we'd go
over to Grandpa and Grandma's and they would always have something for us.  Not
a lot as they didn't have much money, but that didn't matter.  We always
appreciated what they gave us and the love that went with it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandma &amp; Grandpa loved going to parades -
so our family always went to the 24th of July Parade in Ogden every year.  We
would park the car and walk carrying our lawn chairs and blankets.  I looked
forward to that and being together.  Ken doesn't like parades - so our family
hasn't gone to many.  I remember taking Jeff to one in Layton when he was
young.  And last year (1997) Ken &amp; I took our grandchildren, David &amp;
Tayler, to the Layton parade.  Ken was sweet and knew I would like to go - so
suggested we take them.  I was delighted and really enjoyed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I have some regrets of those last few days with
Grandma.  One was when we went down to see Bryce, she had asked if I would comb
her hair to make it look nice to see Bryce.  I fixed Grandma's hair much of the
time for her.  I guess that is one of my talents as I have always been able to
fix my hair the way I like and set and comb out, and recomb both Grandma
Bushnell's hair and my mothers.  I have been happy to be able to do this
service for them.  Anyway, at this particular time, I forgot to comb her hair
for her.  She had asked me when she got into the car to go down to Provo. 
I intended to comb it as soon as we got there, but I was excited to see Bryce
and we all got to talking, then went to a park and had lunch, etc.  Grandma
told Mom later that she felt bad I hadn't combed it as she sure didn't look
very pretty with lying in a hospital bed and she wanted to look nice for Bryce
and everyone.  I wish she had reminded me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The other regret was just a few days before she
passed away, Grandma had phenomena as well as cancer, which at that time they
thought she had Pernisha Anemia and were treating her for that. She was having
such a hard time breathing that they had her in an oxygen tent.  She was so
miserable and in so much pain that she asked me if I would ask the nurse if she
could have some more pain medication.  I went to find the nurse, but this nurse
was annoyed and said that she didn't need it, that old people like her just
complain and want lots of attention.  I should have known better because
Grandma was such a sweet little woman and she didn't complain.  She was really
bad before she would ever say anything.  Many times, when she was really sick
or in pain and we would ask her how she was, she would say &quot;oh, pretty
good&quot;.  Anyway, I told grandma that the nurse said she didn't need any. 
That hurt Grandma that the nurse felt that way, and that I didn't do anything
more to try to get help &amp; relief for her.  I remember thinking that maybe
the nurse was right.  I've felt like kicking myself many times since then -
that I felt that way and that I didn't do more when she needed me.  I know now
that she really was terribly sick and in so much pain.  She was dying so it
sure wouldn’t have hurt to give her more pain medication, even if it wasn’t
time.  They came to weigh her a little later and I hated to see them have to
pick her up and put her on the scales, she was too miserable and so thin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Grandpa &amp; Grandma Bushnell</b> lived in Meadow until
after we built on the upstairs of our home in Sunset.  Then they sold out and
my parents talked them into moving up and purchasing the lot next to our home. 
While their home was being built, they rented an apartment about a block away
on the highway which a Mr. Randall owned, and then they moved into our basement
for awhile.  It was great having my grandparents so close.</p>

align=left hspace=12>I remember Grandpa as being a short, quiet, gray haired
man with a mustache.  I have heard, and his own autobiography states that he
believes his growth was stunted because of too much really hard work.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I loved going to Grandpa &amp; Grandmas as they
had a farm up in Richfield (southwest of Morgan) Grandpa would let us ride Old
Doll or Old Dan, his work horses.  They were really big.  One 4th of July when
my cousin, Joanne, and I were riding one of these horses, Hal lit a firecracker
and threw it under the horse.  Of course, it started running and bucking and we
were thrown off, but not seriously hurt, thank goodness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Grandpa coming in the house at night
after his days work on the farm, and all of us sitting down at the table to eat
supper which usually consisted of bread and milk, fruit, jam and honey, etc. 
We children preferred crumbs and milk, partly because it was fun grinding the
hard bread into crumbs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Grandpa was a scriptorium.  He loved the
scriptures.  He read and pondered them a lot.  Dad said that Grandpa wasn't a
very good farmer and partly because his mind wasn't on it.  Instead of thinking
what he could do to improve the farm, while he worked, he would be thinking and
pondering the scriptures.  He wrote lots of poetry and one was &quot;Morning
Glory of the Soul&quot; which he thought of while he was weeding the Morning
Glory weed out of his farm.  Dad said that people came from all around to talk
to Grandpa about the scriptures - as he knew them so well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Grandpa and Grandma Porter going on
some trips or just for a ride with us sometimes, and we loved having them with
us.  It made it more special to have them along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>GRANDMA PORTER:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I remember Grandma for her love of reading, her
ability to memorize and give talks, readings, poetry, scriptures, etc. 
Whenever we played church games such as &quot;Seek&quot; or &quot;Zion&quot; with her, she always won because she knew the scriptures so well.  She loved to
have her family around her.  I enjoyed visiting with grandma, and she would get
out her scrap books and photo albums and enjoy showing them to me and
explaining each picture, card, newspaper clipping, etc.  I'm sure most of the
family members remember times of reminiscing with grandma with her books and
albums.  Perhaps I got my love of scrapbooks &amp; photo albums from her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When Sandi was little, we'd go to visit
grandma.  She lived in one of my parent's duplex apartments at the time and
she'd always have a cookie or piece of candy for Sandi.  She wanted lots of
grandchildren and great grandchildren.  When I was just a young girl, I
remember grandma saying she would be glad when I got married and had some great
grandchildren for her.  I remember being mortified at even the thought of
marriage.  I didn't even like boys at that time of my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also remember how grandma hated to waste
anything.  While growing up, when grandma would help Mom and I clear up the
dishes after a meal, I was surprised at how she would clean out the dishes and
bowls so not a crumb was left.  These leftovers would be put in the
refrigerator to be sued at a later meal.  I'm sure she learned this because of
the scarcity of food and money to buy food while she was raising her family. 
She taught me how important it is not to waste and I'm trying to teach this to
my family.  I've heard someone say that some women throw out more with a
teaspoon than their husbands can bring home with a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grandma Porter passed away June
 4, 1965.  She has been very healthy all of her life.  These last few years her
eyesight and hearing were bad, but other than that and gas pains which kept her
from sleeping good at night, she felt fine.  This last Christmas she had a
slight stroke and then in April she had a bad stroke and was more or less in a
coma until she passed away in June.  She was put in the hospital at first, then
they put her in a nice nursing home, but Aunt Maurine wanted to have her there
in the apartment with her, so she could take care of her and be near her.  The
other members of the family were reluctant, but finally they consented, and
Grandma was with Aunt Maurene for about a month.  Aunt Maurine had studied to
become a nurse, years earlier, so she knew what to do for her.</p>

about here for our <b>Glendon Porter Reunion at Heber Valley Campgrounds</b> on
July 27<sup>th</sup> &amp; 28<sup>th</sup>.  <u>Our campground area is “Sarah,
Site 1”.</u>  We have 4 cabins in our camp site so room for 64 people.  At last
count, we will only have 48 at max.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mae’s
family</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> - I think we have 20 coming
from our family - us, Mike, David &amp; Jeff and families.  Scott isn’t sure,
but hopefully they can come.  From <b>Bryce’s family</b>, Nolan and Chad and
their families are the only ones able to come.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Terry’s

in Alaska with Terry, Angela and their family since the beginning of June, but
she was excited about this reunion and didn’t want to miss it so they are
flying home on the 26<sup>6h</sup> so they can be with us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>From
<b>Georgia’s family</b>, they plan on 10 – Georgia &amp; Rick, Kristy, Brian
&amp; family and Nathan &amp; Jessica.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Facilities</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> - we have nice restrooms in our camp site with hot
water, flushing toilets &amp; showers.  We have a nice eating pavilion with
tables &amp; benches, grills, fridge, sinks, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dinner
on Friday night</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> - we plan to eat our
Friday evening meal at 5 pm.  Remember, we have asked each family to bring
either a salad or desert.  If we have leftovers, we can finish them off with
our Hogies for our Saturday afternoon meal.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Campfire
program </span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>on Friday night will start at
7 pm - Remember to come prepared to have either a talent from your family or
someone to give a memory they have of Grandpa or Grandma Porter or both.  The
camp site has logs around the fire area, but the <u>adults might want to bring
lawn chairs</u> to sit in.  We can do some campfire singing also and after the
closing prayer, those who want to might stay and roast marshmallows &amp;
visit.  If you have roasting sticks, bring them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Breakfast</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> - we will have breakfast of pancakes, bacon, eggs,
juice &amp; milk at 10 am.  Since we have to be out by 5 pm, we felt it would
be best to have a late breakfast and an early dinner at 3:00 pm.  If your
children will have trouble waiting until 10, you might want to bring them
something to tide them over. <b> </b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dinner</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> - we will have Hogies, chips, veggie trays &amp;

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>            Activities </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>– they have a volleyball court in our area. We will
have games for the younger children and some board &amp; card games for youth
&amp; adults.   The camp also does challenge courses.  You could make reservations
for these in advance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>            <b>Cost</b> – the
cost for the camp site was $160.00 so it will cost each family $12.00.  We
don’t have the cost of the food yet, but it shouldn’t be too expensive since we
are having simple meals and you are bringing salads &amp; deserts.  </span></p>

snacks</b> – If you want additional drinks or snacks for your family, feel free

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>I Am The Flag of the United States
of America&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>I was born on June 14, 1777 in Philadelphia and I am as old as my nation.
There the Continental Congress adopted my stars and stripes as the national
flag.  My thirteen stripes alternating red and white, with a union of thirteen
white stars in a field of blue, represented a new constellation, a new nation
dedicated to the personal and religious liberty of mankind.  Today fifty stars
signal from my union, one for each of the fifty sovereign states in the
greatest constitutional republic the world has ever known.  My colors symbolize
the patriotic ideals and spiritual qualities of the citizens of my country.  My
red stripes proclaim the fearless courage and integrity of American men and
boys and the self-sacrifice and devotion of American mothers and daughters.</p>

<p>My white stripes stand for liberty and equality for all.  My blue is the
blue of heaven, loyalty, and faith.  I represent these eternal principles:
liberty, justice, and humanity.  I embody American freedom: freedom of speech,
religion, assembly, the press, and the sanctity of the home.  I typify that
indomitable spirit of determination brought to my land by Christopher Columbus
and by all my forefathers –&nbsp;the Pilgrims, Puritans, settlers at James Town
and Plymouth.</p>

<p>I am a living symbol of my nation's law: The Constitution of the United
States and the Bill of Rights.  I voice Abraham Lincoln's philosophy: “A
government of the people, by the people, for the people.”  I stand guard over
my nation's schools, the seedbed of good citizenship and true patriotism.  I am
displayed in every school room throughout my nation; every school yard has a
flag pole for my display.  Daily, thousands upon thousands of boys and girls
pledge their allegiance to me and my country.  I have my own law-Public Law
829, “The Flag Code”&nbsp;- which definitely states my correct use and display
for all occasions and situations.</p>

<p>I have my special day, Flag Day.&nbsp; June 14 is set aside to honor my
birth.  Americans, I am the sacred emblem of your country.&nbsp; I symbolize
your birthright, your heritage of liberty purchased with blood and sorrow.  I
am your title deed of freedom, which is yours to enjoy and hold in trust for
posterity.</p>

<p>If you fail to keep this sacred trust inviolate, if I am nullified and
destroyed, you and your children will become slaves to dictators and despots. 
Eternal vigilance is your price of freedom.  As you see me silhouetted against
the peaceful skies of my country, remind yourself that I am the flag of your
country, that I stand for what you are -no more, no less.  Guard me well, lest
your freedom perish from the earth.  Dedicate your lives to those principles
for which I stand: “One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all.”</p>

<p>I was created in freedom.&nbsp; I made my first appearance in a battle for
human liberty.  God grant that I may spend eternity in my “land of the free and
the home of the brave” and that I shall ever be known as “Old Glory,”&nbsp;the
flag of the United States of America.</p>

But this is predicated upon the person's becoming in every Facet an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.</span></pre><pre><span

is so true, and so many people in the United States are on Welfare.  Some

there are many who can and should work to provide for themselves and their

government to take care of them.  That is sad for them and for all of us who
pay taxes which pays for these people </span></p>
