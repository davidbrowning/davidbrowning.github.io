<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
still isn’t feeling well.  I prepared breakfast of hot cakes and eggs for us. 
After cleaning up the dishes I worked on my 2013 journal entries getting them
ready to print.  I bought a cord for the printer so that I could connect the
printer to my computer without having to move the computer to the printer, but
I think I will return it.  It costs $26.61 and I have a hard time spending that
much for it.  I bought a Sub-Way for our lunch.  I worked more on backing up
files and caring for Mae.  I am afraid that I lost some of Mae’s picture and I
am not sure how.  I got dinner with Mae’s help.  The day has sure gone by
fast.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
let Mae sleep in and I got myself off to work.  I woke shortly after 3AM and
couldn’t go back to sleep.  My runs went well.  With my grade school children,
I asked two girls, Mattie and Hannah to be bus monitors for me.  We started
getting each child assigned to a seat, so that should help with bus discipline,
although I really don’t have many problems with ether of my schools.  I took
almost an hour nap in-between my AM and PM runs.  I have worked on back-ups of
computer files and worked on my journals also today.  I watched a “Gun Smoke”
and “Bonanza” series while I made up some capsules.  I also finished up my Home
Teaching report before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Again
this morning Mae was under the weather.  My runs went well although I was quite
tired after the morning run.  When I got home I took care of the chickens and
then took a nap.  I got a call from the Dispatch office asking me to take a
mid-day run.  The only problem, they forgot to call me earlier, so when they
called me at 12:45 PM, I was supposed to have been at the school to pick-up the
children.  I was ½ hour late getting their and by that time most parents had
came and got their children.  We took the rest home and then I went back to the
compound and took my regular PM run.  After my run I came home.  I realized
that I had dropped my cell-phone somewhere.  I got Mae and we drove back to the
compound.  I found my phone by my bus.  We then drove out to Sandi and Nick’s
so that we could visit with Shellie before she and Jase returns home tomorrow. 
We had a good evening getting home about 11PM.  I didn’t feel like going right
to bed so we watched a good movie on TV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                 We
slept in until almost 11AM.  Mae is feeling a little better today.  I spent a
lot of time working on seating charts for my Elementary Bus Run.  I tried to
take care of Mae, although she feels some better I don’t want her to get back
down.  This evening we watched a show on TV but we were disappointed in the
show.  I think that it was the first show staring Jimmy Stewart that I didn’t
enjoy.  We have early meeting time this year, so that will be an adjustment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
had to get up early this morning as we now have the early meeting schedule.  I
also have our High Priest Group Leadership meeting at 8AM, plus the High Priest
has the chairs to set up this week and next week.  Meetings went very well.  I
didn’t think that Mae would be going as she still doesn’t feel well, that’s
really not true, because I know Mae and so it didn’t surprise me, when I found
that she was there.  After meetings we both laid down in the recliners and
slept for a while.  When I got up I worked on my journals.  Mae did stay down a
little.  I cooked dinner for us, trying to keep Mae down as much as possible. 
We had trout and hash brown yam.  They were very good.  I worked longer on my
journal getting another two pages typed.  We watched a show on DVD before going
to bed, that was sure good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
runs went well this morning.  I had some corrections to make on my bus seating
assignments but I think it is going to work quite well.  Mae still isn’t
feeling well so I let her sleep in this morning.  Mae has tried to do some
things today but gets tired very fast.  When I came home from my PM runs, I
took care of the chickens.  Heather and her four children plus Jamie and her
son were upstairs visiting with Bob.  Bob knocked and asked us to come upstairs
to visit with them.  Mae and I went up for a little while then Mae came back
down to get our dinner.  I visited for a while and enjoyed being with them.  I
tried to explain Bob’s condition with his hearing to Heather and she
understood.  It was good of them to come and visit their Grandfather.  Mae
cooked a very nice dinner, cooking cauliflower and making it taste like mashed
potatoes.  I cleaned up the dishes while Mae read from the book “Heroes from
the Book of Mormon” which is taken from many General Authorities.  We read the
first chapter by Russell M. Nelson.  I finished this entrance into my journal
and then we went to bed.</p>

woke early again this morning but was able to sleep in the recliner for a
while.  I let Mae sleep in again and I got myself off to work.  My runs went
well but I did get some changes to the seating arrangement again.  In between
the AM and PM runs I helped Mae get some of the Christmas cartons in so she
could pack the Christmas decorations and dishes put away.  I also got a short
nap.  I stopped at the store for a few items and returned the printer cord I
bought last week, it was too short.  I took the Christmas cartons back to the
shed and took care of the chickens before dinner.  We were going to start
watching the DVD set by Hugh Nibley, on the Pearl of Great Price but I spent
most of this evening working on my bus charts for the seating assignments for
the grade school.  This is taking more time than I thought it would but I think
it will be a good thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep well so she had most of my breakfast out for me and I got myself
off to work.  It is snowing lightly today so the roads are somewhat bad.  My
runs went well this morning.  I took a nap after getting home.  I ordered some
Dr. Scholls sandals on the internet this morning.  I also called and ordered
some of my milk supplement from Nancy.  It will take a couple of days to get it
in.  I had tried to call Lee Brown before I went to work this afternoon but he
didn’t get my message until I had left.  He did call and visit with Mae for a
few minutes.  My PM runs went well, but I was sure tired when I got home.  I
took care of the chickens and was going to clean off the snow from the walks
and driveway, but (I believe Glen Higgley) had plowed the driveway and
sidewalks.  Mae has been preparing all day for a Relief Society meeting
tonight.  She left about 6:30PM.  I watched the last half of two shows and
started a 3<sup>rd</sup> when Scott and his family came to return the picnic
tables they had borrowed.  Mae came home just as they were getting ready to
leave.  It was good to see them for a few minutes.  Mishelle is sure having
back problems.  I finished this entrance after they left and before we went to
bed.</p>

was sleeping in the recliner when I got up, so I had her get back in bed.  By
the time I had showered she had got up and got my breakfast.  After I went to
work she did go back to bed and sleep longer.  My bus runs went well although
it snowed and the roads were slippery in areas.  Mae was up when I got home and
had got started in a western show so we finished it together.  </p>

went well this morning but the shop didn’t get the extra things done that I
need on my bus.  After getting home and eating a little, I laid down for a
nap.  The dispatch called and asked me to take the mid-day run again.  Again I
was already late and when I asked why I wasn’t notified earlier?  They said
that they had put the information in my box.  Any way I took it although there
were some upset mothers.  I stayed and took my PM runs and they went well. 
After work I took Mae out to eat for her Birthday that we missed because she
was sick.  After eating we went to Jeff and Gail’s.  Jeff has been trying to
change out his bathroom fixtures to bronze trim but has had trouble taking the
old bathtub drain.  I went in to see the problem.  The drain was just to set,
so I took a metal cutting blade in the sawsall and carefully made some cuts in
the fitting and then knocked the unit loose with a screwdriver and hammer. 
Gail, Mae, Jeff and I then played a game of Hearts.  It was a long game this
time but Jeff finally won.  It was mid=night before we got home and went to
bed.</p>

had a Relief Society meeting to attend so I got up and fixed us some
breakfast.  I got some tools and went over to Jeff’s and finished changing the
fixture trim for him.  He helped me until 11AM when he and his family went to a
show.  I finished up by noon and went home.  Mae had gone shopping for a few
items after her meeting so she jot home just before I did.  We got some lunch
and after cleaning up we took a nap.  I only slept for 20 minutes but I let Mae
sleep longer.  I worked the rest of the afternoon and evening on my personal
histories.  </p>

was a regular Sunday schedule and our meeting went well.  We invited David and
his family to come for dinner with us.  Mae prepared a very nice chicken dinner
with all the trimmings.  David wasn’t feeling the best so he took a short nape
after dinner.  We played a few games but at 5PM David had to leave for a Cub
Scout meeting that was to be held at their place.  Mae and I played a game of
Knock in which Mae beat me.  I then wrote a though for the Ward News Letter and
got it E-mailed to John Sliger.  I got my journal entry typed for today and
worked a little on my 1970 – 1974 Diary entrances before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Work
went well this morning although the master switch to the loading lights shorted
and caused sparks.  I left it on top to repair after the morning run.  When I
went in for the afternoon run the switch had been replaced.  When I got home
this afternoon, I took care of the chickens.  I need to do some work on the
feeder.  I did turn the chick box on its side and adjust the heat light.  This
way they will have more room to run.  We got 13 eggs today, that is the most we
have collected with these chickens in a day’s time.  This evening we went over
to Smokey and Silvia Barns to visit and played games with them.  It was a great
evening even if Silvia won the games.  She might be losing her memory but she
can sure play games.  It is now 9:20PM so we had better go to bed.</p>

I got home from the bus run this morning, Mae went to use her I-pad and
couldn’t find it.  When she got worried I suggested that she call Mike.  I
think that Mike installed a search program that will find her I-pod’s
location.  Before she did that she went in the bedroom for prayer.  When she
came out she called the Dr. Office where she had taken Sister Reed yesterday
and they had found it.  I took her over to get it.  We also stopped at Greens
Feed and bought some Laying Mash, and then we got the car washed.  My PM runs
went well.  I stopped at Mary’s Health store and picked up some capsules.  I
then went over to the credit union and deposited a check for Mae.  Mae prepared
a nice dinner when I got home.  We then went up and watched a show that Bob had
recorded.  Today is Bob’s Birthday and I think he wants the company.  The show
was “Mr. Lucky” with Cary Grant and Larine Day.  We had seen it before but a
long time ago so it was good to see it again.  Bob told us that Larine Day
worked in the Los Angeles Temple with Aunt Vida.  I had never heard that
before.  It is now almost 9 PM so we had better go to bed, morning comes fast.</p>

woke at 3AM and Mae wasn’t in bed.  I checked and she was the recliner
sleeping, so I went back to bed and slept for a couple more hours.  I was going
to get myself off to work but Mae woke and helped me get off.  My runs went well
and when I returned to the compound the bus wash was open, so I washed my bus. 
Mae had a sandwich and protein drink ready for me when I got home.  I went up
to help Bob with some papers he needs to fill out.  We got watching a show and
finished it before doing the papers.  The papers were just to verify that he
was still occupying the home as his primary residency.  I wonder if it is in
the best interest for all concerned if plans weren’t made for that to change. 
That is one thing Mae and I don’t see eye to eye on.  She feels we should just
wait until something happens on its own.  My pm run went well.  This evening I
worked on my Diary entrances.  Mae has been working on her personal history
quite a bit today.  We did watch a show on TV that was quite cute.  It’s
getting late so we will quite for today and go to bed.</p>

a nap.  I then started on my Diary entering.  It sometimes take me a while to
enter just a few days as I elaborate with much more detail, where I now have
room to explain some of those short entries.  My pm runs also went well.  When
I got home Mae’s Visiting Teachers were here.  I fed the chickens and gathered
the eggs.  I brought in a squash to see if it was ok.  I believe they are so I
cut this one up, it looks and smells good.  I gave some to Mae’s Visiting
Teachers and will take some to my Home Teaching Families also.  Bob and I went
home teaching to the Casey’s.  We got the same short doorstep welcome and I
gave him some squash before we left.  We then had a nice visit with the
Johnston’s.  Bob gave the lesson but he wasn’t able to hear anything else that
was said.  When Mae and I were ready to go to bed, I had to go upstairs and
have him turn the volume on the TV down.  He didn’t realize it way up.  His
hearing is really getting much worse.</p>

with Dispatch to see if they planned on me for the bus 98 mid-day run or not. 
They said that they were not planning on me.  I was quite cold when I got home
so after a small snack, Mae and I laid down for a nap.  Mae put the electric
blanket over me and I finally got warn and slept.  My PM went well.  This

took Mae out to eat at Sizzler, fowling the session.  After eating we went to
Costco for a few items.  We then stopped at the grocery store before going

did not sleep well last night.  I was in quite a lot of pain.  I noticed it
coming on while we were at Costco’s.  I did eat one ½ slice of toast and had
Ranch Dressing on my salad, but that is the only thing that I can think of that
might have caused it.  I attended the High Priest leadership meeting and then
came home and slept for an hour.  I went back to Sacrament meeting.  Today was
our Ward conference.  Bishop Hatch and President Puffer were the speakers and
both gave very good talks.  Our Ward Choir sang “Praise to the Man” and
although we hadn’t had a choir practice but just sang it from the Hymn Book, we
had a large number join in singing.  Mae and I had Temple Recommend interviews
with the Bishopric after meeting.  We didn’t go Home Teaching or Visiting
Teaching as to Sister Fallis, as she isn’t feeling well.    Scott and their
family came over for dinner and after eating we played some games.  After they
left, we relaxed and watched a TV show.  Because I don’t have to work tomorrow
we watched a second movie that was totally a downer.</p>

and I worked on the chicken feeder, the water purifier along with several other
small items.  I spent a lot of time working on correcting an error that
occurred on my 1974 journal.  I believe I was able to salvage 99 % of it so I
felt good about that.  Mae made turkey soup for dinner today.  We always save
the left over carcass of Thanksgiving turkeys, boiling then until the leftover
meat fell off.  Then the vegetables and seasoning are added to make a choice
soup.  Today’s was no different and we enjoyed for our evening meal.  We
watched a “Gun Smoke” series and then read most of the first lesson from the
Relief Society and Melchizedek Priesthood manual.  We were late getting to bed.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 4:40AM and Mae was not in bed.  She didn’t sleep very well so I let her
go back to bed and I got myself off to work.  When I got into the bus compound
I realized that all the busses were still in the parking lot.  I was a little
early for work so I checked out and started my bus.  I then called into the
office and found out that today is also a day off.  I really don’t understand
why but I came back home.  Mae was still asleep so I covered up on the recliner
and went back to sleep.  Mae got up at 8AM and came into the front room. 
Seeing all my pocket items left on the cupboard top, she gasped in surprise. 
That woke me and I said good morning.  I worked on my journal entries while she
took a shower and got dressed.  I prepared her some breakfast.  We texted David
and told him that I would be going to Vernal with him also.  He text back with
“<span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span> that sounds great”.  I learned
something about my computer when I put the : - ) into my keyboard as it
automatically makes a <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span>.  That is
cute.  We took the gifts that we had bought for Deven and Betsy’s daughter with
us and stopped for a few minutes and gave them to Betsey.  We then drove on up
to David’s.  We got to visited with Shawna for a few minutes before David
arrived home.  David, Mae and I then drove to Vernal where we watched Morgan
High vs Dushane High.  It was a very good game but the first quarter Dushane
kept the lead, then the second quarter it stayed almost even.  After returning
from the half time break Morgan kept the lead winning 68 to 48.  It was a good
game and Tyler played very well.  Although it was a long drive it was great
visiting and the time passed fast.  Mae and I got home about 8:30PM.  I filled
out my journal and we soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
got up with me and got me off to work.  My runs went well although one of my
grade school children got sick to her stomach and throw up.  I had to clean
that up.  When I returned to the compound I got more paper towels and garbage
sacks, before coming on home.  Mae fixed us a small snack before we laid down
and took a short nap.  I had trouble getting awake so slept for almost an hour. 
I worked on my Diary transcribing but that has been slow because I have
expanded on the Short Dairy to give it meaning.  After my PM run I worked
longer on my Diary until I went visiting as the High Priest Group leadership
and the Bishopric.  I went with Bishop Hatch and we visit Sister Fernandez and
with Brother Tayler’s wife and children.  After getting home, I worked a little
longer on my Diary and finished today’s journal entry before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep much last night so I had her go back to bed and I got myself off. 
We had heavy fog this morning.  My runs went well.  I worked on my Diary most
of the time between runs.  After my PM run I just relaxed and watched 2 last
half TV shows.  I did that because there wasn’t much else to watch.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
sweetheart slept better last night and was up to get me off to work.  She sure
is special.  When I got home Mae had a snack for us and then I took a nap.  I
worked on my Diary again.  This afternoon’s routs went well and I got home in
time to go with Mae to Tylor’s basket ball game.  Morgan played Park City and
Morgan won 58 to 52.  It was a good game.  Mae and I then went to Jeff and
Gail’s where we tended the children while Jeff and Gail went out to eat.  We
prepared dinner for us and the children.  After eating, Mae read scriptures
with the children while I cleaned up the dishes.  We then watched the movie
“Planes” with the children.  It was an animated movie of an airplane raise. 
Jeff and Gail came home, just before the show ended so they watched the ending
with us.  They then put the children to bed and the four of us played some
games before we went home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
spent a relaxing morning, not getting up until late.  This evening we went to a
movie at the Kaysville Theater.  We went to see the “Saraog Approach” but got
in the wrong theater and saw “The Book Thief” instead.  It also was a very good
movie.  We got home late and soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Up
before 6AM and was soon off to meetings.  When we got home Mae prepared a nice
dinner and we then took a nap.  I did take care of the chickens while dinner
was cooking.  Bother Taylor and Korbin Rogers came Home Teaching at 3PM today. 
Mae then went Visiting Teaching with Shirley Olsen to Sister Fallis at 4PM. 
Bob and I went Home Teaching to sister Fallis at 4:30PM and had a nice visit
with her.  When we got home Mae had a light dinner prepared.  Irven and Sandy
came over this evening.  We just set and visited with each other until 9PM,
when we had to get ready for bed as work still is on for tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
got up with me and got me off to work.  My runs went well.  After getting home
I took a nap.  Due to the Elementary Schools having Parent – Teacher
Conferences, the grade schools are getting out early.  I have to go back for
the PM runs at 12:40PM.  This evening Mae had invited the Garf’s to come for
dinner and to get acquainted.  Mae had a lovely dinner ready, so we ate and
visited.  We had a wonderful evening and hated to have it end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
AM runs went well.  I had just enough time after getting home to have a small
snack. Mae and I then went to an appointment with Doug Christensen, BC-HIS at
his Layton office.  He gave us hearing tests.  Mae was ok except he had to
clean her ear drum out.  My test defiantly indicates that I need a hearing
aid.  My big concern is the cost, $4,785.00 if we pay up front.  I just don’t
feel that we can do that.  After leaving the office I have felt dizzy and light
headed.  I felt ok to drive my bus and so soon had to start my PM runs.  Mae
went up to Morgan to watch Tyler play basket ball this afternoon.  Morgan
played a team from Draper.  Mae said that she was almost sure the other team
would win but at the end Morgan won by 1 point.  Tyler played most of the game and
made several of the major plays and points. When I got home from the PM runs, I
went upstairs and watched a movie Bob had recorded.  This evening after eating
dinner, Mae and I watched some TV while we worked on our pills.  I am still
feeling a little woozy this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night but still got up and got me off to work.  She
then went back to bed.  My ears are still bothering me.  I am hearing strange
sounds and still feel some dizziness.  I took a short nap and when I went to
get up I almost fell with dizziness.  I checked with the Audiologist and he
said I should check with my M.D.  I called into the bus dispatch and they will
find a sub for my PM run.  Mae took me over to Dr. Lee’s.  He checked my blood
pressure and said that no one knows what causes vertigo but he wants me to see
an Audiologist and an E.N.T., but that won’t be for a week.  During the mean
time I should not drive unless the dizziness goes away.  I called back into
Rosa but it went to her answering machine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Well
I guess I goofed as they didn’t cover my AM run as Rosa hadn’t checked her
messages.  I was down all day.  I watched TV this afternoon and evening.  I did
call in to the Sub-Line this evening.</p>

guess I got too much sleep yesterday because I didn’t sleep last night.  I
slept quite a lot this morning.  Mae is sure special and does all she can for
me.  My eyes bother me, beside the dizziness so it make reading or working on
the computer uncomfortable.  Mae went to Jeff and Gail’s to help with a
Birthday party for Rachel.  Bob took me into Dr. Toone’s and he gave adjusted
my neck area and almost immediately the dizziness left and my sinuses started
to drain so that by the time we got home, I felt great.  I called the dispatch
and let them know that I am sure that I can be back to work on Monday.  </p>
