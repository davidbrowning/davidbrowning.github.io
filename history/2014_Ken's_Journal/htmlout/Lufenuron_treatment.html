<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
Mae and I started taking this treatment today.</p>

each took the Lufenuron powder with our noon meal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                By
evening neither of us felt any affects or results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Day 2     Thursday,
April 03, 2014</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                At
2AM I woke with strong feelings going through out my complete body.  My first
thoughts were that it was like the pain that was going through my body when my
illness started in 1989.  The pain was a shooting sharp pain that started in
one point and traveled to another.  This time instead of pain, it was a strong
uncomfortable feeling.  The feeling was occurring throughout my body from my
feet to my head, even in my ears.  This lasted for about an hour.  My first
reaction was fear; I felt my heart racing and my breath quick and heavy but
then I realized that it might be the treatment removing the Candida from my
body.   My next thoughts were of driving the school bus and I was concerned
about my motor skills.  I removed my c-pap mask and got out of bed.  I did some
movements and walked into the bathroom.  I was steady on my feet and felt no
dizziness, so that fear left.  I used the toilet and my bladder and bowels
functioned properly.  When I had gone to bed I was constipated but now it moved
comfortably on its own.  By now all feelings had returned to normal and I was
able to return to sleep until the alarm woke me.</p>

took the last does of Lufenuron at noon today.</p>
