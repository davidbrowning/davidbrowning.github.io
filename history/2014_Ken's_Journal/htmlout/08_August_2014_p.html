<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up with the plans of going to the Temple.  The problem was that I thought
we were planning to go in the morning and Mae thought our plans were for
afternoon.  Well, it worked out and we got some things done around the house. 
Mae picked strawberries, plus we picked some grape tomatoes, green peppers and
one ripe tomato.  I delivered some vegetables to Sister Olsen, Brother Casey
and Sister Miller.  I also returned Sister Miller’s book that we read.  From
there I took the letter that I had mailed to the bus department but it had
returned as I hadn’t put the P.O. Box on the address.  I went up to Jenny’s for
some pills but her assistant, Suzie hadn’t come in by the time I got there.  We
left for the Temple shortly after noon.   We just got on the freeway when Suzie
called so we took the next exit and went back to the office.  After getting the
pills we went to the Temple.  We ended up on the 2PM session.  After the
session we went out to eat at Chuck-A-Rama.  From there we went to Costco for
some supplies for the Porter Annual Family party at Layton’s Surf &amp; Swim on
Monday afternoon.  We next stopped at Scott’s to visit with this special
family.  After getting home Mae and I watched a cute show on Netflix, “The Wood
Carver”.  It was a very good movie.  We sure enjoy having Netflix as we can always
find a good movie to watch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
enjoyed sleeping in.  After getting up at 9AM, I showered and prepared
breakfast of egg omelets.  I tried to find a pool pump and cleaner for Scott,
as they need something for their backyard pool.  I called him with a couple of
places he might look.  I cut a large pan of Chard.  I then took it into the
house and cleaned it and packaged it.  We will use it in our “Green Drink” that
Mae makes.  Mae went shopping for a few items she needed at Wal-Mart.  After
Mae returned she fixed some lunch and as we set down to eat I turned the TV
on.  We watched a Western Movie.  Mae then worked on her computer and I worked
on my journals on my computer.   I have something in my transcribing of my 1970
through 1974 dairy that is out of sync that is going to take some researching. 
I went with Mae to Wal-Mark to get some potatoes.  When we got the potatoes
they were priced $3.49 for 10lb and $3.49 for 5lb.  I asked the produce clerk
about the price and he just smiled and said that the 5lb were not selling very
well.  When we got back home I made some phone calls to check on the Home
teaching Visits for last month.  It’s going on 10PM so we will go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night.  I let her sleep until 7am but felt that she
would want some time to finish her lesson preparation.  I attended me High
Priest Leadership meeting at 8AM.  It was an interesting meeting and being that
I was the only one that had read the First Presidency message in the Ensign I
got elected to give the lesson in our quorum meeting, even though it was my
month to conduct.  I had given it some thought s and felt impressed that I
would be giving it.  I feel that the lesson went well and I hope the Brethren
will use some of the points when they go Home Teaching this month.  Mae’s
lesson went quite well.  The Fast and Testimony was very special today and I
enjoyed all of the Testimonies that were expressed.   I really haven’t felt the
best today but at the same time I didn’t feel sick.  We had invited David’s
family to have dinner with us.  We also invited Bob to come down.  Mae prepared
a wonderful dinner and I did help her a little.  I worked on my journals before
dinner.  Mae got me to hold up on my journal entries and I grilled bacon
wrapped steak and chicken breasts for dinner.  All of David’s family pitched in
and helped clean up the dinner dishes.  We had a nice time visiting, with some
playing some games.  David and I talked and I mentioned that tomorrow I would
be going into an ENT tomorrow for more test.  David said that he thought he
knew what the results will be and he doesn’t feel there is a cure.  He said
that if so I should completely give up driving.  That would be a hard pill to
swallow.  After they left, Mae and I played a game of Rummy in which Mae won
this time.  It was after 10PM so we got ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
had rained during the night but I checked the lawns and decided to start
cutting them.  Between Bob and Mae’s help we got all the lawns mowed.  Mae and
I then hurried to get ready for my Doctors Appointment at 1PM.  I was a little
concerned when I saw Dr. Owens as of his age, but when I had visited Dr.
Kennington and then followed up with Dr. Owens, I was very impressed.  The
appointment took longer than we had expected, especially with the thorough
testing of Dr. Kennington.  So Mae had to leave in order to be at the Layton
Park in time for the reunion.  She asked Bob if he would come and get me.  Bob
didn’t understand the directions and I ended up waiting for over an hour
outside before he finally found me.  The reunion went quite well although there
was many that did not come.  More came for the swimming pool than came for the
dinner.  All of our children except for Mike’s family came, excluding Shellie’s
family.  None of our married grandchildren and families attended.  A thunder
storm came in about 8PM so they had to close the pool.  I entered this entry
and we went to bed.  We were both still wound up from all the hurrying and
pressures of the day so we sat down and tried to find something short on TV. 
That didn’t happen so we flipped to Netflix and watched “Sarah’s Choice” and
really enjoyed that.  We were late going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
never got up until late, so we didn’t eat breakfast until 10AM.  We went over
to the Health Store and then we went to Sportsman Warehouse for some fishing
equipment.  After getting home I cut the lettuce off and both Mae and I worked
the rest of the afternoon cleaning and washing the lettuce.  After diner this
evening we watched “Bed of Roses”.  It was a fair movie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up early this morning as I had to be at Ogden Regional Medical Center at
8:30AM.  They did blood work on me and then gave me a CAT scan of my head.  We
stopped on the way home and bought a wedding gift for Steve and Judy Porter’s
son.  We also got word that our Grandson David and Sierra are getting married
on Friday.  They will be married by a Justice of the Peace and it will be a
private ceremony for immediate Family members only.  Grandparents are not
invited.   We are sure sorry that David has lost his testimony.  I hope it will
work out for them.  After getting home we had lunch and then both Mae and I
took a nap.  Mae and I then finished cleaning the lettuce that I picked
yesterday.  I worked in the garden for a couple of hours.  We got quite a few
strawberries, some cucumbers and some tomatoes.  Our tomatoes have some black
tomato rot in them.  I called J&amp;J Nursery and they suggested that I spray
the tomatoes plants with Yield Booster for Calcium Deficiency.  I went over and
bought a container of Yield Booster, also some Seven to kill the Earwigs.  This
evening we attended Tom Porter and Makayla Holmes wedding reception.  This is
the son of Steve &amp; Judy Porter, Uncle Verle and Aunt Beth Porter’s son.  We
met Bryce and Deanna there.  After attending the reception the 4 of us went to
a Maverick and bought some frozen Yogurt.  We set in the car and visited for
some time.  It was 10PM when we got home.  It has been a nice evening.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
of us slept well last night and got up about 7AM.  Mae and I got in somewhat of
a discussion concerning all the vitamins and minerals that I am taking plus the
amount of water I consume daily.  I certainly don’t have the answers but I am
concerned at the great cost we are putting out and the results I am seeing.  Mae
went to Provo to visit with Pat Bradfield, she won’t be home until this
evening.  She took Ashley with her and dropped her off at Mike &amp; Becky’s
home so Ashley could be with her two favorite cousins for a few hours.  Mae
said she sure enjoyed having Ashley with her and they even talked about
Ashley’s YW camp experience and how she bore her testimony and told how she had
prayed for a brother and a sister when the twins were born.  That way she could
have a sister and Kylan could have a brother.  She knew Heavenly Father had
answered her prayers.  Ashley also told her grandma that she wanted to grow up
to be with her.  Mae also had a good visit with Becky before Mike came home and
they ate dinner.  Becky had invited Mae &amp; Ashley to stay for dinner.  I
visited with Bob for a while, and then I did some searching for someone in the
area that sells glass tubing.  That wasn’t very successful.  I worked in the
garden for a while a couple of times today.  I watched a show that Bob had
recorded and then visited with him for a while.  I worked a little in my
journals.  Mae didn’t get home until almost 8:30PM.  I was getting a little
concerned as the night is coming earlier now.  It is hard to think of the
summer coming to an end.  The evening seemed to pass fast and before long it
was 11PM so we went to bed.</p>

got up early and went down to the Stake onion patch and weeded our ward area. 
When I got home Mae was out working in the garden.  I helped her for a while
before we went into the house.  Mae prepared breakfast of Waffles and eggs.  We
both took a nap after eating.  Mae cleaned up the vegetables while Bob and I
mowed the lawns.  Before we finished Mae came out and started trimming.  After
finishing the yard work, Bob asked if we would like to go to Sizzler for steak
and all you can eat shrimp.  We decided to go so we went with Bob.  The food
was very good and we came home very full.  We tried to go to bed early as we
have to get up early in the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were up early and got away shortly after 4:30AM.  We got to Strawberry
Reservoir at 6:40AM but I went to the wrong boat ramp.  We had to back track
and go to the lower ramp, getting there just after 7AM.  Mae checked in while I
prepared the boat.  She came back to ask if we had room for 5 in the boat, I
said that would be too many to fish.  A few minutes later Mae came with Kaislynn
Spencer, a 12 year old child that was quite crippled in her legs.  Also, with
her was her father, Lynn.  Her mother stayed to help with the other activities. 
I had Mae drive the boat and I helped Kaislynn and Lynn get set up for
trolling.  It was almost 8AM when we got on the lake and though we had some
strikes, it was about 10AM before we caught our first fish.  We turned the pole
over to Kaislynn and had her bring the fish in.  It was a nice Rainbow trout
and Kaislynn was so happy and said that it was her first fish she had caught
and got into the boat.  The Director of the C.A.S.T. program along with two
camera man and a driver of the boat came by just then and took pictures of
Kaislynn and her fish.  He told us that he thought Kaislynn was the first to
catch a fish.  A short time later she hooked another, but it got off just as we
reached for it with the net.  We then caught a nice Cut Throat that was about
18 ½ inches long, that we turned loose because of the slot limit.  Just before
11AM we caught another and the Director and camera crew was back in our area
and filmed Kaislynn bringing that fish in.  She was really excited for her
catch.  We were to be back into the dock about 11AM so we started back.  Just
before we got to the dock I asked Kaislynn if she would like to drive the
boat.  She was really excited and I had her drive for several minutes before we
went into the dock.  After loading the boat I showed Lynn how I filet fish.  We
then attended the luncheon and closing ceremony.  It has been a very good day. 
We did find it interesting, that when we first pulled in this morning there was
another boat close to us.  The boat was much bigger than ours, plus he had two
down riggers, several pole holders, and about every other fishing devise and
bait anyone could want for fishing.  When we parked our boat he was also there
with his boat and was talking very loud and upset because they hadn’t even got
a strike though he had so much equipment.  I heard him exclaim to someone else
how he had tried everything he had but was still skunked.  I wanted to ask him
if he had tried prayer.  We had asked in our morning prayer, that we could help
a child have a good day.  I think that prayer was answered.  During the closing
ceremony Kaislynn was one of the few to catch a fish.  We had thought that we
might stay longer and go back out fishing but by the time the ceremony was over
we decided to go home as we were tired.  It was still 6PM before we got home. 
I also had to help set up seating for tomorrows Stake Priesthood meeting at
7PM.  It didn’t take very long.  By the time we got things put away, it was
still 10PM before we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
emailed Kaislyn’s parents the pictures we took of her and the event at C.A.S.T.
for Kids at Strawberry Reservoir and Alison, Kaislyn’s mother emailed this
message back to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Ken and
Mae, Thank you so much for volunteering your time, experience and boat to this
wonderful event.  Kaislyn has not stopped smiling or talking about the 4 fish
she caught.  You truly made a wonderful difference in her experience.  Lynn
spoke so positively of you both and the pictures say it all.  It was a great
day for all of us.  Kaislyn truly is a special girl.  We are so lucky to be her
parents.  She teaches us much about patience and endurance every day.  Thank
you so much for sharing in this event.  We hope we get to see you again.  The
pictures are priceless!  Thanks for sharing.  Sincerely, Alison &amp; Lynn
Spencer”  </p>

met as a High Priest Group leadership for a few minutes.  Then followed
Priesthood meeting was the Block Program.  We were tired and took a nap after
lunch.  Mae cooked a turkey along with all the trimmings for this afternoon
when we had Jeff’s family and Scott’s family for dinner and games later.  Mike
&amp; Becky’s younger daughters, Maddi &amp; Jessie were staying at Scott &amp;
Mishelle to play with Ashley as these three cousins love to be together, so
they came too.  After the dishes were done, Jeff talked Scott &amp; Mishelle into
playing games with us.  Usually they won’t play games with us because they
don’t like playing most games, but Jeff talked them into playing Sequence and
Jeff &amp; Scott were partners and they ended up winning the first game, Gail
&amp; Mishelle won the next two games.  We then asked what game they would like
to play next as Scott also likes Mormon Bridge, and we let him decide.  He said
if we didn’t mind, he would like to play a couple more games of Sequence, we
did and they won again.  We were happy that he and Mishelle along with the rest
of us had fun playing that game.  Scott even told Mishelle that they should buy
that game.  The children watched Disney on TV when they were not playing
together.   They all left about 9 pm to get their kids to bed.  I turned the TV
on and couldn’t find anything so I turned on Netflix.  I brought up a couple of
shows but turned them off.  The third movie was “Guess How is coming for
Dinner” and though we have seen it before it was still very good.  It was close
to mid-night before we got to bed.</p>

woke before 7AM and found that Mae was sleeping in the recliner.  She had got
up at 6AM with leg cramps and was asleep in the recliner so I let her sleep
until about 7AM when she woke hearing me up.  She started the washing while I
prepared egg omelets for breakfast.  After breakfast I caught my journal up to
date.  Mae and I then cleaned the windows.  We took the bars off the storm door
so that it is easier to clean those windows.  We left for the Ogden Medical
Center at 1PM and from there we went to my Dr. Appointment with Dr. Wm. Owens MD
and Kody Kennington, Audiologist.  Kody is sure that he can make hearing aids
that will work for me.  Dr. Owen said that I definitely do not have Manears
disease.  We were glad to hear that news.  My right ear is almost totally deaf
and my left ear is pretty bad.  Dr. Owens can only find one area that he has
any concern and that is a cyst, but he thinks it is an old one.  He said that
we will take another MRI next year to see if there is any change but for now he
isn’t worried.  We stopped at Costco and Kitchen Kneads before coming home.  We
also filled the car with gas and got it washed.  Mike and Becky called to see
if we were home.  They will stop by.  Irven and Sandy were planning on coming
over but with Mike and Becky stopping we had to propone that until another
evening.  We did enjoy visiting with Mike and Becky and seeing the pictures of
David and Sierra’s wedding.  After Mike and Becky left I turned on the TV and
we watched part of a Netflix movie before turning it off.  </p>

of money going out, especially with $4,000 for hearing aids for me, and that I
hadn’t wanted to go in and spend more money, but Mae asked me anyway, and I
reluctantly said “I guess”.  That kind of set me in a bad mood.  I have fought
depression the rest of the day.  I did work on the lawn sprinkler system.  I
was going to go down to the city building to find out if a person can own a home
and then rent out both the upstairs and the downstairs.  Bob wanted us to talk
to Bishop Pearson first so it was about 7:30PM when Bishop Pearson got off work
and stopped by.  He gave us some names that we might contact at the city office
building but he didn’t know the regulation.  We did go to bed at 9pm quite

until about 7AM.  Mae also slept pretty well.  I prepared breakfast of poached eggs
for us.  Quite a bit of my time was spent trying to order new heads for my
electric razor.  When I was able to find the heads that I needed I couldn’t get
the program to except my order.  After several attempts I reached an order desk
and was able to find the heads, but the price the clerk quoted me was $10 more
than the inter-net catalog quoted.  When I questioned it the clerk was quite
abrupt and said that she couldn’t change the price.  I called another phone
number and this time got someone that really helped me and even told me where I
could buy the blades locally at a cheaper price.  She then checked the store
and found that they were out at this time so she checked another store and
found that they had even a better price.  I then started working on my Diary
transcript and spent most of the day there.  Mae cooked a very good pulled
chicken crock pot meal for our dinner.  I went visiting with Brother Morgan
Thomas this evening at 7:30PM.  At the first two doors’ we found no one at
home.  We then visited with Smokey and Sylvia Barns and were there for over an
hour, but it was a good visit.  When I got home, Mae was watching a movie with
Bob, that I had already seen so I came down and worked on my journals a while
longer.  It was 10:30PM when the show finished and Mae came downstairs.  We
soon went to bed.</p>

breakfast we took Sister Shirley Olson over to Layton where she had a Doctor’s
appointment.  While Mae was with her I went over to Target where I bought a new
set of razor heads for my Norelco electric razor.  Yesterday I had got on the
internet and tried to find where to buy the heads.  After several attempts I
finally reached a secretary at Phillip Norelco that was very pleasant and
helpful.  She not only told me stores in our area that carried the product but
she also checked their inventory for availability and cost.  She then suggested
that Target in Layton had inventory and then she said they had the best price
and if I would check with at the cash register they would give me an extra $5.00
off the already lowest price.  I had previous found them on-line at $49.99 and
at Target got then for $29.99 and then another $5.00 store discount.  That was
quite a savings!  After going back and getting Mae and Sheryl we took Sheryl to
the bank.  When we got home Mae then went to Sister Marna McPhie and the two of
them went out for lunch.  They were gone for almost 3 hours but Marna deserved
it.  I did get quite a bit accomplished and wrote some thoughts about my
Grandmother.  When Mae got home we went over and met with Aud. Cody Kennington
who fit my new hearing aids.  I sure hope these helps as they are $4,000 we

find a show to watch but could not get our Netflix to work and there wasn’t
anything else on TV that was worth watching.  We went to bed.</p>

got up at 6AM but Mae has been up since 12:30AM.  We had breakfast and then
mowed the lawns, weeded the garden, picked strawberries, chard and onions plus
fertilized most of the garden plants.  Irven and Sandy wanted us to go to the
Clearfield Aquatic Center with them to an exercise class.  We were to tired so
didn’t attend today.  We took showers and then Mae laid down for a while.  I
worked on my journals.  After Mae got up, and she never did go to sleep, she
started making a vegetable casserole that Georgia had given her the recipe to. 
She also made two batches of strawberry jam for Mishelle and to have on hand
for when company comes.  I helped her with these projects.  I took cucumbers
around to some in our Ward, plus Sister Fallis came by and we gave her some
cucumbers.  We also had an enjoyable visit with her.  After dinner we both went
back to the computers with Mae working on our budget and I working on my 1970
Diary.  Rewriting my Diary is really a big job that I would like to get
finished by the end of this year.  I also worked on some memories I had of
Grandma Hill and sent a copy, by E-mail to all of my children.  It is now
almost 11PM so we had better go to bed.</p>

woke about 5 this morning and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I am just so
undecided as to what we should do concerning not only what is going to happen
with this house but also what to do about bringing in some extra income.  I
guess my changing jobs have really put us in a mess.  After some breakfast I
got my ice fishing tent out and set it up.  Mae came out and helped me clean it
up.  We took some pictures of the tent, ice auger and ice fishing poles and
stands.  I looked up the prices on the inter-net and we decided to sell it all
as a package for $450.00.  David called to see if it was ok with me to enlarge
the gates to the back to 12 feet.  I told him that it was ok with me.  He brought
Tyler and Connor over to help me, then he went looking for the gates.  We got
the old gates removed and dug new post holes, before he returned.  It took us
until about 5PM, then David and his boys left for home.  I had some fishing
poles that I offered David and they took 3 of them.  I thought that David gave
me $10 or $20 for the poles but when I took the money out of my pocket it was a
$50 bill.  He had already left so I called but he said that the rest was for me
helping him install the gates.  Mae made dinner and we got the Netflix working
so watched a show while we ate.  It was 11PM before we went to bed.</p>

got up with the alarm at 6AM but Mae slept in until 7AM.  Mae got some
breakfast of cereal and toast before I went to my Leadership meeting.  In
opening of Priesthood meeting I got after the Elder for not getting the chairs
set up but then found out that it is the High Priests that were suppose to have
got here early and set them up.  Meetings went well but my hearing aids didn’t
help much today.  I was going to do Brother Roper’s Home Visiting for him as he
is laid up with a knee operation but none of his assigned families are
available today.  After lunch Mae and I laid down and took a long nap.  We read
the Priesthood/R.S. lesson from our manual of the Prophet Joseph Fielding
Smith.  It was about families and how we need to teach them so they will stay
true to the gospel.  That made both Mae and I sad because our three youngest
sons have lost their testimonies and are not teaching their children the
gospel.  We know Gail, Jeff’s wife, is teaching her children, but not sure if
Mishelle or Shauna are.  We hope so.  We thought we had taught our children,
but wonder if we did our best.  At the time we thought we were.  Mae and I then
went over to visit Smoky and Sylvia Barns.  We had a nice visit with them. 
They are pretty sure they have their home sold.  </p>

got up about 7AM and started with the laundry, and garden.  We picked most of
the beets as they are getting to big.  We ended up with two buckets full of
beets.  I washed one bucket and took them into the house and cooked four of
them.  We also washed the strawberries and froze some of them.  I also packaged
with the Seal-a-meal 6 pints of frozen strawberries.  I worked on transcribing
my Diary onto the computer.  We had a fellow that wanted to blacktop our
driveway for us and would do it for $25.00 per sq. yard.  He had too much
blacktop mixture left from a job and wanted to us it rather than just dumping
it out.  He even came down to $20.00 a yard but I told him that we just
couldn’t put money into this home as if Bob either dies or has to go into a
rest home, we will be out of the home.  I really wished that we could have done
it.  That depressed really depressed me.  Randy called and wants me to help him
get his boat repaired.  He then wants me to take him fishing and he will pay
the expenses.  I decided to repair the boat Wednesday and go fishing on
Thursday.  Irven, Sandy and Mark came over this evening and we watched a video
“Monumental”.  It was a good DVD, showing just what is happening in the United
States at this time.  And the real reason that America has been so great in the
beginning and the role the Pilgrims played in it.  I don’t know if any of our
boys would watch and lesson to the DVD or not.  We then played some games
before they left.  I finished this entry and we went to bed, after 11:30PM.</p>

worked on my computer.  I look like it might be stormy as it is overcast
today.  It did rain most of the morning but was only over cast this afternoon. 
Mae and I helped Bob clean the two freezers in the garage.  We finished up with
just enough time for me to shower and shave.  I got ready to go to the Ogden
Temple Open House.  I picked up Morgan at the church house and we got over
there just in time to get our assignments.  I was assigned the parking lot just
to the West of the Tabernacle and I quite enjoyed it.  The weather was just
about perfect.  The last hour my legs got to hurting and I wasn’t sure that I
was going to get up the stairs of the parking lot when we went home.  I was

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 3:30AM and quickly got some breakfast and went to Randy’s to get
him.  Thanks for a sweet wife that got my lunch and breakfast ready for me last
night before she went to bed.  We took Randy’s boat and truck.  I couldn’t get
the right rear light on the trailer to work so we went that way anyway.  Head
to get fuel in the truck so we lost a little time that way.  Randy went to
sleep shortly after we started so I had some problems with sleepiness as I
drove.  We made it ok but it was almost 8AM when we got the boat launched.  I
had some problems launching the boat.  Without anyone to help I backed the boat
in but the boat came off quicker that I had expected so I tried to walk the
trailer to catch the boat.  I slipped off and skinned my leg, but was able to
catch the boat.  Yesterday when I repaired the boat I was sure that I had
raised the trolling plate, but as we started to drive we soon realized that the
plate was still down.  Randy had another fellow come and do something with the
lights last night so maybe he put the plate down or I was mistaken in which
position I had left it.  Any way it bent the plate a little but I was able to
bend it back down.  Randy tried to tell me where they had fished before but
without him seeing we went somewhere else.  We didn’t have any luck for a while
so I moved to where I had been told before where we might try.  Randy had a
couple of strikes but lost both of them.  I then caught a nice fish.  Using a
fly instead of the pop-gear really made a difference in the fight of the fish,
it was really exciting.  Randy only fished a few more minutes and then he felt
sick and crawled into the bow of the boat and went to sleep.  With the new
regulations that you can fish with more than one pole at a time, I continued to
use Randy’s pole with a fly, my 1st pole with a fly and a 2<sup>nd</sup> pole
with pop-gear.  I really started having fun as at one point I had three fish on
at the same time.  All the fish I caught were Rainbow trout and they were all
nice size fish.  Shortly after noon I had caught 8 fish.  I had release one
small fish although it to was a Rainbow.  The wind then came up quite strong
and I really had trouble handling the boat and getting the lines in at the same
time.  We had put the canapé up on the boat earlier thinking that it would help
Randy feel better.  With the wind I was now having trouble having enough power
to keep the wind from driving us backwards and towards the bank.  I didn’t dare
to give more power to the motor in fear of bending the trolling plate and I
couldn’t take time to stop to raise the plate because of the wind carrying us
towards the shore.  I finally disconnected the front of the canapé and letting
it fold backwards.  That gave me enough break that I was able to get control of
the boat again.  I about decided to head back to the dock and call it a day
when the wind let up more.  Having 7 fish still gave room for one more so I
went back to fishing.  With- in minutes I caught he largest fish of the day.  I
was sure this one would be a cut-throat but when I finally landed it, it too
was a Rainbow.  I then brought all the fishing gear in and lifted the trolling
plate up.  When I started towards the ramp, Randy finally woke up.  After I got
the boat loaded Randy went with me to the rest room and then I cleaned the
fish.  I had brought a couple of plastic bags but they were not big enough for
that long of fish.  I put my lunch into a grocery bag and put the fish into my
lunch box.  Randy did stay awake going home so that was much more enjoyable. 
After parking the boat, unloading everything into the truck, I then took the
truck to the garage.  I pulled it in but we had left the back lid up and it
caught on the garage door from and pulled the hinge some.  I didn’t notice it
until I had unloaded my gear and Randy had gone into the house.  Too tired to
worry about it now I called Randy to let him know my concerns.  He said he
would check it out.  I gave Randy four of the fish and I took the other four. 
I was another hour cleaning the fish and putting them away.  I took pictures of
the fish and measured them.  The largest fish was 17 3/8” long, the next was
16” long, the next 14 ¼” long and the shortest was 13 ½” long.  It has been fun
but I was sure tired.  The four that I gave Randy were in that same range but I
kept the shortest and the longest ones.  Mae and I watched a show this evening
before going to bed.  When we started for the bedroom my back started going
into traffic pain and we spent the next 2 or three hours putting ice packs on
my back.  At 2AM I had Mae go into bed and I slept the rest of the night in the
recliner.</p>

picked strawberries and cucumbers from our garden.  I started to edge the lawn but
is started to affect my back so I left it for today.  After lunch I called and
visited with Cheryl for a while.  I called to see if she and Bob would like to
meet us for dinner.  Bob fell and broke his arm and then a couple of days ago
he again fell and severely sprained to other wrist.  He doesn’t feel that he
would want to go into public and have Cheryl have to feed him.  We will make it
another time.  Cheryl and I did have a good visit.  Mae and I went out to eat
at the Sizzler in Layton.</p>

wanted.  We still had 4 bucket so we took one bucket over to the Ward Social
and gave them away there.  It was a good social with a fair attendance.  After
leaving the park we stopped at Larry and Diane Steel and visited for a while. 
Larry gave us a sack full of zucchini squash.  We got home at 9PM.  I worked on

concentrate as I lesson to people and talk and I really didn’t understand ant

some lunch.  We got a call from Gary Nelson, informing us that his wife, Ruth
and her Grandson had been killed in an automobile accident yesterday.  We
didn’t get any details but sure feel bad for the loss.  Mae has been trying to
get a hold of our friends but only talked to Pat.  She left a message for
Ralph.  Brother Taylor and Korbin Rogers came Home Teaching at 3PM.  After they
left I picked up Zack Roper and we went visiting to Brother and Sister Glen
Higgley and to Brother and Sister Rogers.  I took Brother Ropers families in as
much as Craig is having problems with his knee replacement.  We had a good
visit with each family but I talked to long.  After getting back home Mae told

picked and got them into the freezer.  I also sealed the previous strawberries
that we had frozen.  At 11AM we had an appointment with a Doctor who is with
our insurance company.  He came to our house and give both Mae and myself a
brief physical examination and filled out a questioner.  I then took a form
that I needed signed by Davis School Board Payroll, so that I can get my money
out of the saving program I was with while I was driving school bus.  I then
went down to Randy’s and helped him take his camper shell off his truck.  It was
almost 7PM when we finished and I came home.  I had removed the rear window
from the shell so I could bring it home to work on.  Mae had some dinner ready
for me when I got home.  After eating my left leg was hurting so we removed my
pants.  The scrape on my leg was quite inflamed.  Mae called David and he came
right down.  Connor had fallen and had a bad gash in his arm, so David had came
home from work, to care for Conner and had just finished cleaning and sowing up
the wound when Mae called David.  When he got here and looked at my leg, he
felt that I needed to get right into ER.  David then drove Mae and I up to the
Ogden Regional Hospital.  They took a scan of my leg and gave me two

but I believe I like the new version the best.  I took a short nap and then
went into Dr. Lee.  He said my leg is looking ok and said to continue with the
medication.  I then asked him about going down to the University of Utah
Medical Center about my hearing and dizziness.  He said they would check the
dizziness but they would not check my hearing.  He feels that if the dizziness
is getting better then I should maybe wait.  He also said that if the hearing
aids are helping even some it is better than not hearing at all.  Mae has been
busy getting ready for a party for Charles and Karen Saunders, prior to them
leaving on a mission call.  I worry that Mae goes to hard but there is no
slowing her down.  After lunch I took a nap, but not Mae.  This evening we had

Diane &amp; Ron Graf, Morgan &amp; Marge Thomas, Karren &amp; Joanne

getting his Driver’s License. Evidentially, Jacob made a left turn in front of
a 1 ton diesel truck and they were both killed with the impact.   The building
was packed with people coming to pay tribute.  Shortly after 11:30 they asked
the line to just pass through for a viewing but not speaking to the family
members.  We did get to give Gary a quick hug.  Even with that the family members
weren’t seated in the Chapel until 11:45AM.  With it being a double funeral, we
did not get out of the Chapel until 2:45PM.  We found a Sub-Way and got
something to eat.  We then drove to Mike and Becky’s to be with Maddie and
Jessie, as Mike and Becky have gone with others from the High School on a
retreat.  The girls were home before we got there but they were fine.  We did
let Mattie got to a friend’s where several others just hung out.  Mae and I

After eating breakfast I tried to lie down for a few minutes on the couch.  I
had just dosed off when the dog jumped right onto my stomach.  Then a fly
started crawling on my face.  That did it and I got back up and worked longer
on my Diary.  Both Maddie and Jessie took advantage of the day off and slept in
quite late.  Mike and Becky came home earlier than they had planned as Mike
decided that all his family would go up to Idaho to Football game his school is
participating in.  We got our things packed up and left.  We drove downtown to
see the Temple that is being created out of the Old Tabernacle.  I am not sure
why the people wanted to save the old building, just because it had stood there
for so many years.  To me a beautiful new Temple would be so much nicer to have
in the Center of their town.  I guess I am not very sentimental.  Mae went to
the grocery store and we parked in the shade and both took a short nap and ate

Tayler came over during the Sunday School time and administered to me and gave
me a Blessing.  I slept quite a bit this morning.  When Mae came home she
prepared us some lunch.  After eating Mae took a short nap and I got my
computer set up so I could work on my Journal and Diary.  This evening Mae and
I read from the book “The Infant Atonement”.  That is sure a good book with a
lot to think about.  We then watched a good movie on Netflix “The Children of
an Lac”.  Story was taken from a true account during the war with Vietnam.  It
told of the rescue of almost 400 orphaned children and babies before the fall
of Saigon.  There were many that because they were over 10 years old, were not
allowed to leave the country as the boys would have to serve in the military
and the girls would be the ones to mother children to renew the country.   As
it concluded it told that these children were brought to the United States and
all of them were adopted out.  Having lived during those years of the Vietnam War,
it really had a sobering effect on me.</p>
