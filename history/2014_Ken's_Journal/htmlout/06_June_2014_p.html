<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Being
that it is Fast Sunday we didn’t eat before going to Church with Roy and Linda. 
After Sacrament meeting was over Mae and I left for Half Moon Bay on the coast,
south of San Francisco.  Still being in Sunday best we decided to stop at a gas
station.  We filled up with gas and then went inside to see if we could use the
rest rooms to change clothes.  The young fellow operating said that they didn’t
have public rest rooms but he let us use the key to the privet rest room.  After
changing, I tried to give him a tip in gratitude for the use of the rest room
but he wouldn’t take it.  We thanked him and left.  We then decided that we
should get something to eat before leaving Fresno, so we stopped at a Dennies
but would have to wait for ½ to ¾ of an hour before getting in, because of the
crowed before us.  We found a Spanish calf that had take out chicken so we
stopped there and got 8 pieces of chicken and a salad.   We then left Fresno
and drove to the coast and then drove up highway 1 to Half Moon Bay where
Shauna had rented a home on the beach.  While driving, we got a call from Mark
Stringer, informing us that something had killed one of our chickens.  There
wasn’t much we could do at this point but tell him to put the remains in the
trash and lock the chickens into the run at night.  David and his family plus
Shauna’s parents arrived at the home in Half Moon Bay just a few minutes before
we got there.  It is a very nice home.  After getting settled into the home, we
all went down to the beach for a little while.  It is quite cool and the skis
are overcast but everyone had a good time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                All
the rest got up and went down to the beach but I stayed in bed longer and then
took my shower.  Mae lost the camera case while at the beach.  She and I walked
back down but we couldn’t find it.  After climbing back up the steps, we then
walked north along the top of the cliffs. We had gone maybe a block or two when
we could look down to the shore where we saw 2 dozen elephants seals on the
beach.    On the way back to the house, found the camera case in one of Mae’s
coat pockets.  We relaxed and played some table games in the home, as it is too
cold to enjoy the outdoors.  This afternoon we went down to shore of the Pacific
Ocean and out on a pear, where David and the boys did some fishing for crab. 
They caught one but it was just under limit size, so they released it.  They
caught a couple more but didn’t get them in before they got away.  After
getting back to the house Connor, Emily, Mae and I played some games while the
rest watched TV or took a nap.  Connor, Mae and I then took a walk along the
top of the shore line.  We got to the area where we saw the seals this morning
but they had moved due to the tide coming in.  Then we found that they had
moved up onto the sandy shore.  Using the field glasses I was able to count 104
seals.  Mark called again to tell us that the raccoons had returned again last
night and killed two more chickens.  When he had put the chickens into the
chicken run last night, there were two chickens that they could not find to put
in.  These were the two that the raccoons got during the night.   Mark bought a
trap and will try to catch the raccoon.</p>

never got up until after 7 AM, and then we all helped and cleaned up the home. 
We had a nice breakfast and then packed things into the cars.  We relaxed and
went for a walk.  Shauna and the kids went back down to the beach for a while. 
We took more scenic pictures of the ocean, seals and beach.  We went over to
the beach where they have the Maverick wake board contest.  They say that they
have waves as high as 48 feet at certain times of the year.  That is the time
that the Wake Board contests are held.  We then drove to the Yosemite National
Park area.  Shauna wasn’t able to get us reservations inside the Park but got a
very nice Western Ranch type home just before the Park.  It is really very nice
and very clean.  We all went for a hike to a small lake, that was just a short
hike but it took us over an hour of steep hiking.  Coming back was all downhill
so it only took us 30 minutes to return.  We had dinner and then I took a
shower and got in the hot tub for a few minutes.  Mae didn’t get in with me as
she didn’t want to get her hair wet.  By the time I entered this journal entry
it was almost 10PM and we are getting up early in the morning to go inside the
Park.</p>

woke early to have breakfast.  We went into Yosemite National Park this
morning.  It was ok but I really haven’t felt very good all day.  I don’t know
if it was my ears that affected me or just general discouragement.  I got sharp
with Mae a couple of times.  Over all I should have just stayed home and let
the rest have a good day.  It was late when we got home.  We had dinner and it
was about time for bed as we want to leave early in the morning as it will be a
long day of driving.  David, Tyler, Connor and I did play a game of Horse Shoes
in which Connor and Tyler won.   We haven’t been able to use our phones so we
don’t know how our chickens are doing.</p>

woke at 3:45 AM and didn’t go back to sleep but started packing.  I started
taking things out to the car before it got light.  I could hear the lawn
sprinklers going so I thought I was being quite cautious, however I walked
straight into one and it hit me about chess high, really getting me wet.  I had
to change clothes before continuing.   The rest of the family got up about 5AM
and we left at 6AM.  We drove, stopping for fuel and rest stops every couple of
hours.  Also we lost an hour because of the time zone but got to St. George at 5PM. 
After getting things settled in the John and Vicky’s home in St. George, Mae
and I took our car to a car wash and cleaned it up.  We also stopped at a
Safeway and bought some chicken for our dinner.  Shauna and David took Emily to
a hotel where her Violin group is staying.  They are having a pool party this
evening.  Tomorrow her group will be participating in some competition.  I
worked on my journals, while others played games.  I then joined the group as
they wanted to play a game of “Mormon Bridge”.  We then played a game of “99”
which was quite fun, plus I won.  </p>

breakfast deferent ones went different ways.  Some watched TV which seems to be
such a waste of time to me.  Mae, Connor and I went swimming and had a lot of
fun, plus it was nice and refreshing.  We came back and took showers.  I laid
down and took a short nap.  Again the TV was on and I set down and watched a
little but fell asleep for a little while.  I then got up and worked on my
journals.  Shortly after 6PM we went out to Tuacon where we ate dinner, then
attended the presentation put on by the group that Emily participates with.  In
a couple of numbers Emily took the lead.  After that we watched the play “Some
Where over the Rainbow”.  It lasted until Mid-night but was very good.</p>

breakfast we left for home about 9:30AM.  We stopped a couple of times and then
again at Mike and Becky’s.  It was 3:15PM when we got to Mike’s.  They invited
us to eat dinner with them.  Mike, Becky, Mae and I then played two games of
Rook.  We each won a game but didn’t have time to play another so called it a
tie.  We were tired when we got home but got most everything carried into the
house and put away.  We checked the garden and it is doing pretty good.  The
lawns are still starting to dry up so I am going to add mort watering time to
the sprinkler system.  I let the chickens out to the run and they sure were
happy about that.  The raccoons got three of the best chickens and then locking
the chickens up put them into molding.  It looks like we are only getting 3 to
4 eggs a day.  I will try letting the chickens run free during the day time and
lock them in the run at night.  Before going to bed Mae and I watched a show on
DVD.</p>

I really enjoyed them but Mae won’t eat any.  After lunch Mae and I took a
nap.  I helped Mae get things ready for Jeff and Gail’s family to come for
dinner at 5PM.  After dinner we put a DVD on for the children while Jeff, Gail,
Mae and I played a game.  It was good to get together.  It was late when we got

woke early so I went down to the Stake Onion patch and weeded our wards
assigned area.  I was there about 2 ½ hours.  When I got home Mae was in the
garden so I went out there and weeded our garden.  Most of the garden looks
pretty good.  We have a lot of ear wigs in the leafy vegetables.  This
afternoon Mae laid down with me for a few minutes but I slept for a couple of
hours.  Time went by fast.  We thought that we would watch a show on TV that
Bob recorded but time went to fast.  Morgan Thomas and I went up to see
Patriarch Johnston at the care center.  He can’t remember where Sister Johnston
is or why she doesn’t come.  I sure feel sorry for him but it makes one wonder
WHY and WHAT IS TO BE LEARN FROM THESE EXPEARIANCES.  I reset the clock on the
sprinkler system so that we will get more water on the lawns.  I had to get
Chris at Durk’s plumbing show me how to set the timer.  Our lawns are sure
starting to dry out, due to not getting enough water.  We sure had a hard time
getting the chickens into the coop this evening.  It took Bob, Mae and I and we
still had a hard time getting them in.  Wang, next door caught one of the
chickens that flew over his fence and returned it to me.  He said that the
raccoons got into one of his pens and killed all the chickens in that pen a few
nights ago.  It’s time for bed, so I will end this entry.</p>

attended In-service Training all day today.  I guess there is always something
that one can learn from those classes but it was sure a long day.  I had
trouble hearing a lot of what was said.  I didn’t feel very well when I left
and I seem to be quite edgy and things upset me at home.  Mae went visiting
when I got home.  I just went into the bed room and went to sleep.  I haven’t
felt well all evening.  I went out to get the chickens into the coop and the
first thing I did is place a sheet of plywood between the east fence and the
shed, so the chickens couldn’t run around the building.  I then replaced the
light in the coop so that it was lit up.  Also feeling quite unstable on my
feet I walked slow and just herded the chicken slow and they went right into
the coop.  I figured the miles that we drove on our trip last week and we
traveled approximately 2,473 miles, using 91.01 gallons of gas, which averages
over all 27.17 miles per gallon.  </p>

mowed the lawn with the small mower today for two reasons, 1<sup>st</sup> the
lawn looks so much better and 2<sup>nd</sup> I put the clippings on the garden. 
Mae and I went over and talked to Mark about the live animal trap he bought and
we paid him back $60 for the trap.  I will still try to use it to catch the
raccoons.  This afternoon I took the cab off the pickup.  I was going to use
nylon rope and pulleys to hang it in my shelter but when I went to get the
parts, it would have cost over $100 and I just didn’t feel it was worth it.  I
went over to Winager’s to get the barbeque Bob bought me but I brought back one
that wasn’t assembled.  Bob had told them he bought it that he wanted one
already assembled so we took it back and they gave him the one on display.  Bob
and I then went over to J &amp; J Nursery and bought a yard of top soil.  There
are some areas that I need to level out in our yard.  Mae and I drove up to
David’s this evening.  We were going up to watch Connor play baseball but a
storm came in and canceled the game.  We had a nice visit with David.  Shauna
was at a meeting she needed to attend for her work.  We then came back home and
went to Kohl’s where I bought a white shirt and Mae bought a blouse and some
pants.  We had coupons for $20 off is we used them this evening.  I set the
trap and entered this entry before going to bed.  </p>

Mae took Kylan, Ashley, Kaitlyn and Kaden to Dinosaur Park in Ogden this
afternoon.  While they we gone I finished some work, washed my pickup and
repaired the windshield wipers, as they have been squeaking.  The squeak was
coming from the mechanical parts of the wipers.  When Mae got home we had some

After lunch we took a short nap.  We finally got tired and quite for a little
while.  We watched a movie with Bob that he had recorded.  It was a very good
movie.  I then picked some lettuce, swish chard and lettuce.  The wind blow
quite a bit of grass clipping into the lettuce, plus there are lots of ear
wigs, it was really a job getting the vegetables clean up.  I also took care of

Shauna’s parents also came.  Shauna had prepared a wonderful dinner and David
grilled T-bone steak for all of us plus a couple of Sirloin steak for those
that wanted to try them.  David cooked the meat on his new grill.  After a very

was going to catch her limit before me but it ended up that I got my limit
before she did.  Mae is getting more confidents with the handling of the boat. 
She took the boat of the trailer and when we finished she drove it back onto

went up to get some water and found that the freezer was thawing, so Mae and I
spent a little while getting food switched and cleaning that up.  My sciatica
nerve really started giving me problems so I had to quit and put ice pack on my
left leg.  Bruce came to visit with his Dad for a few days so we talked with
him for a few minutes.  Mae just finished cleaning up the kitchen and we are
going to bed.</p>

got up this morning and were soon busy getting things put away from canning
yesterday.  We took our car to Murdock’s and got it serviced.  They loaned us a
car so we could go to the Temple.  We enjoyed a session there and enjoyed just
visiting after the session in the Celestial room.  When we got back to
Murdock’s the car was finished but they said that the wheels were out of
alignment so we had then take care of that .  We then went to Sizzler for
dinner.  We enjoyed a wonderful meal there.  We stopped at Costco where we
[picked up a few items.  We then went to the theater in Farmington where we
joined with Jeff’s family and Marcy to attend a 3D movie “How to Train Your
Dragon”.  The occasion was Ben’s Birthday.  It was 8PM when we got home.  We
went out into the garden where we weeded, thinned beats, trimmed the lettuce
and Swiss chard off and then thinned the beats.  When we came in we had a light
snack.  Mae got more things ready for our trip tomorrow.  I entered this
journal entry.  This day has sure been a busy but fun day.  It was late before
we got to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
spent the day getting ready to leave this afternoon for a week at Lake Tahoe
with Sandi and Nick.  Sandi has two Time Share programs and has rented 3
units.  She invited Mae and I; Shellie, Roy, Jase, Garrett, Nora and their
baby; Chelci, Steve and their 4 children to be with them.  We were busy all day
getting things ready.  There was not only the clothes and food that we will be
taking but also some work in the garden.  Mae and I were packed and left home
about 2:45PM.  We met Sandy at in Tooele, where she took us out to lunch for
our 55<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary.  After eating we went to the Tooele
City Park, where Chelci is performing with a band.  We got to help tend the
children while she was performing.  We sure enjoyed that, especially the twins
Luke and Joshua.  They are the cuties baby’s and are so easy to care for.  Of
course we were especially proud Great Grand Parents.  Chelci sang with the band
for almost 2 hours and they were very good.  Of course there was no predigested
on our part.  Mae spent a lot of time with Nathan and Addie.  Addie is such a
pretty little girl.  She is just a little concerned about me but just thinks
Grandma Browning is just about as good as Grandma Sandi.  Following the
performance we went back to Sandi and Nick’s where we stayed the night.</p>

got up at 4AM, planning on leaving at 5AM but Nick know that the pickup was out
of gas took it and got fuel.  That was ok except we couldn’t do any packing so
our time was kind of wasted waiting for him.  We got to Chelci and Steve’s
shortly after 6AM and helped them finish packing and was soon off.  It was a
long trip to Lake Tahoe Nevada.  Sandi felt quite upset as somehow the GPS took
us around the West side of Tahoe Lake, instead of the West side which is much
shorter.  It all worked out ok except Nick and I gave her a little teasing,
which was a wrong thing on our part to do, as she already felt the pressure of
planning the trip.  Roy, Shellie and Jase arrived shortly after we got to the
Marriott condominium.  We got Sandi, Nick and Chelci’s family’s luggage to
their rooms and then Sandi took Shellie’s family and Mae and I to the other
condominium where we will stay.  Mae and I will have the one unit almost to our
self.  JaNae’s family was invited to come and we would have shared a unit with
them, but there are problems there and they wouldn’t come.  Shellie’s family
has the other unit.  Garrett and his family will be arriving about 5AM tomorrow
and will be with Shellie’s family.  We may have Jase with us part of the time. 
By the time we all got settled it was getting late and I was too tired to do
more today so we got us something to eat in our room and went to bed.  The
Facilities that Sandi has arranged for just couldn’t be better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It’s
a beautiful morning and our apartment has balcony that looks out over the
valley to the East of us.  Our units are located quite high in the mountain. 
It is built right on the edge of a very steep sloop dropping to a flat valley
floor below, possibly 1500 feet or more to the valley floor.  Our condominium
is the QM Resorts and is over 10 miles from the Marriott condominium.  We have
two units, 114 which Shellie’s family are staying in and 116 which Mae and I
are in.  Jase comes up part of the time and sleeps in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
bedroom.  Our units are not as large or as fancy as the Marriott’s but where
the Marriott is in down town Tahoe, we are in a very peaceful mountain resort. 
It was 5:30 AM when Garrett, Nora and Maggie arrived.  Today is the first time
I have seen Maggie and she is sure a beautiful little girl.  I love these
children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.  They are so special to be
with but I also have great concerns about the future and the great wickedness
that is abounding all around.  Tahoe, being a tourist town seems to be overly
abounding with the evils of the world.  We are preparing meals and eating
together in the lower unit so we can have the closeness of family.  We didn’t
find a chapel to attend Church at and without our own car I didn’t feel
comfortable asking to take Roy’s car to go looking, so we just spent the day
relaxing.</p>

a relaxing morning and breakfast everyone met together in Tahoe.  We then
traveled to Lake Fallen Leave, which located South East of Lake Tahoe.  We had
a little trouble with 4 cars keeping together but with a little delay, all
arrived together.  It is a small lake, maybe a little larger than East Canon reservoir,
but beautifully located in a pine surrounded valley.  Ho! How it looked good
for fishing.  It lost some of its desire desire when I talked to a fisherman
and he told me that there was a $35.00 boat inspection fee and then another
$35.00 launching fee plus a California fishing license.  From the lake we hiked
up a road to some cascade waterfalls.  There all but Nike and I, we volunteered
to stay with Chelci’s twins, who were sleeping.  The rest including Mae climbed
onto the falls and played in the water.  After a while Roy, Shellie and Sandi
hiked on further to higher waterfalls but the hike back to the cars was enough
for me.  After returning to our condo’s Mae prepared lasagna for all of us and
we joined together at the Tahoe condo for dinner.  It was late by the time we
returned after a wonderful evening of eating, games and visiting.</p>

 It was fun to see Maggie enjoying the water.  Nike and I played Chess with a
giant chess set.  We played two games in which each of us won one.  It was time
for lunch so we didn’t have a playoff.  After lunch it was playing games and
visiting time.  Some watched TV and although I played games, I took some
interest in a space travel story. Chelci and Steve prepared a wonderful chicken
and rise caesural dinner and then we played more games and spent togetherness
time before returning to our own units for bed.</p>

was up shortly after 5AM but let Mae sleep longer.  This morning I felt much
more in tune with the Spirit as I read the 5<sup>th</sup> chapter of Romans.  I
also meditated about the Space show last night and wondered about the insight the
author had on the plan of creation.  I worked on my journal for about an hour
getting it caught up.  Vacation time seems to be distraction to some of regular
scheduled time.  Most of the family went to the beach but Nick and I went over
to the pool area and played another game of chess.  We were over two hours or
possibly more but I finally won.  We then went to the condo and we played three
games of Sequence and Nick won all three.  Some of the family changed beach
areas.  Nick and I drove out there for a little while.  Everyone then bought
ice cream cones before we came back to our condo.  We had planned on grilling
hamburgers and hot dogs and eating on the upstairs patio.  It was too cold to
eat there so we moved tables into Roy and Shellie’s condo and ate dinner
there.  I got tired after eating so went upstairs to our condo, entered my
journal, played a game on the computer and went to bed.  The rest played games
and watched TV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke before 6AM and enjoyed reading three chapters of Romans, chapter 7, 8
&amp; 9.  They are fantastic to meditate about, though there are much of the
Scriptures that are far above me, but some of them I find very exciting.  That
is the way these chapters were to me.  We had a very nice breakfast with the
Seymore’s again this morning.  After breakfast I worked on my computer for a
while until Sandi called to let us know that they were about ready to leave for
our activities today.  While waiting for everyone to get ready for the day’s
activity, some of us decided to play a table game.  Nora is very enthusiastic
about playing games and when I suggested we play a game she was the first to
say she wanted to play.  I said that was great and we were going to play “Strip
Poker”.  It was so funny to see the expression on her face of shock and
wondering what she had volunteered to get into.  Mae didn’t think my joke was
very appropriate.  Taking four cars, we drove to Emerald Lake area.  When we
got there we found parking was very difficult due to so many visitors.  It took
some time finding some place to park.  Sandi got very frustrated and upset with
Nick before we found some place to park.   After parking we did see a very
picturesque seen of the crystal clear lake, an island and a beautiful water
fall.  After taking many pictures there, we walked a couple more blocks to a
trail head and then a mile down a fairly steep trail to see a Danish style home
built by a very rich woman in the early 1800’s, as her privet home summer home. 
I was concerned about the hike as I was in my cowboy boots but went anyway.  By
the time we got down the hill I was even more concerned about the return hike. 
The home cost over a million dollars, using 250 highly skilled craftsmen and 5
months to construct the home.  The architect was the ladies son-in-law and the
main instructions given him were that he was not to remove or damage any of the
natural trees and it must fit into the natural terrain of the area.  Although I
was tired from the hike down, I did enjoy the tour.  After the ladies death she
donated the home to the State for a public museum.  It seemed like a long hike
back up the trail and took us about 50 minutes to get to the top.  While
resting at the top of the trail I talked to an older man.  I asked him if he
had hiked down the trail.  He said no because of a bad knee.  I said he made a
wise chose as it was a hard trail.  He then asked me how old I was.  I told him
that I was 75 years old he said he was 89 years old.  I guess I had better
quite complaining.   Steve and Chelci did not go to the cabin with us but
returned to the condo because the twins were tired and getting cross.  When we
returned to the condo, Sandi prepared a very nice dinner, this evening being
her turn for the meal.  It was a very nice dinner and after eating several of
us did the cleanup.  Sandi, Mae, Shellie and Roy took Jase to the swimming pool
for a while.  I fell asleep in a soft chair while the rest watched TV and took
care of children.  When Mae returned and woke me to go to our condo, I was very
tired and sore.  After getting to our condo and starting to get ready for bed,
I noticed that Mae wasn’t feeling very good.  When I asked her about it she
finally told me that she was tired but mainly upset and concerned that Sandi
had confided in her that she was going to get a divorce from Nike when they get
back home.  Although I took a hot shower, being very sore and not feeling
physical well, add to that the news that Sandi wants a divorce; I just couldn’t
go to sleep.  Tousling and turning I was keeping Mae awake so I got up and came
into the other room and wrote this journal entry.</p>

was well after midnight and I went into the bed room, Mae spoke to me; so I
found a blanket and went back out.  I finally went to sleep on the couch.  Mae
was awake by 7AM and checked on me, which woke me.  I decided that I didn’t
want to go playing today but wanted to stay in the condo.  This didn’t set very
well with Mae but after a while she accepted it.  I got me some breakfast and
went back to sleep for a while.  After getting up I worked on my journals until
4PM and then went for a walk.  Nick and Mae came up and picked me up on my
walk.  We came back to the condo where Nike and I played games while Mae took a
nap.  We later drove back to Tahoe to the Marriott condo where all of us went
out to eat Fire &amp; Ice Mongolian restaurant for dinner.  It was an all you
can eat but it was a little more expensive than I am use to but it was good. 
It was interesting as you selected what you wanted cooked and took it to the
two cooks and watched them cook it.  You also put your own salad together.  One
helping was enough for me but some of our group went back two and three times. 
Some also ate with chop sticks.  It was late when we got back to our condo.  We
were sure ready for bed.</p>

took us a few minutes to say our goodbyes to Shellie, Roy, Jase, Garrett, Nora
and Maggie.  As we left the GPS directed us to go down the east side of the
mountain, rather the west side which we usually went to get to Tahoe.  I was
excited for that as I have wanted to go that way just to see that valley. 
Because of elevation signs we found that the drop from our condo to the valley
floor was close to 2,300 feet, a 1,000 feet more than I had estimated.  Our
trip back home went well but again a long trip across a lot of barren waste
land.  We got home earlier than we expected, even with stopping to get a Subway
chicken salad and eating it at Sandi’s we still got home before 9:30PM.  We
unpacked and put most things away before taking showers and going to bed.</p>

he said that we weren’t having it because of the 5<sup>th</sup> Sunday.  I was
relieved so took a short map and then got up and went with Mae to our meetings. 
The meetings were very good with lots of good instructions.  Mae said that her
Sunday School class went very well also.  After getting home we had some lunch
and then both of us took a nap.  Brother Taylor came Home Teaching and though
his companion was out of town he brought his two oldest children with him.  Mae
went to bring them upstairs to Bob’s but when they came up on the patio Mae and
both children got stung by hornets.  After we had a nice visit and they left,
Mae and I went visiting to Sister Fallis and also to the Casey’s.  When we came
home we went upstairs and started to watch the show “Over The Top”.  Shortly
after starting the show Irven called and asked if they could come over also, so
we restarted the movie.  Bob then had a second show “Sneakers” but after
getting into it the profanity got bad so we quite the show and Irven, Sandy,
