<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up and got ready to go to work.  Mae got my breakfast and I let.  When I
got to the bus compound the gates were locked so I realized that Spring Break
lasted another day.  I returned home.  I tried to get into the Davis School
District Home Page but that didn’t work for me.  Mae finally showed me how. 
Sometimes I wonder about these computers and ME.  We went to Jennie and were
there until after 11AM.  Before leaving the Secretary, Suzie showed us around
Robin’s shop and showed us the milling machines and the conveyer system that
Robin designed so that his shop, with few employees can accomplish what other
shops with 2 to 3 times the employees are trying to do.  It really is amazing
what he does even though he is blind.  From there we went to two Health Stores
trying to find the Health Supplement that Jennie recommended we have to help
with a Candida cleans we are going to try.  We stopped and got us some fried
chicken for our lunch.  This afternoon was busy but I did get 10 more Diary
days interred into my computer.  October 7, 1972 went from 4 short lines to
almost a page of typed information.  It is fun when a short entry jogs my
memory of and occasion and I can expand to something that is much more
interesting for possibly future readers.  The day sure slipped by in a hurry
and was soon gone.  We were late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep well so I got myself off to work.  My morning Junior High run was
just about finished when dispatch called me asking if I could pick up another
rout that (not explained to me) got missed.  That doubled the number of
students and made both groups late for school.  Where I usually have 15 to 20
minutes between the Jr. High run and my grade school run, today I only had 3
minutes to wait before starting the next run.  When I got home I helped Mae
with some daily chores that take two hands.  She sure tries to do most things
herself but there are some that she just can’t do.  We had some breakfast and
then I took the Missionaries from their apartment to the Chapel on 1000 W 300 N
in Clearfield where they had a meeting to attend.  I then came home and took a
short nap.  I started working on my Diary but didn’t get very far before it was
time to take my PM runs.  When I got home Irven and Sandy were here.  We
visited for a few minutes.  After they left Mae and I went into Ogden and got
some items at Nancy’s.  We then went to Costco for a couple of items.  We then
went to the Rehabilitation Care Center where Judy Porter is recovering from
having both knees replaced.  She is doing pretty well.  the day was about gone
when we got home and we soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                At
2AM I woke with strong feelings going through out my complete body.  My first
thoughts were that it was like the pain that was going through my body when my
illness started in 1989.  The pain was a shooting sharp pain that started in
one point and traveled to another.  This time instead of pain, it was a strong
uncomfortable feeling.  The feeling was occurring throughout my body from my
feet to my head, even in my ears.  This lasted for about an hour.  My first
reaction was fear; I felt my heart racing and my breath quick and heavy but
then I realized that it might be the treatment removing the Candida from my
body.   My next thoughts were of driving the school bus and I was concerned
about my motor skills.  I removed my c-pap mask and got out of bed.  I did some
movements and walked into the bathroom.  I was steady on my feet and felt no
dizziness, so that fear left.  I used the toilet and my bladder and bowels
functioned properly.  When I had gone to bed I was constipated but now it moved
comfortably on its own.  By now all feelings had returned to normal and I was
able to return to sleep until the alarm woke me.  This morning went well.  I
took the Butter Fly that we got while in California to show my grade school
students, especially Maddi.  They were quite impressed with it.  After getting
home we had a snack and then we went to Tanner Clinic for Mae to see Dr. Cook. 
They took new X-rays and Dr. Cook felt that it is healing well.  He took the
splint off and told her to wear a sling when she is anywhere that she might get
bumped.  We had to go to Wall Greens to find a sling.  My PM runs went well. 
After returning home we ate dinner while we watched a show.  I made up some
capsules while we watched a Doris Day movie.  By then it was time for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was a normal morning and my AM runs went well.  I took a short nap.  I did some
work on a strainer Bob wanted me to repair.  I thought I could finish it before
I took my PM run but my pop-rivet tool jammed and when I took it apart, I lost
a part.  I didn’t have time to find it before my PM runs.  My PM runs went well
and I was home shortly after 3PM.  Marge Thomas was her doing Mae’s hair.  She
had forgotten that she was going to do Mae’s hair this afternoon.  As Mae
couldn’t do her own hair, she finally called Marge and she came right over.  We
still got away about 3:45PM.  Mae was able to do ok but did have a couple of
Sisters that helped her a little.  After the session we went out to eat at the
Chuck-A-Rama.  When we got home David and Shauna had stopped by and left their
dog, Davinci, at our place for us to tend while they go to St. George for the
week end.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up about 5am and took Davinci outside for a few minutes.  When I came back
Mae had woke so we both went back to bed for a while.  We watched the morning
Session of General Conference and really enjoyed it.  Mae went shopping
in-between the sessions.  I repaired a strainer for Bob and fed the chickens
along with gathering the eggs.  I am not sure what Mae wants for lunch and she
forgot to take her phone with her so I can’t call her.  The Second Session of
General conference was just starting as Mae got home.  Again the Second Session
of Conference was very good.  After the conference ended I took a nap.  I also
worked on some of my personal history.  It seems that the more I write the more
I remember and come up with more ideas to write about.  I hope that this time
is of some value.  Mae keeps encouraging me to write.  I stayed home and
enjoyed the Priesthood Session of Conference on TV as this time this session is
being broadcast live on our local TV stations.  The addresses were all so
inspiring and I look forward to being able to get the printed messages in the
Ensign.  We decided to go to bed and watch a movie on DVD from Net Flex.</p>

both slept fairly well and got up at just before 8AM.  After normal morning
preparation I prepared breakfast.  We turned on the TV in time hear the
Tabernacle Quire perform their regular Sunday Morning Broadcast.  Then we
watched the Sunday Morning General Conference meeting.  We left shortly after
the session completed to go out to Sandi’s.  we got almost to the Antelope
Drive exit when Mae realized that we had forgotten to being the toss salad, so
we went back to get it.  It was almost time for the afternoon session of
conference to start when we got there.  After that session was over Sandi, Mae
and I looked at the basement and the possibilities of building an apartment in
it for Mae and me.  Nick got home and we went over to Steve and Chelci’s for
dinner and to see their twins.  The twins seem to be doing well and are sure
cute.  We enjoyed the evening there and got home at 9PM.  I made this entry and
we soon went to bed.  We have a lot to think about as we contemplate moving.</p>

morning went fairly normal although I feel quite tired this morning.  Mae got
my breakfast and I got off to work.  My runs went well and when I got back to
the compound I went into the office to be sure that someone was going to cover
my PM runs.  When I got home Mae had a Quiche for us and it was pretty good.  I
sure miss salt in my foods.  I took a short nap and then we left for my Doctors
appointment.  He again checked my ears and can’t see anything that is wrong. 
He asked about the prescription that he had given me.  We told him that I
hadn’t taken it.  His only suggestion was to try the prescription along with a
nasal spray.  If that doesn’t work the only other option is to have a M.I.R. 
After getting home I called Sportsman’s Warehouse and they do have my Lasergrip
sight in so I can go into the store and get it.  While we were gone to my
Doctors appointment we left the dog in the house.  When we got home we found
that he had gotten the egg basket down and had tore it to pieces.  David and
his family got here about 1PM and they took their dog.  Mae and I went into
Ogden to check on the Colonial Court Apartments west of the Temple.  No one was
in the office so that was a waste of time although we did get to look at the
Temple construction.  It will be great when they get it completed.  We went out
to Sportsman Ware House and bought my Laser Sight for my gun.  We then went up
to David’s home in Enter Prize where we joined with David’s family and Sandi
and Nick for dinner.  We then went to a benefit concert, featuring Collin Raye,
at the Morgan High School.  We quite enjoyed the concert and they did bring in
$33,000 to help a family with a very handicap child.  We were late getting home
so I didn’t get to bed until 11PM and it was almost midnight before Mae came to
bed.</p>

tired when I got home.  We had something to eat and then I went to bed for
about an hour.  Mick, Becky, Mattie and Jessie stopped in and had lunch with
us.  I then had to leave for my PM runs.  Mae and Sandi attended some classes,
this evening at Clearfield High School.  I finished leveling the garden and
then started tearing out the grape vines north of the house.  Bob came out and
drove the pickup for me and that sure helped.  I then came in and got ready for
bed and worked on my journal entries.  At 9:20PM I called Mae.  She is out of
the class and will soon be home.</p>

AM runs went well.  After getting home the Missionaries called asking for a
ride.  That worked out and after dropping them off Mae and I went to J&amp;J
Nursery and bought some garden seeds.  We also stopped at Durk’s plumbing to
check on some garden watering hose.  Before going to work I went to the city
offices to check on bringing grape vines down and they said that the grape
vines wouldn’t go through their chopper, so no.  I also checked about the
annual registering of chickens and I do have to do that.  I asked about cats,
horses, cows, sheep, goats, ducks and etc.  Oh well!  My PM runs went well this
afternoon.  This evening I purchased 25 gallons of gas and put it in storage. 
I also started cleaning up the grape vines and putting them in my pickup.  Mae
came out and help some but I made her put her sling on to remind her not to use
her right arm.  The back yard looks much better with that set of grape vines
taken out.  </p>

runs went well today.  In between runs Mae and I laid out the garden on paper. 
We also took the pickup in for emission, inspection and registration.  This
evening Mae had planned on Brother John Sliger coming for dinner and to do some
repairs to our computer, but he didn’t show up.  I bought some peat moss and
some Vis Queen for our garden.  By the time we did that it was time to take
showers and go to bed.</p>

garden.  I was able to spend about an hour in the garden getting the lines set
for the strawberries.  After finishing my PM runs I went over to Scott’s and
looked at his sprinkler system and what changes he can make in his watering
system.  I brought their children back home with me.  Mae had dinner about
ready when we got here.  After dinner I helped get the dishes into the
dishwasher.  Mae took the children over to the park and I went upstairs and
watched two shows that Bob had recorded.  They were both very good although I
had seen the one show before.  I came downstairs just as Scott and Mishelle
came for their children.  Mae was tired as she had entertained the children all
evening.  I entered this entry and we went to bed.</p>

reason the Comcast was down so that stopped the TV, the phones and the
internet.  Bob doesn’t have any patient and especially when it comes to his
TV!  I worked in the garden all day, getting all the seedlings planted, with
Mae’s help.  Morgan came over as he couldn’t reach us by phone, to let me know
that John Slager is in the hospital.  He thinks that he will be home tonight. 
He also let us know that Willy and Linda’s daughter died during the night and
they found her Friday morning when she didn’t get up for work.  This evening we
took Morgan and Marge Thomas out to dinner to repay Marge for doing Mae’s hair
for her while Mae is recovering with her arm.  After dinner the four of us
stopped by the Haydorn’s and visited with them.  When Mae and I got home we

back to having High Priest Leadership meeting at 8AM on Sundays.  I didn’t ware
my hearing aids and so there was quite a bit I am missing.  Bob had pork chops
ready for dinner ready when we got home.  Mae and I took a nap after eating.  A
couple of phone calls interrupted that nap for Mae.  After getting up I helped
Mae make some cut-outs for her Sunday School class for next week.  I then
worked on my journals for a while.  We went over to Scott and Mishelle’s at
5:30PM and had dinner.  After dinner Scott and I looked at his yard for
expanding his sprinklers.  The little children and Ashley went downstairs and
watched a show on the TV.  Kylan, Scott, Mishelle, Mae and I played a game of
Mormon Bridge with Kylan won.  We all had a lot of fun playing.</p>

Teaching so I took the pickup over to the Dispatch and did get the 29<sup>th</sup>
scheduled off.  I called Randy to let him know that the 18<sup>th</sup> fishing
trip is off.  I mentioned that I was so upset I felt like quitting.  He said
that he would like to talk to me about a proposition.  I went up to the county
dumps and unloaded the grape vines and then went down to Randy’s.  He would
like to hire me as a chuffer.  We talked over some ideas and I told him I would
think about it and talk it over with Mae.  When I got home Mae and I talked
about it and Mae isn’t against it.  Maybe it could work out.  My PM runs went
well.  Mae had “Hay Stacks” for dinner.  We then went for a walk and talked
more about Randy’s proposition and came up with more ideas.  I need to find out
just what I am getting paid per hour and I can do that tomorrow.  Mae and I
played three games of Rummy Cube and I won 2 out of 3.  We then took our pills

for him but he can’t afford it at this time.  I was concerned about that.  Mae
was gone this evening so after getting home from work I went over to Costco and
had my hearing aids adjusted and then went to Harbor Freight to get a message
vibrator but they said that they didn’t carry them.  Randy is the one that told
me about it so I called him but he wasn’t home.  After getting home I watched
part of “Gun Smoke” and then watched another cute movie until Mae got home.  It

After getting home we attended the funeral services for Shanon Marie Heydorb. 
I was asked to give the opening prayer for the services.  It was a very
appropriate funeral.  We know her parents in our Ward but had never really met
Shanon.   My PM runs went well.  After getting home we quickly ate some dinner
and went to an appointment with Wayne Johnson, a Chiropractor that Mae and
Sandi have been going to some classes with.  I am not sure what was

a few minutes when Mae had to leave as she; Gail and Mishelle are going
shopping and out to eat.  I took a nap and then called most of the families in
my Home Teaching District to give them a reminder about the need for help in
the onion patch.  I walked down and visited with Mark Stringer to see if he
could also help with the onions.  We visited about his boat for a while but I
finally left to come home and get some things done before my PM runs.  I worked
some more in my journals.  Mae got home just as I was ready to leave for the

for me to eat.  I went down to the Stake Farm and planted onions for 2 hours
and 15 minutes.  I was tired and starting to hurt so I quite.  There were quite
a few people down there including families.  The only one from our Ward except me
was Mark McFee.  I called Morgan and gave him a report but like Morgan said we
can only ask.  David and his family stopped for just a minute to drop their dog
off for us to tend while they got to Idaho for a basket ball tournament that
Tyler will play in.   Well it’s getting late and I need to wash Mae’s hair
before we got to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
did sleep in a little later this morning but when we got up we kept busy
getting ready for our family to come for an Easter Egg hunt and dinner.  We
only had Scott and his family and Jeff and his family here this year for the
Easter activity.  We had a good time being together.  Mae, Mishelle and Gail
attended a Baby Shower for Kristy as they are adopting a baby boy about the 12<sup>th</sup>
of May.  We sure hope things work out ok.  I went over to Scott’s and he and I
figured the materials he would need to get his yard sprinkler system working
right.  I then went up to Jeff’s.  Mae and Gail came a little later.  Jeff
showed us some of his pictures from his trip to China.  They were very
interesting.  Jeff, Gail, Mae and I had a game of Hand &amp; Foot in which Mae
and I won.  We were late getting home and to bed.</p>

Mae and I had a hard time getting up this morning.  While I showered and got
ready Mae prepared me some cereal.  When I got to the Church house there wasn’t
many there.  I found out that Morgan had told the others that we wouldn’t meet
this morning as it was Easter.  Charles had forgotten so he showed up.  He and
I started setting up chairs.  Brother David Probert had put up the chairs in
the over flow area and helped us in the R.S. room.  We then did the chairs in
the Jr. S.S. room.  I was glad that I had gone over early.  Meeting went well
but I had trouble with my hearing aids and part way through Sacrament meeting I
removed them.  Mae said that her S.S. class went well even though she didn’t
have an assistant with her.  We fixed some lunch after getting home.  I then
gathered the eggs and fed the chickens.  We both took a short nap.  I tried to
contact JaNae to find out where and which Hospital Brad was in, but she never
did return my TEXT message.  I worked on some of my personal history.  I did
take some time to go to the church and help with the set up for Sister Johnston’s
Funeral services tomorrow.  We plan on attending the viewing tomorrow before
the funeral and attend the funeral services.  It is now getting quite late so
we had better get to bed.</p>

woke with my ears very stuffy so I didn’t put on my earring aids today.  mae
made waffles for our breakfast.  My AM runs went well.  I took my bus in for
service when I finished but a few minutes after getting home the shop called
and said that my bus had been pulled and was out of service for now.  I will
have to get a sub bus for a while.  We attended the Viewing and Funeral service
for Cleone Elaine Keller Johnston today.  We are so glad that we had the
privilege knowing her even if it has been only a comparatively short time but
she was a real Lady in every way.  I just hope that Elwood can soon join her. 
I helped put up chairs for the family lunching after the services plus we put
up the chairs in the overflow area.  I came home long enough to eat some lunch
and take a 15 minute nap before taking my PM runs.  The bus I got is one of the
oldest ones but it will do.  After the bus runs I went to Durk’s and got
sprinkler parts for Scott and Mishelle’s place.  I sure appreciated Chris’s
help for he know just what we needed and where they were located.  Mae soon had
dinner ready when I got home.  After eating Scott came to get the roto-tiller
and that took most of the evening.  It is now time to get ready for bed and we
didn’t get the things done we wanted to.</p>

didn’t sleep last night.  After going to bed I couldn’t breathe due to my
synapses being plugged up.  I removed the c-pap and went to sleep for a few
minutes but woke again with a splitting head ache.  I tried to sleep in the
recliner but finally turned the TV on and watched most of a show.  Before 5AM I
called into the dispatch and reported that I would not be driving today.  At
6AM I took some Acetaminophen and went to bed for a little while with Mae.  I
went over to Jennie’s and she gave me some things to help me.  She feels that I
have sinus and inner ear infection.  After getting home I went to bed and was
able to sleep for a while.  Bob cooked chicken and gave us some for dinner.  He
sure does that a lot.  At 6PM Brother Taylor and Brother Saunders’s came over
and gave me a blessing through the Priesthood.  I sure appreciated their
willingness to serve.  We tried the hot packing, alternating with cold packing
of my ears and sinus area and it made me quite dizzy for a little while.  I was
able to sleep fairly well tonight.</p>

Mae took Randy to his appointment for me.  After taking Randy back to his home,
Mae went visiting teaching.  I slept most of the time that she was gone.  I did
try to repeat the Hot and Cold packing.  I watched most of the American
Experience: The Mormons, while Mae was gone.  When Mae returned home we got
some lunch and watched “The Saratov Approach” on DVD that Mae was able to
barrow.  We really enjoyed that moving movie of an actual Experience.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early I guess because I was concerned with all the things we needed to do
before I went to work.  My AM runs went well.  When I got back to the compound
I saw my bus with the “Out of Service” sign taken out of the window.  I called
and was told that before they released it to me they were going to replace the
driver’s seat.  I can wait on that as I have been complaining about my seat
from day one of this year.  I guess that while I was off the sub-drivers had
some problems.  I was told by students and the office assistant at the
elementary school that they were glad I was back.  When I got back to the
compound I was told that my bus was ready.  I was glad to swap the spare back
for my bus.  I went over to Scott’s and helped him get one water line ran in. 
I got home at 7PM.  Jeff and Gail were here to get the children as Mae tended
them while Jeff and Gail went out to eat.  The four of us played a couple of
games of Rummy Cub before they went home.  It really rain hard this evening and
I had to go out in it to fill the chicken’s water cans.  We are trying to get
to bed early this evening as we will have to get up at 4AM tomorrow in order to
be at the State Republican Convention tomorrow.  It is already 9PM now, so we
won’t get to bed very early.</p>

woke at 3:30AM but let Mae sleep a little longer.  She still was up by 4AM.  We
did get to the Convention Center in Salt Lake before 7AM but by the time we
found where we were to register, we were 1<sup>st</sup> in line.  We then went
through the various booths and learned quite a bit as to who were Candidate’s
for what offices and what Resolutions were being voted on.  The conventions
actually got started at 10AM and went thru until almost 4PM.  It was a long day
but I felt that it was very interesting.  I felt bad that we hadn’t talked to
anyone or had anyone in our Precinct as to what we should vote for.  I can’t
criticize any one without criticizing myself for this is about the first time I
have done much towards being involved with the elections.  Mae has done more
but I have only attended the Caucus meetings.  I felt some amazement in out of
all the population of Utah, and I understand the population is majority
Republicans, only 4000 Delicates really get to vote on those running or
Constitution &amp; By Laws Amendments and then 204 of those Delicates did not
show up.  It seems to me that “We the People” aren’t really very interested in
our government.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got home in time to get changed and go to Our Stake Conference meeting.  I had
difficulty hearing some of the speakers but what those I heard, I really
enjoyed.  Our Stake President Announced that the Ogden Temple Open House will
be in August and Dedicated in September.  I would like to be called to work in
it.  After hearing the Speakers in our meeting I again get the feeling that I
would like to serve another mission.  I just don’t know how things will turn
out.  We really can’t leave Bob and we don’t have much financial support.  </p>

don’t know what to do about it.  We attended Regional Conference which was
broadcast from the Conference Center.  Elder Neil A. Anderson of the Quorum of
the Twelve presided.  Elder Clayton of the Seventies was also there.  It was a
very good conference.  The Conference took the place of Stake Conference for
all the Davis County and Morgan Stake’s.  I was so excited as I thought that
David and his family might be at the conference in Morgan but then Mae told me
that they went to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>St. George
for the week end.  After conference Mae and I went Visiting Teaching and Home
Teaching to Sister Fallis.  We came home and got some dinner.  At 3PM our Home
Teachers, Brother Richard Taylor and Brother Korbin Rogers came Home Teaching
to Bob, Mae and I.  Mae and I watched a good movie on DVD, “Courage” before

and having something to eat a took a nap.  Mae went with me and we went to
Discount Tires and had them rotate and balance the tires on our car.  From
there we went to Good Earth for a few things.  We then went to Cost Co and I
returned my hearing aids.  Mae picked up a few items while there.  We then went
to Harbor Freight where I bought a palm sander.  We got home just in time to
let Mae off and I made it to the bus compound and made me PM runs.  This
evening I called Sandi to see about helping them turn on their lawn sprinklers
for the summer.  We then called Mike to wish him a Happy Birthday.  As I was
visiting with him somehow I brought up the Republican meeting and that was a mistake
because I got told how little I know.  It seems that whenever I try to talk to
any of my sons I end up being wrong.  Irven and Sandy came over to Bob’s and we
watched two shows that Bob had recorded.  They were both cute shows.  After the
shows was over we got talking to Irven and Sandy and different things came up
and I blow that also.  I am not sure just how to put my thoughts over that I
don’t end up wrong.  I just had to shut up and go down stairs.  We stayed up
late this evening as I am not going to work tomorrow.  I had planned on going
fishing but decided against that because it is too cold and stormy now.</p>

interruptions.  Bob decided that we needed to service the rider lawnmower
before mowing lawns today.  We had to buy some oil and a filter for the mower. 
I checked on buying a new battery for the trimmer but they want $99.00 for it. 
The trimmer is not worth that.  Mae had gone to visit with Jackie from 11AM
until almost 3PM.  I had Mae get on the computer and she found a batter for the
trimmer for $55 on the internet.  That is a better price.  Scott came over and
brought some tools back and borrowed my ladder.  Brody came to see his
Grandfather but Bob had just left to run up to the base.  We had him come in
and visit for a little while until Bob returned.  I did get the lawns trimmed
and Bob used the rider mower.  Between the two of us we got the lawns mowed and
trimmed.  I was able to visit the Casey family for a few minutes and then after
dinner I went with Morgan to visit one of his families.  It is now 8:40PM and I
am about ready for bed.  We are trying to make arrangements to go to California
when they have a retirement Party for Lee Brown.  We think we can arrange the
trip to coin side with our trip with David and his family.  I will have to take
the 30<sup>th</sup> of May off in order to get there by the 31<sup>st</sup> of
May.  I finished this entry and we soon went to bed, very tired.</p>

had to take the pickup as the car had a tire that was almost flat.  After my
morning runs, I went to Jennies to get some Vitim E for Mae.  That took a while
as I couldn’t reach Mae to find out just what she wanted.  I worked on our
sprinkler system for a while, talking to Chris at Durk’s who told me how to set
the timer controls.  I also had Mae sent a E-Mail, for me, to Sandy to
apologize for the other night.  I didn’t have time to take the car back to Discount
Tire to get the tire fixed.  Mae took it back this afternoon and the one tire
was bad.  We had to buy two new tires.  After my afternoon buns I helped Scott
with his sprinklers.  We had to get some new parts so we didn’t get very far
today.  I will have to come back tomorrow after work.  I had some super and
watched a show on TV before we went to bed.  I was in quite a bit of back and
leg pain when I went to bed.  Mae rubs my back and leg with Thera-gesic and
that usually lets me relax and go to sleep.  I slept well.</p>
