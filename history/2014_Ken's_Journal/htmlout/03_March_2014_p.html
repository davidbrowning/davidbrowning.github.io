<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke about 4M with my phone ringing.  Whoever by the time we found it wasn’t
ringing.  The battery was completely drained and that might have been the
reason for the ring.  Neither of us could go back to sleep for a while.  When
we did we slept in late.  It has been an interesting day.  We are concerned
about Brad and JaNae and their situation.  We got a letter offering a job
mailing out information but I feel that it is a scam as they want us to send
them $199.00 to show them our true intentions and willingness.  I checked the
chickens and they seem to be ok.  I got 11 eggs plus the one hen is still
sitting. David called and asked if we would be interested in going to
Washington for a week, the first part of June.  It sounds fun and we might be
interested.  This evening we went to the Sizzler in Bountiful where all of our
children except Shellie, Roy and Nick were there to honor my 75<sup>th</sup>
Anniversary.  Mike and Becky paid for Mae’s and my dinner.  Sandi and Nick
bought me my new fishing license and put it inside a nice card.  David, Shauna,
Scott and Mishelle gave me a Gift Card from Sportsman’s Warehouse for $120.00
in a nice card.  Jeff and Gail gave me a $100.00 bill in a nice card.  Mae also
gave me a new Jump Suite that we picked up at J.C. Penney’s.  It has been a
very great Birthday party as we ate and visited.  Jeff and Gail invited us over
to their place after we left the Sizzler.  Mae and I were the only two that
went.  We played a game of Rummy Cube, in which Jeff won.  It was 10PM when we
got home.  I entered this entry and we soon went to bed.  </p>

attended my High Priest Group Leadership meeting.  I had forgotten that I was
to give the lesson this morning.  I called Mae to get her to bring the Ensign
over.  She was trying to find her keys to the car.  We had taken them with us
to St. George, but I couldn’t think where we put them.  I therefore walked home
and got Mae.  Meetings went well and Morgan gave the lesson for me.  After
returning home for the Block program, Mae and I took a nap.  We were woke by a
phone call asking us to give to a donation.  Then my phone rang again but it
was Shellie so I visited with her.  She and Roy are updating their Will and she
wanted to know that if something was to happen to her and Roy, if we would be
willing to care for Jase until he could take care of himself.  We had a good
visit.  This afternoon Morgan, Charles and I went visiting Brother Roper and
Sister Haydorn.  Roger just had a knee replacement and is doing quite well. 
Sister Linda Haydorn is still in recovery from some operations and is looking
much better than she was when we administered to her after the surgery.  After
getting home I called to get reports about Home Teaching for February.  Irven
and sandy came over and showed us a DVD on nutrition.  It is now bed time so I
had better get to bed.</p>

woke at 12:30AM thinking that it was time to get up.  After looking at the
clock I went back to bed and slept until the alarm woke me.  Mae wasn’t that
lucky and she didn’t get much sleep.  I fixed my own breakfast but while I was
eating Mae came out and said that she couldn’t go back to sleep.  My morning
runs went well.  After letting the grade school off I drove over to the Kaysville
Tanner Clinic where I got my DOT medical sheet, covering my CPAP usage.  I then
drove the office where I got my DOT medical examination.  They gave me a new
DOT card that is good for a year.  It was 10:30AM when I got back to the bus
shop.  Bob took Irven, Sandy, Mae and I out to the Chuck-A-Rama and bought us
dinner as our Birthday gifts.  After getting home Mae and I took a nap before I
took my PM runs.  After getting home I got all the paper work put together and
ready to send to the Drivers License Department.  This evening we read our
Priesthood/Relief Society lesson and then we watched a DVD (Love Finds a Home)
and enjoyed that.</p>

I got up to take my shower there was no hot water.  I finally went up stairs to
see if Bob had taken a hot shower early this morning.  He had turned the water
on last night and had forgotten to turn it off.  We ate breakfast and then I
took a quick shower.  My runs went well.  When I got back to the compound I had
to have my bus inspected by the High Way Patrol.  That took an hour.  Mae had a
snack ready for me and then we went over to Jenny’s where she tested me.  She
did find some concerns but was able to cut my pills down by a lot.  As we came
out of her office we walked by a gray car that looked very similar to ours but
when I saw it I about had a heart attack as the Left front head light and
bumper were broken.  We then noticed that it was not our car.  Wow! Was that a
relief! We just had time to get a bite to eat and I left for my PM runs.   I
stopped and had new windshield wipers put on my bus, but that took longer than
I had planned so I was later getting to my Jr. High School.  I didn’t have time
to take a walk like I wanted to.  My runs went well.  After getting home we ate
dinner, then I worked on my journals and then we went shopping at Costco.  I
finished my journal entry and soon went to bed.</p>

morning Mae prepared waffles for breakfast.  My runs went well and I got home
on time.  Mae did some calling on flights to Arizona.  We have decided that she
will fly down and I will stay home.  The expense for the two of us is too much
and I would have to take a week and a half off work.  Also it will be right at
planting time for the garden.  After returning home I took the Full Time
Missionaries over to the 8<sup>th</sup> Ward Chapel in Clearfield.  I took a
nap and typed up the experience I had when I was in High School and Margaret
had brought a fellow home.  My PM runs went well and just as I was coming to
the bus compound, Rosa called me asking me to drive a Field Trip tomorrow. 
Bryce called and informed Mae that Marvin Fisher passed away and he viewing is
this evening.  Marvin was in the Bishopric with John Nicholas and also served
with Dad Porter when he was Bishop.  We went over to Scott and Mishelle’s so I
could measure some dresser drawers that need new runners installed in them.  We
then came home and changed and went to the Viewing.  We remembered his daughter
Carol who we visited with there, but we didn’t know any of the other family.  I
wrote up this journal entry and we soon went to bed.</p>

wasn’t feeling the best this morning but she still got up and helped me get
ready for work.  I would have not let her except I will be gone all day with a
Field Trip.  After my AM runs I went to Cook Elementary where I picked up the
children that are scheduled to go to Salt Lake, to the USU Utah History
Museum.  It took two bus and not knowing just where the Museum is and also the
teacher that was with my bus, doesn’t know just where it is, I kept very close
track the other bus.  We found it ok because of the other bus driver.  After
unloading the children we drove to where we could park the busses.  The other
driver and I, after finding a rest room, came back to my bus.  As we were
visiting he started getting quite carried off about with some radical theories
and after a while started telling me that there are leaders of the Church that
have been leading the Church in directions good for their own prophet.  I
finally backed up and straight forward asked him if he felt that President
Monson was one of them.  He said that the last 7 Presidents were fallen.  I
stopped the conversation right there and got him off the bus.  I called him an
apostate to the church and refused to talk to him more.  It really upset me. 
We returned the children to Cook Elementary and then I went straight to the Jr.
High.  I did have time to walk before the students came out.  This evening Mae
and I watched The move, “Mighty Macs” which we enjoyed.  I am sure thankful for
my sweetheart and for my Testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, The Book of
Mormon, my Testimony of the Prophet’s in these Last Days and for President
Thomas Monson, his councilors and the Quorum of the Twelve.  I do sustain them
in their great calling of the Lord to lead the Church in these latter days.</p>

bad experience for him.  His hearing aids would not pick up the sound even with
head phones on.  I also left his neck amplifier in the locker so that added to
the problem.  We made it but it was disturbing.  After leaving the Temple we
went to Sizzler in Layton for Steak and All You Can Eat Shrimp.  We sure enjoyed
that.  This evening we attended the Stake High Priest Quorum Banquet.  It was
nice but there was no program.  Charles and Karen Saunder’s came over to our
place for about an hour after the dinner.  We played a game of Raco and Karen
really whipped us.  </p>

meeting we stayed for choir practice.  We then stopped and visited Brother Dee
Francom.  He is getting quite old and he thinks that we will soon move back to
Pennsylvania with his daughter.  We came home and got some lunch and took care
of the chickens.  We next went over to the care center in Layton and visited
with Patriarch and Sister Johnstun.  After that we went over to Jeff and Gail’s
for dinner.  After dinner we played games with them until 9PM before leaving to

work.  My morning runs went well.  I spent most of my break composing a letter
to Paul as to my testimony of the Prophets and Apostles.  I am inserting a copy
of that letter at the end of this entry.  I don’t know if it will do any good

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
apologize for the way our conversation went last week, but when you started
accusing men that I have known, some even very personally, it really upset me. 
You said that you believed in Jesus Christ, and I presume that includes the
Apostles of Christ.  You also said that you believed in the Prophet Joseph
Smith and some of the early Prophets of this dispensation, but have doubts
concerning some of the last Prophets.  Again, you said that you believe in the
Book of Mormon.  I am left to question how well you are acquainted with these
latter Prophets or have studied their lives and teachings.  Also, how well you
have studied the Book of Mormon.  May I suggest that you read, (and study) Alma
chapter 5 and then may I suggest that you fast and pray for the spirit to
testify to you of the truthfulness of these teachings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                You
told me that you can produce evidence of some of these accusations, against
these later Prophets and Apostles.  Remember that it was Religious leaders that
brought forth false evidence to Pilot that condemned Jesus to be crucified on
the cross.  Remember that it was false evidence from those that were personal
associates of Joseph Smith, which caused him to be jailed and then they painted
their faces with blackness and was in the mob that murdered Joseph and his
brother Hyrum.  I have seen many of these so called evidences against the
Church and its leaders, even as early as when I was 14 years of age and the
latest, just a few years ago, when I was brought a stack of anti-Mormon so called
documents, that were literally 8 to 10 inches high.  As I went through them I
found some of the same ones that I had been given at age 14.  The rest had no
evidence that could be verified, only hear-say statements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
have personally met with many of these leaders of the Church.  I have read and
studied many of their personal lives and teachings.  I have set in leadership
training in which they have taught.  I have taught classes using their personal
lives and teachings.  I have had the privilege of eating lunch with one of the
apostles and his wife and visiting one on one in a casual setting.  Never once
have I ever found anything that would cause me any question as to their
integrity or loyalty to our Lord and Savior.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Think
of what they give when they accept these callings.  From the position of Jr.
Apostle to the Prophet, they will never retire but will serve until they die. 
They will serve and travel where ever in the world they are sent and needed. 
They receive no monitary retirement benefits, but are paid for their personal
and immediate expenses.  Even in their late 80’s and even into their 90’s they
still put in full days at the office.  President Monson is now in his 90’s and
keeps a full calendar that would exhaust most men several years younger.  They
leave no financial dowry or estate to their Family upon their death except for
their personal testimony and example.  I have heard of them being given time to
meet with family members and having a day to spend at Disney Land if their
Church assignment took them to that area and their assignment allowed them
time.  The positions they hold is not sought for but is controlled by the Lord
through seniority and death.               </p>

also stop at Jennie’s and pickup some items for her.  It was 9:40AM when I got

going to work.  I found problems with my bus and had to have a mechanic help me
remove the radiator cap and fill radiator with coolant.  I was still able to
leave in time to get to my first pickup on time.  The rest of my runs went well

the bus.  When I got home there was a letter from Altius for me.  I put the
information in our medical records before I discarded the letter.  I went over
to the church and helped Mae and Sister Garf set up and decorate a Relief
Society social this evening.  While waiting for our wife’s to finish Brother
Garf and I got visiting.  The subject of military and benefits came up.  He
said that I should be eligible for Veterans Benefits.  I will have to look into
it, as I was told that because they think I had a preexisting condition, I was
not eligible for any benefits.  My PM runs went well and when I returned home I
took care of the chickens, then Mae had dinner ready.  Scott came over and set
our TV up to work on the Comcast or the DVD player.  We watched the end of a
show while eating.  Mae then left to attend a Relief Society Birthday party.   I
watched the “Undefeated” starring John Wayne.  It was a good show.  I worked on

AM runs went well but shortly after I got home, Mae went up to tend Gail’s children
while she went to the Temple.  I lay down to take a nap but the dispatch called
and asked me to take a mid-day run.  I said that I would so they gave me the
bus number 331 and said that they would print me a route sheet.  When I got
over to dispatch there was no print out in my box, so I went into dispatch and
asked for a route for 331.  I found the bus and waited for an assistant to
come.  When one did not come I called dispatch on the radio and they told me to
wait a little longer.  Finally I left with out her as I only had 3 children to
take home.  I went to Lake Side Elementary and waited but the children didn’t
come.  I called dispatch and they said I was at the wrong school but should go
to Adams Elementary.  They would have an assistant meet me there.  Adams is on
the opposite side of the valley.  Before I got there dispatch called me to tell
me that the car that was taking my assistant to the school had broken down and
ask if I could pick her up on the way.  That was good timing as I was just a half
a block from where her car was broke down.  After getting my assistant we went
to the school and got most of the children as many parents had came and got
their child.  With the help of the assistant we made it.  I then took my PM
runs and they went well.  I was able to take a long walk between the mid-day
run and my PM runs.  I filled in my payroll information before coming home.  I
was tired.  Mae soon had dinner ready and we ate it while we watched part of a
TV show.  We started another one but we had seen it before.  We couldn’t find
anything else so we turned it off and played Sequence.  Mae won me 2 out of 3
rounds.  We went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
of us slept well last night.  My bus runs went well this morning.  After
getting home I was on the computer getting some of my school records corrected. 
Mae took me to work for my PM runs.  After I finished the runs Mae came back
and got me.  We went over to the Layton City Library and returned a book on
tape.  We then went to Dr. Wilcox an E.N.T. and Mae went to Tanner Clinic and
got  a Tetanus and Whooping Cough shot.  She then came back and was with me
while Dr. Wilcox checked my ears.  He had me take another Audiology test and
after looking at those he said I was a rather confusing problem.  He doesn’t
feel that Manears as David felt I might and he gave the reasoning why.  He also
does not understand why the first Audiology test would start this whole
situation off.  I felt very impressed with Dr. Wilcox’s thoroughness in testing
me and explaining his feelings.  When we left his office I asked Mae for my
keys.  She didn’t have them and at first I said that she had to have them as I
didn’t.  then as I thought through our step by step sequence I realized I
hadn’t used my keys to drive the car from the bus shop to the doctor’s office. 
That meant that I must have left them in my school bus.  We went to the Megaplex
Theater in Ogden where we saw the movie “Son of God” which both Mae and I felt
was a pretty close description of the Events as given in the New Testament.  We
hadn’t had time between the Dr. visit and the movie to get anything to eat,
until we got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
had to get up and be at the church house by 8AM to help with the weekly
cleanup.  That went quite well.  After completing that job we went over to the
bus compound and checked my bus and my keys were still hanging in the ignition
switch.  I had to apologize to Mae for my mistake.  We then went to look at a
car wash that is for sale.  We were both hunger so we went to Golden Corral and
ate.  When we got home we went to bed for a while.  When I went out to feed and
water the chickens I found that we had two new chicks that had hatched by the
black hen.  They seem to be doing fine.  This evening I started hooking up some
equipment for Bob.  Grant also came over to help.  We have a door bell that
will set off a flashing light and a vibrator in his chair.  Grant then came
downstairs and set up our remote control for our TV.  Hopefully that will help
us enjoy our TV better as we haven’t had control of the sound or mute of the TV
without getting up and going to the TV.  You wouldn’t think that would be such
a big thing, but with most of the shows now on TV, 50% of the time is
advertisements.  I am not feeling very well this evening and would like to go
to bed but I remembered that I needed to get an article for our Ward News
Letter into Brother Sliger before mid-night.  I had to have Mae help me as I
was in such pain that I couldn’t sit at the computer.  With her help we got it
sent.  I’m not sure if it was what was appropriate or not, but it went in.  it
was after mid-night before we went to bed.</p>

really didn’t feel like getting up this morning.  I walked to my meetings so
that Mae would have the car.  I later found out that Mae hadn’t got her keys
out of the car yesterday so they were still locked in it this morning and she
had to walk to Church anyway.  I was to start taking the medication that Dr.
Larsen prescribed for me this morning but Mae read all the disclaimers on it
and decided that I shouldn’t take them, so I didn’t.  I am confused as to just
what I should do.  This afternoon Mae called and visited with Jenney and she
also feels that it will increase my Candida and possibility put it out of
control. This afternoon we had our Home Teachers, Brother Bryn Taylor and
Brother Crobin Rogers, come Home Teaching.  Later Mae and I went Visiting
Teaching and Home Teaching to Sister Fallis.  We had a good visit with Leslie
and we hope she will start coming back to Church.  I worked on my Diary for a
little while.  Mae got on Face Time and we visited with Mike and also with
David’s and his family.  It’s now bed time so we had better close this now.</p>

St. Patrick Day until I started picking up the grade school children.  My runs
went well.  After getting home, I worked on some of my history stories.  I took
a nap.  Scott and Mishelle brought the twins over for Mae to tend while they
went out for Mishelle’s Birthday.  My PM runs went well.  Scott and Mishelle
had just got here to get the twins when I got home.  I worked for sometime on
my history again.  Before going to bed Mae and I played some Rummy.  I won this
evening, that’s a switch.  Good night.</p>

woke early and know that Mae had been up during the night, so I thought I would
let her sleep in again.  Mae heard me up and she got up and got my breakfast
before I left.  My runs went well.  Dispatch asked for drivers that could help
with field trips tomorrow, so after checking with Mae, I went in to volunteer. 
However they didn’t have a trip I could take because of the restriction on
hours.  Mae and I went shopping for my laser sights for our pistol.  Sportsman
Warehouse has them on back order but they can’t order one just for me.  I am
not happy about that.  I tried calling other Sportsman Warehouse but they all
give me the same story.  My PM runs went well.  Mae went over to Clearfield
High School to register for a class for her and Sandi.  I was on the phone and
internet for quite a while researching the Laser Sight.  It’s now bed time so I
had better quite for tonight.</p>

Bond, her cousin.  I did some checking on materials to make drawer slides and
found that the materials will be just about as expensive as building them,
besides the work.  I got the shop to repair the emergency rear door on my bus. 
I did some checking on the Lazier sight for my pistol but didn’t get very far. 
I am having quite a bit of pain through my left leg.  My ears are getting worse
and my hearing aids only make things worse.  This evening we went over to Jeff
and Gail’s where Jeff and I worked on Ben’s Pine Wood Derby.  </p>

runs went well except when I was doing my grade school run, I was traveling
east on E. Gentile around the Golf Course when a yellow and black Jeep came
around the curve and took more than his share of the road.  It is a very narrow
road anyway and as I was afraid that he was going to come into my lane, I
turned right and caught a tree branch with my right rear view mirror and broke
the mirror.  I had to report it to the Safety Coordinator and now I have a
report that must be filled out.  The shop had a new mirror installed so I could
take my bus this afternoon.  This evening Mae and I attended the Republican
Caucus meeting for our district.  I am hurting quite a lot from pain coming
from the Sciatica Nerve and my ears are even worse.  During the meeting Mae and
I were chosen to be delegates for our district at the state Republican Party on
April 26<sup>th</sup>.  </p>

AM runs went well.  When I got home I took a nap and worked on composing a
letter to the Mayor of Layton about the trees on E. Gentile Road.  About
11:30AM Bob knocked on the wall.  He had me come upstairs as a Clinton City
Police officer needed to talk to me.  I went up and he introduced himself and
said that a complaint had been turned into the Mayor about me having a
rooster.  The officer apologized that he had to inform me but he had received a
letter from the Mayor and so had to do he duty.  I told him that I would get
rid of the rooster although I felt that this property was under the Grandfather
exemption.  My PM runs went well.  When I got home I found that Mae had taken a
walk and tripped on the sidewalk in front of Shirley Olson’s.  She had banged
up her knees but had hurt her right arm.  Her hand is quite bruised but her arm
hurts.  I took her to the Tanner Clinic after hours where they x-rayed her arm
and put it in a half cast so that she doesn’t move it.  A radiologist will look
at the x-ray on Monday morning and then the Dr. will call us.  At this point it
doesn’t look like it was broken but they will know for sure on Monday.  We got
some Chicken at the Madox in Layton.  We ate while watching a TV show.  When
the chickens went in to roost, I went out and caught the rooster, the banty
rooster and the hen that has broken her leg.  I put them in cages and will
butcher the three of them tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 4 AM thinking about our chickens and rooster problem.  Am I right to,
just because a new neighbor moved in, get rid of my rooster?  I know that there
is a new city ordinance that states that there can be no roosters within city
limits, but when was that put into effect?  I killed the Banti Rooster and the
hen that had broken her leg but I let my big rooster go.  I prepared breakfast
of omelets for Mae and I.  After cleaning up the kitchen I started work on
installing a new electrical outlet in the bathroom.  Mae found a Hair Dresser
in Clearfield to wash, dry and set her hair as she cannot use her right arm.  This
afternoon we drove into Costco where I got my hearing aids adjusted and
readjusted.  We did buy a few items while there and brought a salad back home
for our dinner.  We watched a cute show on TV “A Hand for the Little Lady”.  It
sure kept you interested and wondering how it was going to turn out.  I figured
out the plot about half way through but Mae didn’t see it until right at the
end.  Mae’s assisting teacher called this evening and is sick so won’t be at
Church tomorrow.</p>

got up at 6:30 this morning and both hurried to get ready.  Although Mae is a
little slow with her casted right arm she still is going and plans on giving
the lesson.  While I was getting dressed Mae also prepared breakfast.  You just
don’t slow her down.  My hearing aids gave me problems during Sacrament
meetings and I finally took them out.  I missed much of the talks.  I was going
to prepare dinner with Mae’s direction and although I helped Mae really got
dinner.  We laid down this afternoon and took a nap.  After getting Shellie
called just to talk to her mom.  I wish I could talk to Roy about his demands,
but the last time I tried that it really backfired on me.  While Mae talked to
Shellie, I finished typing a letter to the Mayor of Layton. This afternoon we
drove up and visited with Patriarch and Sister Johnston.  We had a nice visit
with them.  When we got home I gathered the eggs and then came in and got us
some fruit and toast to eat this evening.  Lindsey called and talked to Mae and
the next thing I am told is that Mae is going to go over tomorrow and help tend
their children because Lindsey can’t lift over 5 LB for a while.  I can’t
believe Mae would volunteer to help with her arm in the shape it is in.  Bob is
having quite a bit of swelling in his left hand where his cat bit him a couple
of days ago.  We have had him soak his hand in Epson Salt and hot water.  That
is helping.  Mae typed Georgia and Rick a letter this evening while I did up
the dishes and took out the trash.   While she typed the letter, I finished
this journal entry.  It’s now time to get to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep the best and though I tried to get her to go back to bed, she got
up and got me off.  My runs went well.  After getting home Mae and I went to
the City Offices and found that unless Bob got an permit when he bought the
home, then this property comes under the ruling of “No Roosters in Clinton
City”, but she said that we could have up to 50 chickens on this lot.  As much
as I am unhappy about killing our rooster, I guess Saturday morning I will
“Kill the Old Black Rooster” and we will roast him for dinner.  Bob has been
trying to get his cat into a cage but she will not corporate.  I called the
Animal Control and they will come and get her.  We ate lunch and as we finished
David came over to put new batteries in his trailer.  We couldn’t figure out
the wiring.  Mae suggested that we look at Scott’s but when I did that I
realized that Scott’s trailer only has two wires and David’s trailer has 6 plus
a jumper.  I guess David will take it up to a dealer and pay them to hook it
up.  He said that when he took the old batteries out, he should have taken a
picture before unhooking it.  Too late now!  The Animal Control came just as I
left for work.  They took the cat away for Bob.  The Dr. Called Mae back and it
looks like she does have a broken arm.  David was still here when he called so
David was able to visit with the Doctor and understand the procedure better. 
She will have to go back into the Doctor on Wednesday.  We had super and are
now going up to Bob’s and watch a show he has recorded for us to see.  The show
is “The Happiest Millionaire” and we did enjoy it but when it got 9:30PM we
told Bob that we would have to finish it tomorrow night.  It was 10PM before we
got to bed.</p>

got up and got most of breakfast ready for me.  Having a broken arm sure
doesn’t slow her down very much.  On my morning runs we had “emergency
evacuations” with the children getting off the bus through the rear door.  At
both schools the drill went well and the students were very good about it.  
When I returned to the bus compound I had to get a light replaced on the bus. 
They have worked on this light several times so this time they replaced two
complete fixtures.  That took me some extra time, so when I got home Mae had
already showered and was trying to get dressed.  She had made a fruit drink and
toast for me to eat before we went into the Audiologists at Costco for another
adjustment on my hearing aids.  We made a couple of other stops afterwards. 
When we got home we ate some lunch and I got a 15 minute nap before going back
to work.  My PM runs went well.  I gave both groups of children a candy treat
to express appreciation for their corporation this morning.  I helped Mae
prepare dinner.  Scott came over and borrowed a couple of pipe wrenches to work
on his plumbing.  We went up stairs and watched the ending of the show we
watched last night.  Bob is getting quite forgetful and is hard to convince him
of some things.  I can see some of Mom’s traits showing up in him and that
worries me.  I am not sure about going through that again.  When we went to set
the alarm for tomorrow morning the Ipod was still on the computer charging. 
Mae got up during the night and brought the Ipod into the bedroom.</p>

Mae some exercises to do twice a day and we will see him next week.  I made
almond butter today but the Vitamix heated up on the third batch and we had to
let it cool down.  My PM runs went well and I got home before 4:30PM.  We
attended the Pine Wood Derby at Gale’s Ward in which Ben raced his car.  He
didn’t win the first race but won the next four.  I only stayed for his 2<sup>nd</sup>
