got up about 4AM and did sleep a little in the front room.  I woke about
6:50AM.  We had breakfast and got started.  We went to the Clinton home and
returned Bishop Hatch’s trailer to him.  That has sure been a blessing for us. 
We next borrowed a trailer from Brother and Sister Graf.  We left it at the
Clinton home, loaded some more items that we want stored at Sandi’s and drove
out to Tooele.  We had to take about half of the goods out of the boxes as the
boxes were wet from the storm Sunday.  We came back and loaded a lot of items
into the trailer, plus our fridge.  We took the fridge over to Irven and
Sandy’s who bought it from us to have in their garage.  The rest of the items
we took to the D.I. and gave it to them.  We returned to the Clinton home where
Scott and his family met us.  Scott removed the shelves from under the stairs
and we loaded them into his truck.  We gave those to him.  He also help us load
almost all of the remainder of our items into the trailer, except for the items
Mae wants in the house now and we put them in the pickup.  We put a good tarp
over the trailer and parked the trailer in the space where I will store my tool
trailer.  I parked our pickup at the house and secured a canvas over the back
to keep out any rain or snow that might occur before I can get the items
unloaded.  We were sure tired when we finished this evening after 9:30PM.  I
entered this entry before going to bed.  </p>

woke at 4:20 and couldn’t go back to sleep so she worked on the house.  I slept
until almost 7 before I woke up.  I had Mae go back to sleep and she was soon
out.  I let her sleep, getting my own breakfast.  I repaired the small table
that has Uncle Floyd Hill’s name on it.  I do not know the story behind it but
my mother ended up with it and then we got it when she passed away.  I used L
brackets to strengthen 8 joints.  I then strengthened another table that we
inherited from my mother.  Again we do not the story behind this table.  Mae uses
booth tables to have plants on them.  I then used dark ole English furniture
oil and restored the beauty in both tables.  By then Mae got up arranged  the
front room furniture and decided where we wanted to hang the pictures.  I
called Comcast and they got our home phone working.  I was able to brace up the
trailer, raising the trailer just a small amount which let the rear door
operate without sticking.  A little after 6:30PM the High Priest Group
Leadership came over to get acquainted and welcome us into the Ward.  We tried
to watch a show on Netflix, but we couldn’t get the Netflix to work.  I tried
to call Grant but he didn’t answer.</p>

didn’t get going until almost 9AM but both Mae and I slept pretty well.  After
breakfast we started right on to the house.  I got all the pictures hung on the
walls.  We did a little shopping and got a Sub-Way for dinner.  I mounted a new
surge protected plug on the computer desk and got everything associated with
the desk hooked up to it.  I also mounted another shelf in the desk.  It is now
10:45PM so we will be after 11PM before we get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 1:15AM thinking about Bryce’s dolly that he loaned me.  I couldn’t
remember where it was left and worried that I might have left it out where
someone may have taken it.  It bothered me so much that all sleep was gone.  I
finally got up and prayed about it.  I then put a coat on and used my flash
light and went out looking.  I found it in the storage shed.  I was relieved to
have found it but still couldn’t go to sleep so I turned on the TV and watched
a show before going back to bed about 3AM.  Mae let me sleep until almost 8AM. 
I prepared breakfast for us as Mae had already started with household items to
put away.    We were both busy with the house. About 3PM we loaded items to
take to the D.I.  We also had some items to take to the landfill.  We were too
late to go to the Land Fill but did go to the D.I.  We then went to the Clinton
home and loaded trash for the land fill and medal for the salvage yard.  We
next went to Scott’s and got my extension ladder so that I can put up Christmas
decorations outside.  When we got home, we got something to eat and watched a
Christmas movie on Netflix.  The home is closer every day to be finished.  It
was after 10:30 PM when we Quite and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept until 7AM but Mae was up earlier.  After breakfast I set the Christmas
tree and it looks nice.  Sister Graf stopped by for a few minutes on her way to
the Temple.  She wanted to add some of our children to the Temple Prayer Roll,
along with some of her children.  It seems that there are a lot of us that have
children and Grandchildren that are struggling with their testimonies.  I then went
to the D.I. and took more things.  From there I went to the metal salvage and
turned in a bunch of metal items.  I then went to the dump and through quite a
lot of trash away.  Mae called me to let me know that Scott is sick and won’t
be able to help me load the cab on back of my pickup.  I decided to load it
myself.  It took me a little time but I made it.  I got all the rest of our
things from the Clinton home except two file cabinets.  I took the green picnic
table of Bob’s to Grants home for him.  I was tired and hungry when I got home
so I ate a little and then hung the Christmas star that we bought while in the
Philippines.  Mae had made some soup for Scott’s family for their dinner this
evening, as most of them are sick tonight.  As it is getting dark I told Mae I
would take her over.  I carried the soup out to the car and Mae came behind. 
She asked if she should lock the door or not.  I told her that maybe she should
and just as she closed the door she realized that she didn’t have her keys.  I had
hung up my keys when I came home so we were locked out and with no car keys.  I
checked every window and door and they were all secure.  Mae called Vick’s
Locksmith and had them come out to open the door.  I found out that the shop
was Vick Townsend who we know when we lived in the Mound Fort Ward.  Vick died
in 1980 and Ruth died 1995.  We had good memories of Vick and Ruth.  Anyway
that cost us $40.00 and almost an hours time.  After taking the soup to Scott’s
family we stopped at the store for a few items before coming home.  we ate and
soon got ready for bed.</p>

woke at 2AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I was hurting quite a bit in my
joints, especially my hands and feet.  I looked for the acetaminophen but
couldn’t find it.  I tried laying in the recliner but that didn’t help so I
finally asked Mae and that woke her up.  Then neither of us could go back to
sleep.  I turned on a VT show and Mae started putting things away and preparing
more for the Grandma’s Christmas Party for the older Grandchildren.  About 6AM
we tried again and I slept for over an hour before getting up again.  Mae was
already up.  We both were on edge but both went to work.  I got the outside
lights hung but needed an extension cord and some other parts to finish the
jobs I have started today.  I did get more pictures hung and took down the
shower curtain but need some more items to complete that job.  I finally made a
trip to Lowe’s.  They also had the under cabinet garbage rack and can that I
wanted so I bought that as a Christmas present for both Mae and I.  I then went
over to Scott and Michelle’s and got Kylan and Ashley for the party.  Scott and
Mishelle are both down with the flu.  When I returned home Mae had a very nice
dinner ready.  We had Kylan, Ashley, Emily, Connor, Maddi and Jessie for this
party.   After eating we took all the children over to the Country Pines Assisted
Livings, where the children and Mae put on a program for the inmates there.  We
were there for about 35 minutes.  We then came back and played games.  I played
with them for a while and then I installed a light in our computer desk.  Mike
and Becky came about 9:45PM for their children and then we got the rest in the
car and took them home.  It was 20 after 11before we got home.  Mae got most of
the house straightened up before we took showers and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was almost 12:30AM before we got to bed, very tired.  I woke just at 6:45AM,
just before the alarm went of at 7AM.  I set up but couldn’t get up for several
minutes.  It was really hard for both of us to get going.  Because of it being
Fast Sunday we had time to get ready for Church and made it there by 8:50AM. 
We were very warmly welcomed to meetings and introduced to many.  Our records
were read in by Bishop Mullin, with a special introduction.  Many members of
the Ward introduced themselves to us throughout the block program.  We stopped
at the Clerk’s office to see if we could get help downloading our IPod and Note
Book with the Ward Directory.  We got the Not Book downloaded ok but had more
problems with my IPod.  After coming home I helped Mae get dinner started and
then both of us went into the recliners and took a nap.  We both took a pretty
good nap.  I went over and got Bob at 4PM and brought him home for dinner. 
Before Mae had everything ready, I tried to teach Bob how to use the computer
just to play games but he really didn’t try to learn it. Mae had prepared a
very lovely dinner with a rolled pork roast with all the trimmings.  Bob ate
most of it but was continually complaining about the food at Chancellor
Garden’s.  We turned on the First Presidency’s Christmas Devotional on BYUTV
and really enjoyed that.  Bob couldn’t hear that so he slept through most of
it.  We took him back by 8PM and Irven and Sandy were going to see him right
after that.  I hope that Bob can adjust and try to like life.  On the Way over
to return Bob, Mae called Sandi.  Sandi is quite depressed as she has worked
all weekend on making wreaths.  She has an order for 6 wreaths but has only
completed 5.  She is only charging $100 per wreath and it cost her over ½ that
just for the materials.  She is also upset over Nick for he is going to go to
court over the divorce.  She is also upset over the problems of JaNae and
Brad.  All in all she is quite depressed.  When I think of my family I sure get
depressed and wonder where I failed so badly as a Father.  It is now almost 9PM
and Mae is on the phone with Shirley.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night.  She got up and wrote a Christmas letter
that we will try to get out.  It has been very busy and we thought we might let
the Christmas letter and cards go this year, but it just doesn’t seem right, so
we will try.  Mae came back to bed just about the time that I got up so I let
her sleep longer.  I got myself something for breakfast and then went over to
Clinton and got the last of the items out.  I stopped at Winco’s and got some
water.  After getting things at the house I called Bryce and told him that I
would meet him at Wheelwright Lumber.  He wanted me to suggest what to do with
a camper he had bought.  Personal I think it is a waste of time.  When I got
home Mae went to ship Shellie’s family’s Christmas gifts and to have the Christmas
Letter printed.  From there she went up to Morgan to watch Tyler’s basket ball
game.  I worked on the shed getting the conduit ran for the electrical wires so
I have power in the shed.  Mae got home just before 6PM of which I was glad to
have her home before dark.  Mae prepared some dinner and then she wanted to
take some treats to the neighbor.  I went with her to visit the Jimmy and Garma
Cosper.  I brought our TV, VCR &amp; DVD players in and hooked them up in our
bedroom.  I then wrote this entry before watching a Christmas show with Mae.</p>

worked on the shed getting electric wire ran.  I had to have Mae’s help.  She
also drove into Ogden to get parts for me.  It was quite a job as I had to get
under the trailer.  While there I found one of the furnace vent pipes
connections that had came loose and was letting a lot of heat escape.  I hoped
that this might increase the heat to our bathroom but we don’t see much
difference there.  I had to quit and shower as we had the Ward Christmas dinner
this evening.  We enjoyed the evening and got a chance to meet quite a few more
members of the Ward.  Brother Dallas Day, the Ward Executive Secretary, stopped
us and asked us if we would meet with Bishop Mullins in his office Sunday, after
the block program.  When we got home I put the DVD on to play and we watched
Miracle on 34<sup>th</sup> Street.  I really enjoyed it but Mae got too sleepy
and fell asleep.</p>

chasing after materials.  This evening we went to Mike and Becky’s for dinner
and then to Jessie’s choral program.  Dinner was excellent as always.  Becky’s
parents were also with us.  After the program and we returned to Mike and
Becky’s home, while Mae was looking at pictures, Mike and I watched the last of
Mike’s High School’s basketball game.  Mike’s school won in overtime, so it was
a very good game.  After Mae and I got home we corrected the Christmas Card
list and printed off address stickers.  I we also made up new return Address
stickers for us and printed those off.  It was mid-night when Mae went to bed
and I was up for another ½ hour getting labels printed and entering this entry.</p>

Jeff stayed home with her.  I felt that I had too much to do so I stayed home
and worked on the shed.  After the Breakfast and a movie, Mae went to Emily’s
music recital.  Mae reported that Emily did a beautiful performance, playing
two violin solos.  From the recital Mae then attended Connor’s basket ball game. 
I quite working on the shed before 3PM and when Mae got home we went out to
Grantsville to a dance recital that JaNae’s girls are dancing in.  We were
surprised when we got to the High School at the crowd there.  We found out that
there was several dance groups that were participating this evening.  In fact
there was so many dance groups that there was one set that performed starting
at 5PM and then a second set that started at 7PM.  We watched both groups as
Chelci’s daughter performed in the second group.  It was almost 9PM when we got
home.  While we were at Grantsville a fellow text me, wanting information about
the moving boxes.  There were several texts back and forth and by the time we
got home we thought that the fellow was coming over to get what boxes we had
left.  We had stopped and got some take out for our dinner and while eating we
turned on the TV.  The show “Follow me Boy’s” we just about over so we watched
the ending of that.  the fellow hadn’t come so we tried to find the show on Net
Felix so we could watch all the movie but Net Flex didn’t carry that movie.  We
tried to watch another but both Mae and I fell asleep.  Finally we turned the
TV off and took our showers.  The fellow never came.  We found out that the
shower in the 2<sup>nd</sup> bathroom has major problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up at 4am very concerned with the plumbing in the house.  I don’t think
there is anything that I can’t repair but there will be some expense that we
hadn’t planned on and really don’t have.  I am afraid that I really goofed on
our inspection of the home prior to purchasing it.  I had asked Mae to check
out the inside while I checked out the roofing and outside.  We are finding
that there were several problems that we didn’t recognize during that
inspection.  I know that we would need a water softener, but it looks like we
will need a new water heater and some repairs to the plumbing.  There is also
some duct work that may need repairs.  Not being able to sleep I did some on my
journal.  Mae woke at 6AM and we started getting ready.  I prepared breakfast
for us.  Meetings were very enjoyable and we are meeting more every meeting. 
Mae and I were asked to give the prayers in Sunday School.  After the Block we
were asked to stay for a few minutes to visit with Bishop Mullin.  After a
short visit , I was asked if I would oversee the scheduling of our Wards Temple
activity.  I have thought about this assignment quite a bit today and am still
not quite sure just how to do that assignment.  I guess I will learn but I feel
a great need for guidance from the Lord.  Mae was called to serve as 1<sup>st</sup>
Counselor to Sister Evelyn Andrus.  We will serve where we are called.  After
returning home and having some lunch we both took a nap.  Before I fell asleep
Mae started reading a booklet given to us by Marcy, “Room in the Inn” by Neil
L. Andersen.  Before she finished reading I went out.  Mae let me sleep for
almost 1 ½ hours.  We then both worked on getting Thank You cards and Christmas
cards ready to mail.  It was shortly after 6PM that we ate dinner.  After
eating I reread the booklet by Neal L. Andersen and really enjoyed it.  Mae was
busy on the computer so I watched the show “Toro Toro Toro”.  That is a show
that shows so many mistakes that was made by Government and Military personal
in their responsibilities.  It was going on to 11PM by the time we went to bed.</p>

rented me a hammer drill so I could drill holes in the concrete pad, under the
shed to tie the shed down.  That should secure it from wind movement.  I
finished and came in for dinner.  After dinner we watched a cut show on Netflix
before going to bed.  I am really quite sore through the joints especially

have Mae come out and help me a couple of times to brace up the sheeting on the
ceiling.  Mae had dinner ready when I came in.  After cleaning up from dinner
we went down to get the mail.  I was tired so I watched a commentary on the
battle of Mid-Way.  There were sure a lot of young men, on both sides that lost
their lives on that day.  I then watched a Western show of Kit Carson.  Mae has

Priesthood meeting.  We then played a game of Rummy of which Mae won.  I think
she beats me at that game almost 75% of the time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both woke quite early this morning.  We took our showers and got ready to
attend the Temple.  While Mae was getting ready I made egg omelets for
breakfast.  It was after 9AM when we left for the Temple.  We stopped and got
our mail first and then went into Ogden.  I thought the Utah Drivers License
Department was on Grant Avenue but when we didn’t find it we went to the
Temple.  We attended an Endowment session and after finishing the session, we
went to the Sealing Office so that I could find out a little more about the
assignment that Bishop Mullin gave me.  We were invited to help with Sealing’s
right then, so we stayed.  Following that session we went to the cafeteria and
had lunch.  We then found the Utah Drivers License Department on Lincoln Avenue
and stopped there.  We were quite a while and were told that we needed the
Wolfley’s to give us a signed Title on the house or get a duplicate Title.  We
then can get return to get a Title for us.  From there we went up to Harvest
Moon for some supplies, to Wal Mart for a few items of groceries and then to
visit Bob.  Bob and Stacy were just getting back for a busy day of Dr.
Appointments for Bob.  Mae gave Bob a hair cut while we were there.  From there
we went to deliver some cans of nuts to Cole and Eric, for Bob’s Christmas gift
to them.  On the way home we stopped and got gas in the car.  It was 8PM when
we got home.  Mae quickly got us some dinner.  After eating I called Loreen
Wolfsley and she will stop over Saturday and sign for the Duplicate Title.  I
watched a show on Netflix while Mae was busy with the house.</p>

got up at 6:30AM and had breakfast.  Mae went up to Jeff’s where she went with
Gail, the kids and Marcie to Heber where they rode the Heber Creeper.  They
then met Jeff in Bountiful as he had been out of town on a business trip.  They
then got something to eat before coming home.  I worked on the shed all day. 
After dinner this evening I started laying out our family pictures.  I had
hoped to use Command hangers but they won’t work as there is a finishing strip
through the center of the area.  Mae turned on the TV and watched the true
story of the composing and writing of “Silent Night”.  I finished repairing the
kitchen cabinet door that had been broken before we move here.  The trim on the
cabinet doors are edged with a plastic trim.  I used wood filler to build up
the broken corner and then sanded it into matching shape.  When I finished it
can hardly be noticed.  I watched the remainder of the show with Mae.  I would
like to see all the show so we tried to find it on Netflix but had no luck.  We
watched another Christmas show before going to bed.</p>

got up and had some breakfast and then went to the chapel where we joined with
others to clean the building before Sunday.  We had quite a few out to get it
done.  After returning home I got the family pictures hung.   I was going to
start on the shed, but Jim Fraizier called and talked for some time.  After lunch
Mae and I took a nap.  I then worked on hanging the door on the shed.  It was
quite a job, plus the door opening is no longer square so it took some time
working on it.  Also the door weight quite a bit so I had Mae come out and help
me hang it.  I couldn’t lift the door and hold it in place while Mae put the
hinge pins in place, so I got the automobile jack to raise it.  That worked
quite well.  By 4:30PM I had the door hung and ready to trim.  By that time I
was also cold and tired so I called it enough and quite.  Mae had got the mail
but in our box was a key that had a tag on it labeled ELP.  I took the key to
our Mail Box Hut and found that the E was for our row and the LP was for large
package.  In each row of boxes there are two large boxes for packages that are
too big to fit in the regular boxes.  In there was a package from Cheryl and of
course we know it was a Campbell Kids 2015 Calendar.  I think Cheryl has given
us one for the past several years.  It is sweet of her to remember us.  We also
got several Christmas Cards from friends and family.  I spent a couple of hours
or more designing Form to be filled out during Priesthood and Relief Society
meetings to arrange for Ward members to attend Sealing Sessions at the Ogden
Temple.  Mae and I spent a few minutes going over our budget and what we have
spent in making this move.  It has cost us some but we hope that we are ok!  </p>

attended church services and especially enjoyed our Sacrament meeting.  The
program was put on by our Ward Choir and they did a very excellent Christmas
performance.  Barbara Dainard was the director and had invited a soloist, a
narrator and four performers on the bells.  It was a very special program.  The
lessons in Priesthood and Sunday School we also very good.  We are enjoying
this Ward but I am having a hard time remembering names.  After lunch both Mae
and I took naps.  I got on the internet and ordered a door sweep and a
threshold from Home Depot.  It sure takes time when I get on the computer,
especially when I get watching pictures on the screen savor.  I am not sure
what I did to our TV but now it will not change channels on regular TV.  We
went over to Sister Dainard’s and she loaned Mae 3 Christmas books.  Mae is
thinking of reading a story tomorrow evening at our family Christmas party.  It
was 11PM when we got to bed.</p>

woke up with a bad headache so I laid on the Chee machine.  That helped some. 
I took a shower and washed the inside of the shower with Rain-X to see if it
will help with water spots.  We had a young fellow call to see if we still had
moving boxes for sale.  I told him we just had the 4 clothing boxes and he came
and got those.  I let him have all 4 for $5.00.  I got the external hard drive
out so that I can start backing up our computer files.  I printed the last five
months of my journal off and put a hard copy into a binder.  I also helped Mae
make Christmas Crunch and fruit salad for the family Christmas party this
evening.  The crunch turned out perfect as well as the salad.  Most of our
family came this afternoon and evening for our Family Christmas party.  David
and Sieria both had to work tonight so they didn’t make it and JaNae’s family
didn’t come, but all the rest except for Shellie’s family were there.  Scott
had arranged to hold the party at the Layton Holiday Inn.  It worked out very
well.  We all brought pot luck with Scott ordering pizza.  We had a wonderful
meal.  Mae arranged for a program, with Kylan playing three numbers on the
piano, Chelci playing the guitar and singing, Chelci singing with Sandi
accompanying on the piano, Emily playing three numbers on the violin, Garret
and Page sang with Garret playing the guitar, Nathan played two numbers on the
piano and Mae read a Christmas story.  Mae then led everyone in some Christmas
carols and then Santa brought some gifts to the children.  Mae was talking with
little Addie Mae and telling her that their coats were the same.  Addie was
surprised and acted excited.  She then showed Mae a button which was in the
inside of her coat and told Mae that it was a secret button.  Mae looked in the
inside of her coat and she had a secret button there too and she showed Addie. 
Addie said: “Holy Cow, I didn’t see that coming.”  Mae had to chuckle as that
was a surprise coming from a little three year old.  After we got home from the
party, I texted Sandi about getting together here at our home for dinner on
Sunday, for Mae’s birthday.  She thought it was a good idea, so I texted the
boys to see if they could come.</p>

dinner the children went down and watched a show on TV while Gail, Jeff, Mae

goodies for the Missionaries to take out this evening.  Mae and Jeff prepared
hot cakes for breakfast.  After eating we cleaned up and came home.  We got
gifts and packing ready to go to David and Shauna’s where we will spend
Christmas Eve and stay overnight with them.  Shauna and David had a nice dinner
ready for us this afternoon.  After cleaning up from the meal Mae and I were
invited to go with David and his family to delivery two Money trees that they
had prepared for two needy families.   On the way back to David and Shauna’s
home, Mike called and he had cut his finger quite badly.  David told Mike that
if he wanted to drive up he would stitch his finger up.  We guess that Mike
decided that he would handle the problem some other way, as he didn’t come up. 
David turned the TV on for a little while after we got home.  Then at 9PM he
turned the TV back off and his children went to bed.   After the children went

we cleaned up, Mae and I left for Jeff’s.  I think it was 11:30AM when Mae and
I got to Jeff’s.  We exchanged gifts and had an enjoyable time at Jeff and
Gail’s.  We next went to Scott and Mishelle’s and spent the remainder of the
day.  They were going to attend a family party at the Dillingham’s at 5 so we
were about ready to leave when Mishelle came down with one of her migraine
headaches and so Scott had her go right to bed.  We came home and started to
bed but it still took us some time.  We watched the movie “Christmas Shoe’s”
before going to sleep.  It has been a good Christmas Day.  We did hear from
Sandi, Shellie and Mike during the day.</p>

Grant called and they feel that Bob should no longer pay for the Life Insurance
since I am the beneficiary.  Bishop Mullin came over and asked if I would
except another assignment of helping with a family home evening program they
are doing here in our Ward.  He also likes the program I am working on to get
more attendance at the Temple.  When the sun set it turned of bitter cold so I
quit and came in side.  I started installing another light in the computer
desk.  I am going to install a switch on the doors so that when they are open
it turns the lights on.  After dinner I helped Mae clean up.  I called and Kim
and he will get me the paper work to have the policy changed to me being the
owner.  We can then decide what to do with the policy.  While I was talking to
Kim I invited them to come here for New Years Eve.  They said that they would. 
I also called Brice and invited them to do the same.  I think that will work
out.  I entered this entry and then we are going to watch “Christmas Blessing”
on DVD before going to bed.</p>

Mishelle and Jeff and Gail when they brought the children and also when they
came to get them.  Kylan came over and help Mae with the party.  After it was

got some things from the spare bedroom and from the back porch put in the
shed.  Things are looking better each day.  This evening I took Mae out to

nice dinner and enjoyed visiting.  Sandi plus Mike and Becky left shortly after
7PM as they have quite a ways to travel.  The rest stayed and we played a game
before the rest went home.  Mae got quite a few Birthday calls from friends and

dishes from the dish washer.  I installed more shelving in the shed.  It was
very cold today and so I took the electric heater out into the shed with me. 
That sure helped to take away the cold.  Brother David Presnell, the 1<sup>st</sup>
Counselor in the Bishopric, stopped by to give us the subjects for our talks in
Sacrament meeting on January 11<sup>th</sup>.  This evening Mae and I went to
the auto part store where I bought some oil for the 2 stroke engine on the snow
blower; we then stopped and bought some gas for the snow blower.  From there we
went to The Home Depot and bought another set of shelving for the shed.  We

near what it had been predicted.  I shoveled the walks and driveways as I
couldn’t get the snow blower to start.  I put the new section of shelving
together and then had Mae come out and help me arrange some of our things in
the shed.  Although it was cold we did get most of the items off the west
deck.  That will be good when we have everything put away.  Before I finished
working outside I did get the lock on the shed door and also got the show
blower running.  I believe that I will be able to take my tool trailer down to
the Storage lot and bring the trailer up so that we can get it unloaded and
returned to the Graf’s tomorrow.  This evening, after dinner we went to Good
Earth and to Home depot for a few items.  After getting home we read from the
book “The Power of Everyday Missionary” before we went to bed.  Bishop Mullin
suggested that we read that boo, so we checked it out from the Ward Library and
will try to get it read right away.  From what we read tonight it should be

Bryce and Deanna came shortly after.  Mae had prepared a nice Lasagne for
dinner along with Garlic Toast.  With the additions that Jeanenne and Deanna
brought we had a wonderful dinner.  After eating we visited for a while.  We
played a game of Mormon Bridge which Kim won.  We then played Farkal which Mae
