well and after I went to Durk’s and purchased a sprinkler head.  After getting
home I had something to eat and then took a nap.  Mae went over to the Doctors
for a check-up on her arm and it is healing well.  I worked on the sprinklers
until time to get ready for lunch and my PM runs.  </p>

and after getting home I worked on the sprinklers.  I thought I had the timer
set but there is an 8 hour time area that we can’t water from 10AM to 6PM. 
Anyway, I thought I had it set.  We then drove out to Sandi’s where Nike and I
worked on their sprinkler system.  It was about 8PM when we got it working. 
Sandi, Mae, Nike and I played a game of Marbles before we all went to bed.  Mae
and Sandi won tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Sandi
and Nick had to leave early for their photo shot.  This is a big hassle for
them but they get a large tax write off because of it.  JaNae has helped them
in the past but they are not getting along with each other so I don’t think
that will continue.  We slept in before getting up and showering and having
some breakfast, then we left.  I took Mae to Adam’s Elementary where she
attended B<b>e</b>n’<b>s </b>soccer game.<b>  </b>From there she went with Jeff
and Gail to<b> </b>Whiteside’s Elementary for Rachael’s soccer game.  While she
was supporting Grandchildren I filled the car with gas and then vacuumed and
washed the car.  I hadn’t been home long when Mae called me to come to get
her.  I quickly packed us some food and left.  After getting Mae we went to
Lagoon to support JaNae and Kennedy in clogging contest.  We had to park a long
ways from the gate, do to the crowd attending Lagoon.  It cost us $6 for us to
park and we had a discount.  Most cars cost $10 to park.  We had guest passes
to get into the park but they cost us $12 each just to see the dancing.  We
then had trouble finding where JaNae’s group were dancing.  I was afraid for a
while that we had paid all that out and then was not going to be able to find
them.  I finally stayed at one pavilion, while Mae when out looking.  I set
there becoming frustrated but Mae finally stopped and privately said a prayer
asking for the Lords help.  She told me that she no sooner had asked for help
when she turned around a corner and instantly saw Kennedy.  She rushed over to
her and gave her a hug and hugged JaNae.  She then called me and help me find
them.  We got there just before JaNae’s group went on stage to perform.  They
did very well.  JaNae is teaching clogging with Cody.  Cody and JaNae danced in
the group that Sandi taught 20 years ago.  We had attended that dance contest
then also.  Cody and JaNae also had an older group that performed a little
later.  After those two groups finished, Mae and I found a bench in the shade
and ate our lunch.   When we finished Mae called JaNae.  We wanted to say
goodbye and give them a hug.  We found them and just at that time they received
the Judging results.  Their groups each took first place.  That was quite
exciting.  From Lagoon we hurried home where I again tried to get out watering
program working.  I ran out of time and soon Bryce and Deanna came to get us. 
We went up to a Porter Cousins party, where we ate and then discussed some of
the problems that are coming with the Byron and Mary Porter Family Reunion.  We
came up with some alterations to the reunion and will see if this helps.  It
was an enjoyable evening.  I really enjoyed visiting with Neal Wall, Verla’s
husband.  After commig home, we invited Bryce and Deanna in for a little while
and we played a game of Trance America.  Bryce was the winner of that game. 
After they left we soon went to bed.</p>

was sure tired but got up and attended our High Priest Leadership meeting.  I
gave the lesson in our High Priest Group meeting.  That went fairly well.  I
had a lot of trouble hearing the lesson in Sunday school class.  Also in our
Fast Meeting there was several that I had problems hearing.  By the time the
block ended I had a bad headache.  Bob had dinner ready for us when we got
home.  I then took a nap of over an hour.  This evening I visited with Sister
Fallis and her son Mark.  Mark had not done a complete engine check before
taking his boat out for a trial run and due to that burned up the engine.  He
was really discouraged over that.  We looked at a water problem that seems to
becoming from Womg Yang’s secondary water line.  They may also take charge of
our chickens to see if they are really interested in rising chickens them
self.  I finished up my Home Teaching report for April.  That month really
seemed to have gone by fast.  Bishop Hatch asked Mae if she will give a talk
next week on Mothers.  She has worked most of the afternoon and evening on that
talk and her Sunday school lesson for next week.  </p>

I got up this morning I read from John 3 and I was especially touched when I
read the 16 verse “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life.”  17 verse “For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world:
but that the world through him might be saved.”  I believe the Hymn was written
by Janet Cash Perry.  Any way I then thought of the many Hymns that has helped
strengthened my Testimony.  I really out to list them down and request that
they be added to my Funeral Program.   Mae got me off to work.  My runs went
well.  I went to Dr. Tunne’s and got an adjustment.  He worked on both my lower
back and my upper neck.  On the way home I stopped at J&amp;J Nursery and
bought 4 Early Girl tomato plants, 4 Big Boy tomato plants, 2 Cherry tomato
plants and 2 cucumber plants.  I also bought a weedier.  Mae soon had lunch
ready and after eating we took a nap.  I got on the inter-net and 1<sup>st</sup>
checked the driving distances from Clearfield to Wasco California by way of Las
Vegas or by Reno.  It comes out about 2 ½ miles.  We there for decided to go by
Las Vegas.  I looked at staying the night in Mesquite but the rooms were quite
expensive for weekend travel.  Mae then reminded me that it was time for me to
take my PM runs.  While I was gone Mae found us a room in St. George much more
reasonable, so we will do that.  My runs went well and after getting back to
the compound I checked to see it I had approval to take of the last day of
school. It was approved.  After getting home we ate dinner.  We tried to find
something on TV to watch but there wasn’t anything.  We watched the DVD we got
at the State Convention that explains the Common Core Program.  If that
information is correct then that is a terrible program.  Now the question is,
Who Is Telling the Truth???  I went to bed really feeling bad but after I got
to sleep I seem to sleep ok.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
back hurt me quite a lot this morning but after taking some Acetaminophen I was
ok and my run went fairly well.  I didn’t take my normal walk on my lay over
between schools.  When I got home and had some breakfast I went to work on the
lawns.  With Mae’s and Bob’s help we got the lawns mowed and the garden
weeded.  When I came in I took a short nap.  My PM runs went well.  After
getting home we had dinner and I gathered the eggs.  Mae received a e-mail that
told of using Hydrogen Peroxide for pest control in the garden.  You are to use
a 8% mixture.  Mae bought a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide from a hair solon and
it contains a 40% mixture.  I was trying to figure what parts water to the
already diluted mixture I should use.  Giving up I called Jeff.  He was just
leaving Cost Co, so I told him my problem and without even writing the problem
down, he came right back with the answer.  I was amassed that he could figure
the answer in his head so fast.  He has always been able to figure math
problems in his head and give the answer right back.  Mae had a Relief Society
meeting to attend so I started working on my Diary.  I got to October 12, 1972
when I realized that I had left a lot of detail out of the diary, which I felt
should be add.  I spent the rest of the evening working on that.  Mae edited
what I had written and I read her talk that she is preparing for Sunday.  My
information needed some corrections and addition but Mae’s talk really sounds
very good.  It’s bed time so I will quite for now.</p>

waking her but when I turned on even the little light on the stove it woke
her.  I had her go back into our bed but she didn’t sleep longer and soon was
up.  My AM runs went well.  When I got home Mae was on the phone with someone
claiming to be PC Support, authorized by Microsoft to correct problems on our
computers.  While she was on the phone with her, I got on my computer and found
the phone number for PC Support.  I called and asked the representative there
if they had authorized any company to correct problems on our computer and he
told me defiantly not and don’t let them onto our computers.  I then went to
Dr. Toone in Bountiful.  I was a few minutes late and I explained to Dr.
Toone’s wife why I was late and as soon as I told her that someone was trying to
get into our computer, she described then as having an Indian Accent and they
were represent Micro Soft.  They were defiantly a scan that is going on.  We
were very glad that we had been wise enough not to fall for it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning when I first got up and was reading my scriptures, as I read John 5, I
had the strongest spiritual feeling of the truthfulness of the scriptures and
the knowledge that the Gospel of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is true and
the only True Church on the earth today.  What a special feeling it was and how
thankful I am for the Spirit of the Holy Ghost to guide us.  Late, while on my
bus runs, when I had some idling time and I was reading from President
Kimball’s book, Faith Proceeds the Miracle, I again I had such Spiritual confirmation. 
Oh how I wish my children could find such a strengthening feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                 The
day went well.  I did call South Valley Farms and talked to Merrill Dibble’s
secretary Carman.  She told us that they were having a lunching in honor of Lee
and Kim.  Then the next day, they will have the company annual Summer party,
also honoring Lee and Kim.  My PM run went well except for the one Jr. High boy
that I had to ask him not to practice his whistling on the bus.  Then I had
some problems on the Grade school rum but nothing serious.  Mae was getting
dinner ready when I got home.  She is trying to have plenty of food ready for
me while she is gone.  I am not sure what I will do without her.  We decided to
watch a show on TV while we ate our dinner.  We turned it to the Hallmark
channel and one of the old Walton’s series was on.  The problem is the ¾ of the
time was advertisements, so it was really a waste of time.  I tried to work on
my Diary entrances so that I felt like the time was not a complete waste of
time.  I had planned on going visiting with Morgan and Charles this evening,
but Morgan has been sick and Charles was not at home.  I guess we will try
again tomorrow evening.</p>

runs went well although we got a lot of rain this morning.  When I got home I
was going to go to Sister Shirley Olson’s and till her flower garden but Scott
still has my tiller.  We had Scott for lunch so while he was here I asked if he
was through.  We sure enjoy having Scott come for lunch when he can.  Scott
still will have some tilling to do but right now he is waiting for the ground
to dry out.  He will return the tiller after work this afternoon.  After
returning for my PM runs Scott and his family returned with my tiller.  He also
had a barrel that he is going to bury for a drain to handle some of the runoff
from the roof.  I got the drill ready and showed Scott how to drill the barrel
so the water will seep out of it.  While he was doing that Kylan helped me take
the tiller to Sister Olsen’s.  I just got started and the starter rope tangeled
so I had to get tools and repair that.  When Scott finished he and his family
left for home.  Mae came down to see how I was doing.  I needed my glasses so
she went back to get them.  In a few minutes Scott came with my glasses.  He
said that after they left and got part way home they had forgotten their phone
so had to return.  I finished repairing the tiller and quickly tilled the
area.  Scott helped me bring the tools and tiller back home.  Mishelle wasn’t
feeling well so Mae prepared some dinner for Scott and the children.  Mishelle
went into the bedroom and took a nap.  </p>

Mae took me to work this afternoon and met me when I finished.  We left
straight for Mike’s getting there about 4:30PM.  That gave us a few minutes for
us to visit with Mike about the Common Core.  Mike gave us quite a different
look at the program than we have received up to this point.  Becky prepared a
wonderful dinner.  Becky’s parents also came for dinner.  After dinner we all
went to the Junior High where Jessie and Mattie performed with the chorus in a
beautiful performance.  I had trouble hearing the words as the choirs sang. 
Mae read from “The Infinite Atonement” by Tad R. Callister.  He made a point
that I have never thought about and it gave me some problems in comprehending
it.  I really couldn’t grasp the meaning and I couldn’t explain to Mae what my
problem was.  I am going to have to reread that portion and give it more
thought.  I felt bad as I upset Mae.  Mike also gave us a lot to consider. 
Between the two of them, and then with my hearing, my mind is in a spine.  We
were tired when we got home.</p>

special.  I was going to cook us an egg omelet for breakfast but only had 3
eggs.  I went out to gather the eggs as we hadn’t gathered them yesterday. I
found that the chickens had been locked out of the coop and from what I could
tell it may have been since Thursday evening.  I hadn’t gathered eggs yesterday
and Mae hadn’t checked the coop when she fed the chickens.  My guess is that
the girls had shut the run door Thursday evening and hadn’t locked it the open
position when they finished playing with the chickens.  All together the
morning didn’t go to good so we decided we needed to attend the Temple.  I
enjoyed the session but I had trouble with my hearing and the fellow that set
next to me needed two seats just for him, so it was tight.  We came home long
enough to change and get on the computer for a few minutes.  We then went into
Riverdale to the Chuck-A-Rama where David, Shauna, Emily and Connor met us for
dinner.  This was their Mother’s Day gift.  We had a very enjoyable evening. 
When I got home I did go out and gather the eggs and to my surprise there were
9 eggs.  We went to bed about 9:30PM.</p>

breakfast but Mae felt like she needed to Fast prior to her Sunday School
lesson and especially for her talk.  I didn’t have an early meeting due to it
being Mothers Day.  It was nice to go with Mae.  Both Mae’s Sunday school class
and her talk went very well.  Bob prepared a nice dinner for us following
Church.  Shellie called and visited with Mae.  I finally laid down for a nap
and when I woke, Mae had also laid down and sleep for a while.  Scott and his
family came over for a little while to wish Mae a happy Mother’s Day.  After
they left we had some dinner and while eating we watched a movie “Brigham
Young” produced by Hollywood, so it wasn’t quite to fact but was good.  I did
some work on my Diary entrance, made some corrections to my letter for Kim and Lee

worked in the garden until time to eat and go on my PM runs.  This year I will
have the majority of the garden covered with plastic sheeting which should hold
the weeds down.  I will also have the complete garden under a drip system which
should make the watering much easier as well as more efficient with water.   I
called and visited with Sandy for a few minutes to see how she is feeling as
last night she wasn’t feeling very well.  She is doing some better but the Dr.
doesn’t know what the pain is from yet.  Mike called me just as I got to the
bus.  He is coming to Clearfield High School to watch his Girl’s Softball team
play.  He invited me to join him and then after the game go out to eat with
him.  After my run I met him at Clearfield High.  Clearfield won 12 to 2 but
his girls played well but Clearfield was much better.  We went to Sizzler and
had a very nice dinner.  After eating we set and visited for some time.  All my
children have been talking and they are quite in favor of us finishing Sandi’s
basement and living there.  They would like to have that our main home but come
around to the other and stay at each home for a while.  We also visited about
problems that some of the family are having with the Gospel.  He is much more
understanding, since his son has left the church now and he doesn’t know how to
help them.  After we parted he still had to ride home, so he will be late.  It
was late when I got home so I first gathered the eggs.  I then prepared and
released the Lady Bugs.  It will be interesting to see the results.  I also
looked at Bob curtains and found the problem with the pull cord was that the
cord was twisted.   It is now 9:45PM so I had better get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                The
water on the yard was on this morning.  My AM runs went well.  Shortly after I
got home I was called from the shop and told they want me to attend a Accident
Review meeting next Wednesday.  Bob had me call Robert for him to see if they
are still using the pickup, they are.  The water timer still has problems so I
took it into Chris at Durk’s and he found the problem.  Hopefully it will work
right now.  With my PM runs in-between I got the garden planted today.  Bob
took me out for dinner.  I am sure tired this evening and am going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
AM runs went well but I feel very discouraged about life.  When I got home I
fixed something to eat and then Bob and I mowed the lawns.  It was noon before
we finished and I am tired.  Bob offered to prepare some lunch so I accepted.  I
got a short nap before taking my PM runs.  Scott was at our place when I got
home.  He brought my large bar back and also needed to get some camping
equipment out of their camper.  We visited for a little while about the Common
Core program but I have no real advice about it.  At the State Convention I was
convinced that it was an evil program but after talking to Mike about it I am
not sure.  Bob and I had lunch warmed up chicken again this evening as we
watched the show “Pearl Harbor”.  Even though it was a show, it still brings up
anger at what Japan did to us.  The biggest problem is what is happening today
with what we have in Washington now.  I fear for what I think is coming and the
traders’ in our government that is bringing it on.  I fear that the biggest
problem is still with the people leaving “God” for worldly desires.  It late
and I am going to bed.  I tried to call Mae before I went to bed but she didn’t
answer.  Whether she is away from her phone or the call didn’t go through, I do
not know.  I sure miss her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early with the hose from my C-Pap not connected.  As I went to bed last
night I hadn’t turned the light off put I had hooked my mask up.  I there for
just disconnected the hose and must not have got it reconnected fully.  I woke
early so had time to start this entry before leaving for work.  My AM runs went
well but I again noticed that my bus was very sluggish on the take off, so I
called and talked to Curt about it.  He suggested that I bring the bus into the
shop when I finish my runs and they would change the fuel filter.  I did that
and when I got home I made three pints of Almond Butter.  When I went back for
the PM runs my bus was still in the shop.  They found other problems so I had
to get a sub-bus for this afternoon.  The first bus I went to take was almost
out of fuil so I switched again because I was already late leaving.  My runs
went well.  I was tired so I didn’t do much this evening.  I watched a show
with Bob that he had recorded.  It was a very good show but Mae wouldn’t have
liked it because of the suspense.  I then watch another show after I came
downstairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early and got my breakfast.  I cleaned up the trash under the back
stairway.  That has needed to be done for some time.  I then went over to where
the men of the Ward gathered to help with the Ward cleanup.  There wasn’t a lot
to be done.  Brother Niederhouser, Brother McPhie and I picked up an old chair
from Brother Tripp’s and a old matters from Sister Karboski’s.  I then helped
remove two trees and a bush from Checketts by digging around them and then
pulling them out with my chain and pickup.  I then came home and butchered the
two roosters.  When I finished that I was tired so I lay down and took a long
nap.  I went up to Jeff’s about 4PM.  Jeff and Ben had gone Mountain Climbing
so I visited with Gail, Rachael and Mat for a few minutes.  When Jeff and Ben
came we put the rooster on the grill to cook.  It was a nice time visiting with
Jeff’s family and the rooster cooked very well for our dinner.  I came home
before 8PM and watched the show “Dances with Wolf’s”.  Although I have seen it
more than once, I still enjoyed it and thought about the purpose of life and
wondered what our decisions were in the Pre-existent.  The thoughts of not only
did Christ’s Atonement go forward into the next life but also going backward
into the Pre-existent has been something that I had never thought of.  It is
beginning to sink in more all the time.</p>

woke early and felt quite well, even my hearing seemed much better, but by the
time I got to Church everything became fuzzy again.  I Have also been quite
dizzy most of the day.   Meeting went well.  Bob prepared a nice dinner for the
two of us.  I took a nap.   Our home teachers came and we had a nice visit. 
Mae called and it was most welcome.  I sure miss that Beautiful Girl, Dream of
my dreams.  I talked to Bryce and we got talking for quite a while.  I went up
stairs and watched a movie with Bob that was pretty good.</p>

bus was still in the shop so I again took a sub bus.  My runs went well and
when I got back to the compound I checked and my bus is going to be laid up for
a few days.  After getting home I weeded part of the garden, then came in and
took a nap.  Mae called and we visited for a while.  I had tried to call her
but it just went onto the recording.  She told me that her phone has quite
working.  I finished my laundry and got it put away.  My PM runs went well. 
When I got back to the compound I scheduled the bus for a service appointment. 
As I got home Bob was waiting for me.  He wanted me to ride down to check on
Cole and Erik as they haven’t answered his phone calls.  They were just fine,
Bob gust gets to worried over them.  It seems to me they don’t worry about him
at all.  This evening I went up stairs to heat my dinner and ended up watching
a recorded show with Bob.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early but needed the time as I got reading more in John and meditating. 
There is so much that we really don’t know and won’t while in this life.  I
just have to keep trying and hope that somehow it will work out. I don’t know
how anyone can go through this earth experience if they have little or no
hope.  My morning runs went ok.  After finishing I stopped on the way home and
bought tome Tinactin, some spray olive oil, some salt for the water softener
and some flowers to put on the graves this Saturday.  I got a little to eat and
then mowed the lawns.  I wanted the clippings to put on the garden so I did all
the lawns with the small hand mower.  Bob prepared chicken and dumplings for
lunch.  I stopped long enough to eat and then finished up.  I still had time to
take a 15 minute nap before taking my PM runs.  When I got home this afternoon
I called and talked to Mae for a few minutes before gathering the eggs.  Bob
heated up the chicken and dumplings again for me.  We watched a show that he
had recorded.  We visited for a few minutes as to what does the future hold and
really didn’t come to any conclusion.  I think of Dad’s comment “the older I
get and the more I know, the more I know that I don’t know!”,  How True that
is!  It almost time for bed so I will close this entry for now.</p>

woke at 4:15 this morning but that was ok as I didn’t have to hurry.  My AM
runs went well and when I got back to the compound I took my bus into be
serviced.  I then went into to dispatch and got my Field Trip for Friday
printed off.  Next I went into the Accident Review Committee and explained what
had happened when the jeep came into my lane and I swerved right to miss a head
on collision and in so doing I broke a Right rear view mirror.  It was 10AM
when I got home.  I drank a green drink and had some toast and almond butter. 
I visited with Bob for a few minutes then came down stairs and took a nap.  I
slept right through the alarm, sleeping for an hour.  I worked on my journals
for a while.  My PM runs went well.  After getting home I got my boat pulled
out and uncovered it.  It is really dirty, part from the last time I used it
last fall but also because a lot of dust blow under the covering into the
boat.  I finally got tired and gave up for the night.  </p>

about the same time I went to work.  In between my AM and PM runs I worked on
the boat changing the oil and filter.  I was surprised but the battery seems to
be in pretty good shape.  The motor runs very well but I still need to wash the
boat down.  I am tired plus I needed to call my children and make plans for
Saturday to go to the Morgan Cemetery to decorate graves and then meet back at
the Morgan Park to eat and visit.  Most of our family will be there.  Making
plans for our family is something new for me.  Mae always does this job.  It’s
now past bed time so good night.  </p>

woke about 2:15AM and had some trouble going back to sleep.  When I did I
almost over slept the alarm.  It was a busy day on my bus today, taking my two
AM routs and then going to East Layton Elementary where they needed two buses
to take three First Grade classes around to the Layton City Library, the Museum
and to the Fire Department.  They then went to a park where they had lunch
before we took them back to the school.  I then started my PM runs, finishing
at 4:15PM.  I then filled out my reports before going home.  I washed my boat
and dried it before covering it back up and putting it away.  As I was finishing
it started raining.  Bob had some chicken for me to warm and eat for dinner.  I
then quit and watched two shows that Bob had recorded.  It is now 10:30PM and I
am going to go to bed.</p>

cramps.  That brought me up.  I lay on the Chee machine for a while and then
came back to bed.  I slept until 8:30AM.  Bob asked me to help him put flowers
on Cherrie, Carroll and their baby’s graves.  Roy called just to see what out
plans are for California.  I talked to Bryce as he called to see what I thought
about the weather.  I did make up some more capsules that we are getting low
on.  I went Harmon’s and to C &amp; B Maddox’s where I bought fried chicken to
take up to Morgan this afternoon.  Sandi came a little after 2PM and we soon
left for the Morgan Cemetery.  Bryce, Deanna and their three son’s plus
families, Kim’s youngest daughter, her husband and daughter, Jeff and his
family, David and his family also met us at the cemetery.  We decorated family
graves and took traditional family pictures and then we all went to the Morgan
Park where we had lunch, visited and played games.  We all missed Mae but it
turned out pretty good anyway.  I sure enjoyed the time Sandi and I had riding
together and visiting.  It is getting late so I think I will soon got to bed.</p>

the alarm didn’t go off.  I was ok and still made it to my early meeting.  I
also forgot last Tuesday evening that I was to go visiting with the Bishopric. 
The rest of the meetings went well.  My hearing is sure muffled today.  During
Sacrament meeting I set by Brother Dee Francom.  When they announced that the
Ogden Temple is getting close to completion I whispered to Dee and asked if he
would like to go for a ride and we would go to Ogden and see how the Temple is
doing.  He said he would like that.  I sure enjoyed Sacrament meeting this
morning.  After the Sacrament, Sister Annie Thurman was the Youth Speaker and
she gave a very good talk.  Falling Annie the Primary Presidency spoke and each
gave very good talks.  I was especially impressed at the love Sister Jennifer
Cummings has for the children.  After getting home Bob had dinner ready.  He
had cooked liver and onions and they were sure good.  It is a good time to have
that Menu, as Mae isn’t here, she won’t consider eating Liver and Onions, but
Bob and I sure like them.  I took Bob and Dee and we sure enjoyed driving to
Ogden and especially going around the Temple Block.  It is sure a beautiful
Temple and the Tabernacle has also been completely redone to be very attractive
but not to take away from the Temple.  After getting home Bob wanted me to come
right up to watch a TV show with him.  I put him off for a while and went
downstairs and took a nap.  David called and had some questions about a GFI
Outlet.  Irven called and asked if his children could come over tomorrow and
talk to me about buying the chickens.  I told him that would be ok with me but
that I was going over to Jeff’s after I got the lawns mowed, to help him.  They
will be over about 8:30AM.  Bob then called down stairs to see if I was coming
up to watch TV with him.  He just doesn’t understand me being home and having
anything else to do but watch TV shows.  Sometimes it gets to me.  I typed this
much of the journal entry and took care of the chickens before going upstairs. 
We watched two movies and at 11PM I came down to go to bed.</p>
