slept in until 7:30 before getting up and prepared breakfast.  We went over and
picked up Irven and Sandy at 10:15 and went to the Bountiful Temple.  In our
session they played the newest film.  It was very emotional and seemed to have
brought out more feelings for the decisions Adam and Eve had to make.  After
the Session we went to the Chuck-A-Rama where we ate and enjoyed visiting with
Irven and Sandy.  After taking Irven and Sandy home, Mae wanted to go to a
Health Store.  We enjoyed the rest of the evening together.  We watched a movie
on DVD that was fair, but I enjoyed most being with my sweetheart.</p>

I was tired, I was up and to my meeting at 8AM.  Meetings were good but I have
a head cold that is really hindering my hearing.  I keep wondering about the
hearing aid but that is just too much money.  When we came home we prepared
some dinner and had Bob come down to eat with us.  After dinner I took care of
the chickens, while Mae cleaned up the kitchen.  We then took a nap.  I caught
my journal up to date.  I then worked on my Diary getting September 10<sup>th</sup>
and 11<sup>th</sup> entered for 1970 thru 1974.  I added quite a bit of
expansion to the short Diary Entries.  This is an interesting project to
re-enter those journal entries.  Many of then I enter just as they were written
but many has just enough to touch my memory and I can add needed explanations. 
Well it is now getting time to get to bed as I am going back to work in the
morning.  Having a few days off sure makes me wish I could be more retired than
I am.  I shouldn’t complain as many have it much worse than I do.  Mae visited
with Pat Bradfield on the phone, and she is one that has lots of trials.  I
called Roy to see how they are doing and we visited for a few minutes.  I was
expecting President Steadman to come by this evening to get our check for the
Boy Scouts of America drive, but he must have been longer with his family than
he thought he would be.</p>

both slept pretty good last night.  Mae helped get me off to work.  My runs
went well but as I was returning to the compound they called over the radio,
asking for a driver to take a field trip.  It really upset me as they are just
under manned in that office and the field trip just slipped through the
cracks.  Roberta retired and as far as I know now no one has been considered as
a replacement.  To me that is management’s irresponsibility.  If Bryan can’t
handle his staff then it is the Davis School District Superintendent’s
problem.  I feel it is the same thing with not having enough bus drivers and
assistants.  This morning I came home on a soap box.  I am also concerned about
the Audiologist and Doctors appointments I have for Wednesday.  Will they do
any good or is it just more money going out for nothing.  It is like Mae just
told me; I need to quite complaining because it only is upsetting me.  After
taking a nap, I worked on my Diary entrances for a while before we had lunch. 
I then went into work and got approval to have Wednesday PM off to see the
Doctor appointments.  This evening went fast.  After dinner I read the lesson
for Sunday’s Priesthood and Relief Society lessons.  We called and reached
JaNae and they have got the Buick registered in her name, so we can notify the
DMVA that we do no longer own the car.  </p>

didn’t sleep last night so I just got ready and went.  She left me a note
saying that she was sorry, but she shouldn’t have to apologize as it isn’t her
fault that she doesn’t sleep well and beside that she does so much else for me
that I am always in her debt.  She is a beautiful and wonderful wife and
sweetheart!  My runs went well and after getting home I cooked some eggs for
the two of us.  I then took a short nap but I didn’t wake when the timer went
off so I slept about ½ hour.  I worked on my Diary entries for a while but
yesterday I made some mistakes in entering some of the information so it took
me a while to get it straightened out.  My PM runs went well.  This evening we
tried to find something to watch on TV but there wasn’t much.  We watched the
show “Charades” which was good but we have seen it so many times that we know
the plots.  It finished at 8PM and there was another advertised that sounded good
so we thought we would stay up and watch it even if it wouldn’t end until
10PM.  We got ready for it and then it was switched for an Elvis Presley
movie.  We turned that off and went to bed early.</p>

and wake, so Mae set it for another 10 minutes.  I still didn’t hear it go off
but a few minutes later Mae woke me with a kiss.  She is sure a special wife
and sweetheart.  I took off work this afternoon to go to my appointment at
Tanner Clinic .  Mae went with me.  First I saw an Audiologist who tested me
hearing and went over the Audiogram report that indicates I do have need for
hearing aid for hearing correction.  She did not try to high pressure us but
simply explained what they could suggest.  Their prices are a little less that
we had been given but still expensive.  Dr. Richards, E.N.T. Doctor then
examined me and said I didn’t seem to have anything causing my problems except
I do need hearing aids.  I went shopping with Mae after leaving their.  Mae got
us some dinner when we returned home.  I took care of the chickens and gathered
the eggs.  We turned on the show “The Alamo” and watched it.  It’s now bed
time. Good night!</p>

me.  It will take a week before it comes in and then I will go in to have it
adjusted for me.  This evening I updated our Garmin GPS.  After dinner I worked

I had her go back to bed and I got myself off to work.  I really didn’t feel
like getting on the bus this morning but I did and my routes went well.  It
started snowing quite hard but then let up before I finished.  After getting
home and having something to eat with Mae, we laid down and took a nap.  I
slept quite well but Mae just rested.  Mae took me over to work this
afternoon.  My run’s went well and I got back to the yard to park my bus at
3:45PM.  Mae was waiting for me.  We drove to Morgan getting to the school with
about 5 minutes to spare before the basketball game started.  Tyler played well
although he only made 5 points this game.  Morgan won the game by about 9
points.  After the game, I took Mae out to eat at the Chicken Restraint in
Morgan.  I had a 12 oz. steak and Mae had chicken.  It was very good.  When we
got home we watched an interesting show on DVD before going to sleep.</p>

slept in this morning.  It was a relaxing day.  I did work on my Diary, getting
several days entries copied in to the computer files.  Mae and I drove into
Ogden to pick up some items at the Harvest Moon Health Store.  The clerk made a
substantial error in adding thing up so we had to go back in and get it
corrected.  Mae then wanted me to stop at Costco for a couple of items.  I
kidded her about, it cost us at least $100.00 every time we stopped there.  We
got a few items and then watched a Vitamix demonstration.  I was very impressed
and am sorry that we bought a Blendtex machine.  Just before checking out we
went past the Hearing Center.  We found out that we can get even a better
Hearing Aid for over 50% less than what we will get it through the Hospital.  I
was very impressed and am going to check it further.  When we checked out the
bill was for $94.00 so I kidded the casher that she had shortchanged me by
$6.00.  I then explained to her about my bet to my wife that we always spent
over $100.00.  She chuckled over that.  We came home and watched a show on
Bob’s TV that he had recorded.  The name of the show was “Christmas Visitor”. 
With it being recorded we could fast forward the advertisements, which reduced
the show time by ½ and made the show much more enjoyable.  While Mae showered,
I caught up my journal.</p>

and Primary room along with Mae’s Sunday school room.  I got home for just a
few minutes when it was time to go to the Block Meetings.  I am really having
trouble hearing.  I don’t understand why it is so bad now.  After returning
home Mae fixed us some lunch.  Charles Saunders and I then went up to the
Legacy Village Rehabilitation Center and visited Sister Cleon Johnston.  She is
doing much better as she had been in the Hospital with fluid on her lungs. 
They have drained much of the fluid off.  Her big concern is for her sweetheart
Elwood.  Brother Thomas and Brother Thompson went over to visit Sister Linda
Haydorn, who went into the Hospital this morning.  Mae has been busy most of
the afternoon preparing dinner.  Jeff, Gail and their family came at 5PM for
dinner.  We visited and played games, in which I won at Bohnanza.  That is the
first for me at that game.  I helped Mae some with the clean up although she
did circles around me.  I entered this journal entry and we soon went to bed.</p>

order.  I then called the Costco Hearing Center and made an appointment with
them for Thursday at 10:45AM.  I did take a nap before eating lunch and taking
my PM runs.  Dispatch called over the intercom and asked for help with Field
trips.  I went in after my run to see if I could help.  I met Lynn Degraw there
and he told me that his Sister, Kathy Degraw Cragun die Saturday, very suddenly. 
He wasn’t sure about the details.  Evidently Kathy and her husband we flying to
Los Vegas.  On the flight down, Kathy wasn’t feeling well and when they landed
they had to take her off the airplane in a wheel chair.  An ambulance took her
to the hospital there in Los Vegas.  After examining her they took her back to
the airport and life flight her back to Salt Lake, where she was taken to the
hospital.  She died there due to blood clouts and other complications.   The
funeral will be a grave side service at the Redwood Memorial Estates in Salt
Lake.  When I got home I let Mae know about Kathy.  We ate dinner and watched a
couple of shows on TV.  I worked on my Diary entrances while Mae called Bryce
and other Family members.  She also changed some of her schedules so we can
attend the grave side services tomorrow.  </p>

a field trip.  It is a drop and return trip so it will work out with my regular
PM runs.  We went into to Kitchen Kneads and bought some rice and beans.  We
then went to Costco where we bought a Vitamix food processer.  That is what we
should have bought instead of the Blentex while on our mission to California. 
I also got my hearing tested again.  It checked out the same as the other two tests,
so I guess it is unanimous.  We bought the hearing aids there for $1,899
instead of the $6,000 that the other two wanted.   We got home and had some
lunch.  I took a short nap and then went to work.  I took Sunset Jr. High to
Layton High and dropped them off.  I then took my regular PM runs and when I
finished I went back to the High School and waited.  When the game was over I
took the students back to Sunset Jr. High.  That will almost make up for an
extra days pay.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  After dinner we started
to watch a movie that had came on netflex.  We didn’t get very far into it when
we shut it off because it was a PG-13 movie of very poor quality of standards. 
We watched a JAG movie instead.  I sure love my wife.</p>

a flower.  I stayed at the office to enter my Field Trip information.  They
have done some updates to the employee information and now want each bus driver
to enter the ending bus mileage each Friday.  I don’t think I am going to do
that.  We already turn in a weekly report but now it will require use to take
the time to enter it into the computer, which will require waiting until for a

make vinyl lettering for a sign that we will set out in front to try and get
some more customers that wants to buy eggs.  I had a little to eat and then

Our GPS was off when we got to Salt Lake and it took us a little while and a
phone call to the hospital in order for us to find the hospital.  We had a nice
visit with Chelci and she is doing well but is tired of staying in bed.  When
we left we had trouble getting out of the Parking Lot.  The signs kept taking
us in circles.  We finally had to call security to find the way out.  After
getting home I took care of the chickens and made Mae some small sticks for
that she will use in her Primary class for an object lesson.  I also made a
stand for the sign that Mishelle made for us.  Brother Morgan Thomas called and
asked if I would go to the hospital in Ogden to give Sister Linda Heydorn a
Blessing.  We tended Scott and Mishelle’s children for them while they went out

went well although I really had trouble hearing various people.  I don’t have
an explanation, but my hearing has been worse since I started taking the
hearing tests.  Maybe it is a lot mental but whatever I am looking forward to
getting the hearing aids to see if they make much difference.  After getting
home from meetings I went up stairs to invite Bob down for dinner but he
already had dinner started.  We ate up there and it was very good.  Mae and I
also got a rest and a nap before eating.  Mae rested, I went right to sleep.  I
walked down to Mark Stringer to see if he would take care of our chickens while
we are gone from February 24 thru March 1.  He said he would be glad to.  He
then wanted me to see his boat.  It is a large boat, I hope he likes it. 
Brother Taylor and Brother Korbin Rogers came Home Teaching this afternoon.  We
had a lovely visit with them.  Scott and Kylan came over to bring us a TV.  I
think that it will fit in the cabinet of our current TV with a little
modification to the cabinet.  Scott also wanted to borrow my extension latter
so he can take his Christmas light down.  I went upstairs and watched a show

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were able to sleep in due to it being Presidents Day but we got up at 7:30AM. 
I prepared omelets for breakfast.  I went over to Dr. Toone and got a treatment
on my back and also a little more adjustment on my neck.  We then went to Ben
Lomond High School, where we watched Morgan Freshman play South Summit Freshman
team.  Although it was a close game Morgan took and kept the lead winning by 10
points.  We enjoy watching Tyler play and he did well.  We then went to Legacy
Village Rehabilitation Center and visited Sister Cleon Johnston.  We came home
after that visit and I took care of the chickens and I also took a nap.  This
evening we went into Costco where I was fitted with my hearing aids.  We bought
a few other things before coming home.  We watched some of the Olympics while
we ate dinner.  Mae is more interested in those than I am.  I feel that there
is too much emphasis placed on sport and it just keep increasing and drawing
money and time to the sports of all kind.  We put our sign out this morning and
when we got home this evening we had a call on the recorder interested in
getting eggs.  It is now bed time as I have to drive bus again tomorrow.  It
has been a very busy day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Work
went well today.  My hearing aids seem to work ok but I hear lots of sounds I
am not use to hearing.  Mae left to take Ashley, Kaden and Kaitlyn to Tree
House Museum in Ogden and will be back about the time I finish my PM runs.  I
was able to get two more days entrances typed up from my Diary.  I now have
just three more months to type up.  My PM runs went well and I got home at
4:20PM.  Mae had some dinner for us to take and eat on the way.  I invited Bob
to go with us also and I think he enjoyed the game.  Morgan played Bear River
and lost, but Bear River had then on size all the way.  Morgan fought hard but
lost by over 10 points.  We didn’t realize it at the game but one of the boys
on the team, his Grandfather is Roger Cowen from Grantsville.  I believe that
he took my place when I was released from the Bishopric and put in as Scout
Master.  We are sorry that we didn’t recognize him.  Before going to bed we
watched a movie on DVD “The Note” that we really enjoyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
AM runs went well.  After getting home, I had a snack, took a short nap, went
over to the Work Care and got my DOT physical.  They gave me a temporary card
until Dr. Lee fills out a form assuring that I use my CPAP machine frequently. 
I then went to Green’s Farm Feeds and bought Laying Mash for the chickens. 
There wasn’t much time left before I left to take my PM runs.  After my pm runs
I stopped for gas and at the store for a couple of items Mae needed.  Mae had dinner
almost ready when I got there.  We invited John Sliger for dinner and to look
at our computers.  He came late because he got involved with his own computer
and forgot the time.  After eating john went to work on our computers and
worked until 10:30PM before leaving.  He did a lot to cleanup both machines,
plus found the problems with the wireless printer.  I tried to watch and help
some but he was soon way over my head.  I finally had to give up and went to
bed.  Mae stayed up after he left for another hour cleaning up and getting
things ready for me for tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
had my breakfast all but ready when I got up so I let her sleep in.  I woke a
little early but I read a little longer this morning.  I finished the Joseph
Smith History and was thrilled with it.  I still had plenty of time to get to
the bus compound for my AM runs.  Both runs went well although I stopped after
getting all my grade school children and talked to them about bus cleanliness. 
I also switched Spencer Bair and Harrison Stromberg to a front seat where I can
keep a better eye on them.  I visited with Mrs. Hansen, Area’s mother, about
changing Area and Finnley with Spencer and Harrison, explaining that I needed
the two boys up front where I could have better control.  She was ok with
that.  Mae was up and dressed when I got home.  She fixed me a treat and her
some breakfast.  I laid down and took a nap, but I never heard the timer go off
so Mae let me sleep for 30 Minutes before waking me.   I worked on the computer
for a while.  Mae and I went for a walk.  We walked just over 1 mile in 20
minutes.  My PM runs went well although I had to give Spencer a last warning
before I write him up.  He just can’t reframe from horsing around.  After I got
after him he sulked until he got off the bus.  When I got home I went out and
gathered the eggs and brought them in so Mae could take eggs to Sister Reid.  I
cleaned the chicken coop and then came in.  This evening Mae went to a special
Stake Relief Society meeting.  I took my dinner and went up stairs and watched
the show “Twelve-O Clock High”.  Although I have seen it several times it is
still a very good show.  I was working on my journal when Mae came home.  We
soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep the best but still got up to get my breakfast and see me off.  My
runs went well.  Mae took the car into Murdock’s to get it serviced.  Bob
followed her down and then brought her back to Layton where she got her hair
done.  After I finished my PM runs bob took me down to get the car.  They were
not finished with it so I waited.  The mechanic came in and told me that in
checking our battery is showed that it should be replaced.  It is under full
warranty so I told him to go ahead.  By the time I got back home, Mae called to
tell me that she would soon be through.  I stopped and bought us some chicken
for our dinner and then got Mae.  We went over to Jeff and Gail’s where we
played games with them.  We played “Hand and Foot” in which Mae and I won
tonight.  We had a very enjoyable evening.  Jeff showed us how our cell phones
work on the cars Blue Tooth system.  We can now set our phones so we can
receive calls on the car speaker system without having anything in our hands to
distract driving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 6AM and started reading the New Testament.  I don’t know when I have
ever enjoyed and felt the Spirit of the Lord in reading the New Testament as I
did this morning.  We enjoyed sleeping in this morning.  After breakfast Mae
took Sister Olsen to the Bank so she could make a deposit.  When she got back
Mae and I went into Costco where I got my hearing aids adjusted.  We then
shopped for a couple of items and Mae decided that she would like to get a
second processing container for dry items.  That cost $90.00 plus with the
other items it cost over 200 dollars before we got out.  We looked at “Best
Buy” for some parts for our TV but decided to hold on those for now.  After
getting back home and having something to eat, we took a nap.  I worked on my
journals for a while.  Mae heated some soup for dinner and we watched a show
“Courageous” that we got from Netflix.  The show is 2 hr. 9 min. long, so it
took most of the evening.  When it finished we went down to Jennies daughters
and got some Tree Tea Oil that Jennie sent home with Shannon.  I then finished
this entry while Mae pressed a couple of blouses.  I also played a game on the
computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early but Mae hadn’t slept well.  I wish I could help her to sleep
better.  I went to the church and set up chairs before starting meetings. 
After meeting Mae and I were planning on going visiting to Sister Fallis but
she called and said that her flight was late getting in so she didn’t get home
until 2AM this morning.  Mark Stringer came over and I showed him what to do
for the chickens while we are gone.  We also visited for a few minutes.  I
helped Mae get some of the food ready for dinner.  We took a nap before Sandy
and Nick came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up this morning after both of us had slept pretty good last night.  We
packed the car, ate breakfast and left about 8:30AM.  We stopped in Centerville
where I got a treatment on my back from Dr. Toone.  We then stopped and got our
car washed and left for St. George.  We made a couple of stops and got to
Charles and Karen’s home at 3:30PM.  We just visit and enjoyed being together.  Grenn
and Kathleen Clark had arrived Sunday Evening.  It was about 10PM when we all
went to bed.</p>

Clark’s left walking a little before we were ready so Mae and I went walking. 
We walked around the sub-division and enjoyed seeing the new construction
taking place.  When we got back we ate breakfast and then left for sightseeing,
ending up going through Zion’s Park.  We stopped at the Majestic Lodge in
Zion’s Park, where we ate lunch.  It was very good and fairly reasonable.  We
sure had an enjoyable day. After getting home I entered yesterday’s and today’s
entrances to this journal.  Mae called Joan and Ralph Peterson, Joan isn’t
feeling very well.  this evening we watched the basketball game between Utah
State and New Mexico with New Mexico winning in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter. 
After the game ended I joined Mae, Kathleen and Karen a game of Mexican Train
Dominoes at which Karen won.  We all went to bed after that.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night.  I tried to let her sleep in but she soon
got up.  After breakfast Mae and I took a 15 minute walk but came back so that
the women could go shopping.  Our three wives went shopping for the day.   Chuck,
Grenn and I went sightseeing.  We ended up in Mesquite, where we went to a
Casino and ate.  Chuck and I ordered Liver and Onions and it was very good.  We
then returned to St. George where we stopped at a gun store for a few minutes
before going on to Chuck and Karen’s.  Our wives soon arrived.  They fixed some
dinner but we were still full from our dinner.  This evening we went to a stage
show of “Little Women” at the Brigham Theater.  I believe that this is their
first performances and we all thought that it was wonderful and very well
done.  We sure are having a great time being here with the Hyer’s and Clark’s.</p>

slept well last night.  I woke up before 6am but let Mae sleep until almost
7am.  We did go for a walk but it is cooler today with possible chance of
rain.  Mae had a nice Birthday card for me plus some socks and a new pair of
coverall suit.  I got a text from David and from Sandi wishing me a Happy
Birthday.  Sandi text also to wish me a Happy Birthday and then added a note
saying I might have a Birthday with twins born on it.  We sure hope and pray
that everything will be ok.  Scott called, Jeff text, Nick text and Mike
called.  I did appreciate them taking time to express their Love for me.  After
breakfast we Mae and I taught the others the game of Mormon Bridge.  This
afternoon Grenn, Kathyline, Charles and Karen took Mae and I out to dinner for
my Birthday.  After eating the ladies went shopping for a few minutes, so we
men went to Big 5 Sports store and looked around.  We then came back and had
another game of Mormon Bridge with Grenn winning.  We have sure had a wonderful
time with the Hyer’s and the Clark’s.  Better people just can’t be found on
earth.  Sandy sent us word and pictures that the babies were born at 11PM,
Jacob born 1<sup>st</sup> was 5 lb. 2 ½ Oz. and Luke born 2<sup>nd</sup> was 5 lb.
even.  Both were 18” long.</p>

woke at 6AM and worked on my journal for a little while until Grenn got up and
we visited for a few minutes.  We went walking for a while before breakfast. 
We then got packed up to go.  It has been such an enjoyable time here.  We
checked the tires, adding air to the left front tire and filling up with fuel
before leaving St. George.  We stopped in Cedar City to visit with Uncle Van
and Aunt Allison.  We had a good visit with them.  Uncle Van isn’t quite the
same, since he had a stroke.  I believe that Aunt Allison is quite scared that
he might get worse.  From there we stopped at Joyce and Bill Goddard’s to visit
them and Aunt Joy.  Aunt Joy is still looking quite for being 91 years of age. 
Mae drove from Fillmore to Nephi so I could sleep.  I drove on home and we got
there at 8:30PM.  It took us about an hour to get unpacked.  It has been a very
good and enjoyable trip, but it is good to be home.  We are very excited about
our new Great Grandchildren and so thankful that Mother and Babies are doing
well.  we got us something light to eat, then showered and went to bed.</p>
