<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3AM worry about the move and getting things taken care of.  Mae woke at
4AM so we got up and started with getting the Camper listed on KSL.Com.  That
took a while and then I fixed breakfast.  We have been busy all day with
packing.  I spent most of the time outdoors while Mae spent all day downstairs
packing.  Scott and Kylan came over and helped me move the camper and put the
shell on the pickup.  I finally came in for the night after securing the cove
on David’s tower for his boat.  Cheryl came to visit so that took most of our
time we had left, although Mae and I did get a 15 minute nap.  We went to
Connor’s basketball game this evening.  We didn’t get home until 10PM.  We put
the groceries away, then took our showers and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were happy that it was the change in Day Light Saving Time as we were late
getting up.  Sandi sent us a text first thing this morning.  It read “Starting
my Thankful Month.  I am so thankful for my loving wonderful parents.  I love
you so much.”  That was neat to start the day off with.  Meetings went well
although I had to take my hearing aids out before Sunday school class was
over.  I don’t know just what to do.  Sandi was waiting for us when we got out
of Church.  Mae cooked a nice dinner for us.  After dinner we took Sandi over
to look at the mobile home.  Bryce and Deanna soon came and then Jeff and his
family came and before long Scott and his family came.  Later Irven and Sandy
also came over.  Everyone seems to like the home.  Our children all came back
to our home in Clinton where we visited and played games.  We feel quite good
about the decisions we are making.  We just hope and pray that it is the right
choice.  After our family left I helped Mae clean up a little more.  I then
work on my journals and had Mae type into my journal of 2005 a poem that was
written and given to us where we preparing to leave our mission from the
Philippines, by President Lauro T. Nieto of the Munioz 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward.  It
is getting late and I am tired so I think we will soon go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were late getting up and going this morning.  We were notified this morning by
Monte Vista Mobil Home Park that we were approved by the association.  We are
waiting on our money to arrive and we should be ready to start moving.  Bob had
to be taken into the hospital again this morning but, Grant did that.  Bob had
house cleaners come in this morning.  They did a pretty good job.  Mae was on
the phone quite a while with a call from Tina (was Linderman) Richards and then
Georgia called and talked for a long time also.  I took Bob over to see the
trailer home and he quite liked it.  I went over to Sister Joyce Wilson’s and
installed a 3 way light switch, a fan speed control switch and a new vanity
sink faucet.  I was 4 hours doing that including going to the store to get the
items.  The day sure went by fast and I feel like I accomplished very little.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were up earlier today but still seemed to have interruptions that slowed us
down.   I worked for a little while on my tool trailer getting it cleaned up. 
Mae went into Ogden to my appointment with Dr. Kennington.  He convinced me to
try two more weeks with the hearing aids before giving up.  He made some
alterations in the hearing aids to see if that will help.  We stopped and got
gas for the car and also washed the car.  We did some shopping.  Irven and
Sandy came over and visited for a while.  This evening I checked on prices of
roofing at Lowes.  On the way home I picked up the key to the Church house.  I
called Morgan and turned in my Home Teaching report.  I was going to get some
things other things done but Bob knocked and said that Irven, Sandy and Mark
was there and waiting to watch a movie.  I took my capsules up with me and did
fill a couple of trays while watching a show with them.  Mae has been busy
packing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
breakfast we heard that the Republican Party won most of the positions in
yesterdays elections.  That is good news but I wonder if it is too little too
late.  I worked on getting bids on roofing materials most of the day.  It looks
like Roofing Supply Group has the best bid.  I did more cleaning in my tool
trailer and I took the trailer off the jacks.  Mae has worked all day on
packing and sorting out things in the house.  We watched a show on TV while we
ate our dinner.  Grant and Stacy think they have an Assisted Living Home for
Bob.  That means we have to get moving pretty quick.  Sure a lot to do!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up and soon started with sorting through what needs to go to the D.I., what
needs to be thrown away, what needs to be given to our family and what we want
to pack to take with us.  I worked most of the day outside while Mae worked
most of the day inside.  Jeff and Gail plus Scott and Mishelle stopped over and
got a few items.  We have my old shot gun that needs fixing but I have not been
unable to find anyone to repair it.  I called the Clinton police station and
ask them how I got rid of the gun.  The dispatch sent an officer over.  He said
that he could take it and it would be cut up and salvaged.  He then asked why I
wanted to get rid of the gun.  When I told him that I couldn’t get it repaired
he said that he thought he know someone that would fix it.  I let him use my
computer and he made a call.  I now have the address and will keep the gun and
have it fixed.  Stacy has been over here most of the day getting things
packed.  Moving is a big job, especially when it is for someone else.  We
watched a good show on Netflix this evening.  BYU TV was broadcasting a special
musical concert with James Wilson singing with the Tabernacle Choir and
Orchestra.  We watched the last of it.  It was very good.  We soon went to bed,
very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked out in the tool trailer and the white shed.  Most of what was in the
white shed went into the old shed for now.  I think some of it will go to
Sandi’s basement to be stored.  There were several interruptions that took
time.  Mae was busy in the house sorting through and packing.  I took our truck
loaded with items, to the Deseret Industries.  This evening we had a family party
in honor of Kim &amp; Jeanenne who just returned from their mission and to be
able to visit more with their children as Mysha &amp; her husband Johnny and
Kaleesee live in North Dakota and Joshua lives in Hawaii and they will be
returning to their homes on Monday or shortly thereafter.  Mae was able to
reserve on 800 North and we all brought pot luck items to share for our dinner,
which turned out really nice, and the younger generation had a great time
playing volleyball while some of the ladies visited and Kim showed pictures of
their mission to Ken, Bryce and others.  We all really enjoyed ourselves.  As
we were leaving, Bryce called me over to his car and showed me his dolly and
told me we could use it to help me move stuff.  That was special of him to
think of us and have us use it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                With
many interruptions, I was trying to get the shed ready to be moved.  Sister
Graf had some packing boxes which I went over to get and I mentioned that Mae
was going to go over and clean the carpets and she said she had a carpet
cleaner that we could borrow and then she insisted that she come and clean the
carpets for us, so Mae &amp; Dianne went over to do them and do some
measuring.  Mae wiped out the kitchen drawers and cupboards and fridge while
Dianne cleaned the carpets.  Mae also went over to the management office and
paid our lot rent of $308.50.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Just before
I was going to come in to get ready to eat supper and go to the evening
conference meeting, a couple came to look at the camper.  Just as I was
finished showing them the camper, another fellow stopped by and he wanted me to
show him the camper.  I don’t know how serious either one is about getting it,
but I just had to quickly change clothes and go to the meeting without eating. 
It was a great meeting, and as we were leaving, we met Bishop Hatch and his
wife and they asked how things were coming with us moving and how things were
going with Bob.  We told them that what we knew at this point that it might be
one to two weeks before Bob would be going to Chanceler Gardens assisted living
center.  They also asked how we were doing with our packing and offered for us
to use their large recreational closed in trailer, rather than rent a U Haul
trailer.  The Lord is really blessing us.  When we got home Mae had a plate
fixed for me to eat so I warmed it on Bob’s microwave oven, ate and then Bob
yelled so I went up to see what was the matter.  He is just frustrated over the
whole thing.  I talked to him for awhile and he settled down.  I then worked on
my journal and now we are going to shower and go to bed as I have a 7 am
meeting in the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up early so I could attend Stake Conference Priesthood Leadership meeting. 
I let Mae sleep in.  The meeting was very good and I was able to hear pretty
good without me earning aids.  After coming home we had breakfast and then I
took a nap.  We attended Sacrament meeting in Morgan at Kim and Jeanenne’s Ward
so that we might hear them report on their mission.  They both did very well
although the time was too short.  Many of our family also were there.  After
the meeting, we went to their home were they served a potato bar to all that
came to.  We enjoyed visiting before leaving.  Jeff’s children wanted to ride
home with Grandma.  When we got to Jeff’s, we stayed and played games with the
children and then Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played a game of Rummy.  When we got
home Grant and Stacy were upstairs so we went up to see how things were going. 
We were tired so soon came downstairs and went to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep were well so she got back up and packed her souvenirs.  I let her
sleep in when I got up.  She got up at 8:30AM.  I worked on my journal while
she slept.  After Mae woke I cooked egg omelets for breakfast.  I worked all
day on getting the shed ready to move.  After dinner this evening I repaired
Scott’s cabinet door.  I am sure tired tonight.  She has been going all day but
mainly helping others.  She went over to Knudsen’s and helped Neil with Family
History.  She also took Bob to Kmart shopping.  We are both ready for bed and I
hope that Mae can sleep tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got started by 8AM after eating breakfast, although Mae didn’t sleep very well
last night.  I went to United Rental by 9AM and rented a flat trailer.  By the
time I got back with it, Bryce was there.  Scott had the day off work as it is
Veterans Day, so he soon came over to help.  We were able to jack up the shed
and with a come-a-long,  were able to pull the shed onto the trailer.  We tied
it down, so that there was no way it could blow or tip of the trailer unless it
took the trailer with it.  We were able to unload the shed onto the slab at our
mobile home lot.  However it was 45 decrees off.  Bryce suggested that we put a
round rock in the center of the building so that it worked as a pivot point. 
We were then able to rotate the shed into place.  With Bryce’s and Scott’s help
we were able to get that job done.  I will still have to anchor the shed to the
pad, but can do that later.  Mae of course has been busy packing.  Then at noon
Mishelle came over and the two of them went to work on the yards around the
Mobile Home.  By the time I took the trailer back and came back, they had the
bushes and flower gardens looking pretty good.  I bought Subway sandwiches that
the tree of us ate and then I helped hem and we picked up most of the leaves
and trash.  It was late and dark when we finished.  This evening Mae and I
watched the show some of American Ride, then Story Track and then The Mormon
Tabernacle Choir presented a special Veterans Day program, that we watched. 
After that we showered and went to bed.</p>

continued to pack.  Mishelle again came over to the mobile home and she and Mae
finished cleaning the yard.  I helped some there but started working on the
shed.  We were tired when we came home.  Mae cleaned up and went to a Relief
Society on TV but fell asleep to many times during the show, so I didn’t make
much since of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                 I
woke about 5:30 with a terrible dream.  I was dreaming that I was back driving
school bus.  There was a terrible snow storm and most of the windows were broke
out of the bus letting the snow into the bus.  After picking up my first stop
for students and starting up, I young boy cut in front of the bus and I saw him
go under the bus.  I tried to call on the radio but couldn’t get anyone to
respond.  I got out and crawled under the bus and got the boy out and into my
arms.  I then tried to find help but couldn’t so I started carrying him to the
hospital but didn’t know where it was.  I tried to use my cell phone but with
the boy in my arms I dropped the phone in the snow and stepped on it, breaking
it.  At that time I woke and was very glad for that.  Mae had gotten up earlier
and started packing and getting ready for Sister of the Ward that is coming to
help.  She crawled back in bed with me and held me close until I calmed down. 
I sure love her.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
started snowing this morning and is very cold.  This morning Sister Renee
Barker, Sister Jennifer Roper and Sister Diann Graf came over and helped Mae
pack.  They stayed until noon helping and then Sister Graf also returned with a
roasted chicken for our dinner this evening.  They have sure been wonderful in
their service and friendship.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
really did more puttering around than I did getting things done.  I got on line
to order a hasp from Home Depot, the price was ok ($4.45) but then it would
cost $5.95 shipping.  That upset me so I went to Ace Hardware and bought
another one that I think I can make due for $9.00.  I later was unable to find
what I did with it, maybe I left it at the check stand, I don’t know.  I also
bought a special lock for my tool trailer at Dick’s Boat shop.  I did assist
Mae a little with moving packed tots around.  I called Bryce and he and Deanna
stopped by.  He had left his coat here yesterday when he was helping me move
the shed.  I also gave him my metal chop saw in exchange for him building me a
rack that will bolt to the side of the shed and hold our picnic tables.  Of
course some time was spent visiting with them.  I went over to the trailer and
got my tool box.  I took my old 20 gage shot gun over to Lee’s Gun Smith in
West Haven to see if he can repair it.  I got visiting with him and found that
distantly we are related.  I spent about an hour visiting with him.  I drained
some of our water storage tanks and disassembled that system.  I am hoping to
be able to reassemble a similar system at the trailer home.  Stacy came over
and visited with Mae, venting some of her frustrations with Robert and Patty as
they are trying to get Bob ready to move into an assisted living.  We were late
eating dinner this evening.  We watched a Christmas story on Netflix while
eating although Mae spent some time talking to Mishelle on the phone.  It was
late when we went to bed.  Our check from our annuities still didn’t come today
and that was disappointing.</p>

woke at 5AM thinking of the design for our water storage, so I got up and read
my scriptures and caught up my journal before I woke Mae.  We were busy all day
getting things packed.  Sandy came over and helped Mae today with the packing. 
We got our check from our annuity so I deposited it and had a Cashier’s Check
made out to Bruce &amp; Loreen Wolfley for the mobile home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were busy all day packing.  I put down protective plastic on the carpet to help
keep the carpet clean as we move thing in.  Bryce met me at the trailer and
brought the racks he built to hang the picnic tables on the outside of the
storage shed.  He also brought me a piece of angle iron that I need to remodel
the opening in the end of the west deck on the mobile home, in order for me to
get my water barrels under the deck.  David called and I went back home and
helped him get his boat out and the tower put back onto the boat.  When we took
the boat into the back yard we used my pickup, but when we took it out today,
David’s truck sits higher than mine and so it raised the boat up and the back
drag bars cut into the lawn quite badly.  I took several tots over to the new
home and so Mae went over and started unpacking and arranging things.  Kim was
in the area and had some time to kill while waiting on a client so he stopped
and visited with Mae.  He also helped her with some of the moving.  We were
sure tired when we went to bed tonight.</p>

Mae and I slept well last night.  I got up early to attend my High Priest Group
Leadership meeting.  Meeting went well.  Brother Saunders of the Bishopric
stopped me and asked if Mae and I would speak in Sacrament meeting in two
weeks.  I would have liked to say no but I said we would.  When I told Mae
before Sacrament meeting started she said no, we are moving.  However after
meeting when she spoke to Brother Saunders, she said yes.  When we got home Mae
made Rice Pelf and Chicken and Salmon patties for Bob, Bruce, Grant, Stacy, Mae
and I, for lunch.  I helped her get things ready.  This evening Scott returned
my compressor to me.  He, Mishelle and Kaitlyn stayed for a little while and
visited with us.  We are quite tired tonight and went to bed early.</p>

both slept fairly well last night and got up about 7AM.  I prepared breakfast
of egg omelets.  They turned out better this morning than the other day as I
turned the heat down this time and didn’t burn them.  Mae started the weekly
wash and then we left about 9:30AM for the new home.  We paid Bruce and Lareen
Wolfley the $34,800 and they signed the deed over to us.  I worked the rest of
the day on the back patio deck.  Mae came home and finished the washing and did
more packing.  Bishop Hatch brought his trailer over this evening for us to use
to move with.  We watched a little TV while we were waiting for him to bring it

packing.  At 11AM Diane Graf came and also helped Mae.  I went into Dr.
Kennington and turned my hearing aids into him.  He will send them back to the
company and they will send us our money back in about a week.  Here we go
again!  I started insulating the walls of the west deck.  Bryce came to help
me.  I had him go to Home Depot for some materials.  Morgan Thomas also stopped
by and helped me.  Mae called me to tell me that Scott was there to help me.  He
started hauling food storage into the trailer.  We were not finished with the
insulating but I decided it was getting late and I needed to help Scott. 
Before Scott went home he set up a program to keep inventory of the food
storage under the West patio.  We had some dinner and watched a show on Netflix
before going to bed.</p>

I insulated under the west deck.  I did both the walls and the flooring of the
deck.  I then built a framework for the boxes to sit on so that they would not
be directly on the concrete floor.  Scott came over at 3 pm after work and
Karen Neiderhauser also came over about that time and the two of them helped
Mae plus they loaded Karen’s pickup with food storage boxes along with some of
the totes that were ready to bring over.  Marie McEntire helped Mae do some
more packing at the Clinton home.  She also went to the store and bought Mae
some eggs.  Mae came over so she could begin unpacking boxes and totes and also
type in the number of cans in a case and the order that they were put in on the
Excel program that Scott had set up for us.  Mae went to Subway here in Roy and
bought sandwiches for the four of us.  We started to put some of the cases of
food storage under the deck, but I realized that the framework made it too
tight to put three cases in the stack, so I made the determination to take the
framework back out.  By then it was late and we mainly called it a day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Karen
Neiderhauser came over with me again today.  We removed the framing from
underneath the west deck and with the use of my plainer, plained the boards
down 3/8 “.  While we were doing this, Bryce came over and I had him go in and
help Mae unpack and put things away.  He got bored of this and wanted to take
the stove out since he knew we were replacing it with ours from the Clinton
house.  As he was doing this he grabbed the rug that I had removed from under
the deck and put it on our carpet, which we had cleaned, turned it upside down
with Mae trying to get him to stop, but it was done.  He pulled the stove out
by the oven door and broke it, but he still proceeded to take it out to the
front deck.  Mae was glad when he could go out and help me.  Mae was going to
buy chicken for the four of us to eat, but Bryce suggested Mae just go to Del
Taco and buy grilled chicken burritos as it was close by, good food and
inexpensive.  We all enjoyed them.  After getting the frame rebuilt, Karen and
Bryce helped me get the boxes underneath the deck.  Bryce recorded the items
that were going under the deck with Karen putting them onto a dolly and then I
would pull the dolly into me and unload the cases, stacking them 3 high on the
rack.  We were able to get 12 rows, 3 high and 2 deep plus on the 13<sup>th</sup>
row, we had room to put 2 cases on their side making 74 cases total.  Scott
called me after work and asked where he should come to help.  I told him that
we were about finished at the Roy house and to go help Mae pack at the Clinton
house.  Mae invited Scott to stay and have supper with us as we were fixing
chicken patties and warming up left over rice Pilaf and we had a green salad
also.  We enjoyed having him with us and sure appreciated all his help.  He is
a special son.</p>

Mae and I spent most of the day packing and getting everything ready to be
moved tomorrow morning as the men from the ward and our sons were coming to
help move us.  Scott called to ask if he could borrow my ladder and he also
helped me load and take over Bob’s washer and dryer as we are going to use his
instead of taking ours over.  Bob’s is newer and in better condition than ours
and his family agreed that we should take them.  After we brought the washer
and dryer over, we got my long extension ladder for Scott to take as he wants
to get his Christmas lights up on his house before the bad stormy weather
comes.  When Scott left, he took the back roads home as he had noticed that the
traffic on the freeway was backed up to almost a complete stop.  When I left to
go home, after installing the washer and putting the dryer in, I didn’t take
the back roads and just went south on 1900 West.  That was a mistake as there
must have been so much traffic getting off the freeway trying to find a way to
get around the traffic jam, that 1900 West was also just creeping and it took
me an extra half hour to get home to the Clinton house.  We were very tired
towards evening so I suggested to Mae that we go out for dinner.  We went over
to Golden Coral and enjoyed dinner there.  We were very tired when we went to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
woke at 3 pm and couldn’t go back to sleep and I was partially awake trying to
organize the move with the volunteers that were coming from the ward and
family.  Mae and I had breakfast and frantically tried to get things going.  I
loaded the food out of the freezer into 3 totes and a packing box while Mae
went to the store to get dry ice to put in the totes with the food from the
freezer.  I asked her to buy some bright red sticky notes to put on the boxes
that we needed to take first, but when she arrived David and Tyler were there
and others started arriving and there was no time to put sticky notes on.  We
had quite a few that came over to help us: Wayne Thompson arrived shortly after
David &amp; Tyler did.  Others that came were Karen Neiderhauser, Corbin and
Tanner Rogers and their dad, Ryan, arrived shortly after.  Vi Graham, Dick
Larsen and Thomas Saunders and his son, Nathan were also there early.  Brother
Campbell was there helping load for a little while, and also William Heydorn. 
Some only helped get the first trailer load in and then left, while others went
over with us to unload and some even went back with us to get the second load
and helped us bring it over and unload it.  Mike was later getting there, but
was there in time to help us get the second load in the house and helped get
the beds set up.  David &amp; Tyler stayed the entire time.  Mae went to Del
Taco and bought a dozen large Burritos to feed the men for lunch.  I think that
we have the name of all that helped and they were surely appreciated.   We are
in a real mess now, but at least most everything is here.  We still have some
stuff in the coat and game room and stuff to take to Sandi’s basement in the
storage bedroom.  I needed to take the moving blankets backs to the  Rental
company and so I dropped off the trailer at the Clinton home and started
getting the blankets counted and folded and realized that I was 3 blankets
short.  I rushed back to the Roy home and found the blankets still wrapped
around fragile mirrors.  We also had one blanket that we had to dry that got
quite wet from the rain.  I was able to get back to Universal Rental just
before they locked up at 5 pm.  Mae stayed at the Clinton home to get the food
out of the fridge to take to the Roy house and started cleaning the fridge and
dropped one of the tempered glass shelves and it shattered all to pieces.  That
was about the straw that broke the camel’s back and she started crying.  She
had just finished cleaning it up when I got back to the house.  We noticed that
we still had food in the freezer part of the fridge so I unloaded it while Mae
vacuumed.  By the time we left, it was late and we were tired and hungry so we
stopped at Smith’s grocery store and Mae bought some Chinese takeout while I
bought some fried chicken from the deli.  We went home and sat, where we could,
and ate, then made our bed and went to bed exhausted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up this morning in time to attend meetings in the Clinton 20<sup>th</sup>
ward.  Our master bath is cold and there seems to be no air flow through the
vent.  Being in such a mess and then having unexpected problems really
depressed me to tears.  To add to the when I got dressed we couldn’t find my
ties.  After several minutes of searching I told Mae that I wasn’t going to
Church.  She balled me out so I went, although I sure felt half dressed when I
entered the chapel.  Brother Taylor got me a tie from the Bishops office and I
felt much better attending quorum meeting.  Meeting went well although I was
cold all through Sacrament meeting.  The primary put on the program during
Sacrament meeting and I had a hard time hearing most of the children speak. 
After meeting we stopped over to Sister Provert’s so Mae could give her a small
gift.  We came home and had some lunch and then I took a short nap.  We went
over to see Bob for just a few minutes and then we had to go Tithing
Settlement.  From there we stopped at the house to get a few items.  Grant and
Stacy were there cleaning up the house as Grant has to work all next week.  We
went up to Jeff and Gail’s where we visited, played games and ate dinner.  It
was after 9PM when we got home and soon went to bed.</p>

was about 7AM when we got up.  After breakfast we went right to work organizing
things.  I went to get things from the house and at Home Depot.  I was going to
get the glass shelves but I forgot as Mae called me and said that the
technician from Comcast was there and needed a way to get under the house.  I
came straight home and cut an access opening for him.  The technician had quite
a bit of trouble getting wires ran.  When he left we had internet and the TV
works.  Sister McEntire brought homemade chilly over for our dinner this evening. 
We worked up until almost 10PM and then Mae called and talked to Sandi for
quite a while.  I was so tired when we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was not pleased with the way our computer desk looks and wanted to get a new
desk.  Mae didn’t think we should but she got on the internet and got on
KSL.com and found a desk advertised for sale in Kaysville.  I called on it,
talking to David Fowler.  He and his wife are in St. George right now but he
called his daughter, then he called me back.  He made arrangements for me to go
to his house at 3:30PM and his Son-In-Law would be there to help me.  I
returned a box to Comcast that had been brought to our house in the move by
accident.  It needed to be credited to Bob’s account.  I then went to Mr.
Fowler’s where his Son-In-Law showed me the cabinet.  As soon as I saw it and
the asking price was just $75.00, I told him that I would take it.  It was in
the basement and so was a real job for his son-in-law and I to get it upstairs
and loaded onto my truck.  I then stopped at Davis Glass Company and got the
shelves Mae ordered.  I stopped at Home Depot for more materials before going
home.  Jeff was at our place when I got there and the two of us brought the old
cabinet out and took the new one in.  Scott came by and tried to set up our TV
but wasn’t able to get sound out of it on regular TV channels.  Even Jeff tried
to help him but still no sound.  We were late getting to bed again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Another
busy day.  I worked for a couple of hours getting the new computer desk leveled
and solid.  Bryce came over to help us again today.  He and I got the shed
lowered of the blocks.  While we did that Mae took the old computer desk and
some other items to the D.I. in Ogden.  The three of us then went to the house
in Clinton and loaded items that we are going to store at Sandi’s.  We were
tired when we got finished that job.  I thanked Bryce for all his help and sent
him home.  Mae and I took a nap before continuing.  Mae went grocery shopping
while I started installing the dryer.  I found that the water to the washer was
leaking and I had quite a bit of water to mop up.  I then started to hook up
the dryer and found that it needed a 4 prong plug.  I had to go to Home Depot
for a new cord, plus some longer shelf brackets.  I was able to install the
glass shelves for Mae.  This allowed her to arrange more of her figurines
better in the cabinets with the glass doors.   Scott came back this evening and
set up our computer, for us.  I really like the new computer cabinet.  Grant
and Stacy also came by and Grant checked out our TV.  When he first turned the
TV on, he asked me, what is the problem?  I told him that last night after Jeff
got the wires all hooked up, there was no sound from the normal TV stations. 
He tuned in the standard TV channels and the volume worked perfectly.  I asked
him what he ahd done and he said that he just turned it on.  Even Scott came in
and asked what they had done wrong, because last night they couldn’t get the
sound to come on.  Anyway Grant also checked out other features of the TV and
made sure it was working ok.  I got the new Dryer cord installed and set up
before we quite for tonight.  It is now 11:30PM and we are going to bed.</p>

Mae and I slept well last night although I was quite stiff and sore through my
neck, shoulders and lower back.  Mae rubbed me quite well with the vibrator and
that helped.  I installed our shower head in our bathroom before taking my
shower and like the shower much better.  Mae prepared breakfast and then we
both got a few more things done.  I walked over to Jimmy’s and asked him about
storage space rental.  He said that he was sure that there was space available
but I would have to check with the office.  I feel that if we can get a unit to
rent it would be better than taking our thing out to Sandi’s basement.  We are
not sure how the budget will work out but Mae agreed to give it a try.  We went
out to Chelci and Steve’s for Thanksgiving Dinner.  We got there just in time
for me to carve the turkey and Mae helped make the gravy.  We really enjoyed a
wonderful dinner that Chelci and Sandi had prepared.  Of course Mae initially went
with the Great-grand Children to play with them.  The twins are growing so fast
and developing well, Jacob is even crawling and trying to get his feet to work
under him.  We feel so good with this little family.  After a wonderful dinner
I set down in a comfortable chair and soon fell asleep for over an hour. 
Chelci and Mae played as a team and Sandi and I in a game of Marbles.  At first
it looked like Chelci and Mae were really gaining an advantage but Sandi and I
ended up winning.  Sandi had a large Banana Squash that I friend gave to her so
she had me cut it up and the three of us shared it.  We got home about 7:30PM. 
I worked on my journal and worked on her talk.  We can both sit at the computer
desk and each work on our computer at the same time.  Mae made a suggestion
that will even improve the working area by adding a light on the inside top of
the cabinet.  I really like that suggestion.  Both Mae and I worked on our
talks for next Sunday.</p>

worked on the bookcases in the front room when Bryce and Kim came.  Kim had to
bring his car into Ogden to have some work done on it.  Kim stayed and to help
me move things out to Sandi’s but Bryce had other commitments and couldn’t help
today.  Scott and Kylan also help me.  We took Bishop Hatch’s trailer with all
the contents we had loaded into it on Wednesday, out to Sandi’s.  Scott used
his pickup to pull it but would not let me help with the gas.  He has sure been
a great helper with this move.  After getting back we left the trailer at the
Clinton home.  I brought my boat home with me and parked it in my area in the
storage lot.  Mae and I then met Roy, Linda, Irven, Sandy, Andrea, Mark and Bob
at the Golden Coral for dinner.  We had a very enjoyable time and after eating
we went to Irven and Sandy’s where we visited and played a game of Mormon
Bridge.  It was cute as Linda said that she didn’t like Mormon Bridge, but she
ended up winning the game.  We were sure tired when we got home and soon went
to bed.</p>

got up and got the trash out to the curb, with Mae’s help.  The lady across the
street was walking her dog, so I spoke to her.  Her name is Judy, but I don’t
remember her dog’s name.  She seems very lonely and liked having some to talk
to her for a few minutes.  I think we are going to find a lot of people in that
condition in this area.  Mae got breakfast ready and just before we finished
eating we had a couple, who lives across the street and north a few houses stop
in and introduce themselves to us.  We enjoyed visiting with them for a few
minutes.  They brought us some baked goodies and we enjoyed meeting them.  Mae
started some washing when she found that the water hoses were switched, so I
had to change those.  I got the Book Cases secured to the wall in the front
room.  They are now ready for Mae to put things in them.  I also added some
legs to the cabinet I had built for additional storage with the old computer
case, but now Mae will use it for other storage.  That is now ready to use.  We
left about 12:30PM for David and Shauna’s where most of our family assembled for
a get together and lunch.  Sandi and Shellie’s families were not there; also
Kylan didn’t come as he isn’t feeling well today.  Mae and I left about 4:30PM
and came home.  We both worked on our talks for tomorrow.  I tried to get our
home phone to work but it is not making connections some place.  I did catch my
journal up to date this evening.  I then work on my talk for tomorrow, finally
quitting at 11:10PM and going to bed.</p>
