<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
worked all day in the garage building a rear compartment cover for Randy’s
boat.  My stapler broke and so when I went to use it, it wouldn’t work.  I
believe that the last time I used it, it quite working then.  I have it ready
to inst the carpeting on it and then I will have to wait for the piano hinge to
get here to finish it.  That has been more of a job than I thought it would but
the main problem is the boat shape is not quite even.  It was almost 10PM when
we got to bed.</p>

got up at 7AM although I was up most of the night, not being able to sleep.  I
was trying to figure out how to fasten the carpet onto the boat cover without a
staple gun.  Mae and I went into the Ogden Temple and got on the 10:30 AM
Session.  The session was full even though the sisters out did the brothers
almost 3 to 1.  As we left the Temple to come home Mae realized that she had
left her purse in the temple locker.  We went back and they were able to find
it for her.  After coming home and having lunch Mae went shopping.  She went to
Arrow Fasteners and bought me a new Staple Gun.  Their goes any prophet in
doing that job.  Bob and I mowed the lawns.  While mowing the front parking I
noticed that the cover over the 2ndary water on Mike Lindstrom lot is
completely rotted away and very dangers if someone was to step on it.  I
pointed it out to him and told him that if he would get me three 2 x 6 and one
2 x 4, I would build him a cover for the junction box.  He went right down and
bought the boards and brought them to me.  It didn’t take very long and we had
it built and installed.  Mae got back with my new staple gun.  We got most of
the tools gathered up and out to the trailer.  At least Bob can park in the
garage tonight.  Mae and I brought the boat up and washed the seats and
vacuumed the carpet so that it is ready to take fishing tomorrow.  we and
dinner and while Mae got our pill boxes replenished I enter my journal entry
for the past two days.</p>

got up at 4:15AM and got ready to go fishing.  Brother and Sister Garf came
just before 5AM and we soon left to go fishing.  It was after 7AM when we got
to the Jordenal Reservoir and launched the boat.  It was a very nice day but
fishing wasn’t really good.  We tried flies but ended up going to pop-gear.  I
caught one chub which I throw back for the Sea Gulls to eat.  Ron caught one
nice rainbow and Mae caught two rainbow trout that we kept and one small fish
that we tried to release but it turned up and the Sea Gulls got it.  We were
most of the day and by the time we finished cleaning the fish it was after
5PM.  Mae and I came home by way of Weber Canyon to be away from the Salt Lake
traffic.  We stopped at Coal Ville and filled the pickup with gas and got us a
Sub-Way sandwich to eat on the way home.  We went directly to Jeff and Gail’s
where we tended the children this evening.  It was almost 11PM when we got
home. We were so tired that we soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in and got up just in time to watch the Saturday morning session of
General Conference.  It was very good.  I suggested to Mae that maybe we could
plan on one more fishing trip before putting the boat away for the year.  She
just said that we couldn’t afford to do it.  That did upset me but it is true. 
After that session I looked for my pump to winterize my boat with Anti-Freeze. 
I did some cleaning out of my storage shed with several things that I will send
to the Deseret Industries.  I did get some Anti-Freeze and added a fuel
stabilizer to the fuel.  By then it was time for the Afternoon Session of
General Conference.  I helped Mae get ready for the Garf’s to come for dinner
at 5PM.  They came a little early but that was ok.  We enjoyed having fried fish
for dinner.  We enjoyed their company and after eating we watched the
Priesthood Session of Conference, again enjoying the messages.  I love the
Gospel, have a strong testimony of the Restoration and the Prophet Joseph Smith
and of the Priesthood Leadership.  I do have a discouragement of my children
and the problems they are having.  When the session ended the Garf’s went
home.  Mae and I took showers and when I came back into the living room Mae had
picked a show on Netflix for us to watch.  The show was good but it left me
discouraged about the decisions that life has for us.  Mae was tired so I had
her got to bed and I stayed up working on my journal.</p>

turned on the TV and watched the end of the BYU and Utah State collages football
game.  Utah State won by 15 points. I then watched the last half of a western
show before I went to bed about 3AM.  We enjoyed sleeping in this morning. 
Both Mae and I slept until 9AM.  We got up in time to watch the Tabernacle
Choir and then watched the Sunday Morning Session of General Conference.  After
the conference session we took a nap and then watched the afternoon session.  I
was starting to work on my journal when Bob knocked.  He had gone to get him a
Whooper in West Roy but as he started to return he had a dizzy spell and had to
pull over.  We were glad that he was able to pull over and stop.  He thought of
using his medical alert but then waved his arm out the window and a young
couple saw him and turned around and when they found out what happened one
drove his car back home and the other followed.  That was very special of them
and I thanked them and they left.  I believe that it really scared Bob.  Mae
and I watched the Afternoon Session of Conference.  Later this evening we
watched a movie on Netflix before going to bed.</p>

After breakfast I started working on my boat and Camper getting them about
winterized and ready for storage.  David brought his boat over to store it here
as his boat wider than his garage door.  We will remove the tower from the boat
and then it will fit in my boat storage car port.  He will then put my boat in
his garage for storage.  Stacy came over and wanted to talk about the situation
with Bob.  I hope that we came up with some ideas.  The time sure went by fast
today but I guess I did get some things accomplished.  I was sure tired when I
came in for the evening.  Mae cooked a nice dinner.  She then folded clothing
and put it away, that she had washed today.  We watched a show on Netflix this
evening and enjoyed it even though we have seen it sometime ago, “Sleepless in
Seattle”.</p>

woke up depressed this morning.  I wanted to get Randy’s boat finished but
there were a lot of things that ties up time.  I had to take Bob over to the
Distribution Center, so he could buy himself some garments.  I got some work done
on Randy’s boat but still have more to do.  I gave up and quite working on the
boat for the night, when Robert and Patty came over about 4PM.  They have an
electronic unit to try on Bob.  Robert wanted me to try it also so that took
about an hour of my time.  Whether or not it did anything I don’t know.   I
haven’t used my hearing aids much today as they are bothering me too much.  We
were late eating dinner.  After dinner we both played some games on the
computer.  Mae read an e-mail that sure indicates the fall of the United States
as was designed by our Founding Fathers.  Satan sure must be laughing at our
Supreme Court with its liberal, treasonous Judges.</p>

worked on Randy’s boat.  Grand and Stacy came over to work with Bob.  After
they left Bob came down and asked me if I thought he should sale his car.  I
told him that I felt he should.  He said that wasn’t what he wanted to hear but
maybe he should.  Irven called with water problems and I told him where to look
for the pressure regulator.  That may need to be replaced.  This evening I met
with Morgan at his home.  Morgan also invited Vie and Tish Gram, plus Wayne and
Claudia Thompson to meet with us.  We talked over several options for the
dinner, everything from Turkey to Soup.  We still don’t know when we can have
it, but it will not be next week end.  I am sure tired this evening so after
getting home we soon went to bed.</p>

woke with a dream at 7:30AM that really put me in a depressed mood.  I remember
that Grandpa Hill found that when he started getting old and hard of hearing
that he couldn’t find employment.  That is what my dream was about except it was
me that now can’t find employment.  I am concerned but there isn’t much I can
do about it now.  I have thought about going to Lowe’s or Home Depot but just
the thought of it upsets me.  I don’t think I could do it.  Bob then called and
needs to go to the bank and then to Kmart where they will cut his toe nails. 
After breakfast I took him to those places.  I looked at Ace Hardware’s tools
and am thinking of buying some Craftsman tools.  I worked on Randy’s boat this
afternoon.  I also called Dr. Kody Kennington about my hearing aids.  They want
me to come back in.  Mae and I went in and I told him that these hearing aids
just weren’t working.  He wants me to try a different type of hearing aid
before I give up.  The cost will not increase and if they don’t work I will
still get my full refund back.  We decided to try that.  I finished Randy’s
boat except for putting the anti-freeze in it.  Mae went Visiting Teaching to
Jackie Provert this afternoon and had a good visit.  I also got my fishing
poles and equipment put away.  I was tired when I came in and just wanted to
quite.  Scott, Kylan and Kaitlyn came over to bring back my tiller.  They
stayed for a few minutes.  Mae and I watched the show “Fine Touch” and really
enjoyed it.</p>

breakfast.  I got Randy’s material and labor figured up for the work on his
boat.  We mowed the lawns today as they were getting bad.  Bob still uses the
rider mower and doesn’t seem to have any problems driving it.  Robert came out
this afternoon and gave Bob and I a treatment.  I don’t know if it is doing
anything are not.  This evening we took Bob with us and we attended Elwood
Stewart Johnston’s viewing.  We are glad that he was finally able to pass on. 
It has been a good experience to have known both Elwood and his wife Cleone. 
They were sure great and wonderful people.  Mae and I watched some TV before

put the cover onto my boat.  I then went over to Brother and Sister Barns and
helped them with their packing.  Brother Barker and Brother Campbell, along
with the Roger boys, also came over to help.  We worked until almost 10AM and I
came home so that I could get ready to attend Patriarch Johnston’s funeral. 
Mae had attended part of Rachael’s soccer game and a practice for Mat.  We
attended the funeral service.  When we got home David and his family was there
as we were going to get his boat inside of my canapé for the winter.  Scott,
Kylan and Kaitlyn also came over to help as we needed to take the tower off the
boat before it would fit under it.  We had plenty of good help and it went
well.  Mae prepared lunch for all of us.  After they left I went back over to
the Barn’s helping them.  We got most of the house hold belongings packed and
moved into a storage unit.  We also had more people come this afternoon to
help.  I came home at 6PM and we had some dinner and then went to Marge and
Morgan’s 50<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary.  Their family put on a very nice
program.  After getting home I filled out this entry, took a shower and then we
watched the show “The Willie and Martin Handcart Story” on DVD before going to

Leadership meeting.  Glen was already there when I got there but Morgan was
still in Ward Council meeting.  I conducted our Quorum meeting with Brother
Neiderhouser giving the lesson.  After priesthood meeting I came home and
brought Bob back to Sacrament meeting.  Following meeting I visited the Casey’s
and took them some vegetables.  I took our air mattress over to the Barn’s for
them to use for a couple of nights as last night they slept on some very thin
pads and was uncomfortable all night.  I also tried to get some help from some
in the ward to help me move a couple more pieces of furniture for the Barn’s. 
I visited with Sister Larsen before Sacrament meeting and she said that Dick
was quite sick.  I called Dick to see if he would like a Priesthood Blessing
but he declined.  I started typing an article for the Ward News Letter and then
we went up to David and Shauna’s to have dinner with their family.   We had a
wonderful dinner and then we played table games and visited for a while.  After
getting home I called Glen Higgley and he will come over tomorrow morning and
help me move David’s and my boats around to get them both inside the cover.  Mae
helped me with my article for the ward news letter and I will have to finish it
tomorrow.  I entered this entry into my journal before going to bed.</p>

Mae was able to sleep until 7AM.  David came down to help me put our boats
away.  Also Glen Higgley came over with his 4 wheeler and put my boat into the
cover.  The 4 wheeler is small enough that after pulling my boat into the
cover, he could continue through the cover and around the back side.  The boats
fit perfect under the cover.  We then used my pickup to pull David’s travel
trailer up to the front of the drive way where we then hooked it to David’s
pickup.  We have been unable to find the 2<sup>nd</sup> set of keys to Bob’s
car.  We were sure that we had both set of keys on the kitchen cabinet.  Stacy
E-mailed me the information on Carroll and Sherri’s death certificates that we
need to order new death certificates.  Time went by quickly as normal but we
did get most of what we wanted to done.  I went up to a shooting range above
Kaysville where I met David, Tyler &amp; Connor.  I sighted the Laser Sight in,
on my Beretta 9mm pistol.  David, Tyler &amp; Connor did some sighting on
David’s pistol and rifle.  I then came home and finished unloading a few items
out of my pickup.  Mae had most of them unloaded for me by the time I got
there.  I then went over to help the Barn’s with their packing.  There were
several that came and helped and by the time we finished most everything is
packed.  I can’t imagine that they will ever get all their items ever moved to
California.  I believe there will be a lot that will just stay in storage until
after their estate is settled.  After getting home after dark we ate dinner. 
We watched a show depicting the story of Ruth from the Old Testament, which we
really enjoyed.  I then watched the story of “The last stand of Custard at
Little Big Horn”, while Mae researched the candidates running for Political
positions and Constitution Amendments to the Utah State Constitution.  Mae has
really been busy today with Monday washing and working in the garden as well as
taking care of me.  She did find Bob’s car keys, in her purse.  She felt bad
about the keys but I was glad that I didn’t say much about it.  I sure don’t
have any room to criticize her but I sure do love her.</p>

filled it, getting back just before 10AM.  Mae then took Sister Olsen into
Ogden to a Doctors appointment.  I ate my breakfast then got some things ready
to take to the D.I.  After lunch we went over to Durk’s to see what I could
find to re-plumb our camper.   That didn’t work out.  We were going to take
some items to the D.I. but we tipped the grill over and broke it so we just
took stuff to the dumps.  We looked at some apartments for seniors and a
trailer park.  We decided to attend the movie “Meet the Mormons” so we stopped
and got some Harmon’s chicken that we ate before going to the movie.  After the
movie, which we liked, we stopped on the way home and got a frozen Yogurt.  After
getting home we watched a show on Netflix titled “What If”.  It was ok.</p>

disappointed at the trashy yards and streets there in Grantsville.  After the
Clogging class we went over and watch Dawson and Kennedy in their Karate
class.  It was fun watching them.  After getting home we ate and started
watching a show on Netflix but didn’t care for it so we changed and started
another show but got interrupted by Bob.  Mae went up to see the problem. 
Grant and Stacy were there and Mae was there for over an hour.  Grant and Stacy
had to take Bob into the hospital.</p>

I went to see the problem.  I had him call Grant as he knows what is
happening.  When grant got here he, Grant called the hospital and they gave him
instructions.  That seemed to solve the problem for the rest of the night. 
When we woke up at 7:30AM, Mae had already been up for 20 minutes.  Mike,
Becky, Middy and Jessie came about 10AM.  They visited and played games until
after 2PM.  We sure enjoyed having them here.  After lunch Mae and I went for a
walk.  We were sitting in the rocker swing when Bob came and wanted me to get
him a new electric raiser.  I gave him one that I had and then I took him to
Target where we bought him some replacement blades for the razor.  I worked on
my journal while Mae filled out some applications for Saint Marks Garden Senior
housing in Kaysville.  We watched a show on Netflix but got the wrong series. 
We watched “Left Behind II” and so we will have to watch “Left Behind” another
time.</p>

had to hurry in order to make it to my meeting and I wouldn’t have had
breakfast had it not been for Mae getting up and getting it for me.  Meetings
went well although I couldn’t hear much of the talks during Sacrament meeting. 
When we got home we had some lunch and then went Home teaching, visiting
Teaching to sister Fallis’s.  Our home teachers were at our place when we got
home.  I had told Bob but he didn’t remember and was looking for us.  After
they left I worked on my article for the Ward newspaper, that I should have had
in last Sunday.  I did some chasing this afternoon and then we went over to
Jeff and Gail’s.  We enjoyed playing games with Jeff, Gail and Marcy.  It was
late when we got home.  Grant and Stacy are getting quite upset with Bob, but
sometimes I am afraid that they are not understanding of old people.  Before
going to bed we got laughing about old age as we figured that laughing was
better than crying.</p>

appointment to look at a trailer home in Roy at 10AM.  We decided to eat a
light breakfast now and then go out to eat lunch in between looking at the one
unit and then looking at another in the same trailer court.  We are quite
impressed with the first trailer home but the 2<sup>nd</sup> is much nicer.  It
is also almost three times the price.  We went to Denny’s to eat lunch and sure
enjoyed that.  We got talking about what we should do and I suggested that we
go on another mission.  Mae isn’t too pronged about that.  I would like to
serve another mission but maybe I am just trying to get out of all the
decisions and problems that are around us right now.  I sure don’t know what we
should do.  The Larsen’s were going to come over and have dinner with us but
they are not feeling well so called and backed out.  Grant and Stacy came by
and we visited for a while.  I don’t know if that will help them or not.  I do
feel that it is wrong for the rest of Bob’s children to stand back and let Grant
and Stacy carry the load.  Mae and I watched a movie on TV this evening before
going to bed.</p>

about looking at the mobile home.  I feel that we should clean up my tool
trailer and try to sell it, along with most of the tools.  Maybe try to sell
the camper.  Bob came down at nine and the first thing he said was “Well, it’s
about time you got up”.  That really didn’t set with me.  He wanted me to take
his car over to Dee’s Service before 8:00 am to have it serviced.  After eating
I went to the tool trailer and started designing a jig to cut plywood circles
for Sandi.  Bob again came down quite upset that I hadn’t taken the car to
Dee’s.  I quite what I was doing and took the car over to Dee’s.  After
returning home and while eating our lunch, we discussed selling our car and
buying Bob’s.  I went to the Bank and deposited my check from Randy.  I also
asked about getting an estimate on the price of the trailer house we looked at
yesterday.  We would have to go through an appraiser for that.  I also asked
about what we could expect if we sold our car.  That doesn’t sound very good
but we would have to talk to the dealer as to what they could do for us.  I
went to Lowe’s and bought materials to make Sandi’s bases for Christmas
wreaths.  I designed a jig that will hold the router and cut circles out of
plywood.  I cut 4, 4ft circles and 4, 3 ½ ft circles.  It was late when I
finished and got things put away.  Mae and I ate dinner and then watched the
movie “Left Behind”.  We then got ready and went to bed.</p>

cereal, a package of mixed vegetables and a carton of sea salt.  I bought a
couple of items but that is what he was in such a hurry to come out for.  We
went into Dr. Kennington’s for my hearing aids and got the new ones.  We hope
these hearing aids work better.  From there we went to the Ogden Temple where
we did an Endowment session.  On the way home we stopped at the Monta Vista
trailer park and visited with the management.  We also looked at two other
trailers for sale but weren’t impressed with them.  We are still trying to
decide which direction we are going with life.  I would like to go on another

Grant and Stacy came and took him into the Doctor.  When they came back, the
Doctor had put him on oxygen.  They sent him home with a small tank and soon a
hospital supply co. came with a machine and several tanks of oxygen.  He is to
be on oxygen 24 hours a day.  Most of the day was spent either getting things
set up for Bob or discussing what cares he will need.  I went to Burger King
and bought Bob a Whooper for his dinner.  I started painting the wooden rings
that I had cut out for Sandi.  This evening Mae and I went over for dinner at
Ron and Dian Graf’s.  It was a very nice dinner and we enjoyed the evening for
a couple of hours.  Grant and Stacy were here when we returned so I went up to
see if everything was ok.  They had brought him some dinner and they had also
bought him some garments and some pants.  I finished this entry and we soon

house cleaning.  I discussed some of the situations that are taking place with
Bob and the help it take to care for him.  That went into more than I had
planned.  After Grant and Stacy returned with Bob there were more discussions. 
I did get the wooden rings painted for Sandi.  This afternoon Mae took Bob to
an appointment with Dr. Toone.  I brought Bob’s car back home, then I tried to
find information concerning the shingles on the mobile home we are looking at. 
That was quite a merry-go-round but I did find a place that can test the
shingles for asbestos content.  I took Grant and Stacy to the Ogden Airport at
4:45PM.  They will be gone on a short vacation.  Mae also got a treatment from
Dr. Toone when she took Bob there.  I started mowing the lawn this afternoon and
got the front and side lawn’s mowed before it got dark.  Mae worked in the
garden getting about the last of the harvest in.  She also cleaned the camper
so it is ready to show if we can get anyone interested in buying it.  In my
checking for information about the Mobile Home in Roy I called Carson Mobile
Home in Layton and this evening we got an E-mail concerning a unit in
Taylorville that looks very interesting.  Bob wanted me to find someone and
give him a blessing to night.  As it is almost 10PM I ask if he could wait
until morning.  That didn’t make him happy but he wouldn’t tell me what is
wrong.  I hope I am making the right decision but I am going to wait until
morning.</p>

checked with Bob first thing about him wanting a blessing.  He doesn’t want one
today.  Today was a busy day.  Mae and I finished mowing the lawns today.  I
got things ready to go out to Sandi’s.  I got a call from Clayton Mobil Homes
this morning telling us that they have a 2009 three bedroom unit for sale for
$35,000.  We stopped over to talk to them about the home.  Ashley, the
salesperson told us how nice it was and that the area in which the unit was
located was 18 or over and very nice.  We drove over and the unit is much
smaller than the one in Roy, the area is a mess and we saw children out side of
the home next door and asked them if they were visiting or did they live
there.  They told us that they lived there.  We just left and went out to
Sandi’s.  It was quite a job getting the water valve replaced.  The first thing
that went wrong as I started repairing Sandi’s water supply line was that I had
to shut the water off at the meter.  When I opened the lid the water was at the
top of the concrete meter box.  In order to shut the water off I had to first
siphon the water out.  In doing this I dropped my cell phone into the water.  I
was able to catch it before it sunk out of sight but water got into the phone
and it would no longer work.  Mae remembered of reading an article on the
E-mail telling you that if your cell phone fell in water, remove the battery and
put the phone in a zip lock baggie filled with uncooked rice and leave for 24
hours.  We did this.  The next problem was that I could not get the water
drained out of the pipe enough that the heated pipe would cause the water to
heat, allowing the steam to enter the fitting to be soldered, causing the ceil
to fail.  I used a trick taught to me years ago and stuffed bread into the pipe
to hold the water back from the fitting.  When the fitting is soldered, you
then flush out the bread before letting the water carry the bread into other
areas.  It worked and I got the valve replaced.  It was late when we got home
and then Bob wanted us to get him some milk.  We drove back to the Maverick
store and got some milk and a Frozen Yogurt.  After getting home we watched a
show on TV before showering and going to bed.</p>

to do about our own living circumstances.  We are leaning very much towards
purchasing the Trailer Home in Mont Vista Trailer Park in north Roy.  This

groceries.  After getting home I called and visited with Roy and Linda.  We
found it very interesting that they invited us to come and live with them, when
I told them that we may be forced to evacuate this home.  Their home is also on
a Reversed Mortgage and Roy is older and in pourer health than I am.  I got
some tools picked up and we went over to the trailer court and did an
inspection of the trailer.  I measured the roof and got a sample to have
tested.  We visited with the park management and got an application to rent in
the court.  They do a back ground check of all candidates for residency.  We
also gave the owners of the trailer, Bruce and Loreen Wolfley a check for $500
to hold the trailer until we got everything checked out.  I did a little around
home after returning.  Mae and I watched a show on Netflix that was quite

Jackie Probert to help her and I went to Salt Lake to take a shingle sample to
Dixon Information Inc.  They ran Lab testing on the Sample and sent me a report
that there is no Asbestos in the sample.  I was quite sure of that but I wanted
to be 100% sure before we purchased the Mobil Home.  After getting home I
visited with Bob and he indicated that he wanted us to have someplace to go
before he died or was taken to a care center.  That was good to hear as now we
can go ahead with our plans.  This evening I took some of our left over chicken
feed and egg cartons over to Brother Child and gave it to him for 2 dozen
eggs.  I visited with Mike Linstrom, next door, about the possibility of him
buying a home in the Monte Vista Park.  This evening we worked on paper work
for applications to the park.  We did come up with some concerns about park
policies.  We will have to check on these items.  It is late and we have an

him that they felt sure that we were going to buy the home.  When the Bishop
said that he was praying that we would, Bruce said “You had better be as Ken

certainly serve where ever I am called but I am a long ways from being Bishop Material! 
Mae woke and came out about 7AM.  After breakfast both Mae and I went to an
annual appointment with the eye doctor.  Neither of us has had enough change to

rent in the park.  I took Mae home and then I went down to Dr. Toone’s and got
a treatment.  This evening Mae tended Scott and Mishelle’s twins while they

had to drain all the water line in the house and re-solder the water line.  I
then looked at their bedroom bath sink.  Someone has dropped something into the
sink and chipped the surface near the drain.  As a result the drain drips water
under neigh the sink.  That will take some cleaning up from the caulk that had
been used to try so seal the drain and then trying to seal the drain with plumber’s
putty.  It may take a new sink replacement.  I will have to try that another
time.  After returning home I checked on renting a trailer to haul my shed over
to the trailer court.  I think I will have to remove a section of fence between
our fence and Mike Linstrom’s and pull the trailer through Mike’s place.  I
helped Mae start the cleaning of the shed.  After dinner this evening I made up

was after noon before he again agreed to look at assisted living.  Mae spent
most of the day cleaning and preparing for us to move.  I had trouble really
keeping focus but ended up getting quite a lot done in cleaning up my tool
trailer.  Mae was able to keep busy but she spent quite a while talking with
Shellie.  Shellie and Roy are having a lot of difficulty in their marriage. 
Most of the problem seems to stems from Roy being over bearing with his sex
desires.  I have to wonder if this marriage will yet last.  As I cleaned my
tool trailer I became quite emotional with the thoughts of selling all my
tools.  Mae suggested that we use most of the storage shed to put my tools in
there.  We will have to see how this works out.  Mae made South Western Chicken
