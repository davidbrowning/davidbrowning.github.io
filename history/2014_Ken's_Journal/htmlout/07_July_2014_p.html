<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke still with a lot of pain especially in my lower back.  Mae decided that I
should get a treatment from Dr. Toone.  Bob took me too bountiful where Dr.
Toone adjusted my back.  It was out quite a bit.  I was given instructions to
put ice packs on my back for 15 minutes, once an hour and to take it easy, but
not to sit in a soft chair for a few days.  Bob brought me back to Clearfield
where Mae and I have appointments with Jennie Porter.  Mae was about through
when I got there.  She is doing quite a bit better since our last visit.  When
Jennie began to check me, she found that I am much worse since out last visit. 
I am not sure just how accurate these test are but I was sure tired when we
finished and came home.  I went right to bed and followed directions by both
Dr. Toone and Jennie.  I am not sure just how we are going to get all that we
need done before we have all our family here on the 9<sup>th</sup>.  I ether
slept or watched TV the remainder of the day.  After getting out of bed, I used
our office chair to set in.  Mae picked the rest of the peas so I helped her
shell them as we watched a show.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early this morning.  I have spent some time on my knees seeking
forgiveness for my many failures.  My greatest failure is with my family.  I am
not sure just where or how I failed but it seems to be in many ways.  I felt
that if I loved their mother, tried to set a proper example, got especially my
sons to be worthy and serve missions, and taught them how to work and be honest
in their dealings with others, they would respond to richness.  I have always
tried to be honest in all my dealings.  In my work I have always tried to give
an honest day’s work trying to fulfill my responsibility the very best that I could. 
I look back at my many jobs and I have tried to figure out where I failed in
each of them.  I fear that, that may have also caused the failure with my
children.  We have moved way to many times because of failure with my
employment.  As Jennie said yesterday, referring to my health reserves, I am
bankrupt.  I couldn’t help but think, that’s not the only place where I’m
bankrupt.  All these moves have also caused me to fail in my Church callings
and to fail financially.  I was once told that 3 moves were equal to a burn
out.  I guess that I have had several burn outs and now I am afraid of the cost
I have caused.  I am now broke financially, and it looks like I am broke with
my health.  I just hope I can hang on spiritually.  </p>

got up early and met Bryce at his home at 9AM.  From there Bryce went with us
to a lady that he has met that read the eyes and uses Chinese Reflexology to
determine your body needs.  We took with us all of the supplements that I am
presently taking.  When she had completed testing each dietary supplement,
rejecting a couple for right now and changing the dosage of a couple others,
she said my biggest need was more water.  I was impressed with her abilities. 
I am willing to follow her recommendation.  We took Bryce back to his home.  Then
Mae and I went into Ogden shopping at Costco.  After getting a few items there
we stopped at the health store, then got gas for the car and then Mae got some
groceries at Winco, while I stayed in the car to keep the car running and
keeping the foods in the car cool.  After we got home Jeff came to borrow our
picnic tables.  They wouldn’t fit in his car so we put them in the pickup and
we will take them to Jeff’s before Ben’s baptismal on Saturday.  Before going
to bed this evening Mae and I watched a movie on CD.</p>

woke about 7AM.  Today hasn’t been a very good day for me.  I have been quite
depressed most of the day.  Mae worked on the computer most of the day.  I
tried to draw some plans for a chicken feeder, for Irven’s daughter but my mind
just wouldn’t think very well.  Bob went with me to get some hardwood to
rebuild the TV cabinet.  The oak 4’ X 8’ X ¾” was very expensive. I checked the
price of a ½ sheet and it only saved me under $15.00 so I bought the full
sheet.   I watched a show on TV with Bob.  That gave Mae some time to work on
her projects.  This evening we went to the symphony concert held at the Layton
Park.  Scott’s family joined us there.  That </p>

woke at 4AM with a sore throat and after doctoring up slept the rest of the
night in the recliner.  Mae prepared a very nice breakfast of hot cakes and
eggs.  Although I enjoyed the breakfast I really didn’t feel well.  Mae wanted
me to take a nap but I had to make some calls about Home Teaching visits
first.  I then lay down and slept until time to go to our Grandson’s, Benjamin
David Browning’s Baptism.  Scott and Mishelle had a wedding they needed to
attend so we took Kylan and Ashley with us.  Both of Ben’s Grandmothers gave
talks, Mae’s talk was on Baptism and Marcy’s was on Confirmation and the Holy
Ghost.  I had the privilege of performing the Baptism and Confirmation.  The
services were very beautiful and went very well but the thing that impressed me
the most was the great Family support, from both sides, that was there. 
Following the service, everyone was invited to Jeff and Gail’s for a luncheon. 
I felt it went perfect almost perfect and would have been perfect if Jeff David
and Nick could have participated.  After coming home I wrote this entry,
doctored up again and we went to bed.  Time quickly flew by and it was soon
time for bed.  I am fighting a sore throat that seems to be getting worse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
had a hard time getting up this morning but finally did.  I attended my early
leadership meeting but questioned what good we accomplished.  I guess I just
didn’t feel very well.  Meetings went well but I really had a hard time hearing
most of what was said.  Some voices I seem to hear well but then others I miss
most of what they say.  When we came home we decided that we would lie down for
a while but Bob called down and said that he had chicken about ready for
dinner.  We went up there and he did have some nice chicken.  Kathy came up to
see her Dad and did join us for lunch.  We enjoyed visiting with her.  When we
finished eating, Mae cleaned up and then we came downstairs and I took a nap. 
She was going to lie down but Jeff called to see if we were home, but then he
was later coming home.  When he came I got up and he helped me unload the
tables and put them away.  He talked to Mae about the TV cabinet I am
remodeling and helped Mae see that our plans were really not what she would
like.  When I came out Mae told me what they had talked about and I agreed, so
tomorrow I will return the material and then we will look for something else.  We
are tending David’s dog, Davinci for them this evening and tomorrow while
David, Tyler, Connor   and Mike go fishing on the Green River.  When it started
to cool down this evening we went for a walk, taking Davinci with us.  We had a
little to eat for the evening meal and then we worked on the computers for a
while.  As it started getting later, we could hear fireworks being set off. 
The sound really terrified Davinci so we waited until 11:45PM to take him out. 
He just started to go when some fireworks went off and sent him terrified to
the house.  He did make a couple of messes in the house, so that wasn’t
pleasant to clean up.  Time went fast and we didn’t get to bed until mid-night.</p>

slept in this morning and were slow starting.  I worked quite a while on
getting the rules typed up for the game of “Hand &amp; Foot”.  That is a game
that Jeff and Gail taught us, then on our Lake Tahoe trip Sandi and Nick
brought the game but had a few difference in the rules, so we wanted to have a
set of rules of our own.  We returned the Oak plywood and did a little shopping
this afternoon.  I checked the plants in our garden and Earwigs completely
killed one squash plant and are working on other plants.  I mixed some Diazinon
and sprayed some of the plants, hoping to save part of our garden.  I also
reset some traps.  Maybe between the two it will slow them down.  I then
started picking green peas.  This is about the last of them.  David and Connor
came about 8PM to get there dog.  We were not sad to see him gone.  I am just
not fond of having pets in the house.  I tried to get Mae to go to bed early
but it was still almost 10PM before she went to bed.  I stayed up and entered
this entry, then took a shower before going to bed.  While showering I washed
down the shower drapes for Mae.  It was after mid-night when I got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was up 2 or 3 times during the night so slept in the recliner until Mae got
up.  She did lay down with me for a few minutes but soon got up as she wanted
to work in the garden before it got hot.  I got up also and helped in the
garden.  The earwigs are really eating the plants up.  Mae thinned the carrots
while I thinned the beets.  We cut the spinach and the chard down.  We also cut
some lettuce.  We planned on trying to save some of the Spinach and Chard but
we quite to get some breakfast and when we came out the heat of the day already
got hot and the greens were shriveled.  We did save most of the lettuce but it
was full of earwigs.  We put it in one side of the kitchen sink with water.  On
the other side of the sink we added a couple of inches of water with soap.  As
the earwigs would swim to the surface I would pick them up with a spoon and put
them in the soapy water and that kills them pretty fast.  I the washed all the
lettuce and picked out the leaves that showed damage.  We saved most of the
lettuce.  While I was working on the lettuce Mae went upstairs and gave Bob a
haircut.  She had me come up and look at Bob’s head and he is not washing his
hair and scalp good enough.  I talked to him and he said that he can’t get his
arms up to wash the top of his head.  I showed him how to by using his kitchen
sink, putting his elbows on the cabnet and leaning over he could wash his head
that way.  I hope he will try.  I then washed the carrots and we got quite a
lot of small carrots from the thinning.  We got some beets from that thinning
but are not sure what we will do with them as I can’t eat pickled beets and we
have never tried doing them any other way.  We are also trying to get ready for
our family to come this week end.  Mae cleaned and moped upstairs as Bob isn’t
a very good house keeper.  She didn’t want any of the kids to go up and see the
house that dirty.  My back is hurting quite a lot tonight.  That sure worries
as we are afraid that it may be a bulged disk in my lower back.  At 11AM I had
Bob follow me to Dee’s Auto Shop where I left my pickup to have the AC
charged.  I also stopped at the School Bus shop and talked to Rosa concerning
my health and the possibility of not driving any more.  She wants me to let
them know by the 5<sup>th</sup> of Aug and if I am going to try to drive I will
have to have a letter from a Doctor stating that I am able to drive a school
bus.  David told me the other day that if he was my Doctor, he would not sign
such a letter.  It’s now after 9PM so I think we will take showers and go to
bed.  We are booth tire as we have gone most of the day.  Mae cooked some of
the beets, peeled then and we ate one, they are not bad eating with a little
seasoning.  It was 11PM before we got to bed.</p>

last long.  I took some pain pills but that didn’t do much.  Mae woke about 4AM
and got me a ice pack.  That seem to help and I did slept for a couple of
hours.  Mae slept in the recliner so I could try sleeping again in the bed.  We
both got some more sleep.  I still woke up before 7AM and went to the sun room
and lay out there.  Bob took me to see Dr. Toone about 9:30 AM and that did
help.  I asked him about the possibility of a budged disk.  He said that it
could be but a budged disk would not show on an X-ray.  He said that I would
need to have cat-scan.  He also said that if I was to have surgery on my spine
it should be done by a neurosurgeon.  On the way home I called Dee’s and he has
my pick-up done.  Bob took me there and I drove the pickup home.  Dee only
charged me for the Freon charge and suggested that it is cheaper to just get it
charged when it quits working as the truck isn’t worth a compressor overhaul.

to prepare the Dutch ovens but needed Sandi’s.  She let us know she was on the
way.  A short while later she called to tell me that she had just blown a tire
on the trailer.  She was on the Legacy Highway by Bountiful.   A young man
stopped and helped her.  I had Shellie and Mae drive to help her but the young
man drove her to Bountiful where she bought new tires for the trailer.  Mae and
Shellie got the stove and Dutch and brought it back to me.  I had all the chicken
browned with part of it in the kitchen oven as I only the two ovens Dutch
ovens.  They got back just as I was starting to load the vegetables in with the
chicken.  I was sure busy without having Mae or anyone else to help me.  As it
was they got back just in time and I was able to get the three ovens going.  It
turned out to be a very good meal.  Mike and Becky didn’t come but Becky
brought Maddi and Jessie and met Jeff in Salt Lake and he brought them on. 
Mike is still sick but hopes to join us tomorrow.  It was interesting getting
everyone’s campers set up, as well as cleaning up the Dutch ovens and help set
up a screen and outdoor projector so that we could watch a movie tonight.  I

water skiing at one of the lakes or going to a water park but they all wanted
to continue visit and playing games.  The little ones played constantly in the
pool plus we had water balloons and water guns so they were having fun all
day.  Scott and Mishelle provided the evening meal of spaghetti with homemade
rolls.  Having the portable toilet was a help plus we went through lots of
water and cups but it was a great day.  David and Sierra came for a while this

appointment.  When we went to drive the car, I realized that somehow I had lost
the key pad to the car.  Dr. Lee advised us that we do not get the MRI test at
this time but continue to use the original prescriptions as often as I need
especially if I do not have to take more than 1 a day or less.  At this time I am
sometimes using 1 or 2 pills per week and often no any.  He said that getting
an MRI would probably cost over $1500 and then surgery could cause greater
problems than I now have.  We asked him about using steroids to try to clear up
my hearing problem and he said that our body already produces steroids to heal
itself.  He felt that the chance of danger from receiving additional steroids
under a Doctor’s care would be very minable at to the help it might give to
maintain needed mobility.  I decided to follow his advice.  We went out to eat
lunch at Golden Corral.  After lunch we filled up the car with gas, got the car
washed, then went to Wal-Mart to get a comb and a hair pick.  While there we
saw a TV on Sale that looked pretty good.  We also found a stand for it that
would fit our needs at a fair price.  We came home and took a nap.  At 5PM Gail
brought the children over for us to tend this evening.  I went up stairs and
watched a show “36 Hours” that Bob had recorded.  It was very good.  I had
called Grant to ask him about the TV and he said that it sounded like it might
be a good price but he needed more information to check it out for me.  Bob and
I drove down to Wal-Mart and got the additional information and I called back to
Grant.  He checked it out and said that it was a year old model and that was
not a good price.  He gave me a better price on a new model, a “Smart TV”
instead of a “HDTV” and a 4 year warranty instead of a 3 year and the cost is
almost the same with his discount that he is giving us.  I am sure glad that I
talked to him.  Mae got the children down to bed and I entered this journal
entry.  It is now 10:30 so we will go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
the children got up we had breakfast.  Gale didn’t come to get the children
until after 10AM.  We then went to Wal-Mart to get the TV stand.  That took
quite a while to find one at another store as this one didn’t have one except
the display model.  Even when they located one at the Syracuse store it took us
well over 45 minutes to get that one.  We then went to R.C. Willies where we
bought the TV through Grant.  Grant called us to see if we had got it ok, but
we were just leaving Wal-Mart then.  He and Stacy had taken Bob to the V.A.
Hospital for his appointment.  They still got Bob home and left before we got
back.  When we got home we got the stand and TV into the house.  We had some
lunch and just started assembling the stand when they came back and helped me. 
By the time we got the stand assembled and the TV mounted it was evening.  They
then stayed and Grant got the TV hooked up and programmed.  That is the part
that I really needed his help.  Mae prepared some dinner for us and after
eating Grant still worked on the TV some more.  It was 8:30PM before finished
and they went home.  We sure did appreciate what he did for us.  Mae and I
watched a show “Heaven Will Waite” on Netflix.  It was a very cute show.  We
were late getting to sleep.</p>

came over to my place at 5AM.  I was about ready and we left for East Canyon
Reservoir with a stop to fill the pickup and boat with gas.  We got up to the
reservoir just as the sun was coming up.  We both caught a fish within a few
minutes of fishing.  We lost a lot of fish before we got them into the boat but
still had our limits before 11AM.  When we loaded the boat onto the trailer
Gail’s Brother Eric was loading their boat.  He waded over and helped me winch
my boat on to the trailer.  I was glad that he recognized me and came over and
it was special for him to help me.  Ron and I wiped down the boat and then
cleaned and filet the fish.  On the way home we stopped at the county land fill
and unloaded some trash from my truck.  It has been a good day fishing and Ron
seemed to really enjoy it.  I got the fish packaged and in the freezer.  Mae
and I then took a nap.  This evening we went to Cherry Hills where we met Jeff
and his family, Eric and his son Landon and Gail’s mother.  We played a game of
miniature golf.  We then went to a band concert.  However Matt got sick to his
stomach and so Jeff, Gail and their family left and took him home.  We stayed
for about an hour before we came home.  I sure have a wonderful wife and sweet

breakfast we worked in the garden for a while.  We are sure having a hard time
saving out squash plants.  We decided to remove the Vis Queen from under the
squash plants and see if that might help.  When I pull up the dried up plants
the roots seem to be covered with earwigs.  I worked on Sandi’s tent trailer
but somewhere I seen to have an electrical short.  I will have to search
further to find the problem.  Mae and I went into Ogden to Good Earth health
store for a few things.  We then drove out to Bryce and Deanna’s where we
visited and played games.  It was almost 11PM when we got home so I soon went
to bed.  Mae stayed up and studded her Primary lesson as there was a message on
our phone when we got home telling her that the Sister that shares her class
with her is recovering from an operation and will not be there tomorrow.</p>

When we got home we had dinner and then took a nap.  We went over to the Ward
that is the last Ward to hold meeting in our building as we understood the
Sister Lesley Fallis was going to be playing her violin in between the
speakers.  Jeannine sister was speaking when we got there.  In her talk she
gave a story of her Great Grandfather while he was on a mission in the Southern
States.  I have heard that story before, I believe while I lived in Victor
Idaho.  I wonder how that is related?  After her talk the special musical
number was from a sister but not Sister Fallis.  Later Mae got a call from
Sister Fallis and she had the wrong information but she did perform at the
Chapel on 800 North.  This evening we went upstairs and watched the show “The
Lost Valentine”.  It was a very good show.   We then came back downstairs where
Mae wrote a E-mail to Kim and Jeanenne.  While she did that I tried to
experiment with our new TV and ended up watching a show on BTU-TV.  It was a
sequence of Blubber one; Blubber two.  It was about as dumb as Blubber one.  I
worked on the rules for the Hand &amp; Foot game while Mae finished her
letter.  It was mid-night when we went to bed.</p>

good.  I got things ready to go fishing with Kylan, Ashley and Connor in the
morning.  We got some Neem Oil and I sprayed most of the garden.  I hope this

the lake at 7:30AM and had our limits by 8:45AM.  With Connor not having a
license yet he had to fish off my license.  That was ok but it limited us to 8
fish.  I let each of them catch a fish and then we started trading positions
each time someone caught a fish.  When we had our eight fish, each of them
caught 3 and I caught 2.  We cleaned and filet the fish and then came home.  I
laid down to take a nap and just got to sleep when Stacy text me.  She sure
makes long text so I just called her.  I watched the show “Mc Clintoc” with
John Wayne.  After it cooled down I cleaned up my boat and then put the cover
on it.  Mae worked on the garden and picked some things.  I sprayed more Neem
Oil on some of the garden.  I am not sure just what we need to do with the
garden.  I think bugs are getting the most of it.  I am tired so I will go

both slept fairly well last night and woke just before 8AM.  I prepared
breakfast and after eating I went out and did some spraying for insects.  I
then prepared the sprayer for using roundup on the weeds.  I went over to Dr.
Gray’s and got there at 11AM.  We had made a mistake and I wasn’t due until
11:45AM.  I read the Ensign while I waited.  When Dr. Gray looked at my tooth,
we talked it over and decided to just sand off some edges so it didn’t cause
sores in my mouth from rubbing on a sharp edge but not to take further action
at this time.  When I went to pay, he didn’t charge me for this one.  Mae and I
looked at Kay’s Crossing apartments in Layton to see what they leased for. 
They look nice but we would cost us about 1,250 a month.  Without me working
that would be a little steep for us.  We went to the Layton Mall to see about
Century Link, but we couldn’t find them.  We went to the store for a few items
and back home.  We watched a cute show Netflix.  That is one of the good
features on our new TV.  About the time that it cooled off and I was going to
go out and do some spraying, it started raining.  It rained quite hard, let up,
rained again, let up and rained hard the third time.  I gave up and was going
to go to bed but Mae needed a couple of items so I went to the store with her. 
She wanted one item from one store and the other item from another store.  I
suggested that I got into the Dollar store for the one and she go to the
grocery store for the other.  That way it would be much faster.  Well I got my
items but when I got to the car Mae wasn’t there.  I checked the other store
but couldn’t find her so I went back to the car.  I didn’t have my phone with
me so I couldn’t call her.  I waited several minutes before she came with
several items she thought of at the last minutes.  We then went to the Maverick
station to get some frozen yogurt but their machines were empty.  After getting
home I started entering my journal.  We changed our phone number to our home
phone today but it wouldn’t work.  We called Comcast to report the problem and
the first thing they had me do was reset our modem.  The phone lights were off
and after resetting the modem they still were off.  I recalled and this time
they were able to correct the problem.  I decided to re-check the internet
connection and found that the internet switch was off on the keyboard.  I hope
I remember that problem the next time we have internet problems.  Well it is
now 10PM and I am getting up early to pickup Morgan and the two of us are going
to weed our Wards onion rows at the Stake Farm.</p>

and having breakfast we watched part of the parade on TV.  We then got ready to
have most of the children over for a barbeque this evening.  We had all of the

out and help me but that became confusing with Bob and my hearing problems, so
I gave that up for now.  This evening Mae and I went over to the Steep Park in

decided that I will have to take it in.  I drew a 10 foot picture of Goliath
for Mae to use in her lesson tomorrow.  Bob and I set down and watched a show
on Netflix until almost 7pm when Mae wanted us to go to Jeff and Gail’s.  I can
turn it back on later to see the ending.  We enjoyed playing games with Jeff

the Picture of Goliath that we had rolled up.  I filed a string on it so when
she wanted the picture displayed she could pull the string and it would unroll. 
After her class was over I asked her if it worked ok and how the children like
it.  She said the picture unrolled perfectly and the children were amazed at
the size of Goliath.  It was a good teaching aid.  Mae and I was going to go
Home Teaching and Visiting teaching after Church but Sister Fallis called and

got under the trailer but still could not see what I am doing wrong.  After
talking to Sandi and told her that I made an appointment to take the trailer
into Arvs on Thursday at 1PM.  She wants to find out if the campsite at Zion’s
has electrical hook up or not.  Mae worked in the garden this morning.  She
went to get her hair done at 2PM.  The strawberries that she had picked were
still in the sink so I took the stems off and put them on a cookie sheet and
put them in the freezer.  I picked what plumbs that were still on the tree.  I
also checked out the dishwasher and it seems to be working ok.  Mae called me
on her way home to let me know that she was stopping to get some chicken for us
to eat this evening.  I asked her about the hook ups at Zion’s and she said
that they do have electrical.  I called Sandi and she wants me to cancel the
appointment to have the shop look at the trailer for now.  Mae got home from

capsules while Mae read from the book “Precious Cargo”, written by Jean
Holbrook Mathews.  This has been a very interesting story that takes place in
the Philippines.  Sister Wanda Miller loaned it to Mae as she thought that
since we served a mission in the Philippines we would find it especially
interesting.  We really did enjoy the story and it did bring back many memories
of our time there.  Mae got an e-mail off to Georgia, letting her know what her
