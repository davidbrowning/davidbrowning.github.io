woke up at 2:45am worrying if the alarm was going to go off to wake me so I
could take my 3am medication.  After that I couldn’t go back to sleep so I
worked on my Diary.  At 6am I went back to sleep until almost 9am.  I watched
the last part of two TV shows.  Mae has been busy since about 8AM with the
garden, fixing breakfast, preparing for our children to come and washing chard
from our garden.  I got up and packaged the chard for her as well as
seal-a-meal frozen strawberries.  I wasn’t up long and my leg began to hurt
again.  I set down and worked on my journal and Diary.  This afternoon our four
boys and their families came over to have a Labor Day barbeque, family get
together and to play games.  Scott and Kylan helped me put the camper onto the
truck.  The boys, with Mae’s directions got the games, tables and volley ball
net up.  They also cooked all the meat.  I mainly just set around and ate.  It
was a fun afternoon and evening.</p>

was up at 3am to take my pills but went right back to sleep.  We didn’t get up
after 8am.  I worked on my diary quite a bit today.  After lunch I worked on
the camper, repairing the electrical plug in.  Mae cleaned and straitened the
inside of the camper, getting it ready for our trip this weekend.  I worked
more on my diary after getting the hookup from the camper to the pickup
repaired.  This evening Mae and I watched a show on Netflix before going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke before 3AM and stayed up a few minutes before taking my 3AM medication.  I
see improvement in my leg almost daily.  We didn’t get up until almost 9am.  I
helped Mae prepare breakfast.  I would really like to take my boat and go
fishing but I am afraid that there are too many other things in the planning,
plus we don’t have much money.  It discourages me to think that we can spend
$4,000 for these hearing aids, that I am not sure are really helping.  Mae got
work that Sister La Rae Karboski is being put into a Nursing Home.  I hope it
works for her.  Mae is out in the garden picking strawberries and weeding.  Bob
and I got out and mowed the lawns; Mae then came out and trimmed the edges.  I
was sure tired by the time we finished.  Brother and Sister Saunders came over
at 2PM and Mae helped them with Family History.  I put my leg up and fell
asleep.  Sister Saunders and I are related as both have the same Great-Great
Grandfather, David Elis Browning.  Shortly after the Saunders moved into our
Ward, we invited them over for an evening and at that time we realized that we
were related.  After they left, I worked more on the camper and got my Browning
sign put on the back of the camper.  This evening Mae and I watched the movie
“First Knight”.  Although we have seen it before it is still a good movie.  We
were late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept in until 8AM and Mae got up at 7AM.  I sure am in love with that
beautiful girl and praise my God daily and often in my heart for the blessing
she is to me.  I try to understand why with such a perfect Mother my children
are not stronger in the worship of my God and His Only Begotten Son.  Shellie
is the strongest but I fear that she does have an anchor with her.  After we
showered I prepared scrambled eggs for our breakfast.  We both have been busy
getting ready for our trip.  I got the trailer hitch attached to the truck.  I
also put air in the load busters so that the pickup will carry the load
better.  I called and visited with Keela Mangim who told me to call her son-in-law
about Quail Creek reservoir.  She also told me that there is a Sand Hollow
reservoir in the area of Hurrican.  I tried to reach Ryan, Lacy’s husband but I
didn’t make contact.  Mae and I went in to Ogden shopping.  We got our propane
tank filled, bought some items at Costco, filled the car up with gas and went
to Winco.  It was late when we got home and had some dinner.  I did call
Garrett to let him know that we had sent him a Birthday card but it came back
as unknown address.  Garrett told me that they have added a Unit # now to the
address.  I think that is just a laze Mail Man.  Mae still wants to give Bob a
haircut and then I will cut her hair before we take our showers.  It was 11PM
before we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Most
of the morning was spent in picking, cleaning and storing the products from our
garden.  We stopped for lunch and I took 15 minute nap and then we spent the
rest of the day packing for our trip.  We stopped at 6PM for dinner and we are
ready to quite or drop.  Sandy came over at 7:30PM to borrow my palm sander so
they can repaint their garage door.  It was almost 8PM when Jeff and the
children came over.  Jeff helped me bring my boat up and get it hooked to my
truck.  We then loaded some camping equipment into the boat.  I think we are
about ready to leave.  It is now 9PM and Mae just finished cooking some cookies
for us to take.  We are both very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke before 6AM and worked just as fast as we could to pack the final items. 
We left home at 8:05AM, stopping to buy some ice, worms and some oil for the
pickup.  Shortly after leaving we called Sandi.  She, Gail and her children are
riding together and Steve, Chelci and their family are just a few minutes
ahead.  We drove through to Sipio where we stopped for gas and also bought us a
Sub-way salad.  We continued on to Beaver where we stopped again as I was
getting too tired to drive.  We filled up the gas tank again just to check the
mileage and it looks like we are getting 11 to 12 miles per gallon.  After I
slept for about 20 minutes we continued on to LaVerkin.  We called Sandi and
they are in Cedar City, so about a half hour behind us.  We stopped at a
grocery store to wait for them.  While waiting we bought us each a piece of
chicken and I talked to the clerks.  They said that they would suggest that for
boating and fishing we should go to Quail Creek reservoir.  When Sandi and the
rest caught up to us I had Ben trade places with Mae.  That way she can use her
Golden Age card to get Sandi’s outfit into the park and I used my card to get
our outfit in.  It took me a few minutes to get my boat and the camper arranged
in the parking area but it worked out ok.  I soon started assembling the
canapé.  Mae and I also helped Gail set her tent up.  I was sure glad that she
has set it up before because we didn’t have any instructions.  Nathan fell on
his bike and with this terrible gravel they have serviced the roads with, it
really skinned his leg.  Chelci and Steve were very concerned about the wound. 
I believe that the gravel is crushed lave rock and is very sharp.  Sandi cooked
hot dogs and hamburgers for dinner this evening.  This evening was very warm
with clear ski and little breeze.  Mae and I decided to try sleeping under the
stars in the recliners.  It was nice for a while but Mae has to get up two or
three times in the night and so she went back to bed in the camper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept well until 2:30AM when the wind and the bright moon woke me.  I then went
into the camper to sleep the rest of the night.  After eating some breakfast I
went into town with Sandi’s pickup to buy ice for everyone.  When I got back
Gail and her three children, Mae and I went into town to attend church.  When
we got there, there wasn’t but one car in the parking lot and they were
tourist.  There was a note saying that today was Stake <br>
Conference so there would be no meeting in this building today.  I then went
looking for the Restraint, Gift Shop, Motel and Wilde Life Display that Charles
and Karen Hyer brought us to when we came to their home in St. George last
spring.  The children really enjoyed it.  After getting back to camp I stayed
with Sandi to tend the twins and Addie as Chelci, Steve and Nathan climbed to
Angles Landing.  Mae and Gail took the other children to the river and let them
play.  The twins kept Sandi and I busy almost all of the time.  This evening
Mae, Gail and I took Addie plus three of Gail’s children to the Ranger
program.  It was talking about the California Condor preservation program.  The
children go tired and fell asleep, but I really enjoyed it.  By the time we
were ready for bed it is now 10PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 12:30AM with acid reflex and got up for a pill.  When I tried to go back
to sleep my left leg got itching and I kept scratching until the scab came
off.  That caused it to burn so I got back up and put alcohol on it.  By then I
was too wide awake to sleep so I stayed up and played games on my computer
until 2:45AM.  It did start to sprinkle but it only lasted 5 minutes at the
longest.  It is interesting that the Weather report were predicting from 1 to 2
inches.  Well it certainly didn’t occur in this area.   I started this entry
until I could take my medication at 3AM.  I took that and went back to bed,
sleeping until about 7AM.  I used the restroom and as I was coming back Sandi
came over and said good morning.  She then went for a walk.  I would have liked
to have gone with her but that would have sure slowed her down.  Mae got up
about 7:30AM, she having slept fairly well.  Mae and I prepared breakfast of
hotcakes and eggs.  I couldn’t help thing that it is different than when I grow
up.  When we had a family campout and breakfast was ready everyone came at that
time.  This morning we had breakfast ready about 8AM and some didn’t come for
it until after 10AM.  I didn’t say anything but I thought it.  Gail told us
that Rachel came to her and asked if we were her Great-grandparents.  When she
said that we were her Grandparents, Rachel said that Addie said that we were
her Great-grandparents and added who are my Great-grandparents.  Gail explained
that her Great-grandparents are now dead.  Rachael then said that she wanted
Great-grandparents.  I worked on my journal for a while, then I took a shower
and a nap.  I then ate my lunch and decided to meet the neighbors across the
street.  I was there for only a few minutes when Jeff arrived.    I had just
finished cooking Dutch oven chicken and vegetables.  Everyone seemed to enjoy that. 
It started raining just as we were finishing dinner.  We have sure been
grateful for the canapé to cover our eating area.  This time we got a heavy
rain storm but everyone weather it ok.  Sandi, Jeff, Gail, their three
children, Mae and I went over and road the shuttle bus up to the narrows and
back.  We had so much fun looking for waterfalls coming off the top of the
cannon rims and down into the canyon below.  We were the only ones on the
shuttle so the driver helped us find places to take pictures of the falls. 
Part way up another couple got on the bus and they enjoyed the falls with us. 
It was a very special experience.  After getting the children to bed the adults
were going to play games.  Jeff then came over and said that water was coming
into their tent.  While Jeff carried children over Mae and I made beds in the
camper for them.  Although it was still raining, the adults still played games
for a while before going to bed.  Again tonight we got a couple more very heavy
rain storms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 2:30AM and got up as it has raining very hard hard.  I went over to
check on Jeff and Gail and they said that they were still dry.  I then walked
over and quietly checked on Sandi and her family.  They seem to be ok.  As I was
in the area I walked down to the river and it is really running fast and
muddy.  I particularly noticed a small that was a couple of feet from the
water.  When I came back to our outfit I realized that I had left the drain
plug in the boat.  I got a wrench and removed it.  Water gushed out for several
minutes before tapering off.  I estimated that there was at least 20 gallons
and maybe close to twice that.  I left the plug out this time.  I cooked
breakfast with Mae’s help when she had time.  She was also helping Jeff
children get up.  Jeff came over and gave me a hand also and breakfast turned
out pretty good.  I think everyone had all they could eat.  Sandi and her
family were busy trying to get their camp cleaned up ready to leave this
morning.  I tried to help but Sandi was quite independent.  I asked Steve if I
could help but again they felt that they had everything under control.  Finally
Jeff and I just went over and started helping.  It was raining lightly but we
got them packed and ready to leave just as another heavy storm hit.  I am sure
glad we helped them and later Sandi called back on her phone and told us thanks
for helping.  When the storm subsided Jeff and I walked to the river.  The tree
that I had noticed out of the water now had water up on it by at least a foot
or more.  We got Mae, Gail and the children and walked along the river.  More
and more water along with large trees and lots of forest trash was coming down
the river.  It was amazing to see the power of the waters.  By the time we
walked back I noticed that the river had risen at least 2 feet more on the
tree.  I moved our camper so I could empty the storage tanks and fill the water
supply.  We had some lunch and I took a nap.  Mae tried to take a nap with me
but when I was woken by a phone ringing no one else was in camp.  It was Gail’s
phone that she had left charging and I have idea how to answer it.  Mae left me
a note, telling me that they had gone for a hike.  At 6PM I took a break from
my computer and walked down to the river.  The river has subsided considerable
so I came back and got a measuring tape and went back to the river and measured
the small tree that I have been using as a gauge.  With the measuring tape,
from the high water mark on the tree to the water it had subsided just less
than 6 feet.  The water still looks like a melted Cholet milk shake.  Gail had
put a chicken dish in the Crock Pot for dinner.  When Mae, Jeff, Gail and the
children returned they told me that they had gone to the Emerald Pools.  Mae
and Gail finished dinner and we ate.  I made a fire in the fire pit where we
then roasted marsh mellows before putting the children to bed.  Jeff, Gail, Mae
and I then played some games before we went to bed.</p>

Gail and Ben left early this morning to clime Angel’s landing.  Mae and I
tended the other children.  After getting up and having breakfast we decided to
take the children up the canyon to Weeping Rock, then to Court of the
Patriarchs.  After returning to the Visitor Center we bought a few items
there.  It was after noon when we returned to camp and found that Jeff, Gail
and Ben had also just returned.  We prepared lunch and then I took a nap.  All
of us played Uno and the children did very well at it.  Jeff told us that at
the “backbone” of the trail to Angel’s landing, when it is the most dangers,
Ben’s attention was on a lizard that he saw.  Ben certainly enjoys catching
lizards and Jeff enjoys them almost as much.  We had dinner of left over’s
before Gail but the children to bed.  We took down the canapé and did some
packing this evening while Gail got the children to bed.  The four of us then
played some games before going to bed.</p>

medication I decided to catch my journal up to date.  I went back to bed at
3:15AM.  We got up at 7AM and started getting ready to leave.  I was glad that
we had packed many thing last night because with getting breakfast and finishing
packing it was 11AM by the time we pulled out of the camp site.  I then dumped
the storage tanks while Mae returned 7 decks of playing cards to the gift shop
that we bought them yesterday.  The cards were made by different companies so
they were of different card stock and also varied in exact size.  Mae wanted to
keep one set for a souvenir.  I wanted the 8 decks of playing cards in order to
play Hand &amp; Foot.  We next stopped at a lodge in Springdale where we
purchased some bow &amp; arrow sets for Grandchildren gifts.  So it was at
least noon before we really got away.  We stopped in Cedar City for gas and
also added air to the boat trailer tires.  We then stopped in Fillmore where we
took a walk and a nap.  We then filled up the truck with gas and bought a
frozen yogurt that we shared as we went on.  Mae has been reading from the book
“Why I Believe” and it is very enjoyable.  When we got to Clearfield, we again
filled the truck with gas before coming on home.  It was 9PM when we got home,
very tired.  We unloaded what we needed and went to bed.</p>

breakfast I went into Dr. Toone’s and got a treatment.  I was still not feeling
very well so when I got home I laid down for a nap.  Mae has been busy with the
garden and putting things away.  I haven’t done very much today.  I did figure
up the mileage and we drove 685 miles and averaged a little over 10.6 miles per
gallon.  I have help Mae a little but she doesn’t stop.  I did text David and
wish him a Happy Birthday.  Jeff came over this evening and helped me finish
the unpacking and putting things away.  He forgot to bring his bike rake to
carry the bikes home with him.  He will have to come back for them.  Irven,
Sandy and Mark had come over to visit with Bob so Mae and I went upstairs to
say hi to them.  We watched the end of a movie with them.  For Bob a visit is
to watching a movie or a sports game on TV with him.  Following the movie we
came downstairs and went to bed.</p>

woke at 5AM and recognized that Mae wasn’t in bed.  I slipped into the front
room and she was sleeping in the recliner.  After using the bathroom I went
back to bed.  I really didn’t sleep but meditated about my life.  I wonder if
when all is added up, have I done what the Lord would have wanted me to do with
my life?  Mae got up about 7AM and then she cuddled up for a few minutes.  I
took a shower before breakfast.  After eating I washed the windows.  I then
started mowing the lawns and Bob came out and helped.  Mae also did some
trimming before she left to watch Ben’s soccer game.  After finishing the lawns
we mowed the weeds in the far back yard.  I then came in and took a nap.  After
being woke by Sister Olsen calling on the phone I watched a western show on
TV.  I then worked on a purposed program for my funeral to have on file.  Mae
came home just as I was finishing it.  She brought a Christmas gift home from
Mike and Becky with instructions to open it.  Mike said that it was something
that we wanted but until we began to open it I couldn’t think of what it was. 
It is a shower curtain and rod that bows out into the room giving more room in
the shower itself.  Mike and Becky has one in their bathroom and I mentioned
that while we were tending the girls a week or two ago, we enjoyed their shower
curtains.   We decided to go out to dinner at Sizzler this evening.  After we
had placed our orders, somehow Mae bumped a table holding a large glass pitcher
of punch and it tipped over breaking the pitcher and splashing punch all over. 
She felt so bad the rest of the evening over it.  After dinner we came home and
watched a show that Bob had recorded.  We watched the end of it last night with
Irven and Sandy so tonight we watched the complete show again for Mae.  It is
now 11PM and time to go to bed.</p>

Saunders last time to meet with us as he and Carolyn’s last Sunday to be with
us as they are being set apart as Missionaries at 4:15PM and will enter the
Missionary Training Center tomorrow morning.  I was glad I got to wish them well. 
After Priesthood meeting I came home and got Mae.  We then went to Gail’s Ward
where the children participated in the Children’s Primary Program.  Following
that Sacrament meeting Mae and I went Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching to
Sister Fallis.  We then went back to Jeff and Gail’s for dinner and to play
some games.  We played “Hand &amp; Foot” with Jeff and Gail winning us.  After
returning home I took out the trash and then worked on the computer for a
little while.  Mae and I then watched “A Man for All Seasons” on video.  Any
way we watched ½ of it and then turned it off and went to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were busy around the house and the garden this morning.  I am quite depressed
this morning over my health.  I think I am falling apart.  My leg does look
much better, my ears are not doing very well and I am disappointed over the
hearing aids.  I am getting too old to make love with my wife and really just
getting old and broke.  My mind is failing along with the rest of me.  After
lunch I took a nap and then we went into Dr. Kennington.  He readjusted my
hearing aids and convinced me that I should keep the hearing aids.  When we
left there we drove up to East Canyon to see how low the water is.  It is very
low.  We stopped at Sub-Way and bought us a salad.  When we got down the canyon
we stopped at Good Earth and bought some items.  We sure spend a lot on Health
Food.  I stopped at a Maverick to buy a frozen yogurt but they no longer have
the machines.  We went upstairs and watched a show “With Six You Get Eggroll”,
with Doris Day.  Mae said that she has never seen it but I have seen it at
least once or twice.  It was ok but mainly it gave us some time with Bob.</p>

me to take a load of trash to the dumps.  We then came in and after dinner we

Visiting Teaching and I went down to Randy’s and put the door on his pickup
shell.  Randy asked if I would go to Price and pickup his boat as his sons had
taken the boat to Lake Powel and on the way home the bearings and breaks went
out on the trailer.  Mae went with me and we left about noon and didn’t get
home until after 8PM.  It was a good trip and we got some reading done.  Mae
soon went to bed but I didn’t feel like it so I stayed up and watched a movie.</p>

slept in until 8AM, when I got up Mae had breakfast ready.  Mae went out into
the garden after eating so I started out to take Randy’s boat and truck back
but as I walked past the boat I noticed that the trolling plate was bent out of
shape.  I worked two or three hours getting it reshaped and put back together. 
When I returned the boat to Randy I noticed that the front bumper was missing. 
I stopped at the boat shop and bought a new bumper.  Randy and I planned on
going fishing tomorrow so I wanted the boat to be ready.  Mae had lunch ready
for me when I got home.  After eating I took a nap and then I installed the new
shower curtains.  Sandi called and she is quite upset as tomorrow she and Nick
are to appear in court for a divorce.  Nick has decided to fight the divorce
and he wants the house.  Mae and I have decided to go out to support Sandi.  I
don’t understand Nick’s claims!  We did watch a very good show that Becky had

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>We were
until noon in the court house before Sandi’s case came before the Judge.  Nick
partitioned to have Sandi removed from the house because he didn’t have any
place else to live.  The judge gave him until the end of the month to find
someplace but got an objection from his attorney as that only gave him a little
over a week to find someplace.  The judge then extended it to the 15<sup>th</sup>
of October with strong suggestions that he make it quicker than that.  Over all
I am sorry that Nick has decided to handle this situation by not only hurting
himself but also trying to hurt Sandi.   After I got home I was upset over not
being able to hear what was going on in the court room.  I called Dr.
Kennington’s office and they had me go right up.  Dr. Kennington gave me a
complete re-examination and said that my hearing had taken a drastic change for
the worse.  After testing me he took the results into Dr. Owens who re-examined
my ears.  He feels that due to tension that there is not enough blood flow and
he gave me medication that should change the situation.  He wants to re-see me
on the 30<sup>th</sup> of September.  I stopped at Winneger’s to get the
items.  They did not have the Niacin 100 mg, but could order it in by Monday. 
Not wanting to wait until Monday, I went to Kmart, then to Wal Green’s who they
didn’t have it in the 100 mg tablets.  The pharmacy at Wal Green’s suggested
that I check with Good Earth.  I had Mae call them and they do have Niacin 100
MG, so after having some dinner we drove there and got the Niacin.  When we got
home I Morgan called and we discussed the schedule for tomorrow.  he said that
he would cover my Saturday cleaning assignment if I would go to the Stake camp
and help them there.  Mae and I watched the movie “Three Coins in a Fountain”

also repaired the pump to the sprinkler system.  I watched the first part of
the BYU football game but got tired of the advertisements so did other things. 
Robert and Patty came over to visit Bob so I visited with them also.  I did
return to see the last of the game and was glad that BYU won.  I just started a
show on TV when Mae came home with the children.  Later Scott and Mishelle came
over to get the children.  I had Scott help me hook up the hearing aids for the

him borrow my miter box saw my plainer and my vacuum.  He is building some
shelving in his garage.  Mae and I walked to the Church House where we attended
the 2<sup>nd</sup> Re-Dedication service of the Ogden Utah Temple.  It was a
special experience.  It is a light rain shower but we walked to and from the
Chapel.  When we got home I had a TEX message from a fellow that is interested
in purchasing my Ice Fishing Tent.  Maybe he will come by?  Bob cooked chicken
and gravy for lunch.  Shortly after dinner there was a young man came to
purchase my Ice Fishing Tent.  We had originally listed the complete set for
$499.00 and when he called last week about it he asked if I would go down any. 
I finally decided to go for $475.  He tried to get me to go down further but I
told him no and I stuck to it.  I told him if he didn’t think my price was
fare, then he should just not buy it.  He finally paid me the $475.00 for it
and we loaded everything into his truck.  When I came in I worked on my Diary
for a little while before we went over to Jeff and Gail’s.  We played a game of
Beans which Jeff won.  Mae got upset with me just before we left to come home
and I spoke cross in return.  That didn’t end the day on a good note.  I took

When I finally got to sleep this morning I slept until 9AM.  We got breakfast

tomatoes because of the wire trellises.  I used the bolt cutters and cut the
trellises into pieces in order to get the out.  I am not going to use those
again.  I got two 3 gallon buckets heaping with tomatoes.  I fell asleep while
using the chee machine.  Bob decided to mow the lawns so I got out and used the
hand mower and Mae used the trimmer.  Before I got done Jeff came over and I
used my table saw to cut him some shelving.  After finishing the lawns we came
in for dinner and watched a show on Netflix.  We watched a few minutes of
another show on TV when the Netflix ended.  It was 9:30PM when we got to bed.</p>

and it just about caused us some problems however it all worked out.  There was
a very special Spirit about attending the first Session of the re-opening of
the Temple.  The Temple is very beautiful and special.  Following the session
we drove down into the underground parking just to see it.  With the remodeling
of the Temple and the restoration of the area around it, it is sure a special
setting.  We then went to Wal-Mart and bought some items Mae needed in order to
make tomato sauce.  When we got home we got some lunch and then started making
the tomato sauce.  I set the camp stove up outside and that is where we cooked
it.  Mae sure is a special wife so it becomes so fun to help her.  We put up

got up at 3:15AM and got ready to go fishing.  I was at Randy’s at 5AM and
Randy was waiting for me, however there was a car, trash receptacles and a
motor scooter that was in the way.  I thought that we could maneuver the boat
trailer around the car but with the weight of the boat and the trailer having
duel axels we just could not get the trailer to turn.  We had to get Randy’s
son up to move the car.  By the time we got my items and Randy’s items into the
boat it was almost 6AM before we got away.  I asked as we started out if the
boat was full of fuel.  He assured me that the boys had filled it after their
trip.  We got to Strawberry about 7:45AM and the lake had a mist over it but as
the sun started to worm the mist was leaving and was gone from the west end of
the lake by the time we got launched.  As we left the marina I looked at the
fuel gage and it registered empty.  I asked Randy and he assured me that the
boys had filled the tank and so the gage must not work.  We got to the area
where I wanted to start fishing and the boat ran out of fuel.  There we set in
the middle of the lake out of gas.  We spent until noon getting gas delivered
out to us and back to the marina to get more gas.  It was good that we had cell
phones with us as I finally had Mae reach the marina and get them to send us
help.  Anyway we started fishing just after noon, the poorest time of the day
to fish.  We did catch some fish but had to release them because of the slot
limit and they were all rainbow trout, where as the last time we fished this
same area I caught all rainbow trout.  I did catch one large cut throat that
measured 22” and so we kept it. We moved to another area of the lake but still
had to release everything we caught.  At 5PM we called it enough and came
home.  It was after 8PM when I got home, very tired.  With Randy being blind it
really causes me to work.  Also with the starting stress that took its toll. 
Then to add to the problems I hadn’t got all my gear out of my truck when we
left this morning and so I didn’t have the fishing equipment I needed to fish
with.  After getting home I cleaned my fish after taking some pictures of it. 
I re-measured it and it only measured 11 ¾”, which if that was what it would
have measured when I caught it is should have been released.  I really think it
did shrink during transportation as I had checked the length three times before
keeping it.  I was so tired that I fell asleep in the recliner as Mae was
talking to me, and that is where I slept most of the night.</p>

having his blacktop sealed for the winter.  That way the boat is not in the way
of the workers.  Mae is busy cleaning the house as we are having Grin and
Kathleen Clark over for dinner this evening.  I did some chasing for some items
for Mae and I also bought some fishing equipment, a spare tire holder for my
boat trailer and some worms for fishing.  Grin and Kathleen came shortly after
5PM.  We enjoyed a nice dinner and played game for a little while.  They are

Sandi, Mae and I put up 12 Quarts and 4 Pints of tomato salsa mainly for Sandi
as the salsa has too much spices for Mae.  We did keep 3 pints and the rest was
for Sandi.  While the salsa was cooking down the three of us played games. 
After Sandi left to go home, Mae and I went up to Mountain Green where Connor
was playing in a game of succor, even though it was raining steady.  Connor’s
seem lost but it was a good game.  Mae and I then came home and after eating

worse during Sacrament meeting, until I took them clear out.  I am becoming
quite concerned about this problem.  This afternoon I visited with David and he
agrees that since I have given the hearing aids some time to check them out and
at this point maybe I should turn them back in and get my money back.  I also
did some calling and got a hold of Linda.  She apologized that they hadn’t got
back to us, but explained that her mother is becoming very frail and not
expected to live very much longer.  This evening Mae and I took a walk.  It
started out to be a short walk but we ended up in a area that we were not

her that we would move out by this weekend if she would give him ½ of
everything.  He then listed both bedroom sets, the TV, the computer, the camera
that he had given her as a Christmas gift, half of all the kitchen items
including he wants the refrigerator, the full sectional set, ½ of all the food
in the house, half of all the Christmas &amp; Halloween Decorations.  Plus he
wanted $50,000.  He also wanted the two dogs and the kennel.  Sandi said that
she would agree to some of it but the Camera was a Christmas Gift, she said
that the Antique Bed Room set was hers; she didn’t understand why he wanted her
Christmas and Halloween decorations and she wasn’t willing to go for the
$50,000, but maybe $25,000 to $30,000.  She then explained that they would make

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke at 6AM with the alarm, so that I could wake Bob as he needs to take
medication at that time.  I moved my tools up into Bob’s garage and worked on a
part for Randy’s boat.  This afternoon Mae went with me to see Dr. Kennington. 
He gave me another hearing test and continues to encourage me to keep working
with the hearing aids.  Maybe it is the high pressure system that is causing me
so much discomfort with my ears at this time.  Mae and I then did some shopping
at Costco and Winco.  Mae had dinner in the crock pot and so when we got home
we ate and watched the show that Tanner sang tonight.  We hope it went well. 
Our concerns are for what it will do for Tanner!  We then watched the show
“Hatari” starring John Wayne.  We were late getting to bed.</p>
