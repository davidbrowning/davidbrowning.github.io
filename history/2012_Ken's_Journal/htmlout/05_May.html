<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 5:30am and got ready for work.  Mae didn’t sleep very well last night
so I let her sleep in.  I had a few minutes left so I started another batch of
Indexing before leaving.  Morning run went well and when I got home Mae was
just eating so I joined her.  We then started making strawberry jam.  We did
take a short nap until the phone rang and woke us.  I ground some spelt grain
for Mae to make bread.  The bread was cooked before I took the pm run so we had
to try it.  As usual it was delicious.  The pm run also went well.  Mae had
worked all day so when I got home I helped her finish up.  We did stop and
watch a show on TV before we finished the work and went to bed.</p>

woke shortly after 4am and was unable to go back to sleep.  After reading my
scriptures and having prayer I started a new batch on indexing.  Mae got up at
6am and prepared our breakfast.  My morning route went well.  After getting
home I loaded our camper onto the pickup.  That was quite a job.  I had Bob and
Mae out helping me.  The hard part is backing into it perfectly straight.  I
didn’t have it finished when it was time for the pm run.  That also went well. 
I was able to get camper on and locked down.  I helped Mae trim the yard as Bob
mowed it today.  This evening I called my Home Teachers and got their report
for April.  I called Brother Thomas and gave him my report.  I worked on
indexing during my spare time and got ½ a batch done.  It’s going on to 10pm so
we had better get to bed.</p>

bus runs went well today.  I took my bus into the shop for service after my AM
run and it was ready for me when I returned for the PM run.  When I got home,
after the AM run Mae had gone to the dentist and then to get a blood test and
then to Georgia’s, so I spent most of my time working on the camper.  I checked
out everything except adding water to the potable water tank.  It took me some
time but with Mike’s, next door, help we figured out the furnace.  Mae was home
when I returned from the pm run.  She had everything ready for dinner when
Garrett and Nora would get here.  They expect to be here about 7pm.  They had
called yesterday to let us know that they were taking a trip to Washington and
would like to stop to see us.  We were excited to have them.  They got here at
7:30pm.  We had a wonderful evening being with them.  I had to excuse myself at
9:30 but Mae stayed up with them until 11pm.  </p>

the materials that it will take to reroof his house.  It was cute, but when I
got to Jeff’s, Matt answered the door.  He was excited to see me but then he
looked for Grandma.  He just kept looking at the car and asking, where’s Grandma. 
I got home from Jeff’s just in time to eat some lunch and leave for my PM run. 
I got to the shop a little early, so I had time installed two wires to hold my
paper basket in place.  Then when we finished the PM run I took time to adjust
my inside mirror.  That has always bugged me so while I had my tools with me I
adjusted the mirror.  Mae had everything gathered up for us to go, so we
quickly put things into the camper and left.  We decided to take the camper and
go over night some place just to see how the truck would handle and what kind
of gas millage we would get.  We fueled the truck, and then stopped at Costco
for some shopping.  We then drove to hwy. 89 and went south to Kaysville,
turned around and went to Jeff’s.  There we parked the truck and camper in the
vacant lot east of Jeff’s and set up to sleep over night.  Mae had called Jeff
earlier to see if that was ok with them.  Jeff and Gail had gone to a movie but
the children were home with a sitter.  They were excited to get in the camper. 
We sent then into the house for bed time just before we ate our dinner. 
Everything went well with the set up until I filled the potable water.  There
is a broken line somewhere as the water ran out the right rear corner of the
camper.  I will have to work on that another day.  When Jeff and Gail got home
we went into their home and played games for a while.  We then went out to bed
in the camper.</p>

woke at 3:30am worrying about the water problem.  I then took the time to catch
my journal up to date before going back to bed.  We slept until after 8am.  By
the time we got breakfast our grandchildren came out and joined us for
breakfast.  After eating and getting the dishes cleaned we got things ready to
go home.  It was nice to just leave our thing in place and lower the stabilizer
jack and drive away.  When we got back to Clinton we refueled the truck.  I
figured that we averaged 11.3 miles per gallon and felt good at that.  At the
price of gas now it will still cost us a lot to go places.  We put things away
when we got home.  Mae went shopping and I took a nap.  We went up to David and
Shauna’s where family members from both sides gather to support Connor being
baptized.  David baptized Connor and Shauna’s father confirmed and bestowed the
gift of the Holy Ghost on Connor.  It was a beautiful service.  Everyone went
back to David and Shauna’s where they had deserts.  We were late getting home. 
Bob had already gathered the eggs and fed the chickens by the time we got
there.  I am tired and don’t feel the best tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 7:30am to start the day.  I went out to take care of the animals and
when I started feeding the rabbits I found that the two kits were not in their
nest.  Also the doe was completely out of water.  At first I couldn’t figure
out where the kits were but began to look at the flooring in that pen as it is
broken.  I found the kits on the ground cuddled together.  When I picked them
up and put them in the nest they quickly berried them self in the fur to get
warm.  It was quite fun to see them hurry to safety.  I move them to another
cage.  I attended my Priesthood leadership meeting.  During Sunday school we
held a work shop on Family History.  That went quite well.  After church we went
up to Jeff and Gail’s.  Mae had planned on having all the family at our place
but because the boys were leaving about 6pm to go to Moab where they plan on
doing some mountain climbing and repelling.  Mae had brought the barbeque and
buns along with salads and chips.  We enjoyed visiting; eating and the children
enjoyed playing with cousins.  At 6pm the boys left, Mae played with the
children, Gail and Michelle visit and I worked on my batch if indexing.  I
finished it and sent it back.  Shauna had stayed home so she could get some
studying done.  Mae and I took Conner, Emily and Tyler home before returning
home.  Bob had gathered the eggs for us but I went out to check on the doe and
her kits.  They are ok.  I entered the last of today’s journal entry before we
went to bed.</p>

morning run went well.  On the way home I stopped and filled the car with gas
so that it would be ready for Mae to take Sister Reid to Salt Lake.  I unloaded
the camper from the pickup.  I found out why the water leaked when we added
water to the drinkable water tank.  The drain hose was not connected to the
drain tap and probably was not connected for years.  I did take a nap before
driving this afternoon.  This evening we read a couple of talks from the Conference
Ensign.  We then watched the original “Sabrina” on DVD before going to bed.  We
enjoyed it.</p>

run.  I stopped and bought rabbit pellets on the way home.  Mae tended the
children for Gail so she could go to the Temple.  When Gail came to get then

the bus shop.  I ate mu lunch on the way.  I had a few extra minutes so I
washed all the side windows on the outside.  Our pm run went well.  When I got
home Bob was starting to mow the front lawn.  He said that he was just going to
do the front lawn.  I did take a nap after eating.  Bob said that we had a
appointment to go Home teaching this evening.  When we got to Therman’s no one
was home.  Bob ask if tonight was Thursday.  It is tomorrow night that he set
the appointment for.  We did stop and visit with Brother Casey before going

indexing for a few minutes before going for my pm run.  When I came back home
Mae had bought a few more plants.  We planted them and then went for dinner. 
This evening Bob and I went Home teaching to the Therman’s.  Mae has been working
on the family reunion.  We also watched part of a Walton serious.  I finished

is about normal this morning.   After getting home I decided to butcher
rabbits.  Actually I had decided that I wanted to butcher rabbits and then
before leaving home Mae suggested that we go fishing tomorrow.  I called Mae as
I was driving to the bus compound and told her that I had better butcher the
rabbits today so we could go fishing tomorrow.  I killed five rabbits and then
had time to eat lunch and go back for my PM run.  When I finished my run and
returned home I got the rabbits in the roaster and took it upstairs to have Bob
watch it cook.  We had Kelley and Marilyn Bodily come over to play games.  We
had a good time being with them. They left shortly after 9PM.  We quickly
stripped the meat from the bones and then ground and packaged the meat.  It was
about 11PM when we finished.  We soon went to bed.</p>

must have set the alarm wrong last night as we didn’t get up until 6AM so by
the time we got ready to go fishing it was 8AM.  We went to East Cannon
reservoir fishing.  It was a beautiful day and the lake was calm until about
11AM.  Mae caught 6 nice fish and I caught 1.  We got home and put the boat
away and just had time to make it to Rachael’s Dance Recital.  We left before
it was over so that we could meet Sandi and Nick for dinner at Sizzler.  Mick
and Sandi paid for dinner as a Mother’s Day gift.  After dinner we came over to
our place and played a game of marbles.  Mae and Sandi won.  They had to leave
by 9PM or close to it to make it out to a store before it closed.  Sandi and Nick
paid us for the camp trailer but they paid more than what we asked.  </p>

meetings then when we came home Bob had started dinner so we ate with him. 
Scott and his family came over to wish Mae a happy Mother’s Day.  Before they
left David and his Family also came.  It was fun to be with and visit with
them.  I downloaded a batch from indexing and completed it while Mae was
visiting with Mike on the phone.  That makes me 771 names that I have entered
through the indexing.  We watched the movie “The Longest Day” which depicted
the battle of Normandy, the we watched “The Heidelberg” which was another good
movie but it made it late to go to bed.  Mae fell asleep in the recliner so I
just let her sleep there and I went to bed.</p>

Supply.  We ordered his roofing materials and then took part of the order with
us and they will deliver the rest Friday morning.  When I got home Mae had a
sandwich ready.  I then took a 15 minute nap and took my PM run.  This evening
we went for a walk to the Maverick on 1800 n and bought a chocolate / peanut
butter frozen yogurt.  While I capsulated some of our nutritional supplements,

for my stomach problems.  I also washed the car before going home.  Mae had
some dinner ready when I got there.  After eating I went out and loaded a sheet
of plywood in the pickup, got some rope out of my boat, turned the water on the

after we got up Scott called and said that Michelle had another migraine
headache so Mae hurried and soon left to go over to get the older children off
to school and to tend the twins.  I had fed the chickens and rabbits while Mae
prepared breakfast.  I made my AM run and then went up to Jeff’s.  Trent was
already there helping Jeff.  We tried to dump the shingles into the dump bin
but it was not working very well.  Finally I drove my pickup down into the back
yard and positioned it under the eaves so we could just shove the shingles off
into the pickup.  I worked until after 1PM getting the truck almost full.  I
then went home to take a short nap before taking my PM route.  That went well
and we finished at 5PM.  I went right up to Jeff’s and took a load of old
shingles to the dumps.  Three young men were there unloading some trash.  When
they finished they came over and offered to help me.  I told them I wouldn’t
turn the offer down and they helped me unload the complete load.  I offered to
buy them a drink but they declined.  That was neat of then to help.  I took the
truck back up to Jeff’s and after cleaning up some shingles again drove the
truck down into the back yard and positioned it to where they could shovel to
old shingles off the roof into the pickup.  I then came home where Mae had some
fruit and toast waiting for me.  I then took a shower and entered this journal
entry.  Dolly called to talk to Mae so I played a game of Solitary while
waiting.  Jeff called to check on how I was doing.  We went to bed when Mae got
off the phone with Dolly.</p>

assessment that is State mandated before we can drive a school bus next fall,
so I stayed took that.  I got up to Jeff’s for a little while.  Jeff and I took
a pickup load and a trailer load of tear off to the dumps.  I helped for a few
minutes and then took my PM run.  Mae also came up and helped clean up the tear
off that fell in the yard.  They loaded it into my wheel-barrel and dumped it
into the trash bin.  Scott came over and a neighbor Travis came over.  With
their help we got the ice &amp; snow shield down and worked until after 11PM
getting the felt down.  We only had ½ the amount of ice &amp; snow so had also
½ the amount of felt.  Scott had ran down to Lowe’s and got more ice &amp; snow
and felt so we were able to get most of the roof dried in.  I had brought a
bottle of caulk and a straight line but when I needed the caulk I could not
find it.  We managed and got what felt we had down.  We would never have made
it without Scott and Travis’s help.  I was sure tired when I got home so took a
shower and went right to bed.</p>

while I took care of the animals.  After my AM bus run I went up to Jeff’s. 
The rain had held off and the shingles got delivered and put on the top.  Jeff
had also got tarps over most of the area that we hadn’t got the felt down.  The
wind had not damaged the felt so the house stayed dry.  I really believe that
the Lord had a hand in holding the storm off until we got it covered enough to
hold the moisture out.  I came home and entered yesterdays and the start of
today’s journal entries.  After the PM run I went back to Jeff’s and we worked

rest of the day.  Mae came up and worked on the cleanup of the yard for about 4
hours.  By 4:30PM I was beat and was going to quit but then I saw the sky
lights that Jeff wanted installed.  I decided that if I cut the ceiling and
roof holes that they could roof the vent jacks in and install the rest of the
Sky Lights later.  Although I made a mess in both bathrooms I got it that far
and left just before 7PM.  Mae had my clothes ready and I took a quick shower
and went to the first session of our Stake conference.  We were about 15

we soon went to bed.</p>

woke early but went back to bed for a little while.  We were able to get the
animals taken care of.  I ate breakfast but Mae was concerned about some
problems that Sandi and JaNae are having so she fasted.  Bob took Cole, Mae and
I with him to our Stake Conference which was held in the Conference Center in
Salt Lake.  There are now 69 Stakes in Davis County and most of them were
invited to attend Stake Conference in the Conference Center.  President Dieter
F. Uchtdorf presided at the conference, Shayne M. Bowen of the 1<sup>st</sup>
Quorum of the Seventy conducted, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the
Twelve and Sister Linda K. Burton, President of the Relief Society, all of
which spoke during the Conference.  It was a great meeting and we were glad to
be in attendance.  After conference we went to the Chuck A Rama in Bountiful
where Bob bought us dinner.  When we got home Mae went Visiting Teaching to
Sister Lesley Fallis.  I took a short nap and then Bob and I went Home Teaching
to Sister Fallis.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night so I let her sleep in and I got my own
breakfast.  Mae got up just before I left for my AM run.  The run went well and
just before we returned to the compound Jana radioed me and asked me to se her
after I finished the run.  When I went in to see her Rosa asked if I would take
a mid-day run.  I said that I would so after seeing what Jana wanted I went
home and took a 15 minute nap and brought a lunch with me.  I took by lingo
students from Northridge to Hill Field Elementary where they helped with
children that spoke Spanish.  After returning the High School students back to
Northridge, I then took students from Clearfield High School to Holt Elementary
for the same purpose.  I got back to the compound in time to take my PM route. 
One thing that was very enjoyable about the mid-day run was the bus I got to
drive.  What Jana had for me is that I have to complete more information about
New Employee Orientation Policy and risk Management.   My PM run also went very
well.  I was very tired when I got home.  Mae and I watched the end of a show
on TV and then started another show but the language got bad and I turned it
off.  We soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were a little late getting up this morning but I got to work in time.  Just
before we got to our first stop they announced over the radio that they needed
someone to take a field trip from 9:30am to 1:30PM.  I thought that I could
take it but really didn’t want to, so I waited for someone else to respond.  A
few minutes later they again made the same announcement but this time they said
that they would need three wheelchairs.  That relieved me because my bus will
only hold two wheelchairs.  I had no more than thought of that excuse when
someone else called in and said that he didn’t have the time to take the trip
but his bus could hold three wheelchairs and someone could use it to take the
trips.  I kept waiting with the excuse that I was driving and didn’t want to
get the details over the radio.  By the time we had picked up all our children
and took them to the school they were still announcing the need for a driver. 
I finally responded that my bus couldn’t hold but two wheelchairs witch again
Chuck re-confirmed that I could drive his bus, so I said that I would take it.
The field-trip went very well and was enjoyable.  Mae brought me a lunch to the
Clearfield South Elementary school where I was to pick up the first of my
children.  I finished the field trip with just enough time to take care of some
things at the office and then go on my PM run.  I got home, took care of the
chickens, ate dinner, showered and then went Home Teaching to the Johnston’s. 
We didn’t get home until after 9PM but had a good visit with Patriarch and
Sister Johnston. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
had gone to the Book Group this evening and then stopped and visited with
Dollie, so she didn’t get home until after I had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
need to insert into this entry that Georgia and Rick’s daughter Kristy went
into the hospital last night in an ambulance.  They decided that they would
operate this morning.  They were afraid that she had cancer but found out that
it was not near as serious as they first expected.  No cancer was found and the
operations was successful in cleaning up other problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                AM
run went well although we took a different route to the first pickup.  Traffic
was backed up on Antelope drive so we went down Main Street to Gordon to Flint
to 200 North Street.  We got there with 5 minutes to spare.  When I got home
Mae was out weeding the garden so I helped her.  Bob then started mowing the
lawns so I used the small mower and got the outside trimming.  Mae used the
trimmer and finished the trimming.  It didn’t take very long with the three of
us working together.  I then moved a sprinkler head so that the water will not
spray on the car and pickup.  We were going to take a nap but Mae got a phone
call so she visited on the phone while I took a short nap.  I took the PM rout
and it went well.  I was held up on getting home because of some rail road car
switching that blocked traffic for about 15 minutes.  We quickly ate dinner and
then went over to Jeff and Gail’s where Mae tended the children while Gail went
to a Cub Scout meeting.  Scott was there and he, Jeff and I worked a little
while on the roof.  Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played a game of Harts and I lost
within five hands.  It was after 10 PM when we got home.  I entered this
journal entry before we went to bed.  It looks pretty sure that Jeff will be
excepting the job offer in Redding California.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night so I let her sleep in and I got myself off. 
Mae had prepared everything for my breakfast during the night.  Just before I
left the house Tino from Risk Management called and said that the New
Employment Orientation that I am being ask to complete is different than the
Orientation I had at the District Office, so I had better get going on it when
I get home.  My AM run went well.  After getting home I took a short nap and
then started on the New Employee Orientation course and worked on it until
almost 1PM when I quite to get ready to go on my PM run.  Mae needed a car and
the pickup is almost out of gas so she took me to work.  After my run Mae came
back and got me.  We went from the bus terminal to Morgan to see Conner play
base ball.  We stopped on the way at a Sub-Way and got a sandwich for our
dinner.  We enjoyed watching the ball game although Conner’s team lost.  After
the game we went to David and Shauna’s to visit for a little while.  When we
got home we found that a water line had broken and water was running into the
back yard.  I just shut the water off and turned the sprinkler system off for
tonight until I can get the line repaired.  We soon went to bed but it is still
after 10PM.</p>

both slept quite well last night.  My runs went well today.  I did stop in and
visit with Curt about the brakes on the bus but he says they are ok.  Janet
also told me that I do get paid for the orientation I am taking on the computer
so I should turn in my time.  Mae drove over to Bountiful to meet Sandi and get
Paris from her.  We will tend her for a few days.  I went to Durk’s and got
some parts and then went to Allco Auto Parts and ordered the air suspension for
the truck.  When I got home I finished fixing the sprinklers.  Mae went to
Bountiful where she met Sandi and she got Paris for us to tend while Sandi,
Nick, Chelci, Steve and the children went to Disney Land for a few days.  I
took Mae out to eat at Golden Corral.  When we got home we watched the movie

didn’t sleep very well last night and was up from 1:30AM on.  Being that I couldn’t
sleep I worked on the Davis District New Employee Orientation on Policy and
Risk Management.  I finished with it at 7AM.  I went back to sleep and only
slept for a little while.  I took Scott and his family up of Hill Air Force
Base to see the air show.  On the way home I took the car into Discount tires
as the “Check Tire Pressure light” keeps coming on.  It stormed most of the day
but Scott’s family stayed to see the air show.  Mae and I went into Ogden
shopping and to visit Sister Southern who is in a Rehabilitation Home after
having an operation on her feet.  We went to Jeff and Gail’s where we played
games.  It was late when we got home.</p>

slept in until after 8AM.  We planned on going to Morgan along with Georgia,
Rick, Bryce, Deanna as well as meeting Kim and Jeanenne but Jeff called and ask
if I could help him on his roof.  We decided that Mae would go to Morgan and I
would help Jeff.  Before I left Mae said that she had dropped one of her ear
rings and it went down the bathroom sink drain.  I disassembled the drain and
was able to save the ear ring.  I got to Jeff’s a little after 9AM.   With the
two of us working together we almost finished but ran out of ridge shingles.  I
there for picked up some of my tools and took them with me.  When I was loading
my pickup I noticed that the front right tire was very low.  We pumped the tire
up with my compressor and it held until I got home.   I stopped at the County
Dumps and unloaded the half bed of tear off shingles before going on home.  Mae
was later with her siblings that she thought she would be.  I worked on our
camper to repair the leak in the potable water holding tank.  Kelley Boldly
came over and we decided to cut an access hole from the top of the floor in the
right rear storage compartment.  I think that is going to work although I
didn’t pressure check the line yet.  We ate dinner and watched the show “Bridge
on the River Quy”.  I entered this journal entry before we went to bed.</p>

back to driving school bus again for four more days.  Mae hadn’t slept much
last night so I let her sleep in and I got myself off this morning.  When I got
home after the AM run I ate some breakfast and took a nap.  I then butchered
seven rabbits.  Bob helped me and we finished with just enough time to eat
lunch, take a short nap and get to work.  When I returned this afternoon I cut
and packaged the rabbits.  We got about 32lb. of meat out of 54lb. live
weight.  After finishing cutting and packaging the rabbits Mae and I went with
Bob to see the grave stone for Carroll.  It still wasn’t completed yet.  Bob
was disappointed that it wasn’t there.  Bob did have some flowers so we put
them around the head stone base.  We then drove over to the Clearfield cemetery
where we put some flowers on Steve’s grave.   I am sure tired tonight.</p>

nice breakfast before I left for work.  My AM run went well.  I stopped at the
dispatch and got the instructions for bidding for next year.  I am the last on
the seniority list so will be last bidding.  I went to Alco Auto Parts and got
the air lifts to put on the pickup.  I was able to repair the camper without
much cost.  The PM run also went well and I was home before 5PM.  We watched
one show of “Little House on The Prairie” and then I went with Brother Tomas to
visit a couple of his families.  I was back home by 8PM.  Mae made some phone
calls, one to Pat and in that conversation she found out that Joan has had a
kidney transplant.  She there for called Pat and visited with her.  Any way it
is now time to go to bed.</p>

to eat and helped Mae with the garden.  I then took the truck over to discount
tires and had them repair a tire that had a nail in it.  I also had them rotate
the tires.   Mae asked me to give her a Priesthood Blessing.  What a privilege
that was.  I don’t think she needs it near as much as I do.  After that Mae
went over to Scott and Mishelle’s and tended the children so Scott and Mishelle
could take a anniversary trip.  My PM run went well.  I irrigated and weeded
the garden.  I capsulated some Phyt-Aloe this evening.  Just as I was getting
things completed Bob came down and wanted me to go with him to see them set the
grave stone.  He has been quite concerned about getting it done.  We got there
before Andrea and ------ got there.  It didn’t take long to set the stone.  I
