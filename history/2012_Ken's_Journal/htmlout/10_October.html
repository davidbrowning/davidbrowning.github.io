got up this morning and cooked fish and hash browns (sweet potatoes, onions,
green peppers and eggs) and toast on the large grill.  After breakfast we
cleaned up and got everything packed to go home.  After the camp was ready we
went over to get the boat.  The store, cabins and boat dock closed yesterday at
noon.  We were told that we could still use the ramp to get our boat our
today.  The boat trailer was parked in front of the cabins and that area was
blocked off until we had to pull the trailer to the road to hook it onto the
pickup.  We then went out fishing for a couple of hours and caught five nice
fish.  At two PM we quite fishing and loaded the boat and headed for home.  Mae
and I took the lead as we left and so I had Mae put the GPS on.  Following the
GPS it took us a different way home and at first we were concerned about
following it but finally determined we would.  It took us a better and shorter
way home getting us there at 6:30PM even with a stop to get fried chicken.  We
got unpacked and then went to bed.</p>

very busy with house hold duties.  She is so concerned about me and my safety
and well being that I am afraid that she is almost neglecting her concerns for
herself.  I did get her to take a nap with me.  I rode Gail’s bike to work this
afternoon.  I made good time again both ways.  When I got home this afternoon I
started filleting the fish that we brought home from our trip.  While working
at that we turned on the TV and watched “A Love Affair to Remember” and then
started “A Patch of Blue” before we finished with the fish.  We stayed up and
finished that show also before going to bed.</p>

morning bus run went well.  Although I have reported some minor problems with
my bus, even writing them up, the shop has not found time to repair them.  I am
not sure what to do about those small problems.  After returning home this morning
I started on my journal.  Sandy stopped by and stayed about 2 hours.  Although
I tried to work on my journal and let Mae visit with Sandy, before long I ended
up in the conversation.  It became dinner time so we almost had to ask her to
leave.  After lunch I took a nap and then rode the bike to work.  My bus needed
coolant so I called Kate and told her to meet the bus up top.  Our run went
well.  It was announced that next week we would have a Utah Highway Patrol
inspection.  The problem with that is that right now my bus won’t pass the
inspection as the shop has never repaired the clearance light and the reflector
that are out or missing.  I have turned it in four times now but with no action
have taken place yet.  Mae was working on the new Family Tree program when I
got home.  It does sound like it will be even greater than the New Family
Search.  We ate dinner and then we tried transferring some information to the
Family Tree records.  We also turned on the Presidential Debate and listened to
that for a while and turned it off.  It looks like my bus job will help us with
some additional income.  I feel good that I am back to being current with my
journal entries.  This evening we took both the lap top and the desk top
computers over to Mike Dopp, who lives in West Kaysville, to have him clean the
virus off them.  He said it should take him about three days.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night so I got myself off to work.  Mae had
prepared everything that I needed during the night so it didn’t take much to
finish it.  The morning run went well but when I got back to the compound I did
go in and tell the shop that I had some clip lights out.  When I got home I
called Mike Dopp’s, someone that David recommended, to see about getting our
computers in for repair.  His wife answered and said that Mike did the repairs
in the evenings.  Right now he has seven computers scheduled.  I asked if I
could schedule ours and then when the date came up I could bring them in.  She
asked me the symptoms and when I told them that both were continually slowing
down.  She then said that if I continued to use them they would get worse until
they would completely shut down.  That would make them much harder to repair.  I
there ore said that we would bring them over this evening.  I guess that I will
just have to write my journal entries on paper in long hand.  I put the chicken
feeder mounted inside the coop.  It fits to tight so I left it for now.</p>

frost had killed most of the garden.  With a little persuasion with a sludge
hammer the feeder fit and went into place.  I almost worked to long on home
projects and so had to hurry for my PM run.  For being retired we sure seem to
keep very busy.  We had planned on attending a class tonight but when it came
down to it we just relaxed and watched a show on TV.  I did call Lois to see
how Rich is doing.  She said he doesn’t seem to know what is going on.  Hospice
comes daily to care for him and give him his bath.  Hospice is concerned that
Rich might get out of bed and fall again.  They wanted them to be concerned
about a guard gate over the stairs.  I told her that I would be more concerned
that if they put a gate above the stairs that he might become confused and try
to remove it, creating a bigger concern.</p>

morning session of Conference.  Bob cooked a nice lunch of steaks for us.  Mae
and I went to the store and bought some supplies for this evening.  We had fun
although we had to hurry to get back home for the Afternoon Session of
Conference.  I am so grateful for the the Gospel and the understanding and hope
that it gives to me.  Also I am so grateful for my beautiful sweet wife.  She
is so fun to be with and doing things together.  My boys came to the Priesthood
Session of conference with me, except for Jeff.  Tyler and Kylan also came with
their fathers.  Sandi and Nick and of course Shellie, Roy and their sons didn’t
come.  Most of the wife’s joined us at our place for dinner and to visit. 
Mishelle did come as she had other plans.  Mae had everything ready to eat when
we got there.  We had a very enjoyable time.  Mike and his family stayed
overnight with us.  Mike, Becky and I went to bed about mid-night but Mae,
Mattie, Page and Jessie stayed up playing “Murder in the Dark”.  </p>

was getting the food ready.  By 9AM we had fish, eggs and hash brown ready. 
After eating we enjoyed watching General Conference with Mike’s family.  The
messages were very good.  Mikes children are old enough to lesson and be
reverent during the talks.  When the morning session concluded Mae quickly got
things together for lunch.  We mainly had left over’s from last night.  The family
left for home at 1:30PM.  We went upstairs and watched the Afternoon Session
with Bob.  Following conference Mae and I went for a walk around the
neighborhood.  When we got home we read the Priesthood / Relief Society message
from the Ensign.  We went out to gather the eggs and noticed cantaloupe,
honeydew and some squash that looked good even the plants have been killed by
the cold.  The weather reports look like we are going to get colder so we
gathered them up and put them in the garage.  Before going to bed we watched a
movie on DVD.</p>

are working.  Other than the cold the run went well.  I was tired when I got
home so I set down with a blanket and soon went to sleep.  Mae let me sleep for
almost an hour.  The news was on when I woke and that was depressing.  I worked
on my boat getting it ready for winter.  I need some parts for the boat and it
looks like they will cost about $200 that I will have to pay before they will
be ordered in.  Right now we don’t have the money so they will have to wait. 
As soon as I got home from my PM run, I changed and we went up to Georgia and
Rick’s for Mae’s siblings get together.  Georgia had a nice dinner prepared and
we all had a very enjoyable get together.  The main topic of discussion is Kim
and Jeannine’s mission call.  They will enter the Mission Home just after
Christmas.  They have been called to serve in Sri Lanka which is a small island
just south of India.  We also played some table games.  Nolan had come with
Brice and Deanna this evening as Brandy and the girls had gone with Brandy’s
family to St. George for a couple of days.  Nolan was going to go with them but
due to his injuries he didn’t feel that he could sit that long.  We were very
impressed with Nolan and the pain that he is experiencing from his first
accident and now this latest one.  He takes morphine to control the pain level
but he has learned that if he takes enough to stop all the pain that he becomes
addicted to it.  He says that he therefore keeps his pain level, on a scale of
1 – 10 on a level of 3.  He is quite an amazing young man.  We were late
getting to bed tonight.</p>

have brought some problems with my bus to the shop 3 or 4 times previously
without getting any results.  That had upset me and I had determined that I
would not say more for I felt that I was just upsetting the shop.  However,
tomorrow there will be Utah Highway Patrol inspections and I know that my bus
will fell.  Kirk said that if I would bring my bus up top he would check it out. 
I did that before I came home.  When I got home I winterized my boat and
camper.  When I went back for my afternoon run my bus had been repaired.  The
PM run went well.  When I got home Mae was picking grapes so I helped her.  We
were surprised at how many grapes there were.  We then started cooking the
first batch of grapes into juice.  Mae hadn’t got the clamp off on the hose
right.  After getting the grapes onto the stove we set down to eat our dinner
and to watch a TV show.  I got up to get something and when I went into the
kitchen juice was all over.  We had lost about a quart of juice on the stove
and under the stove.  It was quite a mess.  We got it cleaned up but this time
we made sure that the clamp was on right.  When we finished that batch we still
got 3 quarts of juice.  It was 10 PM before we got to bed.</p>

I went back for the PM run.  When I got home I helped Mae with the grapes

the computer route sheets.  After our morning run I went in and talked to
Janice and she told me the same thing.  I went to Sherrie and we found out that
somehow Morgan Elementary had been dropped from our route.  That will make
quite a change.  I also found some other errors but was unable to get them
corrected today.  I will have to come in again tomorrow.  I did get my boat put
away for the year and also got the camper about winterized.  Mae has finished
the grapes and got a total of 35 quarts of juice put up.  We took a nap and
then I went back to my bus route.  After the run I fueled the bus before going
home.  Caption Call brought Bob a new phone that should help him with his phone
calls.  I was there to find out how it works so I can help Bob with it.  While
I ate my dinner we watched the TV movie “Little House on the Prairie”.  After
that we went to Kaysville and picked up our computers.  I am typing this entry
on to my lap top so that makes me happy.  It now 10 PM so we are going to bed.</p>

soccer game in which Conner played and David coached.  Conner’s team lost but it
was fun to be there to support him.  It was quite cold and when we left we turned
the heater on.  After getting home I didn’t feel well so I took a nap.  I then
worked on getting last week’s journal entries put into my journal.  It is good
to have my journal up to date on the computer.  Both computers seem to be
working well now.  After lunch Mae lay down and took a nap.  The weather has
turned off cold and we sure are feeling the affect.  I went upstairs to see how
Bob is doing.  I tried to get Bob to experiment with his phone.  Robert and
Pattie stopped in to see Bob.  I showed them Bob’s Caption Phone and Pattie was
especially excited about it.  She would like to have one as she can’t hear very
well on the phone.  They could only stay for a few minutes and had to leave. 
Pattie expressed her appreciation for Mae and I being here with Bob.  Bob and I
then got interested in the BYU vs. Organ football game.  Mae then came up and
reminded me that we only had 15 minutes before we were to be at Tyler’s basket
ball game.  We quickly left and got to the Davis Central gym just as the teams
were leaving the new gym and going to the old gym.  If we had been later we
would have never realized where they had gone.  David reminded that we could
have used our cell phone to contact them.  The game was good but the other team
was much better.  Tyler did very well.  After that game we brought Conner and
Emily back home with us as Tyler will have another game to play at 8PM.  We got
something to eat when we got home.  We then played table game with Conner and
Emily.  When David, Shauna and Tyler came we again played games and visited for
a little while.  After they left Mae and I took our showers.  We then turned on
a DVD that Sandi and Nick had suggested was a good show.  Mae had ordered it on
Net Flex and the rating was PG.  As we started the movie there was a little
profanity but as the movie progressed it got worse until we just shut it off
and went to bed discussed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t sleep the best last night so I didn’t get up until almost 8AM.  Shauna
brought Tyler, Emily and Connor at 8AM and they stayed with us.  Mae took them
to the Air Force Museum at Hill Field.  I started work in the garden.  When Mae
got home the children came out and helped me.  We got the garden clean up and
then I sprayed the area with a fungicide.  I also dug the water tap over and
moved it closer to the fence so that I can get the truck into the garden.  Mae
took the children swimming this afternoon.  Mae had made lasagna for dinner and
Davie came over after work and ate with us.  Shauna called as she was leaving
for home and Davie had her come here.  Mae prepared a plate for her also.  It
was nice visiting with them and the children really helped me with the garden. 
We took showers and went to bed early.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t sleep very well last night as I woke about every 2 hours.  We slept in
and then while Mae put her hair up, I prepared breakfast.  We went to the
Bountiful Temple and did initiatory and I was able to get 13 names out of the
21 that Sister McEntire asked me to do for her.  From the temple we to the Dr.
office where Dr. Larson examined me and he feels that I need to get the hernia
repaired.  We scheduled it for Dec. 20<sup>th</sup> but night change that.  We
then stopped and got us dome chicken for dinner and went to Peterson Marine for
some parts for my boat.  When we got home I finished spraying the garden area. 
Scott and Mishelle brought their family over for us to tend while they went
out.  They are fun but I realize that I am getting old.  It was late when we
went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
really slept in this morning.  It was almost 8AM when I woke.  Mae had been up
before 7 even though she didn’t sleep very well.  Before I had got my breakfast
Scott and Kylan were here to start work on the garden.  I got them ready to
take my pickup to the dumps.  Before they got away Jeff came and so Scott left
his keys so that we could take his truck up to get a load of mulch.  David and
Tyler came, so I got them started tilling the garden.  Jeff and I drove up to
the dumps and got there just as Scott and Kylan finished unloading my pickup. 
We filled both trucks with mulch and then stopped on the way home and bought
drinks and icies for all of them.  We unloaded my truck first and then I went
back to the dumps and got a load of compost.  When I got back they had finished
unloading Scott’s pickup and so started spreading the compost.  Mae then had
lunch ready so we stopped and ate.  We then finished spreading the compost and
I had then stop for today.  While spreading the mulch and compost Jeff had kept
the tiller going so over half the garden is tilled when I had the stop.  I can
finish the tilling next week.  Before they left they helped me put the tarp
over the camper.  I will have to get some grommets and the tool to install
them, plus some rope and get it tied on before a wind comes up but it is pulled
over.   We were sure grateful for our boys and grandchildren’s help as it did
save me a lot of work.  This evening we watched a movie on DVD before going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept well last night and got up for breakfast.  I had time to read the
lesson for Priesthood today.  It is a great lesson but I would like to have had
a lot more time to study if I was to give it.  Brother Thomas wasn’t sure who
was asked to give the lesson so I thought that I should read it.  I was glad
that I did as I got a lot more out of it.  We stayed for choirs practice after
but there weren’t many that stayed.  Mae and I went visiting to Lesley Foulas
right after we got home.  We thought that Bob understood that Sandy and Nick
were coming out this evening for dinner and we had planned on having fish. 
When we got home he was preparing dinner for all of us.  I hope that Bob wasn’t
hurt but we were really planning on fish for dinner.  We had a wonderful
evening with Sandi and Nick.  They left about 9PM and we got things put away
and I entered this entry before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 5:30 with both of us sleeping well.  Mae started the washing and
breakfast as I got ready.  Scott called.  He said that Mishelle had woke with a
migraine and asked if Mae could come over to care for the twins and get Kylan
and Ashley off to school.  We left the house at the same time.  My bus run went
well and when I returned home, Bob invited me to have breakfast with him.  He
sliced the pork roast that he had cooked yesterday and heated it in gravy.  I
put it over toast, while he put it over potatoes.  We both had plenty.  I then
went outside and finished roto-tilling the garden.  When I came inside I called
Mae and she had taken the twins to Dinosaur Park so that Mishelle could just
sleep and rest.  When we picked up the children at schools, I set up the bus
evacuation schedule with each school.  We will do the evacuation drill at
Morgan Elementary tomorrow and for Burton Elementary on Friday.  Mae was home
when I got home and she had dinner about ready.  She was very tired after
tending the children all day so we relaxed and watched a show on TV.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
had rain this morning but my runs went well.  After my morning run we prepared
lunch for Scott.  We had fried fish, hash browns and eggs.  We enjoyed having
Scott eat with us.  Mae turned the TV on while she folded clothes and we
watched part of a show, staring Spencer Tracy.  I had to leave for the PM run
before it ended so Mae had to tell me how it ended when I got home.  This
evening Bob and I went Home Teaching to the Thurman’s.  Mae and I Filled out
our Voters Ballets and got them ready to send in.  We also discussed plans to
go to Arizona the first part of December.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was cold this morning.  The runs went well but I am concerned that Kaylana who
is the first one to be picked up seems to wait until the bus pulls up and stops
before she gets ready to come out.  It took her over 4 minutes and that puts us
behind.  The route is squeezed to meet the time schedule but if everyone is
ready we can make it ok.  Kaylana being late puts undue pressure but I am not
sure how to handle it.  Kayte feels that we should get to her place earlier and
wait.  I’m not sure.  Mae had something ready for me to eat when I got home.  I
got cold on the run and after getting home Mae had me take a nap.  She put the
electric throw over me to warm me up.  Later Bob and I took the pickup over to
Western Radiator to have it repaired.  After I left for the PM run Mae got on
the computer and booked us flights with Allegiant Airlines to fly out of Ogden
to Mesa November 30 and return December 10.   After I finished the bus run I
went into the office and scheduled the time off for that trip.  After getting
home I gathered the eggs, set the water can on the electric base and put a
screen over the holed in the coop ceiling.  Mae had dinner ready when I came in. 
After dinner Mae attended the Book Group.  I watch a couple “Gun Smoke” and a
“Bonanza” show.  I was working on my journal when Mae came home.  After she got
home she realized that she had forgot her book at Grams, so I drove her back
over to get it.</p>

but the main problem was when we got to the school, parents were congesting the
parking lot.  I was given a change to my route as of Monday.  I will have a new
pre-school child to take in.  This evening Mae and I watched a couple of movies
on TV.  </p>

was cold but the roads were clear and the run went well.  When we got to the
school we had a practice emergency evacuation drill.  It went ok.  When I got
back to the bus compound I turned in my report and corrected my days I need off
for the hernia operation.  Bob prepared breakfast of fish and fried potatoes
for us.  I then took a nap as Mae had left to take Sister Olsen to a Doctor’s
appointment.  When I got up I did a batch of indexing on the computer before I
went back to work.  The PM run went well.  when I got home Mae and I went out
to eat at the Golden Corral.  We then went to C.A.L. Ranch and looked at
boots.  We really didn’t see much that we wanted.  We took some Birthday gifts
over to Kaitlyn and Kaden for their 4<sup>th</sup> Birthday calibration.  After
they had cake and ice cream we all went to the Kaysville Theater where we
watched “Ice Age 3 or 4”.  It was 9:30PM when we got home.  I entered this
entry and we then watched a show on DVD before going to bed.</p>

Temple we went out to eat at the Chuck-A-Rama.  We stopped at Ream’s and looked
at cowboy boots and then went to CAL Ranch and bought some warm boots for me to
wear on the bus.  We also bought Mae a dressy sweater for her to wear to
Church.  I called David and found out that Tyler has a basketball game to play
at 6PM.  That gave us time to buy a few things at the grocery store before
going to watch the game.  After getting home I gathered the eggs and we ate a
light super.  It has just been a fun day being with my sweetheart.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night.  We had to hurry this morning as we went up
to Jeff and Gail’s before 8AM.  Jeff is out of town with work so we helped Gail
get the children ready and then we all drove up to Morgan, to the Porterville
Chapel.  Kim, Jeanenne and Kaleesee all spoke in their Sacrament meeting briar
to their leaving on mission calls.  Kaleesee has been called to serve in the
Ventura, California mission.  That is the area where we served our Church
Service mission.  She will be leaving November the 7<sup>th</sup> and will be
in the M.T.C. in Provo for three months while she learns Spanish.  Kim and
Jeanenne will enter the M.T.C. in Provo on about the 28<sup>th</sup> of
November prior to them going to Bengaluru India Mission and will serve Sri
Lanka.  All of them did very well in their talks and we sure enjoyed the
meeting.  After the meeting we went to Jeanenne and Kim’s home where we joined
with family and friends for a lunch and to wish them well.  We got back to
Gail’s home where Gail and Mae went through the pictures that had been taken of
her family here at our home in July.  I took a nap while they were doing that. 
After getting home we got some super.  Mae and I worked on Family Tree for a
while but I think that I became more confused.  I added this entry and quite
for the night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning we had a new kindergarten to take to Morgan elementary.  It changed our
route time by 15 minutes.  The run went well.  I also wore my new boots and my
feet kept warm.  After returning home I butchered three of our hens.  Two of
them had quite laying.  The third chicken was losing its feathers but it was
still laying.  I decided to kill it anyway and found three eggs forming.  The
other thing that I saw when I cleaned the chickens was that all three had brown
soft livers.  I am concerned about that and will have to check it out further. 
The PM run also went well and it warmed up this afternoon.  Bob prepared dinner
at 5:30 PM for us.  He cooked liver and onions for he and I and chicken for
Mae.  Mae has been busy most of the day with cleaning and organizing the
storage, along with washing and all the other everyday items.  She really amazes
me with all she does.  I got a voice message from Lois and she said that Rich
is getting much worse.  She said that he doesn’t respond much and seldom gets
up at all.  This evening Mae and I watched a couple of shows on TV before going
to bed.</p>

woke with a dream at 3:30AM and didn’t really go back to sleep.  It caught up
with me at the end of my run.  After letting the last of the children off the
bus I seem to relax and that is when I can get sleepy.  Before going home I went
to the grocery store for some items for Mae.  I checked the chickens and added
feed to the feeder.  I had a little time before lunch so I took a nap.  Scott
came over for lunch with us.  We sure enjoy having him come by.  I worked on a
batch of indexing and got 2/3s completed when I had to go for the PM run.  I
tried to save my work but it would not save.  I just left it up and went to
work.  My PM run went well.  After we ate dinner I brought the index batch back
up.  All was ok so I finished entering the batch.  When I tried to submit the
batch it could not accept it.  I tried several times without success and so I
called for help.  They said that they were having problems with the server and
asked me to just wait and try later.  Before going to bed Mae and I watched a
Netflix movie “Believe in Me” and really enjoyed it.</p>

Bob was having trouble with his new phone so I went up to see what I could do. 
I finally called customer support and they had me unplug the power to the phone
for a minute.  That let the phone reset itself.  When we replaced the plug the
phone restarted ok.   I went over to Dee Francom’s and helped him get
registered on Indexing.  We then pulled up some batches and worked on those.  I
got on the Indexing and was able to submit the batch that I finished
yesterday.  This time the program worked.  I called Randy to see if he would
like to go fishing on Monday but only got his message machine.  I also called
Nick about fishing and he is ready for it.  My PM run went well and we finished
it early as we had three that didn’t ride home this afternoon.  After returning
home Mae had dinner ready.  We watched “Touched by an Angel” while we ate.  Mae
read some from Allen Burges book but I fell asleep.  I worked on my journal,
then took a shower before going to bed.  (Just a note: I sure have a wonderful
wife and sweetheart!!!)</p>
