didn’t sleep well last night so she slept in after first getting my breakfast
ready for me to finish.  I got a call before leaving for my run from Kate, to
tell me that she is taking off today and that I will have a substitute on my
bus.  My sub arrived in time and the run went well.  Becky did a good time job
caring for the children.  In between the AM and PM runs I put the shell back on
the pickup and installed my new trolling plate.  The holes did not match the ones
on the motor.  When I compared the old trolling plate I realized that the
original trolling plate had been re-drilled so I re-drilled the new plate and
it worked great.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  I had time to take a
short nap and then I went to a meeting with Brother Morgan and Brother
Higgley.  We discussed the organization of our Home Teaching.  Mae went to a
meeting with Jennie Porter.  She didn’t get home until 9:30PM.</p>

didn’t sleep well so I got myself off to work.  I forgot that today is Friday
and therefore go in ½ hour later until I got to the bus compound.  I decided to
take advantage of some extra time and took the bus up top and filled the
coolant as it was low.  I called Kate to tell her that I was up top but she is
still sick.  I told her that I had better look for my sub-assistant.  At that I
heard someone say “Here I am” and I looked and it was Becky, the one that rode
with me yesterday.  After filling the coolant I still had extra time so I drove
over to the fuel pumps.  I just shut the bus off when Lois called me.  She told
me that Rich had passed away about 5:30AM in his sleep, very peaceful.  In my
personal prayers this morning I had the feeling that Rich would soon pass on. 
Although we will miss him I sure have a good feeling about it.  Elise told me
that one of the granddaughters made the comment that Grandpa can now see
colors.  My run went well and when I got home I started calling family
members.  I had called most of them and still had time to take a short nap
before going on the PM route.  Just as we were finishing the run the
announcement came over the intercom that HAFB had a Red Alert and the buses
could get on the base but no one know how it would be before they could get off
the base.  The Dispatch called for help with some of the schools to take
children home.  After talking to my assistant I called in and told them that we
had just let the last child of at her home so could help.  We were asked to
take bus 302’s Special Ed children home from Syracuse High.  We went there and
picked up 5 children and the teachers gave us addresses.  It took us quite a
while even with Dispatch’s help to find the homes without any route sheets. 
When I finished and went home Mae and I drove to a home in West Point and got a
box of toilet tissue that Sandy had ordered for us.  We then went to Chick-felt
and had a sandwich and fries.  We then drove to the Layton Park and walked
around for a little while.  It is sure fun being with Mae.  After getting home
we gathered the eggs, Barbara returned my call from earlier, she also gave me
Billie’s number and I called him and I typed this entry before we went to bed. 
We watched a show before going to sleep.</p>

of us slept very well last night so it was we didn’t get up until 7:30.  We
went to the Bountiful Temple and went on the 10 AM session.  We got home at
1PM.  I worked on my boat for a while but then had a 4PM Stake Conference
Priesthood session that I attended.  When I got home from that we had to hurry
and eat and then went to an open house for Brett Ericksen and his new wife
Kylie.  We only spent a few minutes there and then went to our Stake Center for
the evening session of Sake Conference.  When we got back home I did some more
work on the boat.  Mae then went with me and we went to Wal-Mart and bought
some Silicone.  We then went to Maverick and fueled the boat and pickup.  It’s
getting late but we are going off Day Light Saving Time.</p>

conference was very good with very inspirational talks and Sister Fallas did a
very good job with a Stake Youth Choir.  Bob prepared a nice dinner for Mae and
I after we got home.  This evening Mae and I went over to Jeff’s.  Jeff and
Gail had the kids all fed and a vitio on for them.  Jeff had popped pop-corn
and was ready when we got there.  We played a game of Rook and quite when Mae
and Gail got out of the hole, while Jeff and I were still in the hole.  We then
played one hand of Rummy.  Even with that it was about 8PM when we got home. 
we quickly got thing ready for me to go in the morning.</p>

House at 4:30AM.  We got to Strawberry and was on the water about 6AM.  We
fished for almost 3 hours with only get one bite.  My Fish Finder is not
working plus there was a screw hole that I didn’t get plugged so we had water
entering the boat.  We were very glad that the bilge pump was working.  We
moved to other areas on the lake and started catching fish.  We fished all day
and caught 4 large rainbow trout and 5 slot size cut trout.  We had to relies
several cut trout’s that we over 15 inches and less that 22 inches.  I got home
after 9PM and then had to clean all the fish before going to bed.</p>

took my AM run and it went well although Kate came back she still isn’t feeling
very well.  My 2<sup>nd</sup> child was 3 minutes late when they finally opened
their door and was another 2 to 3 minutes before she got on the bus.  I really
should have drove off and left her.  This put me behind and I could not make it
up and so was late on the rest of my schedule.  After the run I drove to Durk’s
Plumbing and bought a pop-up assembly for the bathroom sink.  After getting
home I took a nap.  Mae had me grill chicken for lunch.  She thought that Scott
was coming for lunch but he had a meeting and couldn’t make it.  Bob ate lunch with
us but we still had plenty to eat.  I spent the rest of the time making calls
concerning Rich’s funeral.  My PM run went well.  After dinner I filet the fish
and packaged them.  I got this entry done and then Mae and I watched a show.</p>

didn’t sleep well last night and so I let her sleep in and I got myself off to
work.  As I started my run I determined in my mind that if Kaylana wasn’t out
by 7:45 am I would drive off without her.  We got to her place by 7:41, 2 minutes
early and she came out at 7:42.  Everything else went smooth and we ended up at
school 5 minutes early.  After getting home, I had some toast and some juice,
then I went to work on my boat.  I finished getting it winterized and put away
before noon.  Mae went with Bob to the eye Doctor’s as he may need someone to
drive him back.  I lay down to take a nap when Shellie called.  We checked the
calendar and Mae and I will get back from her place on December 10.  She will
have Quint fly down to Salt Lake on the 11<sup>th</sup> and stay the night with
us and we will take him to the M.T.C. on the 12<sup>th</sup>.  I laid down and
took a nap and though I had set the timer on the stove I slept thru it.  I woke
about ½ hour before I had to leave.  Just as I was leaving, Stacy called with
some questions about Rich’s funeral.  I made it to work ok and the run went
well.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got home.  I put the tools away and
gathered the eggs before we ate.  While eating we watched a show on TV.  We
also wrapped some presents for the grandchildren’s Christmas Party that Mae is
holding.  I went over to the church and helped Morgan Thomas set up chairs and
tables for the funeral lunching of Sister Probert’s mother.  I worked on my
journal and we went to bed.</p>

viewing of Betty Joan Moulton, Jackie Probert’s mother.  We were very glad and
thankful that we did.  Mae went back to the funeral to support Jackie.  Bob and
I raked the leaves and mulched them with the lawn mower.  I took the pickup
this afternoon as Mae had a lot of chasing to do.  My PM run went well.  I
replaced the pop-up drain in the bathroom sink.  That took me longer than it
should have.  After dinner I wrote more of my thoughts of Rich.  Mae filled our

but many of the other drivers seem to have trouble with their routes.  After
getting home Mae and I had a grapefruit for a snack, then I took a nap.  I
worked on some of my remembrances of Rich.  I also wrapped Mae’s Christmas
present.  Mae was going to have chicken breasts for dinner so I set up the
grill and cooked them outside in the snow storm.  Sandi was later getting here
as they really got a lot of snow out in Tooele.  After dinner Sandi, Mae and I

and as always they were very good.  We got over 6” of snow during the night.  I
was concerned about the driving condition so we took Sandi’s truck.  I put a
shovel and my tow chain and brought boots and coveralls just to be safe.  We
stopped at Lowes and I bought two bags of salt to have in the back of the truck
for extra traction.  As we left the roads were looking bad but the further we
went the better the roads were.  Gail called us and they were about 30 minutes
ahead of us.  They said that the roads were good until you got to Malad and
then the bridges and overpasses had black ice.  He warned us to be careful at
those areas as they already saw some cars that were wrecked and off the road. 
We then found out that Scott and his family was just a few minutes behind us. 
It took us just 2 hours to get to Pocatello.  The funeral was well attended
with the chapel over flowing.  Almost all of Rich’s children and their spouses,
grandchildren and spouses and great grandchildren along with many other family
and friends plus so many ward family.  The program was very well planned with
the theme being the D &amp; C 6:7 “Behold he that hath Eternal Life is Rich”. 
Rich’s daughters read a life history that Rich had written.  Rex gave a talk
and did a very good job in tying in Rich’s life, the love he had for Lois, his
family and the testimony of he lived of the Gospel of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints.   Following the Chapel services the Pocatello Veterans Honor Guard
presented Military Honors at the cemetery.  At the conclusion the Mink Creek
Ward Relief Society served a wonderful meal for the Family members.  We enjoyed
visiting with many that we only see on special occasions such as this.  We had
all but Shellie of our children that attended Rich’s funeral.  Bob, Sandi, Mae
and I returned home at 3PM with Sandi taking another 1 ¾ hour to get to
Tooele.   Mae and I watched 2 Hallmark shows on TV before going to bed.</p>

get any more snow.  We attended our meetings and then we stayed for choir

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
stayed home as I didn’t feel well.  I slept a lot and watched several programs
on BYUTV.  This evening Mae and I watched a couple of Christmas shows on Hall
Mark.  I guess they were alright but they are all worldly.  I fear that outside
the Church there is very little that is not worldly.  Just before going to bed
Mae got a TEX letting her know that Deanna Davis passed away this afternoon. 
Mae had become very close to her and she sure helped Mae.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep well last night so I got myself off to work.  Work went well.  Mae
got up about 8AM and was still doing her morning exercises when I got home.  I
had a little snack and then took a long nap.  Feeling much better when I woke I
got on the computer and did a batch on Indexing.  My PM run went well also. 
After getting home I created a form for sign in and out for our pre-school
children.  We attended Emily’s violin recital this evening.  Emily did very
well and it is exciting to see her improvement each time.  David said that they
never have to remind her of her practice, she does it on her own.  After we got
home I continued working on my form for the Pre-School children.  It was after
10PM when we went to bed.</p>

slept well last night.  That seems to be our age, worrying about how we sleep. 
I feel some better but this stuff is still working on me.  I wasn’t feel very
good when I returned home so I went back to bed for over 2 hours.  I worked on
my form but under the new Word Perfect it doesn’t allow changes like before.  I
guess they want you to use Excel and I am not trained on that.  Bob cooked us a
apple pie using Agave in place of sugar.  It is sure good but we are a little
concerned about the flour.  Mae made a batch of bread using Spelt flower and
that sure looks good.  She made 5 large loaves and had dough left over so is
making scones for lunch.  My PM run went well and I have the rest of the week
off because of the Thanksgiving Holiday.  We watched a couple of shows on TV
but was kind of disappointed with them.</p>

slept in this morning although I was up from 2AM until after 4AM when I finally
fell asleep in the recliner.  Mae made us wonderful waffles for breakfast. 
Time went fast and I haven’t felt very well today.  Mae went to the funeral of
Deanna Davis.  She was quite an inspirational woman.  I thought of watching TV
but didn’t want to waist the day so I worked on indexing.  It was after 5PM
when Mae got home.  I was just finishing the 2<sup>nd</sup> batch of indexing
when she got home.  We called Sandi and wished her a Happy Birthday.  Our
chickens laid 8 eggs today.  I had planned on butchering them because they
weren’t laying enough to pay for their food and other expenses.  We turned the
TV on while we ate dinner and ended up watching two Hallmark Christmas shows
that were pretty good.  During the commercial breaks (which on Hallmark equal
50 % of the time) we would push the mute button and read articles from the
Ensign.  We were able to get through three articles.  In Elder Russell M.
Nelson’s article “Ask the Missionaries!  They can Help You!” we were still left
pondering “What happened to two of our boys while they were on their
missions”?  I really don’t feel very well tonight.  After typing this entry we
went to bed about 11PM.</p>

woke early and laid in bed for a little while.  I finally got up and found that
it was 4:40AM.  I went into the front room and tried sleeping in the recliner
but couldn’t.  I got up and read my scriptures before again trying without
success.  At 8AM Mae came in and got me to go back to bed.  After a while I got
up and had some cereal with Mae for breakfast.  I then started typing a story
that I thought of about some of the events that took place in 1952 when we
moved from Victor to Ogden.  We went to Mimis, a restaurant in Salt Lake, where
we met with Sandi, Chelci, Steve, Nathan and Addison, for Thanksgiving dinner. 
We had a very enjoyable visit and a very good dinner.  Mae and I returned home
and relaxed together.  I am still not feeling the best so really didn’t feel
like being with very many today.  We played Sevens at which I won, Rummy at
which Mae won and one set of Rummy Cube which Mae won.  We watched two
Christmas shows on the Hall Mark channel on TV.  It was mid-night when we went
to bed.</p>

slept in getting up about 8AM.  I prepared our turkey and got it cooking while
Mae got us some breakfast.  I still wasn’t feeling very well so took some Tylenol
and went to sleep in the recliner for a while.   When I woke I worked on some
of my personal history.  Mae was busy preparing another Thanksgiving dinner for
just Bob and the two of us.  She also made a tossed salad for us to take up to
Sandi and Nike’s condo tomorrow.  The dinner was very good but I feel bad that
Mae did so much work.  This afternoon I worked more on my personal history.  I
was going to work on Indexing but the server is down and won’t let me in. 
Probably because of the Thanksgiving Holiday.  We watched a show that we
ordered on DVD “Calamity Jane”, with Doris Day.  It was ok but kind of dumb. 
We took showers before going to bed.</p>

7am and slept for another hour.  We ate breakfast, took care of the chickens
and went to Park City.  We spent the day with Sandi and Nick and their
families.  We played several games and enjoyed being with everyone.  Mae and I
came back home leaving there after 8PM.  We are having trouble getting the
trunk of the car to lock shut.  It looks like I will have to replace the lock
on the trunk.  Mae took a shower and washed her hail before we went to bed.  I
still am not feeling the best.</p>

felt some better this morning so I attended my meetings.  When we returned Mae
prepared a nice dinner left over from Thanksgiving.  We invited Bob to join
us.  After dinner Mae and I laid down and took a nap.  Georgia called shortly
after we laid down so that ended Mae’s nap.  I slept for about 1 ½ hours before
I woke.  I worked on some of my life history most of the rest of the day.  I
did take my Lap Top over to Glenn Higgley’s so he could order me a new battery
pack for the computer.  It was about 10PM when we went to bed.  It sure takes
me a lot of time to do my journal and write on my life history.  Sometimes I
question if it is worth while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Neither
Mae nor I slept very well.  I got up about 11:15pm and Mae was up, she hadn’t
gone to sleep.  I went back to bed and slept almost too well because I had
forgotten to set the alarm and it was 6:25am when I woke and I had to leave by
6:45am.  I had to hurry.  Things went well and knowing that Mae might still be
asleep, I went to the Work Care Clinic and got a form for my Dr. to fill out
stating that I have had a Sleep Apnea examination.  When I got home Mae was
just getting up.  She hadn’t gone to sleep until almost 6am.  I did some
checking on a new latch for the trunk on the car and from the dealer it would
cost $231.96 plus sales tax.  I tried to find one on the computer but didn’t
have any luck there either.  Mae fixed me something to eat and I took a nap. 
When I got up I help Mae get the Christmas decorations out.  It was then time
to go again.  I stopped in to Sherrie’s office and asked for Friday afternoon
of.  She approved it so now we will have no questions about getting to the
airport in time for our flight to Arizona.  My pm route went well.  Roy called
me while I was on the bus so I returned his call.  He was just returning a call
I made to him before Thanksgiving.  They had been to their children’s for the
Holliday.  My run went well and when I returned to the bus compound I fueled
the bus before going home.  Mae had dinner ready when I got there.  We watched
a show on TV.  Mae did more decorating for Christmas than she did watching the
show.  Shortly after 9PM we went to bed.  I hope Mae can sleep better tonight.</p>

both slept better last night and so were up on time.  After my morning run all
Special Ed drivers and their assistance had a meeting to attend.  After the
meeting I went up to Jeff and Gail’s and fastened up a piece of soffit that was
starting to hang down.  Mae had lunch ready when I got home.  Bob and I mulched
the fall leaves.  I also got on top of the carport and cleaned the leaves and
branches of it.  I took a 12 minute nap and then took my PM run.  A couple of
the pre-school children got a little unruly so Kate visited with their Mothers
when we took them home.  After dinner this evening Bob helped me set up the
camp stove so that we can butcher more chickens tomorrow.  We are not getting
enough eggs to break even now.  It was after 8PM so Mae and I watched a movie
from Netflix before going to sleep.  The movie was “The Trial of Old Drum”.</p>

more chickens.  I’m not sure but maybe I should have butchered all of them. 
Mae went into the Ogden Family History center and attended a class on the new
Family Tree.  Bob cooked us another apple pie and it is sure good, I had a
piece of it before I left for the PM run.  This evening Mae and I took some
poinsettias around to Sister Fallis, Sister Shauna Hughes, Sister Olsen and
Sister Southard.  I will have some to take to my Home Teaching families
tomorrow when Bob and I go Home Teaching.   We watched a Christmas show on TV

chicken food.  I got the feeder filled for the chickens so that Bob will have
little to do except gather the eggs.  I trimmed the raspberry and the roses
before getting some lunch.  I took a nap and then started this entry.  Mae got
home before I woke from my nap.  We took a poinsettia to the Casey’s, the
Therman’s and the Johnston’s as Bob and I went home teaching this evening.  It
was 9:30PM when we got home.  Mae and I soon went to bed.</p>

woke early with my mask bothering me.  I slept the rest of the night in the
rocker.  Mae woke me but as it is Friday I have an extra few minutes so we just
snuggled in bed for a few more minutes.  My bus run went well.  we did some
packing, then Mae gave me a haircut.  I thought everything was about ready so I
laid down and took a nap.  When I got up I found that Mae had gone out and
cleaned the chicken nests.  I was a little upset with her as she could have
woke me to do that.  She works to hard!  We had lunch and then got ready for
Bob to take us to the airport.  Bob took us to the Ogden Airport, leaving about
1:45 PM.  We were not sure how to get to the terminal and when we found it was
so small and very few signs to direct us.  We went inside wondering if we were
at the where we should be.  Bob waited for us until we were sure but we finally
found the ticket counter and it only had two check in counters.  By the time of
departure there was a full plane of passengers.  Alliance is the only airline
that flies into the Ogden Airport and they only fly on Mondays and Fridays to
and from Phoenix-Mesa airport.  The air plane looked about the length of the
old DC-10 that Hughes Air West use to fly but wider so that there were 5 seats
across.  It was a comfortable flight but there was no complementary
refreshments served but I guess that is normal now and especially on short
flights.  The rout took us west and then straight south.  We were soon above
the cloud at 33,000 feet.  The clouds broke and we were able to Lake Powel and
were then back over the clouds until just before getting to Mesa and Queen
Creek area.  Roy and Shellie were at the airport to meet us.  We stopped at the
Wal-Mart  grocery store where Mae and Shellie went in for just a few items. 
While they did that Roy and I went over to the pizza place and ordered pizza
for the boys.  When we got to Roy and Shellie’s they cooked fish (tilapia) ,
baked sweet potatoes and broccoli.  Jase then wanted us to see their boat.  It
is very nice and you could about us my boat as a spare tire for it.  We enjoyed
visiting and then watched a movie “Felicia” that was a cute show.  Quint and
Kevis left shortly after we got here to go to some friends home to play games. 
They got home just after the movie ended.  Before we went to bed, Kevis showed
us some of his Karate moves.  Quint also showed Mae some of his digital
paintings.  She was very impressed.  We were tired when we went to bed after
mid-night.</p>
