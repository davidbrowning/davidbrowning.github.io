<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early this morning with still a realization of my weaknesses in the way I
speak to my sweetheart.  I realize that I am very weak in many of my
characteristic and know that I need help to be the person worthy of my companion
and the companionship on my Lord and Savior.  The weather has changed and is
now storming.  I put my boat back away and took care of the chickens and
rabbits.  I am afraid that my one white doe is not well and wonder if I should
butcher her now or wait to see if she gets better.  Mae prepared French toast
for breakfast.  After eating we enjoyed the Morning Session of General
Conference.  I called Randy and we decided to change our fishing trip until
next Thursday, due to the bad weather.  I also called Tyler and we will try to
take him, Emily and Connor fishing on Friday.   Mae made a nice lunch and we
had Bob come down to eat with us.  This afternoon we again enjoyed the last
Session of General Conference.  Mae and I drove over to the rehabilitation
center to visit Sister Joanne Von Niederhauser.  She is doing very well.  We
didn’t stay long as they had family there.  Mae worked on pictures of her
mother’s that I had digitized before we left on our first mission.  She used
the desk top computer this evening while I used the lap top to work on my
journals.  It takes me quite a while as I am digitizing my Five Year Diary from
1970 to 1974.  This is when I started keeping a diary.  We went into our
bedroom and watched another J.A.G. series before we went to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning as our school district is on Spring Break for this week. 
After breakfast I fed the animals and then dug post holes and set standards for
a volley ball net and two fence post.  I mixed cement and set the post and a
base for the standards.  Bob invited us up for lunch as he had made a very good
stew.  This afternoon Mae and I went up to Cindy Bennet’s and got three more
rabbits from her.  The one has an inner ear infection and has lost its equilibrant. 
I just put it out of its suffering.  The other two are ok to rise for meat.  We
stopped on the way home and bought chicken and rabbit feed.  We then changed
vehicles and went into Ogden where I bought a set of scales.  We stopped at
Good Earth and sold them 5 dozen eggs and bought some other things we needed. 
On the way home from there we bought a Sub-Way sandwich for dinner.  Mae went
up to Jeff and Gail’s where she tended their children while Gail went to a
class.  Jeff is out of town on business.  I worked on Indexing for over 2 ½
hours getting one batch done this evening.  I watched the last of one show but
Mae still hadn’t got home and it was after 10pm.  I started another show when
Mae got home so we watched it.  It was after mid-night before we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in but I went pretty hard the rest of the day.  I took care of the
animals, went over to Scott’s and put a 2<sup>nd</sup> coat of mud on the
basement.  Mae had lunch ready when I got home.  I did take a short nap and then
trimmed the pear tree and the plum tree.  I removed the one plum tree and
hauled it away.  Bob and I then moved the fence on the east side of the garden
and got it almost finished before coming in for super.  After eating I entered
the entry and we soon went to bed.  Mae has been busy with family Easter plans;
Siblings get to gather and the Bushnell family reunion.  She also went shopping
and bought a volley ball and net.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up at 4am and found 2 notes from Mae.  She hadn’t been to sleep by 1:30am
and the 2<sup>nd</sup> was that she hadn’t been to sleep until after 3am.  I
let her sleep and got myself off.  Randy and I went fishing at East Canon
reservoir.  We got on the lake just as the sun rose.  We had a good time and
had good luck.  We caught the last of our limits about 1pm and was home about
3pm.  Mae had been with Michelle and the children to Dinosaur Park and had just
got home before I did.  Scott came to our place when he got off work.  Mae
prepared dinner for all of us.  Scott and I started to set up the volley ball
net but found out that the measurements we used did not fit the net Mae
bought.  I will have to set a new hole for the one pole.  After Scott, Michelle
and the children left we watched a couple of western movies on TV before we
went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in somewhat, as Bob prepared breakfast of biscuits and gravy and baked
fish.  We ate at 9am.  I had fed the animals before we ate.  I set the garden
up to water with the hose.  The secondary water isn’t on yet and the ground is
very dry.  I removed the west volleyball standard and reset it further west.  I
took Bob with me and we purchased salt for the water softener, bark to put
around the rose bushes, cement to reset the volleyball standard and parts to
remodel the garden gate.  Mae boiled 6 dozen eggs this morning and then Gail
and their children came over and enjoyed coloring them.  I got all the jobs
done before we went to the Bountiful Temple this evening.  I am experiencing
quite a bit of pain this evening.  After getting home from the Temple I made
calls on last months Home Teaching reports.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                As
I entered the date I couldn’t help but realize that it has been 182 years ago
today that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was officially
organized.  It is also the anniversary day of the birth of Our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ.  It has snowed quite heavy during the night and is still snowing
lightly at 10am.  I have talked to David and we determined that we would cancel
plans to take Tyler and Connor fishing today.  I have taken care of my animals
and now going to try indexing another batch of 1940 census.  I worked on
today’s batch for over 4 hours.  It was a difficult patch because of the poor
handwriting of the one taking the census.  Mae and I laid in the recliners and
took a short nap and then went into Ogden.  We stopped at AmeriGas to see if
they can repair the gas tank for the camper but they said that the company that
makes that tank doesn’t make parts, they just sell new tanks.  We left and went
to Cosco for a few items.  After that we went out to eat at Chuck-A-Rama.  This
evening we watched a show on TV before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                The
weather was perfect for Mae’s Easter Party with our family.  All the boys and
their families came.  I set up the volleyball standards and net and that was a
good success with a lot of fun.  The children had fun finding Easter Eggs. 
Everyone helped with dinner items and so lunch went well.  The boys helped with
the putting away tables and the volley ball net and standards.  The children
had fun gathering the eggs from the chickens.  Ben found that some of the
chickens are laying eggs underneath the storage shed so I nailed boards to stop
them from getting underneath the shed again.  It was about 7pm when they all
went home.  I helped Mae finish putting the toys away.  Bob came down just as I
turned on a show on TV.  He stayed and watched it with me.  After the show I
helped Mae vacuum the apartment.  We got things ready to go to Powder Ridge
tomorrow evening.  It is almost 10pm and we still need to take showers.  So we
will go to bed, very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3:45am and didn’t sleep well after that.  When Mae got up she said that
she didn’t sleep very well either.  We must have been too tired after
yesterday’s activity.  It is a beautiful Easter morning.  I took care of the
animals and while doing that I saw Brother Kelley Bodily out so I called to him
with a good morning.  He said it was until he walked down stairs and found that
his water heater was leaking.  I loaned him my wet vacuum and he said that was
enough.  We attended our normal Sunday meetings.  Mae and I stayed for a short
choir practice.  Bob had dinner ready when we got home.  Bob’s family came over
just as we were finishing dinner.  His grand children wanted to see the
chickens and rabbits so I went out with them so that they wouldn’t chase them
like they did last time.  They had upset the chickens until they quite laying
for a couple of days.  I felt bad that I couldn’t be in helping Mae get things
ready to go.  We did get away about 5PM, stopping on the way at Kim’s home to
pick up some items they had gone off without.  When we got to Powder Ridge and
located the condo, Bryce and Deanna and Kim and Jeanenne were already there. 
Rick and Georgia soon came.  We enjoyed a good discussion lead by Rick about
the Crucifixion of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  We also watched an
excellent movie of John Tanner.  It has been a very interesting and an
enjoyable evening.  It was after mid-night before we got to bed.</p>

and I sleepy on twine beds but my mattress was very hard and I woke with quite
a back ache.  We had a wonderful day visiting and doing several activities. 
Our meals were good and all we could eat.  Bryce and I used his snow shoes and
enjoyed a walk around the hills on what snow there is left.  The ski lift is
still running and there were several that were still using the run.  I found
out how old I am getting when Rick, Bryce, Kim and I played a little
basketball.  I pulled a muscle in my right leg and that really hurt.  This
evening Bryce and I went to the club house and soaked in the hot tub and
showered there.  I put liniment on my leg and between the two it took away most
of the pain.  Quite a bit of time was used discussing the Bushnell Reunion
plans and assignments.  We also played some table games and ended the night by
watching the first half of a movie.  By the name of the movie I didn’t
recognize it but when it started I remembered that we had seen it.  It is still
a fun movie.  It was mid-night before we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept much better as Mae changed beds with me.  She sleeps on her back where I sleep
on my sides so the softer bed helped me and Mae slept ok on the firmer bed.  We
got up about 7:30am and started the day.  I wasn’t able to read my scriptures
because my IPod was low on power and I had forgotten to bring the connecting
cable to my lap top.  We packed and cleaned up the condo and had a very nice
breakfast with everyone helping.  We got everything ready to leave and then
took time to watch the last of the movie we started last night.  The title was
“Second Hand Lion” and it was sure a cute movie.  After getting home I took a
short nap before we ate lunch.  Mae then went over to Scott and Michelle’s
where she tended Kaitlin while Michelle took Kaden to the Dr. for a checkup. 
He is feeling much better.  I went to work on the pickup and installed new
front break on it.  The old ones were completely gone and were just starting to
scratch the brake drums.  I got a couple of calls on my bus route this
afternoon.  First they informed me that I am getting another student to take
home after school.  The sub-driver called me and said that my bus was in the
shop for repair and I would have to get a sub bus for tomorrow morning.  This
evening Mae and Ashley attended a special Grandmother and Grand Daughters
Relief Society program.  I sure appreciated Bob’s help while I was repairing
the pickup.  I came in and got myself some super at PM.  I turned on the TV but
the show “Air Force 1” was rated R so I turned to another channel and saw that
“The Other Side of Heaven” was just starting so I watched that.  Mae got home
before it finished.  She said that they had a very good evening.  We watched
the end of the show and then I entered my journal entry for today.  Good-night!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                When
I checked my bus I had problems so I had to take a spare bus this morning.  The
rout went well and after completing it I stayed at to office to check on some
information.  When I got home I took care of the animals.  My one white doe had
given birth to one kit but it was dead.  I am not having very good luck with my
breeding.  Mae had an appointment with Deanna for a treatment so she was gone
when I got home.  I tried to get an appointment with Davis Human Resources but
only got a message.  I left a recorded message asking them to return my call.  I
took a nap and worked on Indexing.  I had a question about the instructions for
Col. 17-18-19 and tried to reach help but I only got a message that they were
busy and they would return my call.  I continued on until I left to make the pm
route.  That went well but my bus is still having electrical problems, so I
turned it back in to the shop again.  I again worked on indexing until almost
8pm when I let Mae use the computer.  Mae got on with a on-line meeting about a
sales program.  I couldn’t follow it as she was talking on the phone as she
watched the presentation on the computer screen.  I set in the recliner and
soon was asleep.  I am concerned that it is a pyramid program and it seems that
it is the lower people that lose.  It was after 10PM before we went to bed.  I
didn’t sleep well and got up about 12:30am and slept most of the night in the
recliner.</p>

woke before 5am and read my scriptures.  I also checked my batch that I had
completed last night with the Arbitrator and saw some of my errors.  I did
question the Arbitrator in a couple of areas.  I woke Mae at 6am and we had
breakfast before I went to work.  My bus still isn’t working so I had to drive
a sub bus.  After the bus run I went over to the district office and got the
paper work finished and finger printed to be a regular driver.  When I was just
about home I felt that I should stop in at Sierra RV to check on them getting
me a new gas tank.  One of the mechanics was at the parts desk and suggested
that I take the tank to Intermountain Truck Repair in Ogden.  He thinks they
can repair the tank.  When I got home I found a note from Mae that Michelle has
a migraine head ache and Mae is there tending the children for her.  Bob went
with me to Ogden.  The mechanic couldn’t fix it so he will order a new valve. 
I hope it works for it will save me quite a lot if it does.  When I got to the
shop they had my bus repaired so we used it this afternoon.  Mae was home when
I got there.  I gathered the eggs while Mae prepared dinner.  The doe had 12
kits today but she let them all die.  There isn’t any reason to keep her. 
After dinner Mae and I went over to Jeff and Gail’s.  Gail’s mother also came
over.  We played a few games quitting just before 10pm.  We went right to bed
after getting home/</p>

got up with me and prepared breakfast.  My morning run went well.  When I got
back to the shop I had them tighten up the one mirror brackets as they were
loose.  I took care of the animals when I got home.  I bred doe #2 again and
will see if it will make a difference in her taking care of her litter if I
make a larger nest box.  I will try the same thing with doe #1 in a few more
days.  I hate to lose those two doe’s as they are a much larger breed than the
rest I have.  Irven and Sandy came over to get Mae and the three of them went
over to Weber State University to campaign for Ron Paul.  I took a nap, ate
some lunch and then took my pm route.  Mae returned home just after I got
there.  I did some work on my tool trailer and the small table saw.  I had a
man come and look at the saw but he wanted a larger one.  Mae and I watched the
last of the show “She Wore a Yellow Ribbon” starring John Wayne, as we ate our
dinner.  I also worked on indexing in between other things.  Mae fell asleep
while she was waiting for me to finish one batch of indexing.  When I finished
I woke Mae and we then watched a DVD titled “Conversations With God”.  It was
very interesting with a lot to think about.  I sure enjoy being with Mae.  She
is such a special wife and sweetheart.</p>

recliner.  I was afraid that if I got up and worked on the computer that I
would wake Mae, so I went back to bed and slept until almost 8am.  I fed the
animals while Mae prepared waffles for breakfast.  They were very good.  I
worked on indexing for a while and then went over to Scott’s to work on their
basement.  After finishing Scott’s I came home, Mae had gone over to Dolly’s to
help her.  I got myself some to eat.  When Mae got home we went to the church
house to check out the computers in the Family History room.  We found that 1
out of 4 computers worked.  Mae had an dinner appointment to go out with RaNae
Barney.  I stayed and tried to resolve the computer problem but didn’t have any
success.  I came home and looked up in my Stake Directory the Technology Clerk,
Ronald Hubbard.  I called him and he came to the church house to help me.  The
2<sup>nd</sup> computer seemed to work but I was having trouble getting it to
download the Indexing program.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> computer is missing a key
board.  The 4<sup>th</sup> computer doesn’t have enough memory to run the
Indexing system, so that computer is out.  Brother Hubbard hooked my computer
to the wireless inter-net and found that it made contact by going wireless
now.  He said that they had just made some modifications to the system which
gave better coverage in the building.  He then went over to Wal-Mart and
purchased a new key board.  While he was gone I continued working on computer
2.  I was ready to give up when Brother Hubbard came back.  Just at that time
the error message that had continued to stop me went away and the down load
worked great.  With the three computers at the center and my laptop we will
have four computers to work with the Young Women on Thursday evening to show
them Indexing.  I came home and found that Irven and Sandy were waiting to
plant Raspberry transplants.  I had to hurry and till the area where I wanted
them planted.  We planted 14 plants.  When we finished we came in and found
that Bob had made a large batch of chilly and invited us to come up and have
some.  Mae had returned home so she went up with us.  While we were eating Bob
started a movie on TV.  After eating, Irven and Sandy went home.  Mae and I
stayed and watched the movie.  Bob popped popcorn and we enjoyed that.  It was
late when the movie finished and we went downstairs.  I didn’t feel the best
when we went to bed.  I did sleep ok.</p>

of morning chores and we ate breakfast before going to our Church meetings.  It
was our Ward Conference and was very good.  Bob prepared a nice dinner for us
when we got home.  After dinner I took a nap but Mae let me sleep for 1 ½ hours
or more.  I was a little upset as we had a lot to do.  We are trying to get
prepared to teach Indexing to the Young Women in our Ward this Wednesday
evening.  We worked on those preparations until 9:30pm and then I filled out my
journal.  It’s now time to get to bed.  When I did chores this morning I found

and rested for a few minutes.  We tried to find someone that could adjust my
back but no one could today.  I got an appointment with Randy tomorrow after
work.  I relaxed and was able to take my afternoon route.  This evening I just
relaxed.  Mae had to go to Jeff’s to tend their children while Jeff and Gail
attended another financial class.  I entered this entry and then went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
am in quite a lot of back pain but I still took my route this morning.  When I
got home I again had Mae rub me with Thera-Gesoc and I went to bed.  I woke
just before noon when a fellow called about my small table saw that I have in
ksl.com.  He will come to look at it this afternoon.  I got dressed and Mae
went with me to get the saw.  Mae brought it up to the house in the
wheelbarrow.  While we ate lunch I got on the computer and look up a map of
Kaysville so that I can find a better route for the new boy that we take home. 
I am still not feeling well but took my pm route.  When I finished the route I
went down to Randy’s.  Randy gave me a treatment and worked on me for over 1 ½
hours.  He said that I was in pretty bad shape but got some of it out.  I set
another appointment with him when I finish my am route tomorrow.  I came home
and ate my dinner that Mae had ready for me.  I them finished a batch of
indexing before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Although
my back and legs are still very sore I still went into work.  Mae hadn’t slept
during the night so I had her go back to sleep.  The morning run went well and
I went right from work to Randy’s.  He worked on me for 2 ½ hours.  On the way
home I called into the shop and asked if they could get a sub for my bus this
afternoon.  They did.  I came home and ate, had Mae put ice packs on my back
for about 3 hours and then took a hot Epson Salts bath.  Still having a little
time I laid back down.  Mae noticed that my right leg is really bruised on the
back center upper leg.  I believe that was caused a week ago Monday when we
were playing basketball.  I think that is where all my trouble stemmed from. 
Mae and I went to the church house and set up to teach the YW how to Index.  It
went well and was quite a lot of fun.  Bob became worried as he didn’t know we
were going anyplace this evening and was sure that Mae must have taken me to
Randy or the hospital.  Mae is sure tired and so am I so we will get right to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
took today off sick.  Randy is also sick today so he can’t work on me today. 
I’m not quite sure what to do.  I am feeling some better but a long ways from
completely better.  I did do a batch of indexing today.  Roberta called me and
ask if I could please drive tomorrow, they are going to be way short of
drivers.  I told her that I am sure that I will be there and she said “thank
you, thank you, thank you!”.  This evening Mae drove me into see Deanna Davis
who gave me a 1 ½ hour treatment and I feel much better.  When we got home Mae
and I took a walk around the park and it felt very good.  I’m not 100% but much
better.</p>

did drive the bus today but was hurting when I tried to get off the bus in the
afternoon.  Between the am &amp; pm route I did go out and take care of the
animals.  I killed the white doe as she is sick and is just starving.  I was
going to work on one of the young rabbits to clean it eyes but they have gone
too far so I just separated it from the others.  When I got home this afternoon
I got Bob to kill that one for me.  Mae went to lunch with Kylan and Ashley. 
Mae bought us a Sub-Way sandwich for dinner this evening.  We watched shows of
TV and then we watched a show on DVD but I really didn’t enjoy it.  I am not
moving very much.</p>

went to bed in quite a lot of pain.</p>

didn’t attend meetings today.  Brother Thompson and Brother Thomas came over

down all day so when Mae got home I got up and with the laptop on the kitchen
cabinet I could stand and type the last three days of journal entries.  But I
am tired now.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t sleep very well last night.  Mae took our pickup to Dee’s to get it
inspected and new license.  There was two censors that were giving a “check
engine” light that they had to repair.  Total cost was $325.00 so that hurts
our budget.   This morning Mae took me into Dr. Lee’s.  He said that I have
strained muscles in my back area and they will need time to heal.  He
recommends that I take as much as two weeks off from driving school bus and he
gave me prescriptions for a muscle relaxant and one for anti inflammatory.  We
watched 3 series of the Waltons and one of Little House on the Prairie.  Mae
went over to Layton City Library to attend Emily’s violin recital.  I watched a
couple of western movies on TV while she was gone.  I’m hurting and glad to go
to bed.  Mae gave me my medications before we went to bed.</p>

both slept well last night, waking up about 7:30am.  I woke concerned with the
Bus Evacuation drill that is scheduled for this week.  I called Kate and left a
message for her on her cell phone.  I went back to bed and slept for a while
longer.  Mae prepared breakfast and we ate so she could go to a dental
appointment this morning.  From there Mae went out to lunch with Marna Mc
Phie.  I helped Bob repair the fence.  This afternoon Mae and I went to
Intermountain Truck and got my gas tank that they replaced the valve on it and
refilled the tank with Propane gas.  The total bill came to $61.28 and that
included a full tank of gas.  We felt very pleased with that price.  I have
rested all day and did watch some good movies on TV.  Mae sure keeps busy and
it seems that everyone wants her company.  I did work on Indexing for a while. 
Mae weeded the strawberries and I walked out to watch her.  I am sure feeling
quite helpless.</p>

didn’t sleep very well again last night.  I woke after 7am and she was in the
other bedroom.  She soon woke when I got up.  I went back to bed a little
longer but Mae got going.  She fed the animals and did a little weeding in the
garden.  She then came in and fixed breakfast.  Mae went to the Bountiful Temple
to be with Mysha and John as they are being Sealed for Time and Eternity as
well as having their baby sealed to them.  Mae road with Georgia and Rick to
the Temple.  I wish that I could have been there also.  After taking a shower I
went back to bed and slept for over an hour.  I got up and dressed and then
finished the batch that I started yesterday of indexing.  I watched a couple of
shows this afternoon.  This evening Linda, Irven, Sandy, Bob, Mae and I had
dinner together.  Bob made cabbage casserole and we ate downstairs.  I was kind
of a stick in the mud as I laid in the recliner most of the time.  Brother
Thomas stopped by to visit with me.  After everyone left, Mae and I watched
“Gun Smoke” on TV before going to bed.</p>

Mae took care of the animals.  The lopped ear doe had a litter of kits.  This
afternoon I counted them and there was 6 but 1 was dead.  We hope that she will
take care of them.  Mae had a doctor’s appointment before noon for a physical. 
I did do some indexing throughout the day.  I read my scriptures, the preface
to “Joseph Smith – Rough Stone Rolling” and we read some more of our book
“American Prophet – The Story of Joseph Smith”.  Mae received her book that she
had prepared on her mother and while she was reviewing that I capsulated some
of our nutrition.  It is now 11PM and we are ready for bed.</p>

stayed in bed late this morning.  Mae and I gave each other hair cuts before
breakfast.  I am feeling quite a lot better but Mae still keeps me down.  I did
string out the garden hoses to the back and I installed a key box by the back
garage door for emergency access to the house.  I completed another batch of
Indexing and started another.  I also tried to teach Bob how to use the
computer but he just doesn’t want to learn.  The day seems to go by fast and it
is now ready for bed.  We are going to watch a movie on DVD before we go to sleep.</p>

so he stopped over and I showed him my ideas of installing a trailer hich to
the pickup with the camper on it.  this evening Mae and I went to Jeff and
Gail’s where we had dinner and after getting the children to bed, we played
games.  It was almost 11:00 PM when we got home and started getting ready for

well although we didn’t have time to present very much.  I came home during
Sunday school and then went back to Sacrament meeting.  Bob had dinner ready
when we got home.  After eating I came downstairs and took a nap in the
recliner.  Mae also took a nap when she came down.  I gathered the eggs this
afternoon.  Bob and I worked on setting the sprinkler timer.  Jeff called and
asked us if we could come over again to play games.  I hadn’t planned on going
anywhere but it could very well be only a short time left and Jeff and Gail
will be moving away because of work.  We did enjoy being with them.  We played
two games of Rook of which Jeff and I won both games.  That is unusual for us
to win.  It was 10:30pm when we got home.  I entered this entry and we went to

Mae and I slept well last night.  We got up about 7:30am.  Bob and I went into
see Deanna Davis for treatments.  We stopped on the way in at Good Earth to
take them some eggs and to buy some cereal and bread.  After we finished with
the treatments we went to Harvest Moon for a few other items.  It was 1pm when
we got home.  I got me something for lunch, called the bus shop and told them
that I could come back to work tomorrow.  I also went out and checked on the
doe with the new liter, as Mae had taken care of the animals this morning.  She
was afraid the doe was not taking care of the kits.  She still has two that
seem to be doing well.  Mae went out to eat with her cousin, Joan.   I worked
on Indexing most of the afternoon.  When Mae came home she turned on the TV to
“Little House on the Prairie” and I watched that with her but during
commercials I would continue my indexing.  After dinner Mae went over to Jeff’s
and tended the children while Jeff and Gail attended their finance class.  I
again continued indexing.  I did two batches today, giving me a total of 551
names entered.  It is 9pm and I am going to work tomorrow so I will get ready
for bed.  </p>
