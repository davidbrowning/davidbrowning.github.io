<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                 I
woke at 6 this morning and so not to wake Mae I worked on indexing, after
reading my scriptures and saying my prayers.  I finally woke Mae at 9AM.  I
took care of the animals and found that my small doe has kits but it looks like
she isn’t going to take care of them.  I attended High Priest leadership
meeting and then continued with the regular meeting schedule.  When we got home
we finished packing.  Bob prepared dinner for us and Kathy’s family, who are up
from Texas for a few days, and Sherrie and her son.  After dinner we left for
Tropic, Utah.  Mae started out driving so I could make calls to the High Priest
to get a report on Home Teaching.  I then took a nap.  We had passed Provo when
I woke so we stopped just long enough to change places.  We made one more stop
to use the restrooms and other than that traveled straight through.  It was
8:30PM when we got to Tropic.  Paul (Pete) and Keela made us right to home.  We
sure enjoyed visiting with them.  They sure have a lovely home.  When we
retired I had a discouraging feeling as to how I haven’t been able to give Mae
much of a home.</p>

woke at 4AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so got up at 5AM and read my
scriptures and worked on the computer.  I completed another batch of indexing
this morning.  After we ate breakfast we spent some time looking at quilts that
Keela has, some were her mothers and some she and her mother quilted together
and some she had done herself.  We then went over to the barn and saw what
facilities we have there.  She will have three barbeque grills there for us to
use.  Keela also offered her ovens and her daughters oven to cook the potatoes
dishes in.  It was almost noon when we left for home.  We stopped at the local
store and at the store in Panquitch and priced some of the food we will need. 
It looks like we had better buy most of the food at home and bring it down with
us.  We got to Layton about 4:45PM so we stopped at the Golden Corral and ate
dinner.  Mae worked on the reunion and I did some more on indexing.  I sent one
batch back because I could not read the hand writing.  We were tired so went to
bed and watched a J.A.G. series.</p>

slept pretty good last night and didn’t get until after 7 this morning.  After
breakfast we went out and worked in the garden but it got quite hot before we
finished.  This afternoon I figured on a trailer hitch for the truck.  I went
over to a shop in Clearfield that works on trucks and visited with them about my
thoughts for the hitch and they felt that it would work very well.  We went up
to Morgan and watched Connor little league base ball game.  His team won this
evening so they we play again in the morning.  After the game we went over to
David and Shauna’s and spent the evening.  We were late getting home and then
we had to set up for having breakfast in our back yard in the morning.  We are
late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up early and prepared breakfast in our back yard.  We wanted to try the
grill again with pancakes and I am disappointed in it.  We did have Scott’s
family, Jeff’s family, Sherry’s family, Kathy’s family, Bob, Mae and I.  It
went well and we learned a few things that will help us.  Mae and I went to the
Layton 4<sup>th</sup> of July parade where we joined with Jeff and Gail’s
extended family.  Just before we left for the parade, Lanny Wilding called to
tell us that Aunt Welma passed away yesterday morning.  The funeral and viewing
will be July 5<sup>th</sup> at the Teton chapel.  When we got to Layton, we had
a good view and shade to watch the parade so we enjoyed it.  When we got home
we took Mae and I took a 2 our nap.  Our flop eared doe had two kits today and
they seem to be doing well.  This evening we went to the concert at the Layton
Park and the watched the fireworks.  I have never seen such a display of
fireworks, almost too much.  I couldn’t help feeling that the cost of such a
display could have been better spent.  After getting home just before mid-night
Mae and I watched a J.A.G. series before going to sleep.</p>

slept in, not getting up until after 8.  After breakfast I fed the animals and
started working on getting the trailer hitch on the pickup.  David called me
and talked to me about seeing a Gastroligist about my acid reflux.  It looks
like I will have Western Trailer install a new hitch on the pickup.  I repaired
the water supply on Scott and Mishelle’s bathroom sink.  Mae and Mishelle put
the finish on the wall in the sun room and it sure looks good.  I have been
rather discouraged with things today.  </p>

got up early and left for Idaho at 6:15AM.  Bob drove his car.  We picked up
Irven and he was ready when we got there.  I checked with Rich and Lois about
riding up with us but Janet will bring them up.  We arrived at Teton right at
9:20AM.  It was good to see all of Wilma’s children, daughters &amp;
sons-in-laws, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  There was a good turnout
of friends, neighbors and relatives, some that I haven’t seen in many years.  Bill
Hulet was there although his wife didn’t come.  Jennie Lee Hill and her husband
were there and it was good to visit with them.  As Bob said, “It was a long
ways to travel but it was just good to have come.”  The program wasn’t long but
very good.  The Relief Society had furnished a nice lunch after the grave
services and we visited until almost everyone had left.  It was 6PM when we
arrived back home, tired but happy that we had gone.  I took care of the
animals and gathered the eggs while Mae prepared some dinner.  After dinner we
went out into the garden and picked strawberries and raspberries, got a few for
breakfast.  We watched another J.A.G. series before going to sleep.</p>

to the beautician to get a permanent for hair.  I washed the windows of the sun

went shopping after getting her hair done.  After dinner this evening we went
over to Jeff and Gail’s where we played games.  Jeff and I discussed different
ways to repair his patio ceiling.  It was late when we got to bed.</p>

really didn’t fell like getting up this morning.  I attended High Priest Group
Leadership meeting and then Priesthood meeting.  I came home after Priesthood
meeting and took a nap.  I was able to stay awake that way.  Bob prepared
dinner for us after meetings.  That was very good.  I typed some ideas about
Bob and my early years and talked to some of Bob’s children this evening.  I
think it went pretty good.  Mae helped me and we got things ready to go fishing
tomorrow morning.  Nick is coming out to go and Cole is also going to go with
us.  I invited Tylor to come but he isn’t able to.  I am getting up early so I
had better get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 4:30 this morning and got ready to go fishing.  Mae had prepared my
lunch and breakfast last night before she came to bed.  I went down to Cole’s
to get him shortly after 5:30 and was back here at 6:00 to get Nick.  We got on
the lake at 7AM.  Fishing was very slow and I think it is because the water
temperature is around 70 degrees.  I could find very few fish on the fish
finder.  When we got down to the dam area the fish finder indicated that the
fish were mostly right on the bottom of the lake.  I did catch two fish but
other than a very few bites that is all we got.  When I was cleaning those two
fish two fellows came with it looked like 4 limits.  They caught theirs by
anchoring and fishing about 2 or 3 feet off the bottom with power bait.  That
confirmed my theory.  We got home shortly after noon.  I took a nap after
getting home.  Mae had the house work and laundry done and had done some work
outside in the garden and lawn.  We watched a movie on TV and then when it
cooled down we went back outside and mowed and trimmed the lawn.  I then mowed
the weeds in back and Mae pulled and cut down other weeds.  We worked until
dark before quitting.  We were tired and soon went to bed.</p>

slept until 7 before getting up.  Mae slept a little longer.  After breakfast I
went to Kaysville where I was going to have Wasatch Trailer install a new
trailer hitch.  When I got there they told me that it hadn’t got there yet.  I
went over to Alco Auto Parts and ordered mirrors that extend out further on the
pickup so I can see behind the camper.  I then went to Home Depot and looked
for decking and railing for Rich and Lois’s home.  Wasatch Trailer called me
and said that my hitch had come in so I went back and they installed the new
hitch.  It was 1PM when I came back home.  I ate lunch and then took a nap. 
Bob then helped me load the camper.  It was quite a job getting the camper on
straight.  I ate dinner and took another short nap.  The heat really took the
energy out of us.  Gail had two photographers come over at 6:30PM and take
pictures of Grandma and Grandpa Browning and Jeff and Gail’s children.  It was
almost 9PM when they finished.  It was late when we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Bob
had me wake him at 6AM so that he could prepare breakfast for Kathy and her
family before they left for home.  I took care of the animals and washed the
windows before going to the onion field.  I weeded a completer row as there are
very few weeds in our area.  From there I returned the hitch extension that I
had bought because it is not long enough.  Mae found a welder in Farmington
that I called and he said that he could make an extension.  I went there and
talked to him and he gave me another idea that will add to the support.  After
getting home I re-measured the hitch and measured another support bracket.  I
then started working on the car.  I had heard a noise when I drove the car that
sounded like a worn out brake shoe.  I decided to replace all the brake shoes
and change the oil.  While I was getting the car jacked up and started working
on it I had Bob go to Allco Auto got parts, filters and oil.  When I tried to
remove the rear brake shoes I ran into problems.  I had to call Dee Auto and
visited with Dee.  He figured out that I needed another tool so he had me come
to his shop and he loaned it to me.  I then needed a 1 1/4<sup>th</sup>   inch
wrench and special set of pliers.  I didn’t have time to work any more on the
car tonight as Bob and I went Home Teaching to Patriarch and Sister Johnston. 
We had a good visit and they seem to really enjoy our coming.  Mae and I
watched the last of a show before I entered this entry and went to bed.</p>

had to set our alarm for 5:45AM so that we could wake up Bob.  He and Grant
want to go golfing this morning.  Mae went up to wake him but he was already
up.  We couldn’t go back to sleep.  I went up to start working on the car but I
had left the tool that I borrowed from Dee in Bob’s car and he had left to go
golfing.  Mae needed to meet Michelle in Layton so I had to take her in the
truck.  When we got home Bob was there and he said that he saw the tool in his
car so he set it on his work bench but didn’t tell me and I didn’t look for
it.  With the tool it didn’t take me very long to finish installing the brakes
but I could never have done it without that took.  Mae and I cleaned up and
went to the Bountiful Temple.  When we went into the Chapel Bryce and Deanna
were setting in front, having been asked to be company witnesses.  We set by
them until we went into the ordnance room and then we got separated because of
several handicap patrons in wheelchairs.  It was humbling to be in the session
with them.  After the session Bryce, Deanna, Mae and I went to the cafeteria
and ate.  Bryce wanted to pay for our meal.  We sure enjoyed the session and
being with Bryce and Deanna.  It was 6:30PM when we got home.  I went visiting
with Brother Thomas but the person we went to visit wasn’t home.  I got back
home in time to get some things pulled out before Jeff came with his trailer. 
We loaded the tables and a few other things in Jeff’s trailer for him to take
up camping tomorrow.  Mae had gone shopping for groceries and returned home
just after Jeff left.  We got the camper packed and ready to go.  It was late
when we finished.  We did have something to eat also.  Mae got more things
ready to take with us and I also entered this journal entry.</p>

woke early but let Mae sleep in.  I worked on indexing and finished another
batch before we had breakfast.  When Mae got up she prepared waffles for
breakfast and they were sure good.  We got started with packing for our trip. 
When I went out to feed the chickens and rabbits, I found that the young doe
was dead.  I think that is the last of the rabbits and I will try to sell
everything.  We got packed and left about 11:45AM.  I had wanted to leave by
11AM but Mae felt that we didn’t need to leave that early.  It was after 3PM
when we got to Payson Lake instead of 2PM but it worked out ok.  When we got
there it started raining very hard.  I got quite wet before we got our camp and
Sandi’s camp set up.  We hadn’t been set up very long when Scott and his family
came so I helped Scott set up.  Mae then prepared dinner and Mishelle used our
stove to cook their dinner.  They had planned on Hobo dinners but there was too
much rain.   Jeff, Gail and their family then arrived.  They had planned on
camping in our tent but with this much rain they will share Sandi’s camp
trailer with Sandi.  None of Sandi’s family came with her so that worked out
good.  Jeff and Scott did build a camp fire this evening but I got too cold so
came back to our camper and warmed up.  This camper is sure nice but I still
have water problems that I have to repair.  Mae came in about 10:15 and we soon
went to bed.  I did do a little on Indexing while Mae got ready for bed.</p>

waiting for us to come and prepare breakfast.  We did have the food in our

breakfast and things were cleaned up we just enjoyed being with our children
and grandchildren.  Mike and his family came up as well as Shauna and their
children.  David didn’t feel that he could do it today because of school
studies.  Everyone went down to the lake.  Sandi and I walked around the lake
and enjoyed that but I was tired when we finished.  Mae mainly prepared lunch
for everyone.  After lunch I set in our recliner and took a nap.  For dinner we
cooked Dutch oven chicken and vegetables along with peach cobbler cooked in the
Dutch oven.  Everyone enjoyed that and there was very little left over.  We set
around the camp fire, some played games and others walked or played at the
lake. It was after 9:30PM when we came to our camper.  I was beat so stayed at
our camper but Mae went back and played games with some of the rest.  We are
still getting rain storms off and on but it is now raining quite hard.  I am
tired so am going to bed without Mae.  Mae came in about mid-night from playing
games with Sandi, Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Sandi.  My left leg and foot is
really hurting so Mae rubbed that area for me.</p>

shower and get ready for Church.  We attended Sacrament meeting with the 16<sup>th</sup>
Ward.  Bob prepared chicken for dinner for us when we got home from dinner. 
After dinner Mae took a nap and I worked on my journal then took another nap.  I
worked on Indexing and completed another batch.  That makes 1391 named I have

strawberries.  Mae continued to work on the Bushnell reunion.  I made some
calls getting a trailer lined up to take the supplies down to the reunion.  I
tried to find a gas grill that we could rent but they are too expensive as they
want to rent for the full four days even though we only need it for one night. 
I dumped the holding tanks on the camper also bought some parts for the trailer
hitch extension.  I started to find out how to repair the water leaks but
didn’t get very far with that.  After dinner I watched TV while I filled
capsules with Phyt-Aloe and Ambrotose, making 150 capsules of each.  I then

finished and installed and then went to Jeff’s and used his trailer to bring my
ladder, wheel barrel, camp stove and grill home.  The hitch worked fine but it
did dig into the lawn when I came through the back gate.  Mae and I took a nap
and then I worked a little longer on the camper.  I then went visiting with the
Bishopric and High Priest Group leadership.  Bob mowed the lawn this evening
and Mae got most of the trimming done.  Mae was working in the garden when I

Rich kept trying to get me to have some ice cream for dessert.  We measured up
the deck and got a list of needs.  I got the name of another contractor that I
will try to get an estimate of cost.  I need another set of books on the
decking materials as I let Rich and Lois have the set I had.  Rich and Lois had
to leave for a Dr. Appointment for Rich.  Bob and I finished with the measuring
and was ready to leave when Elise came over to see us.  She hadn’t planned on
coming over until this even for she thought we were staying overnight, so we
had a nice visit with her.  Then a friend that worked with Rich and Lois in the
Temple stopped by as he had driven by and saw the fire damage so came by to see
how they are doing.  It was 4PM when we finally got away and got home at
6:15PM.  We would have been home sooner but we stopped at Brigham City and
drove by the Temple.  Mae was at Jeff and Gail’s tending their children when I
got home so I turned on the TV and watched a very good show on Hall Mark.  Mae
got home just as it ended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
tried cooking on the Champ Chef to see how our small steel grill worked.  It
worked ok, so if Bryce also has a small grill we can use them on at the
reunion.  I kept busy all day but am not sure if I accomplished very much.  I
worked on Rich and Lois’s bid, the family reunion and did some repairs on the
camper.  I was late when we finished dinner so we quit and watched a show
before going to bed.  Mae was busy with the reunion most of the day.  She is
starting to pick up some of the groceries we will need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up about 7AM and after breakfast I picked the strawberries’ for Mae.  I got
about two quarts again today.  I worked on the camper most of the rest of the
day and still have some problems.  We went to Bountiful to meet Bob and Pauline
Hein.  Their Grandson was in the Bountiful parade so we found a spot where we
could watch the parade and park our cars at a LDS Stake Center.  We had plenty
of time to go to Sizzlers’ to eat before the parade would start but we wasn’t
sure we could get a place to park when we came back.  Mae suggested that we
park our car on a 45 to take up two parking spots and go to eat in their car. 
We had some traffic to contend with getting back to the parking lot but we made
it and by straightening my car we had two spots to park in.  We enjoyed the
parade but especially the visit with Bob and Pauline.  While at the Parade, I
saw Ken Shaw so I work my way through the crowd to catch up with him.  They are
still serving in Wasco California but are up here for a Family Reunion.  It was
good to visit with Ken for a minute.  I also got his phone number from him. 
After getting home we watched some TV but there really wasn’t much to choose
from.  Mae has been working on the reunion.  It’s now after 11PM so we are off
to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3:45 this morning so went into the front room and set in the rocker. 
Whether I went to sleep or not I am not sure but Mae came and got me after 6
and had me get back in bed.  I didn’t wake then until after 8AM.  We had fish
for breakfast.  I had several things that I worked on but felt that I was going
in circles.  Irven called and wants me to help Andrea and Wallis with their
home next Saturday.  I told him I would have to think about it.  I worked on
the camper without success with the old parts so after lunch I went to Durk’s
and got standard plumbing parts.  I was able to get the plumbing all repaired
and tools put away.  This evening I worked on indexing as well as working of
Photo Shop getting pictures for the family history.  Scott and Mishelle brought
their children over for Mae to tend while they went out this evening.  Mae had
called them and volunteered.  Mishelle showed us how to size the pictures and
then when they came back she showed us how to print them.  We were able to
watch the Sunset Firework Display from outside our door.  They were fair but
didn’t come close to Layton’s on the Forth.  We had a bowl of apple sauce and
some toast before we went to bed.</p>

woke early so instead of getting back into bed, I went into the front room and
went to sleep in the recliner.  I didn’t want to wake Mae.  I hadn’t realized
that earlier Mae had wakened and she went into the spare bedroom so that she
wouldn’t wake me.  We both got up about the same time.  After showering I took
care of the animals.  I then started a write up of instructions how to use
Photoshop to create Portrait Pedigree pictures, so that we can remember how to
do it.  We attended our meetings and then Mae and I stayed after for chorus
practice.  Bob had dinner ready when we got home.  After eating Mae and I took
a nap.  We made arrangement with Carolyn and Charles Saunders and Marilyn and
Kelley Bodily to go to the Stake Camp grounds on our Ward’s night and have dinner
there.  Mae and I went visiting to Sister Fallis for both Home Teaching and
visiting Teaching.  Shortly after 6PM Jeanenne, Bryce, Deanna, Georgia and Rick
came to discuss the Reunion.  I worked on repairing a picture for Mae’s Family
Pedigree chart, for a couple of hours.  It was almost mid-night when we quit
and went to bed.</p>

didn’t work either.  We were both very busy all day and I was tired when I quite. 
We still made some contacts by phone and before we realized it was 10:30PM.  Mae
got the washing done and Bob and I got the lawn mowed.  Most of the rest of the
time was spent in preparation for the reunion.</p>

slept in and both seem to have slept well.  for breakfast I cooked scrambled
eggs in the electric oven.  It worked pretty well.  We both worked on
preparations for the reunion.  I also worked on the camper.  At one point I had
to have Mae help me and I enjoyed her help.  We did watch most of the Salt Lake
24<sup>th</sup> of July parade on TV.  Bob and I went Home Teaching and got it
finished.  I had just about forgotten that we had appointments this evening 
and at 7:30PM I was thinking if I had completed all that I had planned on doing
today when it came to me that we had a H.T. appointment with Therman’s for 7PM
this evening.  I called them and they said it would still be fine to come
over.  After getting home I made a sign for the Bushnell Reunion.  It was
mid-night when I finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke and thought that it was time to wipe the windows.  We try to wipe them
down each morning after the lawn is watered as the secondary water contains so
many minerals that is spots the windows from the spray.  If we do not wipe the
windows dry before the sun dries them, then we have to use Lime A Way to get
the glass clean.  Anyway, as I start to wipe them I realized that I was 1 hour
early.  I therefore laid in the recliner and slept a little longer.  It was so
late when we got to bed last night that I let Mae sleep in.  We had just got up
to start the day when Scott called and asked Mae if she could help tend the
children as Mishelle has another migraine headache.  We quickly got some
breakfast and Mae went over to help.   I was busy all day but I didn’t feel
that I had accomplished very much.  Bob and I went shopping for several items
that I had on my list but we did more walking than finding, so I came back
feeling depressed about that.  I had to hurry when I got home as I had a High
Priest Group Leadership to be too at 7PM.  I was late but Charles was even
later.  We discussed several areas but has mainly focused on the Ward Social on
the 24<sup>th</sup> of August.  After returning home Mae and I set out side on
the bench and enjoyed the evening.  We then came in and watched a JAG series
before going to sleep.  I went to bed feeling that I really can’t talk to any
of my children about their life and decisions.</p>

got up at 6:45 to wake Bob but he had already got up and gone gulfing with
Grant.  While I was reading my scriptures I reflected how I felt last night,
and realized how few of God’s children will talk to him or listen to His
council and advice.   I went out and wiped down the windows.  Mae got breakfast
and then when Bob got home he and I went shopping again.  Where yesterday we
just went from place to place we really didn’t get anything, but today we found
almost everything that I was looking for plus we bought a dinning tent that is
10’ X 20’ at C-A-L Ranch.  Mae also went out shopping, mainly for the reunion.   I
worked on the trailer hitch extension so that it has a little more support. 
This evening we watch a couple of shows on TV before going to bed.  We did
continue with projects that we accomplished during intermissions.  It’s been a
good day</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night but we got up by 7:30PM and got started.  My
back is giving me quite a bit of problems so I am taking mussel relaxers and
pain pills.  I don’t want it to get as bad as I did last winter.  We haven’t
worked hard but did some gardening, wiped the windows, took care of the
animals, and packed for this afternoon to go to the Stake camp.  I did some
indexing and downloaded a batch to work on tonight if I have time.  We left for
the Stake camp shortly after 3PM.  When we got there the camp host told us that
there was some new polices and campers and trailers cannot be in the camp
sites.  We could drive to the site and unload but we would then have to move
the camper back to the parking lot.  I said that we would just cook the meal
and then we would leave before the camp closed for the night.  Mae did not want
to do that but I told her that I didn’t want to pack up and then unload so we
could sleep in the parking lot.  We did set up and start the Dutch oven
dinner.  Charles and Carolyn, Marilyn and Kelly arrived just after 6PM.  We had
a wonderful evening and the dinner was very good.  While we were eating the
Camp Host came down and politely said that we could stay overnight in our
camper.  After the Saunder’s and the Bodily’s left we soon went to bed.</p>

woke about 5AM and went fishing.  The water is really high which made fishing
bad.  I did catch a couple of fish but the one was quite small so I let it go. 
I got cold as my boots are leaking and I got my feet wet.  I went back to the
camper and got back in bed with Mae.  We later got up and had cereal for
breakfast.  Mae wanted to relax and enjoy the morning before we left.  I
decided to give fishing another try and I caught four more.  We loaded up and
left shortly after noon.  We stopped and bought a Sub-Way for lunch.  We then
went to David and Shauna’s and visited with their family for a little while. 
When we got home we unloaded our things and put them away.  While we ate our
dinner we watched a movie on TV.  We missed the first 15 minutes of the show so
I was hard to understand the story.  We hung in and finally got the plot. 
After the show ended it restarted so we watched the first 15 minutes and then
realized the plot of the show.  I filled out my journal entry and Mae continued
working on the reunion.</p>

didn’t sleep much last night so I tried to let her sleep in.  She still got up
about 9:30.  Meetings were good today.  In Sacrament meeting Bishop Steve
Smith, Mark McPhie as 1<sup>st</sup> counselor and Steve Barker as 2<sup>nd</sup>
counselor were released from the Bishopric.  They have been a very excellent
Bishopric and we have really appreciated and enjoyed them.  Bryan Hatch was
sustained as Bishop with Dextor Tayler as 1<sup>st</sup> Counselor and Thomas
Saunder as 2<sup>nd</sup> Counselor.  After meeting was over we went up to
express appreciations and congratulations.  While there Mae tripped over the
box that houses the controls for the podium and sound.  She was caught before
she fell to the floor but she bruised her leg and we are afraid that she has
thrown her neck and back out.  We will know better by morning.  Bob prepared
dinner for us and after eating Mae and I laid down for a nap.  This evening we
went to Jeff and Gail’s.  We took Matt’s Birthday gift to him.  After the
children went to bed Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played a game of “Trans America” the
Jeff showed us two little scooters that you made move by the turning of the
steering wheel.  Jeff had me get on one and he got on the other and we played a
game of tag on the garage floor.  They are very fun to ride.  It was late when
we got home and to bed.</p>

before breakfast.  I went into the Eye Doctor at 10AM for a checkup and the Dr.
said that there has been no more detraction.  At 2:30PM I went to Petersen
Medical and got a new face mask.  I think this one will work better.  I also
stopped at Sportsman Warehouse and got some glue to repair my fishing boots.  I
cut the carpeting for the camper, having to glue a splice on in one area.  Bob
and I mowed the lawn this evening but we had to buy a new lawn mower, as the
old mower gave up.  Mae has been busy all day with the reunion preparations. 
We are both tired tonight.  I hope both of us can sleep better tonight.</p>

go with Brother Morgan to check on meat prices for the Ward Social.  We also
went to the Chapel on 800 N and checked out the bowery.  It is very nice but
the afternoon sun will shine into the west end.  Maybe we can get permission to
hang a tarp on that end.  When I went out to gather the eggs this evening I
found our white chicken coming out from behind a box in the shed.  When I
pulled the box out I found where the chickens have been laying the past few
days.  There was 14 eggs in that nest, 1 broken one and evident that there had
been another that the chickens had eaten.  We worked until 7:30PM before we
quite.  We watched the movie “Hunt for Red October” on DVD.  Although we have
seen it before and it has some rough language, we quite enjoyed it.</p>
