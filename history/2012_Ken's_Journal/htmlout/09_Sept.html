<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up and while Mae finished her packing I prepared breakfast.  I checked the
door that I painted and the stain bleed through.  I will have to paint it with
Kill’s and then another coat of paint.  Scott had forgot to take their raft
with them and so called Sandi asking her to stop and get it for them.  Sandi
and Nick never got here until almost noon and then I turned their stinger over
to lower the tong of the trailer.  It took both Nick and I with the vice and a
20” wrench to remove the ball.  When we finished we had stripped the threads. 
We bought a new ball and just throw the old one away.  It was almost 1PM when
they got away.  I started to work on my bus route when David called and asked
if I would bring him the trailer.  As I needed our projector that they borrowed
I took the trailer up to him.  I then went to Jeff’s and spent the rest of the
day with them.  Jeff worked on our computer trying to clean up some of the
problems we are having.  He did get some of it corrected but still the connection
to Google is still failing, especially when I try to use Jarvis.  I needed to
get the Kill’s and paint, so we went to Home Depot.  As we were in the area we
drove over to Abigail Bank’s and still was not able to find anyone at home. 
Mae called me and they have arrived at Lava and have set the trailer up, but
are unable to get electrical hooked up and working.  I called her baqck and
asked her if she needed me to come up, but she thought that they would be
alright.   After we returned to Jeff’s, Jeff cooked some chicken breasts on the
grill for dinner.  They we very good with the seasoning he used with them. 
After we ate Jeff again worked on my computer but was still unable to correct
the problem.  I came home and watched the end of one show and then another one
on TV.  It was after midnight when I went to bed.</p>

woke up at 6:30 and after reading my scriptures, having morning prayers, taking
a shower and shaving, I typed yesterday’s journal entry.  Mae called and cannot
get hook the gas stove up.  They are having a lot of problems.  I should have
driven up last night.  I attended meetings and choir practice after.  I am not
sure how my voice sounds with the chorus.  Bob had dinner about ready when I got
home.  I called Mae and they will probably stay overnight.  I hope things go
better for them.  This evening I watched a couple of shows on TV before going
to bed.</p>

today being Labor Day I slept in until 7:30am.  After getting some breakfast I
painted a coat of Kills on the shed door and door jamb.  I worked on my
computer but am still having trouble with the inter-net.  At least I can still
use the word processor.  I talked to Mike on the phone and his suggestion is to
have Best Buy look at it and give me an evaluation.  I did three batches of
indexing before lunch.  After lunch I took a 15 minute nap and then painted the
other side of the door and painted the jamb.  Bob went with me to check on a
couple of students that I hadn’t been able to contact.  When we returned home I
worked on my journals.  Bob and I mowed the lawns this evening.  Mae didn’t get
home until 6:30PM.  After butting things away I came in and Mae prepared
dinner.  We ate our dinner in the bed room so that we could watch a movie on
DVD.</p>

was up early and had time to get my own breakfast and off to work, so I let Mae
sleep in until just before I left for work.  My bus route went well thus
morning.  We are going to try an alternative route tomorrow and if it works
better than the one the computer chose I will make the suggestion.  I stopped
and filled the car with gas on the way home.  After getting home I ate a snack
and then reinstalled the door on the storage shed.  I ate lunch and then took a
short nap and went back for the afternoon run.  That went well and when we
returned to the compound I fueled the bus.  I also picked up sum supplies for
the bus.  We ate dinner while we watched a show on TV.  I went with Morgan
Thomas visiting this evening.  I entered this entry and then got ready for bed.

morning run went quite well.  After returning home I worked on the computer to
back up the files on lap top.  The afternoon run also went quite well.  I
worked most of the evening backing up fills onto our external hard drive.  The
one file of Mae’s picture took over 1 hour to back it up.  When we went to bed
I still have some files to back up.</p>

on our morning run it was announced that if anyone had a bus that had a wheel
chair lift that was not needed to let Sherie Nicholson know.  I told Kate that
I was afraid that we were going to lose our bus as we do not need our
wheelchair lift.  After finishing our morning run I went into the office and
visited with Sherie.  Sure enough we lost our bus and I was given buss #411.  I
spent 2 ½ hours transferring over to the bus and cleaning the seats and
sweeping the trash out.  I will still have a lot more cleaning to do but at
least it is clean enough that the children can ride on it without getting
dirty.  It was noon when I got home this morning.  This afternoons run also
went but we were a little late getting to the schools as I was cleaning bus to
long.  We had three children from Morgan that we took home.  We got back to the
compound just after 5PM.  Bob was mowing the lawns when I got there, so I
started trimming until dinner was ready.  After dinner I mowed the back area
and swept the back lawn so that there was less grass to be tracked into the
house.  It was dark by the time we finished and came in.  </p>

didn’t sleep well last night so I got myself off to work.  My runs went well
and the new bus seems to be ok except when I turn around in a caldasak and then
it takes 1 to 2 times backing up.  We got the frame put together for the sun awning.
  We went to the Bountiful Temple this evening so that we could be with
Koleesee as she takes her Endowments out before leaving for a mission.  She will
be serving in the Ventura California mission.  After getting home we shucked 4
dozen ears of corn for the reunion tomorrow afternoon.  We then watches a movie
on TV before going to bed.</p>

were busy all morning getting things set up for the reunion this afternoon and
evening.  Neither Mae nor I stopped until 12:30AM when we just stopped and went
to bed.  We felt that it was a great reunion even thought we had some that for
various reasons could not attend.  Sandi was the first one to arrive just
before 4PM and then others came at different times.  Mae was so good with the
little children and all the adults and youth enjoyed various games with some
just enjoying visiting.  We figured that there was about 46 family members in
attendance.  We were very pleased with the evening.  Several stayed and helped
put most of the heavy items away and then some stayed to watch a movie when it
became dark.  Jeff had rented the movie “We Bought A Zoo” and we setup a screen
and the projector outside.  It was very good, in fact Mae and I kept the movie
to re-watch tomorrow.</p>

slept until after 8AM and got up, showered and attended my Leadership meeting
at 10AM.  Mae and I are joining with several others from our family that are
having a special fast in behalf of Christy and Dave, asking for special
blessings in their behalf.  They would like to have a child of their own and
the Doctors figurer that this next month is the last and only chance that
Christy has to become pregnant.  We also asked special blessings be with Noland
and Brandy with their health situation.  Our choir sang in the Sacrament
meeting program today.  I was also asked to offer the opening prayer in the
meeting.  Bob prepared dinner when we got home from church.  Mae and I took a
nap and then we put the rest of the items from the reunion that could be
damaged by water when the sprinklers run tomorrow morning.  This evening we
again watched the movie “We Bought A Zoo” but this time we watched it with Bob
on his TV.  When we first tried to get it to play we could not figure out how
to get it to work.  We are still not sure what Bob did to get his unit to play
the movie but played with the controls and it came up.  It is almost 11PM and
we are going to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night so I let her sleep as long as she could

payroll information.  When I got home I picked tomatoes while Mae picked
strawberries.  We then washed and pealed the tomatoes and started cooking them
into spaghetti sauce.  I took my afternoon run and that went quite well.  I
started helping Mae with the tomato sauce after getting home but Jeff came and
I helped him cut a 4” X 4” for a mail box post.  By the time I got into the
house Mae had the sauce all bottled.  I helped her get it into the cold pack.  It
was 9:30PM when we finished with the sauce and went to bed.</p>

morning run went well and we got back to the compound at 9AM.  I called Mae to
see if she was still home and asked if she wanted me to take her to the eye
examination.  She said that she was going to Dr. Bennett first and then to the
eye doctor.  I went in to see check on my request for time off on the 28<sup>th</sup>
of September and the 1<sup>st</sup> of October.  I couldn’t remember my new
password so I couldn’t get into the computer.  I checked my mail box and had a
notice of two new children to be picked up as of the 10<sup>th</sup> of
September, which was yesterday.  I told Sherrie that I hadn’t picked them up
and she said to start tomorrow.  I decided to drive over to where these
children lived to check it out.  I found that the first one was at an apartment
complex on Fairfield.  I called the child’s mother and said that I couldn’t get
my bus into the complex so she said that she would walk the child out to the
main road.  The second child’s address was hard to locate but I finial found
the home.  I called that mother also and told her that I would be there in the
morning.  It was 11am when I got home.  I started compiling a bus list when Mae
came home.  we then went to Ogden shopping.  We just had time to do what we
needed and get home for me to drive my PM route.  The afternoon route also went
well.  This evening Mae and I drove up to David’s and took them some tomato
sauce and other vegetables.  We also took David the book Mae made of her
father.  We enjoyed being with them but didn’t stay very long as it is a school
night.  I sure enjoy being with my sweetheart.</p>

did get my time off request entered in the computer.  When I got home I made up
some almond butter and then I worked on my bus route.  We ate some lunch and I
left to take my pm run.  That went well and we were early getting through with
the run because part of the parents came and got their children.  Mae had gone
visiting when I got home.  I loaded my tools into the pickup and then went to
Lowes where I met Jeff and we got his soffit.  After unloading the material I
made a cutting jig to cut the material with.  It was dark so we quite.  I got
home and did some work on my route sheets and then entered my journal.  Mae
called Deanna Davis and found out that she has been diagnosed with terminal

Fridays.  Therefore I had told my first stop that we would be later getting to
her place.  When we got there the mother came out and told me that she couldn’t
accept this inconsistency of time schedule as she had to know when we would be
arriving each day.  She was very upset and wouldn’t let me explain but just
stormed off.  I felt that she was a lot like my sister Margaret in what she
expected of everyone but herself.  After we finished the run I went into the
office and visited with Sherrie.  We spent two hours going over my route for
the Monday thru Thursday runs and Sherrie asked if I would again come in Monday
after the morning route and we would go over the Friday runs.  The afternoon
run went well.  at 5PM we had the Missionaries over for dinner.  After I
returned them to their home we got ready and picked Irven and Sandy up and went
to the viewing for Jimmy Linford, Danny’s younger brother.  We then visited
with Irven and Sandy for a while and played a game of Harts.</p>

patio.  Mae came up and took Ben to his soccer game.  She also took Matt with
her.  Gail took Rachel to her soccer game, which was at the same time as Ben’s
game.  Mae did that so that Jeff would be able to work with me on the patio.  Jeff
and I finished the job just a few minutes after 2PM.  That job finished the
repairs to their house caused by the high winds earlier this year.  I came
right home and then Mae and I went out to Sandi’s.  I checked out the problems
with Sandi’s camper and found nothing wrong.  I then hung a hose storing rack
on the back of their house.  Nick got home from work as I was finishing and
helped me.  Mae and Sandi had gone to Chelci and Steve’s place for Nathan’s
Birthday party.  As I went to leave I asked Nick if he wanted to ride with me
to Chelci and Steve’s but he said that he had to go to another Birthday party,
so he drove his own car.  He turned on the road to Grantsville and I was
thinking that Chelci lived in Stansberry.  I thought that Nick was going to the
other Birthday party so I continued on towards Stansberry.  I got almost to
Erda when Nick called and told me that Chelci and Steve lived in Grantsville
now.  I went on through Erda so took the long way to get there.  I felt very
uncomfortable at Chelci and Steve’s place because of the large size of the
home.  It was late when we got home and I was very tired.  We went straight to

Priesthood meeting.  After the priesthood class ended I got Mae and we went to
Gail’s Ward for Sacrament meeting sa the Primary was putting on the program and
we wanted to support Ben and Rachael.  After getting home Mae and I went
visiting Sister Fallis for the Visiting Teaching and Home Teaching visit for
this month.  We had a good visit with her.  Bob had dinner prepared for us when
we got home.  We took a nap after eating and then we went up to Jeff and Gail’s
for the evening.  After they had their dinner and got the children to bed Jeff
and I challenged our wife’s to a game of Rook.  Jeff and I won by a long ways. 
After getting home I caught my journal up to date as I had missed the two

My morning run went well and after returning to the compound I took the bus
through the wash.  I then went to Sherrie’s office and we worked for about 1 ½
hours trying to get the route sheets corrected.  At 11am Sherrie said that she
would get some help and would have me correct route sheets before Friday.  I
came home and ate a little and lay down and slept for a while.  My afternoon
run went well.  When I got home Mae had dinner about ready.  We ate while we
watched a show on the TV.  The show was very suspenseful but it did use the
Lords name in vain several times, so we should have turned it off.  I got on

a sheet with instruction but when I got to the Download it only gave me the

Mae and I went to a Family History Conference at the Mound Fort Stake on 15<sup>th</sup>

and he is the Managing Director of Family History for the Church.  I just wish

receive.  Mae went over to see Deanna Davis while I was with Bob.  After
returning home I took care of the chickens and worked on the computer.  I tried
to order the CaptionCall phone system for Bob but need more information and
couldn’t get it by phone because of offices being too busy now.  My afternoon
run went well and I got home before 5PM tonight.  Mae had dinner ready.  We did
read from a book that Mae bought yesterday.  Bob and I mowed the lawns.  Mae
went to a book club tonight.  I went over to Jeff and Gail’s and tested some
electrical circuit for Jeff.  I also borrowed a bike from Jeff to see how it
would be to ride a bike to the bus compound.  It’s now 9:30PM and I had better
go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Most
of today was spent with my school bus job.  My morning run went from leaving
home at 6:50AM and then a training meeting after my run from 9:30AM to 1230PM. 
I did get home about 1:30PM for some lunch and a few minutes of sleep.  When I
got home I saw the gates open.  Mae said that Irven and Sandy had been here
picking tomatoes.  They had left in a hurry.  What had happened is their dog
got out of the yard and they went looking for him.  While they were out looking
the dog came back here.  We took him into the house until Irven and Sandy came
back and we gave him to them.  My PM run went quit well but before finishing we
heard strange noises that didn’t sound right.  When we got back to the shop I
talked to one of the mechanics and he checked the bus finding that a band
around air hoses had broken.  I will have to go in early tomorrow and get it
fixed.  Bob was ready to go Home Teaching when I got home.  We visited with
Patriarch and Sister Johnson and did stop by the Casey’s.  I’m tired so we
didn’t do much but eat dinner and I worked on my journal before going to bed. 
Mae tended the children for Gail while she went to a hair appointment.  She was
very tired when that was over.</p>

slept better last night better last night and got up with me and got my
breakfast before I went to work.  I went in early this morning as last night my
bus has a loud horn type noise and from then through the rest of the route I
could hear a loss of compressed air.  When I asked one of the mechanic’s about
it he said that a strap had broken on the air to air hose.  He left a note for
the morning crew but advised me to come in early.  He felt that it should only
take a few minutes to repair.  I did get there and with me being there the
mechanic did take just a few minutes and my bus was ready.   My morning run
went well.  After returning to the shop I attended another training session on
Defensive Driving.  When I got home I only had a few minutes before returning
for my PM run.  That run also went well.  I then spent 45 minutes with Sherrie,
working on my route sheets.  Mae and I went to the movie “Obama 2016”.  It was a
documentary on President Obama’s life prior to him becoming President of the
United States of America with opinions of why he has done the things he has
done and what may be his actions in the future if he is re-elected.  When it ended
I felt that it was of worth to watch but also very concerned for the future of
our country.  We then went to Sizzler to eat.  I would prefer going to Golden
Corral but Mae chose Sizzler.  We came home and watched a DVD before going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in and then got ready to go with Bob, Irven &amp; Sandy to Pocatello.  We
left about 11AM and arrived at Rich and Lois’s at 1:20PM.  Elis brought Rich
out in a wheelchair and then helped him move to the couch.  All of us enjoyed visiting
and reminiscing about the past.  Rich didn’t contribute much but did seem to
enjoy it.  later Elis road with Bob, Irven, Sandy, Mae and I as we drove around
the area where the fire had destroyed.  It was amazing to see the destruction of
homes, buildings and landscaping and then find a home or a wooden swing or a
shed that had not been destroyed.  Some people are starting to rebuild and
others have just moved away.  The fire was expected to have been accidently man
set but no confirmation of this is verified.  It was sad to see such loss and
we marveled at the few, including Rich and Lois’s place that received minimal
damage.  Shortly after returning to the house we left for home.  Bob bought all
of us dinner when we got to Malad.  We got home about 7PM.  After taking care
of the chickens, we tried to find a movie on TV but wasn’t very happy with what
we found.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early this morning and did some meditating about Rich, death and the
purpose of life.  Though we have such a limited knowledge of this subject, I am
so grateful for the greatly expanded knowledge we have that the world does not have. 
We had extra time this morning as we are attending the Brigham City Temple
Dedication today.  Mae and I attended the noon session and really enjoyed the
spirit that we felt and the words of instruction and encouragement that was
given.  Bob did not attend as his hearing aids cannot pickup the closed circuit
broadcast.  When we got home I told Bob that the broadcast had closed caption
in the Relief Society room so after we ate dinner he got ready and attended the
4PM session.  Bob had prepared dinner of liver and onions for he and I and
chicken for Mae.  It was very good.  Mae and I did up the dishes before we went
downstairs.  When Bob got home he said it was fair but he had a lot of trouble
following the program.  Mae and I worked on our computers this afternoon and
evening.  I did some indexing and worked on my journal.  I often wonder if my
journals will ever be of much value after I am gone.  Mae keeps encouraging me
and something within me keep me going.  I went upstairs and called Bruce for
Bob.  He had tried but couldn’t hear him well enough to talk to him.  I called
and visited for a few minutes with Bruce.  He said that Mitchilan will start
treatments this Wednesday and until then they are as much in the dark as we
are.  At this point the Doctors think that she has a slow cancer throughout her
body except her breasts are clear.  It really doesn’t sound the best to me but they
just don’t know.  This evening we talked to each of the boy’s and Sandi about
all of us getting together after General Priesthood meeting and going out to
dinner for the adults.  We will try to get the arrangements made.  It’s late
and I still have the garbage to take out so I will do that, finish this entry
and get to bed.</p>

woke early with a wild dream and it took me a while to go back to sleep.  I
then woke again and got up, taking a shower before Mae woke.  Mae had quite a
bit planned for today.  She helped out two sisters in our ward and went out to
lunch with Georgia.  My runs went well and in between runs I worked on my bus
route, repaired our screen door, gathered up fishing equipment and poles to
take Jeff, Gail and the children fishing this evening.  Mae had dinner ready
when I got home.  After eating we bought some worms and went up to Jeff’s.  We
took the children down to the pond and let them fish until it was dark.  I
thought that the pond was for children to fish but it is mainly for adults and
they only allow artificial lours and flies.  Just before dark I put a hook and
worm on and the children then caught a few blue gills and released them.  They
had fun and that is what we went for.  It was after 9pm when we got home.  I
entered this entry and we went to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep much last night.  I woke with the alarm and got up at 5:30am.  I
had Mae go back to bed and she slept until 11am.  After I finished my AM run I
stopped at the show repair in Kaysville and got my boots that I had taken in
last Friday.  When Mae got up she got ready to go out to lunch with Marna Mc
Phie.  I took a nap and worked on my journal and Indexed until I took my PM
route.  This evening Mae and I watched a couple of shows of “Little House on
the Prairie” and then we went out in the garden.  I picked the strawberries
while Mae picked tomatoes, squash and cucumbers.  I watched part of a “Bonanza”
movie while Mae visited with Mattie.  She had to interview a grandparent about
some of the major changes she had witnessed during her life time.  </p>

didn’t sleep very well last night.  I let her sleep and I got myself off this
morning.  When I finished my run I rode the bike home.  It took me an extra 15
minutes with the bike over the car.  Mae was up when I got home.  I ate a
little and then we lay down and slept for about 17 minutes when the phone
rang.  I worked on my 1971 – 1974 Diary entries getting them digitized into
journal format.  I still have quite a ways to go on getting those years
digitized.  I ate some lunch and then rode the bike back to the compound.  This
time it only took me an extra 5 minutes over the car.  When I got home I went
to the Auto Part store and got oil and filter for the pickup.  It has gone over
on the mileage by 2,000 miles.  I have got to watch that better.  It was about
6PM when Mae called me for dinner.  When I came in Brother and Sister Thompson
had came Home Teaching.  We ate dinner then I did several other small items,
including getting this entry entered.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night but some better than she did for the past
couple of nights.  I wish that I know how to help her.  I let her sleep in and
I got myself of to work.  I had a little time before leaving so I started this
entry and also filled the water bottles before leaving for the bus run.  When I
finished the PM run and returned home, Mae had everything ready to pack.  It
was after 5:30PM when we got away for our trip.  We met Sandi and Nick at Pason
so we could drive the rest of the way together.  It was about 11PM when we got
to Fish Lake and after mid-night before we got to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning until 7:30 and I got up.  Nick soon was up and the two of
us went out fishing.  We started catching fish right of and soon had our limits. 
We cleaned and filet the fish and was still back before noon.  This afternoon
Mae and Sandi went out with us and again we soon had four limits.  The beauty
of the Fall weather and the turning of the leaves is almost breath taking.  It
did sprinkle a couple of times today but not enough to bother.  Most of the
time we did have to wear jackets.  It did sprinkle a little during the day.  
Nick and I again filet the fish.  This evening after eating we played games
until after 11PM.  We played two games of marbles and Mae and Sandy won both of
those games.  We had forgotten to turn off the generator at 10PM.</p>

today Nick and I went out fishing.  This time we tried for larger fish with the
deep rigger but still caught just nice pan size.  The wind caught us off guard
while Nick was trying to undo a snag.  It blow the boat into the shore and we
got hung up in moss.  When nick finally got his tackle free and into the boat
he found that he had hooked another line.  He started pulling that line in and
realized that there was a fish on that line.  The line must have been lost
earlier today as the fish was still alive and fighting.  Before returning to
camp we again cleaned and filet the fish.  We were longer that we were
yesterday so our wife’s got a little anxious about us.  We all went out again
this afternoon and again had a good time catching fish.  Again this evening we
played marbles before going to bed and this time we each won one game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
and I got up and showered and went to church in Loa.  Sandi and Nick didn’t go
with us.  We were first impressed with the old but very beautiful chapel.  We
found out that it had been built in the early 1900s and had been remodeled 4
times.  Loa is also the Stake Center and so the size was needed for Stake
meetings.  There was a good attendance at Sacrament meeting and it looked like
there were several visitors in attendance.  Today was their Fast and Testimony
meeting and after the Sacrament had been passed the time was opened up to the
bearing of testimonies.  At first is was very slow but then it became one
person after another.  Mae also bore her Testimony.  We were very impressed
with the Spirit that was present.  We left after the meeting.  We stopped at a
filling station and filled the truck with gas as it was getting very low on
fuel.  After getting back to camp Mae and Sandi prepared sandwiches for lunch
and we drove to Capitol Reef.  On the way we again were struck with the fall
beauties.  We took several pictures.  At Capitol Reef we first stopped at the
information center and was advised with our limited time that we should take
the 1 mile hike to natural bridge and then a drive down a canyon road.  We did
both of those scenic places and really enjoyed them.  It was late when we got
back to camp; we were tired and just went to bed.  </p>
