didn’t get a call to take a morning route and that was ok with me.  I tried to
call Brad again today but he isn’t returning my calls.  I decided to get Lancer
Auto to remove the CNG from my truck.  I made an appointment with them for
tomorrow.  I removed the bed top before I took my field trip run.  My field
trip was a drop and return so I brought the bus back home.  I was able to take
a short nap before returning to take the students back to their school.  The
run went well.  I took care of the animals and Mae prepared dinner.  We watched
a couple of short movies on TV while we ate.  I took care of some Church
business this evening.  </p>

snowed and the roads were very slippery but I went to Salt Lake anyway.  I took
the pickup into Lancers Auto and had them remove the CNG fuel tank so that it
runs only on gasoline.  I just waited until they got it done.  I next drove to
American Fork and looked at the camper.  Mr. Anton Berbick had delivered it to
Mike’s.  After looking it over I realized that I needed to get a tie down kit,
so I went looking but could not find one in the area.  I called Anton and he
gave me the address for Terry RV in Murry.  I called them and they have a kit
but after talking with them I decided to set an appointment for them to install
it next Tuesday.  On the way home I stopped at the RV dealer in Sunset and they
are about the same price but it will take at least two weeks before they can
get it installed.  I will stay with Terry RV.  Mae has been tending Jeff and
Gail’s children while they went skiing today.  This evening we had Jill and
Jessie Jenson over for to play games.  We had a good time being with them.  Mae
and I watched the BYU vs San Diego basketball which lasted until mid-night.</p>

got up at 7AM and has soon busy trying to get things done.  I went to Scott’s
at 10AM and worked until after 4PM taping the sheetrock.  Just before finishing
my right leg went into cramping and I had a hard time finishing the first
coat.  When I got home I had time to lay down for a few minutes map.  Bob
prepared liver and onions for dinner and chicken for Mae.  Mike called to let
us know that Orem High won the 4A State Basketball tournament.  He was very
excited about that.  I took invitations around to my Home Teaching Families.  
We went over to watch Tyler play Basketball this evening.  They lost but it was
a good game.  We got gas in the car on the way home.  This way we won’t have to
get gas tomorrow.  I entered this entry and then we took showers before going
to bed.</p>

woke before 6AM and Mae soon got up.  We got ready to leave.  I took care of
the rabbits and chickens and we left for Sandi and Nick’s.  We attended their
Ward where during Sacrament meeting Nick was presented for ordination to the
Aaronic Priesthood to the office of Priest.  Sandi was also released from the
YWMIA and presented to be the Jr. Sunday School chorister.  Following the Block
meetings we met in the Bishops office.  I was privileged to be voice as we
ordained Nick; I was invited to stand in while Sandi was set apart.  Brad and
Steve also stood in with Nick’s ordination.  Following the meetings we all were
invited to Sandi and Nick’s for dinner.  It was a very enjoyable afternoon. 
After Brad, JaNae, Steve, Chelci and the children left, Sandi, Nick, Mae and I
played cards.  We first played marbles, at which the girls won.  We then played
“Hand and Foot” and the girls again won that game.  Mae and I then came home
letting Sandi and Nick get to bed as neither had gotten much sleep last night. 
Sandi had let the children sleep over and Nick had worked last night and only
got a little sleep after Sacrament meeting during Sunday school and Priesthood
meeting.  On the way home we started to listen to a financial planning program
and that just discouraged me.  I really feel that I am to blame for our
financial failures and maybe it added to other problems.</p>

down brackets and an electrical plug for the camper.  Mae had lunch ready when
we got back.  I had a short nap and then took a bus route.  I was home before
4PM.  After dinner I tried indexing on the Family Search.  The first couple of
records I did ok on but the next batch was from Texas and I couldn’t determine
Spanish and so finally sent the batch back.  Mae went to Jeff and Gail’s to
tend their children while they attended a finance class.  I turned on the TV
and watched a Hallmark movie.  It is after 10PM and Mae is just leaving
Jeff’s.  Mae got home before I did get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 5AM to take a field trip that started at 7:15AM.  I hadn’t read all
the instructions as the trip sheet said it was for Davis High, however I was to
make my first pickup was at Syracuse High School.  I realized that something
was wrong when no one came out at Davis.  I called and got corrected so went
straight to Syracuse High.  They were waiting but said that there was no hurry
as Northridge High had canceled out.  I took the Syracuse class in and then
returned home.  They won’t be returning until 11:45AM.  Mae had me some
breakfast ready when I got home.  I took care of the animals and filled our
water jugs.  The afternoon return went well and when I returned to the school I
called Mae.  We had planned to go to S.L. and get my pickup from Terry’s RV and
then go on to Mike’s and get the camper.  Mae and Bob met me at the bus
compound after my run.  I had asked Bob to go down to Salt Lake with us and
drive our car back.  That way Mae wouldn’t have to drive our car back Salt Lake
this evening.  Bob decided that he would rather drive his car down as he
doesn’t feel comfortable driving our car.  Mae and I stopped and bought a salad
from Costco for our lunch before going on.  Mike had called me and said that he
might be at home when we got there as he had a meeting at the school district
office and it shouldn’t last very long.  Just before getting to Mike’s we
called Anton as he wants to get the sale’s contract signed.  He will meet us at
Mikes.  Mike was there when we got to his place.  He helped me prepare the
camper to load onto the pickup.  Anton also got there and helped load it.  The
biggest concern was the heavy winds that blew but all worked out ok and with
the three of us we got it loaded and tied down.  I was very grateful for both
Mike’s and Anton’s help.  We waited until 8:30PM for the winds to calm down. 
As we didn’t have clothing, food or our pills with us I decided that we should
try going home.  Before we got to the freeway I had concerns that I had made a
bad decision.  I determined that if it did not get better before we found a
motel that we would stop for the night.  It did get some better after we went
over the point of the mountain so we continued.  I traveled slowly but so did
most of the traffic.  When we got past the Lagoon area the snow increased
considerable.  Just before we got to the 650 exit there was a very bad wreck on
the North bound lane.  By the time we exited south bound traffic was being
exited of the 650 exit.  We didn’t get held up for long and got home safely at
10:30PM.  When I got in and relaxed the tension really started getting to me. 
I took some Tylenol and Mae rubbed my feet to get me to relax.  We soon went to
bed in a warm and safe surrounding.  </p>

got up at 8:30AM and were very glad that I didn’t get a call out from the bus
dispatch.  Mae made a nice breakfast and after eating I went out and took care
of the animals.  I used my snowmobile suit as it was still blowing and quite
cold outside.  I made some entries to my payroll and ground some flour for Mae
to make bread with.  She also made bread to take to others in the Ward.  I
spent most of the afternoon indexing.  Roy called to tell us that Linda is now
home.  She lost 65 lb. and the Dr. says that she is ok now.  Mae and I
delivered some bread to Dee Francom and to Brother Larsen.  We stopped at
Casey’s and gave them a squash and also invited them to the High Priest social
and the couples Dinner Dance.   This evening we watched a couple of shows on TV
before going to bed.</p>

buses for Roberta before coming home.  After getting home I removed the camper
from the pickup.  Bob helped me with that job.  I just had time to eat lunch
and take a short nap before returning to take the PM run.  That also went well
and upon returning home I bid on field trips and entered some payroll
information.  We watched a show on TV while we ate our dinner.  We then studied
our lesson for Sunday.  I entered this journal entry while we were waiting for
Irven and Sandy to come over.  They never got here until 8:50PM so by the time they
left we just went to bed.</p>

were too tired last night and concerned about a possibility I might receive a
call to take a morning route, so we went to bed.  When I didn’t receive a call
out, we decided to watch a movie on DVD that we have had for some time.  It was
the “Little Women” and it lasted for two hours.  We both really enjoyed it. 
That took a good share of the morning.  We did get a few things done and then I
took a Field trip at 1PM.  Mae went shopping with Michelle and Ashley this
afternoon.  We volunteered to tend Scott and Michelle’s children this evening
while they went out with some friends.  It went quite well this evening.  Kylan
and I played a couple of games of checkers.  I tried to teach Kylan some skills
of the game and so either let him take some moves back or made some alternate
moves to free him from a trap.  It ended up that we called both games a draw. 
Mae and I played game all evening with the children.  We were tired when Scott
and Michelle came to get them.  We set up and watched a movie on TV just to
relax.  I fell asleep but Mae watched the complete show before we went to bed
“late”.</p>

as to their size and she wanted the grandchildren to see the rabbits tomorrow. 
I then decided to go to Cindy Bennet’s and get the rabbits she wants to give to
me.  Three of them are ready to be butchered and five of them are just weaned. 
This afternoon I butchered the three does and our one old chicken.  Mae gave me
a haircut, I took a nap and then showered and got ready for the Stake High
Priest banquet.  It was very nice.  Brother and Sister Saunder’s, Mae and I
stayed until everything was cleaned up.  </p>

for meetings.  Meetings went well today, our Family History class went well
although we didn’t have a lot there.  Mae and I stayed for choir practice after
the Block.  We just had a sandwich for lunch as we are having Scott’s and
Jeff’s families over for dinner.  David called and invited all of us to their
place after we ate dinner.  The rest agreed with that so after cleaning up the
dishes we all went to David’s.  We had a very enjoyable evening and left
David’s about 9PM for home.  When we got home we still had a few things to
straighten up.  Mae and I then played a game of Rummy, which Mae won and then
one more hand which I won.  I sure enjoy being with Mae!</p>

small scratch that I must have got while showing grandchildren the rabbits.  I
rubbed alcohol on the area and went back to sleep.  When I woke it seemed to be
better.  Mae had woke with her legs bothering her, after I went back to bed and
so she slept in the recliner.  I got up just after 7AM and stayed quiet so as
not to wake Mae.  I made up the bed and took the clothes into the wash room. 
After Mae got up I did some computer work on my personal journal.  I went into
work about 12:30PM and checked some buses and then made a PM bus route.  I will
do the PM route all this week and next Monday.  We put the rabbit and chicken
on to cook in our roaster oven before I left today.  Mae cooked it and it was
still cooling when I got home.  I stripped the meat of the bones and then
ground the meat.  We got almost 15LB of ground meat that we bag in seal-a-meal
bags and froze.  I was tired before I finished.  We worked on the Family
History lesson for a few minutes before we went to bed.</p>

from the tree that we took down last fall.  I also cleaned the chicken coop and
the rabbit area.  All these I piled in a pile north of the garden and will use
it for garden mulch.  I went to the bud compound after lunch and a short nap. 
There I checked three more buses for Roberta.  I again took bus 76’s PM route
this afternoon.  Mae had dinner ready shortly after I got home.  I did some
work on the computer for a while.  We went over to Jeff and Gail’s to visit and

it up I did have one.  I just hadn’t added it to my day planner and forgot it. 
I worked on building a transfer cage for the rabbits.  I think it will be
easier on both me and the rabbit.  Kim called this morning to tell us that
Michelle, Kalab’s wife, was taken to the hospital during the night and they
performed an emergency C section.  Michelle is doing fairly well but they are
very concerned about the baby.  The baby was blessed and given a name of
Natalie Rose Porter.  We called many of our family and asked them to join in
prayer for the mother and child.  My afternoon run went well and I also stopped
in and visited with Roberta about a bus route that is up for bids.  She said
that there is another that is coming up soon.  Mae soon had dinner ready after
I got home.  I did get the eggs gathered before dinner.  Kim called back and
said that there is still a lot of concerns but he thinks both Mother and Child
are doing fair.  I submitted a bid for a bus route this evening and then

12:30PM so had enough time to eat and take a few minute nap before taking the
afternoon route.  Bob had liver and onions ready for dinner when I got home.  I
did stop and buy rabbit and chicken feed on the way home.  Mae, Bob and I
attended the Republican Caucus this evening.  Bob finally gave up as he
couldn’t hear what was going on so he went home.  Mae and I got a ride home
Cassie Martindale when our Precinct finished at 10:45PM.  I took the time to

that schedule if I had to drive out of the Farmington area so she printed me
the route sheets and I used 392.  With the help of my GPS I made the first stop
1 minute late.  The runs went well but I am sure glad that I had the GPS.   I
came home and took care of my animals before lunch.  I tried to get in a short
nap but Bob knocked to let us know that he had got the mail.  My afternoon run
also went well.  Roberta gave me some assignments for the upcoming week.  This
evening we relaxed and watched a show from Netflex.  The disk had some
scratches on it so we missed some of the show.  Kim came by today to bring Mae
some pictures and while he was here told about their granddaughter.  Mae wrote
up the following and e-mailed it to our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

Natalie Rose. I called Kim this morning and he didn't sound as optimistic as he
did yesterday. He said the doctors are puzzled as they have given her two blood
transfusions as her platelets were only 17% when they took tests soon after she
was born. The 2nd time, they were down to 14% so they gave her one transfusion.
That took them to 58% so they gave her another one and it took them to 86%.
They just took another test and they went back down to 66% (I think that's what
he said). Anyway, the doctors don't know why the platelets won't stay high. So,
please keep praying for her. Caleb had to fly back East this morning (I forget
whether it was West Virginia or where) to check out graduate school. I guess he
has three offers and this is one of them. He already had it scheduled, as this
is his spring break from college, but it was tough to leave his wife and baby
with the way the baby is. He will fly back on Sunday.</p>

in the car but I went into the house.  I have a hard time believing that anyone
needs that size of home.  It is no wonder that our country is in such financial
condition.  From there we went to the High School to the 128<sup>th</sup> Old
Folks Sociable.  Chelci sang in the program and did very well.  the program was
over all very professional and excellently done.  We then enjoyed a very nice
dinner.  We wandered through the halls for a few minutes not realizing that the
Big Band was already playing dance music in the gym.  We got in for one last
number and then the band was changed for a Western band.  Although we enjoyed
the 2<sup>nd</sup> band we felt bad that we missed the 1<sup>st</sup> band.  I
danced with Mae, then a dance with Sandi.  While I was dancing with Sandi,
Chelci asked Mae if she could dance the next dance with me.  She wanted to
dance at least once with me and they had to go home to the children.  I did
enjoy dancing with her and she followed me very well.  it was a very enjoyable
evening and we got home at 11:45PM.  We went straight to bed both hurting from the
experience but it was enjoyable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 7:45AM in order to make it to meetings.  We both slept fairly well
although we were both hurting from the fun we had last night.  I fed that
animals before breakfast and then I attended High Priest Group Leadership
meeting.  We enjoyed the block and our lesson went well.  Bob prepared a very
nice roast dinner for us.  He wanted to have Sherrie and Eric for dinner also
but Sherrie said that she was too tired to leave the house.  I feel badly that
his children very seldom come by to see him.  I went over to Casey’s and took
them an invitation to the Elders social and a spaghetti.  The complete family
is sick with the crud that seems to be going around.  We had an appointment to
go Home Teaching to Sister Fallis’s but she didn’t feel well so asked us to
come next Sunday.  I took a nap but I don’t think Mae laid down for very long. 
Scott came over a helped me get my GPS registered and new maps downloaded on
it.  Mae and I went over to visit Sylvia and Smokie Barns.  Smokie has under
gone surgery in his right shoulder and is still laid up.  Sylvia isn’t feeling
very well either so it was good to visit with them.  We spent most of the
evening their but they seem to need that visit.  It was 9:30PM when we got home
so I entered this journal entry.  We had planned on going right to bed but we
got visiting and it was almost 11PM before we made it to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 2AM concerned about being called to take a run.  I went right back to
sleep and woke again just after 6AM, again worrying about being called so I got
up for a few minutes.  Mae had also woke so we went back to bed and didn’t get
up until 9AM.  It was sure nice.  While Mae prepared breakfast I took care of
the animals.  After eating I set up the camera on a stand and took pictures of
pictures that Mae wanted digital copies.  I filled some capsules Mannatech
product.  Mae took Sister Southard over to look at an assisted living complex. 
Bob called me up to look at an advertisement for a supplement for Sherrie.  I
discouraged him from buying anything that Sherrie didn’t make the decision that
she wanted it.  After I ate my lunch I took a short nap.  I went over to the
bus shop to visit with Roberta but I found that today was a Professional Day
and the busses didn’t run today.  I worked on my journals off and on most of
the day.  Mae and I watched a show on TV while we ate dinner.  Mae went up to
Jeff and Gail’s to ten children while Jeff and Gail attended a class.  I watched
another western on TV and played a game of Harts on the computer before going
to bed.  I had said prayers and was just going to bed at 10PM when Mae came
home.  we visited for a few minutes and went to bed.</p>

woke before 6am but Mae hadn’t slept well and had gone to bed in the spear
bed.  I kept the phones near me so that a call from the shop could be answered
quickly without waking Mae.  I read my scriptures and started this entry while
waiting on a possible call from the shop.  No calls came.  Mae woke at 7:45am
so we had breakfast and went to the Bountiful Temple.  When we got home we had
some lunch and I took a short nap.  I then went into the bus shop to take a
field trip and was told that I had been awarded route 34.  I will start
tomorrow.  I turned all my other assignments back in to Roberta.  I didn’t get
home from this evenings field trip until 9pm.  I entered some payroll
information and then filled out this journal entry.  I guess we had better get
to bed as I will have to get up</p>

woke early and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I got my own breakfast and let Mae
sleep in.  She sure is a wonderful wife and sweetheart.  I started as a full
time bus driver for Davis School District driving bus 34.  Kate Johnson is my
assistant.  The plans were that the sub driver that has been driving that route
would drive today with me riding along to learn the route; however they were
short on drivers so I had to take the route with my assistant helping me.  Kate
was very good at giving me directions.  Bus 34 is a short International bus and
is very different than the Blue Bird buses.  I had trouble finding where the
switches were, how to check the oil and how the door and warning lights
worked.  We made it and was just a few minutes late getting all the children to
school.  When I got back to the compound I spent another hour just learning how
the bus functioned.  It went better this afternoon.  In between runs Bob and I
took some trash over to the city’s garbage trailer.  Mae went with Irven and
Sandy to the Weber Collage area and passed out flyers supporting Ron Paul for
President.  This evening we watched a movie on TV.  I entered this journal
entry before we went to bed.</p>

got up with me and got my breakfast before I left.  My morning run went well. 
I stopped at Scott’s after finishing my morning run, to see if my voltage meter
was there.  It wasn’t.  When I got home Mae was just leaving to take to meet
Shauna so that Shauna could get the children’s items for a CARE package for
David, which Mae is putting together.   I took care of the animals and then
worked on the computer.  Mae prepared lunch and then we took a nap.  The
afternoon route went well and I got home about 5PM.  After dinner Bob and I
went Home Teaching to Patriarch and Sister Johnston.  We could only stay for a
half hour as their son came to take them to the symphony in Salt Lake.  We did
stop by Casey’s and found that they are doing better.  We had an appointment
with Thurman’s but they had something else come up and had to reschedule for
next Tuesday.  Just as I came home Mae got a phone call, I believe from Jeff
and visited until after 8:30pm.  We then visited for sometime about Jeff
situation and other related items.  It’s now after 9PM and we had better go to
bed.</p>

with me and we went over to The Nut and Bolt store to get screws for our
cabinets.  This evening we attended the Dinner Dance social put on by our
Elders Quorum.  They had done a great job with the decorations, the music and
the dinner but there were only 9 to 10 couples in attendance.  I really felt
bad for the support from our Ward.  </p>

slept in and then I went out and took care of our animals.  Mae made a nice
breakfast.  I reinforced Mae’s kitchen cabinet drawers and that took most of
the morning.  This afternoon we put some of my extra tools on KSL.COM and I put
my tools back from using them.  I checked the one gas tank on the camper and it
has a defective valve and is leaking.  I also moved the camp trailer out so I
could get my battery charger.  I put it on the battery for the camper.  Mae was
busy working on the computer so I used our camera to digitize several pictures
for Mae.  We set down for dinner and then watched a couple of shows on TV.</p>

practice plus I had to sign for building keys to get into the church and the
Family History Center.  Mae went Visiting Teaching to Sister Fallis at 2:30PM
and then Bob and I went there at 3PM.  Bob and I then went Home Teaching to
Sister Fallis and had a very interesting and enjoyable visit with her.  I then
came home and called Brother Thomas.  He and I went visiting for a few
minutes.  Mae and Bob were almost finished eating dinner when I got home. 
After eating, Mae and I came downstairs and took a nap.  This evening Bob, Mae
and I went up to the hospital and visited with Sister Von Niederhauser.  When
we got back home we had a piece of toast with almond butter and jam on it.  I
finished my journal entry and worked on Indexing for a few minutes before we

didn’t sleep well last night and when I woke she had wrote me a couple of
notes.  She didn’t get to sleep until after 5am even though she had gone to
sleep in the small bedroom.  She had prepared most everything for my breakfast
so I turned off the phones and let her sleep.  A storm was coming in when I
left and it hit just before we finished our run.  Shortly after I got home Mae
woke and stayed up.  I took care of the animals and filled our water jugs up. 
I got the Big Mable tub out and blow it up, as I have a fellow that wants to
buy it.  I told him that I would let him have it for $100 although we paid $300
for it.  I left for the pm run early as I took our red rocker to the D.I. on my
way.  The pm run went well and I got home at 5PM.  After dinner I took a short
nap.  Claudia and Wayne Thompson came over this evening and we played games. 
It was a fun evening.  I finished up this entry and we soon went to bed.  Shellie
called with some very good news.  Quint has been meeting with his Bishop and is
now putting in to serve a mission.</p>

woke early and was up before 5am.  I was concerned about the write up of the
changes to my bus route because of the change from the Farmington Compound to
the Clearfield Compound.  This change is sure a lot better for me but it may
prove a bad thing when routes are bid again for next Fall.  I worked in the
garden after getting home from the morning run.  I got on row of strawberries
transplanted.  This afternoons run went fairly wel although we had one little
girl get sick to her stomach and we had to clean that up the best we could
until we got back to the compound and then we did a better job.  This evening
Brother Campbell and his children brought their six chickens over for us to
have.  Bob and I then went Home teaching to Brother Thurman and his daughter
Annie.  Sister Thurman was not there as she took her counselors to the Women’s
Conference in Salt Lake.  When I got home Mae and I went out to check on the
chickens.  None of the new ones were in the coop, so we looked around and found
them perched on the boat and tent trailer.  I carefully picked them up and took
them to the coop.  I will keep them locked in at least for tonight.  I worked
on my journal while Mae worked on pictures.  </p>

didn’t sleep well last night but was up early for my route.  The route went
well.  When I got home I worked in the garden.  Mae came out and worked in her
rose bushes and then helped me in the garden.  We got the strawberries
transplanted and ready.  We then worked the rest of the garden down and planted
two rows of peas.  Mae took Ben and Rachael to Dinosaur Park this afternoon.  I
tried to take a nap before leaving for my afternoon route but shortly after
getting to sleep, Bob woke me to tell me that he would cook me a chicken
patty.  I told him that I was about to go to work so wouldn’t have time for
one.  He didn’t understand and within ten minutes he knocked on the wall and
woke me again.  I put it in the refrigerator and went to work.  After returning
home I ate the food and then gathered the chickens into the coop for the
night.  We got 13 eggs today so felt good at that.  Is a High Priest Quorum
Leadership we went visiting Vivan Graham.  Mae and I then went up to Jeff and
Gail’s and played a game of Rook.  Gail and Mae beat Jeff and I.  It was about
11pm when we got to bed.</p>

me.  It took a little longer this afternoon to do the afternoon run due to one
of the children took a long time getting off the bus.  Also the traffic on the
Freeway was backed up and that slowed us up.  Mae had dinner ready for me when
I got home.  After eating I joined others from our Ward and we trimmed a couple
of fruit trees for Wanda Miller.  Mae helped ne and we put the chickens in the coop
for the night.  I am quite tired this evening.</p>

as normal we got up and with Mae’s help I took my bus run.  Before leaving I
went to the chicken coop and released the chickens.  It was fun to see them run
for the grassy areas and pick up worms.  After my morning run I went shopping
for materials to repair the one fence gate, install new post for the moving of
our garden fence and to install volleyball post in the back yard.  That took
most of the time between the am and pm runs.  When I finished my bus route I
went to work on the back fence gate pole.  That took all the time until we were
to prepare for Kelley and Marilyn and Jill and Jesse Jensen to come over for
the evening.  While we were eating dinner we got a call from Marylyn to tell us
that they would be unable to come this evening.  We felt bad that they couldn’t
come but we spent the evening together playing a game of Rummy.  It was a
fairly even game but at the end I won by just a few points.  We then went to
bed and watched a movie on DVD called “Joshua”.  it was a fairly good movie and
had no per vanity used in it.</p>

woke early and soon was busy caring for the animals and resetting the fencing
and the gates on the new post.  I finished just in time to come in and watch
the first session of General Conference.  Conference as normal was very
enjoyable.  After the morning session of conference I reassembled he fence and
gate.  Mae cleaned our new camper.  Bob prepared a cabbage casserole for
lunch.  I then went to Sportsman Warehouse and bought Mae and I a new fishing
licenses.  We again watched the afternoon session of conference.  I got my boat
out and cleaned it up.  Using the ear muffs that I purchased I was able to run
the motor and check it out.  This evening Scot and his family came over so that
Scott and I might attend the Priesthood Session of General Conference. 
Michelle and the rest of his family stayed and visited with Mae.  After the
very inspirational meeting Scott and I stopped and bought ice cream and root
beer along with a large yogurt and came home to our family for treats.  Scott
also helped me down load the Church LDS tool app to my iPod.  In doing so I
hurt Mae’s feelings by the way I spoke to her in asking for her help.  I do not
mean to speak cross but it too often comes that way.  Even Scott picked up on
my remarks.  I didn’t recognize what I had done until I noticed a feeling that
I finally recognized just before we went to bed.  Although I apologized I pray
that unrepairable damages were not done.</p>
