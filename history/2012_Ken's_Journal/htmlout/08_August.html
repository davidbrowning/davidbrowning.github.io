<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 4:45AM and start the day.  I caught my journal up to date and started
this entry.  I am still having trouble sleeping with my face mask.  I’m sure
that is what kept Mae awake and she finally went to the other bed room.  I
worked on the computer getting a couple of pictures ready to print for Mae. 
Mae got up about 7AM and got breakfast.  After breakfast I took care of the
animals and then finished the repairs to the camper.  We hauled all the
supply’s fro the reunion into the garage.  Bob parked his car in the drive way
so we had the garage to put things.  This afternoon Mae and I went shopping for
the groceries for the reunion.  It was 10:45PM when we finished up and got
ready for bed.  We still have showers to take so it will be mid-night before we
get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke sometime early morning concerned about how I could get all the supplies
that we have for the reunion into the trailer that we are renting.  The
solution came to me to use the saw horses that I use to support the camper when
I remove it from the pickup.  I could pack the bottom of the trailer after
putting the saw horses in place.  The lay my 2” X 6” X 8’ across the two saw
horses, then lay a 4’ X 8’ X ¾” sheet of plywood over that would then support a
2<sup>nd</sup> layer of supplies.  I woke and got up at 5:30AM and Mae woke at
6AM as I had forgotten to turn the alarm off.  Mae hadn’t gone to sleep last
night until after 2AM and the got up at 6AM.  We got some breakfast and then I went
to get the trailer.  Shortly after I got home with the trailer, Rick and
Georgia came to help us pack the supplies.  We did it as I had planned during
the night and we were able to get everything loaded.  We used every space there
was from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall but we made it.  Mae and I then
went to Winager’s and got yhe chicken that we had ordered, then filled the
truck with fuel and from there to the Wonder Bread store and got bread supplies
that we had to put on the bed in the camper.  It was 11:30AM when we left for Tropic. 
After getting past the Provo area we stopped just to check the truck and
trailer, especially I was concerned about the trailer hitch but everything was
ok.  We stopped again for fuel and then traveled on the Tropic.  We arrived in
Tropic at 6:16PM.  Kim and Jeaneen were there at the barn and helped us unpack
the supplies.  That was sure a relief as Mae and I was very tired.  Kim and
Jeaneen then left as they have a room in Tropic.  We then start to get food ready
to eat when Scott and Mishelle and their family came to set up for the night. 
All in all it was after 11PM when we finished and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
day was spent preparing for the Bushnell Clan to start arriving.  Scott and
Kylan helped me assemble the canapé that Bob and I purchased.  Scott and I also
posted directional sign so Family members could find their way easily.  The
first started to arrive in the early afternoon and then continued thru the
evening.  We served dinner this evening of barbeque sandwiches.  It had been a
very busy day starting early morning and continuing through the day.  It was
late when we finally were able to turn in for the day about 11PM.  We were very
tired and were glad for the day’s end.  Although we were so busy yet we often
felt the Tender Mercies of our Lord, even with the weather.  Often there were
times when it looked like cretin rains yet the storms never materialized.  When
we started the family activities everything seemed to work out great and many
family members helped activities and work move smoothly.  Thru out the day both
Mae and I we continually approached with questions as to how we wanted thing
done, questions about the cabin arrangements along with a multitude on other
topics.  Sometimes we felt pulled in many directions at the same time.  It was
good to kneel in prayer at the end of the day and go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was up by 4AM and Mae was soon to follow.  We started breakfast early so that
we could have food ready before the participants of the morning trail horse
ride had to leave for Bryce Cannon by 8AM.  Both Mae and I were kept very busy overseeing
the food preparations.  By the time we completed one meal it was time to
prepare for the next.  We were continually helped in these preparations by
family members who were very willing to stop whatever they had going to assist
in my requests.  By the time we finished with our evening meal I really just
quit.  Our evening family talent night went over so well and I felt that
everyone really enjoyed it.  I was hurting so bad that I left after the program
and came to our camper and worked on my journal.  It was after 10PM that Mae
came home.  She is sure a go-er and just doesn’t stop.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning we got up and put things out for each family to bring their own cold
cereal and we provided the milk and other items.  I cleaned up the camp stoves
and took the top off the canapé.  I then enjoyed eating breakfast.  It really
felt good to have the pressure off.  At 10AM we had an hour Church meeting
which Uncle Van conducted.  They had uncle Van’s Grand-son and Keela and Pete’s
son, both recently returned Missionaries, speak.  It was a special meeting.  We
then set out all the leftover food and invited everyone to make sandwiches to
take with them or to take any of the remaining food with them.  We finished
cleaning up and packing the last of the supplies by 2PM.  Just before we
finished cleaning up and packing it rained quite hard for a few minutes.  We
have felt that the Lord had been mindful of our reunion.  Shellie and Roy,
Sandi &amp;Nick and Mae and I were the last to leave.  We went from there to
the Duck Creek Campground where we stayed the night.  Nick and I had understood
that the Duck Creek reservoir was good fishing and we were planning on renting
a boat tomorrow, whoever we found that the reservoir is almost empty.  We
stayed the night in the Duck Creek campgrounds.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
felt good to sleep in this morning.  While Sandi and Shellie were preparing
breakfast; Nick and I went to Duck Creek to buy a few fishing supplies.  When
we returned Sandi had prepared an excellent breakfast for us.  After breakfast
Nick and I took Kylan and Doson fishing.  I caught two nice fish and Nick
caught one nice fish.  I was sure glad when Nick caught the one as he had never
stream fished before, so that was a thrill for him.  When we came back to camp
Sandi had all their camping equipment ready for them to leave for home.  It
started to rain just as they were ready to leave.  It rained most of the rest
of the day.  We played game most of the afternoon in Shellie and Roy’s camper. 
Roy put on a movie, this evening that everyone except me watched.  I stayed in
our camper and caught up this journal.  I was going to get to bed early but as
I started to brush my teeth the pump ran out of water.  I had to carry water
from the faucet across the street in a bucket and pump it into the camper. 
That wouldn’t have been bad but the hose on the emergency supply water pump had
become brittle with time and would break.  I had just about taped the hose with
duck tape from end to end.  I had just gone to bed when Mae and Kylan came in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in until almost 8AM.  Mae and I got things about ready to leave for
home.  Shellie soon had breakfast ready and she really had an excellent
breakfast.  We had to dump the tanks on our camper so it was noon before we
left for home.  I had planned on going thru Cedar City but without even noticing,
I had turned east instead of west, and we were at the Hwy 89 junction before I
realized I had gone the wrong way.  We there for went through Panquage and
crossed back over from Hwy 89 to Interstate 15 by way of Hwy 20.  That cost us
at least ½ hour in time.  Although Mae had heard that the Hwy to Cedar is under
construction so maybe it was the right direction anyway.  We stopped in Fillmore
for gas and while there I laid down in the camper and slept for a few minutes
while Mae prepared us some lunch.  Kylan rode in the camper from there to
home.  when we approached Salt Lake City I decided to take the belt route to
miss some of the evening traffic.  A mile from the turn off all traffic came to
a stop as there was an accident that blocked the north bound traffic.  It took
us about 45 minutes to get around it.  We got home about 6:30PM.  Kylan and I
unloaded the trailer while Mae cooked the fish for dinner.  Bob told us that he
didn’t feel well today.  He also told us that the chickens weren’t laying so I
went out and after searching I found where they had hidden their nest.  There
were 17 eggs in that hiding place.  After eating we took Kylan home and while
there we looked at the camper Scott and Mishelle bought on ksl.com and they got
a very good deal on it.  We were sure tired when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up before 7AM so that I could return the trailer to the rental company.  I
fueled the pickup.  I fouled up on my mileage records but to the best it looks
like my fuel mileage went from as high as 13.07MPG to as low as 11.4 MPG. 
After getting back home I put some of the things away.  By 6PM we were both
tired so we went out to eat as the Sizzler.  Georgia and Rick stopped by and
got their equipment.  Before going to bed, we watch the DVD “Charley”.   Although
we have seen it before we still really enjoyed it.  We haven’t found my phone
and I think the battery is dead so we can’t call it to find it that way.</p>

got up between 5 and 5:30 this morning.  Mae started house work and I started
first with the garden, the I cut down the weeds around the sheds.  We continued
all day getting various items that we took to the reunion put away.  I called
Lois this evening and visited with her concerning their deck.  I asked her to
see if they could find a contractor there to replace it for them.  I hope that
they will and can.  By evening we were both very tired.  </p>

woke at 4:45AM, worked on my journal and tried some indexing, at 7:30 I wiped
the windows.  Mae got up about that time.  I went back to bed for a while.  The
weather was overcast and cool so I mowed the lawns.  I then sprayed the garden
for fungicides.  I then sprayed around some of the back fences for weed
control.  Mae took the electric ovens back and of course did some visiting.  We
watched a couple movies this evening before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were assigned to clean the church house this morning so were there from 8AM to
almost 10AM.  We had others helping so it went quite fast.  We picked up the
license plate holder for the front of my pickup.  I had ordered it in before
the Bushnell Reunion.  We then changed clothes and went to Porterville for the
Sanford Porter Reunion.  Not very many attended but it was good.  We visited
with Jeanenne and Kim’s for a little while after.  We came home and cleaned up
the rabbit pens and replaced the one flooring.  We had a fellow from Heber come
to look at them and bought everything except the rabbits.  I sold it all for
$250.00 which was quite a deal for him but I am glad to get rid of the worry
and expense.  David and his family came over this evening to visit.  Mae made
dinner and we had a good time being with them.  Mae and I watched a movie on
DVD before going to bed.</p>

I got up at 7AM I got a note Mae had left for me telling me that she hadn’t
been able to go to sleep and it was now 4:15AM and she would try again.  I got
ready for church and ate some breakfast when Mae came in at 9:30AM.  I attended
High Priest Group Leadership meeting and realized that I had forgotten the
Stake General Priesthood meeting this morning at 6AM.  I had also gone from
home without my Scriptures so I went home and got them.  Bob and Mae were just
ready to drive over to meetings.  Mae then road back to church with me.  When
we got home from meetings it was 2:40PM and the fellow said that he would come
after 3PM.  I quickly changed close and got the rabbit pens and equipment ready
to go.  I then went in and ate dinner.  The fellow came about 5PM with a
trailer and a helper.  We were able to load everything and get them on their
way.  Mae and I watched a movie this evening but I really wasn’t very impressed
with the story.  After all the chickens went to roost Mae went out with me and
I checked all the chickens to see if they are laying and it feels like they are
all laying at least occasionally.</p>

sleep as long as she could this morning but still she got up at 8:30AM.  I feel
so concerned for her and so helpless as to what to do.  Today she bought some
Melatonin that Jeanenne told her that it really helped her.  I sure hope it
will help Mae.  I butchered our four rabbits and then Mae went to Cindy Bennett
‘s and she gave us 8 more rabbits.  Out of the 12 rabbits we got 4 fryers.  The
rest we cooked and stripped the meat off the bones.  Tomorrow I will grind part
of the meat and freeze it for sandwich and some I will cut up for casserole
meat and freeze it.  I finished butchering the rabbits at 4:30PM, just in time
to clean up and go for the missionaries for dinner with us.  We cooked the
rabbits in the electric ovens and finished the last cooker at 11:45PM.  I have
still got to strip the meat from the bones and put it in the refrigerator to
cool.</p>

got up at 1AM.  This morning we ground and cut in chucks the rabbit.  We then
packaged and vacuumed the meat with the Seal-A-Meal.  We got 34 pints of meat
in the freezer when we finished.  We also packaged 4 more pints of strawberries
from our garden.  This evening we had Gail and the children over for dinner. 
Jeff is in Ohio this week and we had left over’s from dinner last night.  We

Clark’s Foot wear and purchased some sandals for me and some walking shoes for
Mae.  Mae and I walked over to the Church History Museum while Gail let her
children play in a water fountain.  We came back and enjoyed watching the
children play for a while longer.  We then went to Farr’s Ice Cream parlor
where we enjoyed a frozen yogurt.  We then got on the Tract’s and rode back to
the Central Station where we just made it on time to catch the Front Runner
back to Layton.  It has been and enjoyable day.  We watched a show on TV before

have a lot to do.  It seems that I never get done with the needs.  It was late
when we quit and ate dinner.  One good thing that I found had happened is that
the phone numbers in my cell phone are automatically backed up whenever you
make a change to your phone listing and so when I went to add a phone number to

made hot cakes for breakfast and the girls went out to play.  I worked on my
journals from 1970 to 1974 for a while.  There were many changes in our life
during those years but I guess that was only the start.  I cleaned up the back
yard of the weeds that I had cut down, old pieces of wood and some metal.  We
stopped first at the recycle in Clearfield and I got a little over $18.00 for
that, then to the dumps for the rest.  On the way back I stopped and bought
chicken feed.  Mae took the girls to the Clearfield swimming pool.  I refilled
the propane tanks that we used at the reunion and put them back in storage.  At
5PM David and Shauna came by to get Emily, so we got to visit with them for a
few minutes.  Scott and Mishelle came by to get Ashley.  The girls were sure
upset when she had to leave.  Our TV is acting up and I am afraid we are going
to need a new one.  I was tired so I started to get ready for bed but I fell
asleep in the rocker in our bedroom.  Mae figured that I must have slept for
about an hour.  Mae took Mattie and Jessie over to Scott and Mishelle’s so that
they can stay with Ashley another night.  Plans were changed as to dinner
tomorrow.  While Mae took the girls over to Scott’s, I took a shower.  When Mae
got back we watched a show on DVD before going to sleep.  Mae is very good to
me but her problem is that she tries to be a pleaser to everyone.</p>

meeting at 10AM.  The block meetings went well and we stayed for Choir practice
after.  We got some lunch and then started getting dinner ready for this
afternoon.  Mike and Becky stopped on their way home from taking Taylor Page up
to Utah State University where she will attend this year.  Mae had Scott and
his family came over for dinner as much as they needed to bring Mattie and
Jessie over so they could go home with Mike and Becky.  Bob went over to Lowe’s
and bought me some foam rubber tape so that the pickup bed cab would seal. 
Mike and Scott helped me put the cab on the pickup.  I thought that if everyone
left in time I could get things ready and Mae and I could go fishing in the
morning.  Irven, Sandy, Jennifer, Chris and their two children came before
Scott’s family left and it was after 9PM when everyone left.  I helped Mae
clean up the house and then I wrote in my journal.  Mae and I also visited for
a while.  Grant also called and I visited with him about our TV and some
options in getting a new TV.  It was almost 11PM before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning with Mae getting up about 8 and I didn’t get up until 9. 
Mae made waffles for breakfast.  I washed the car and polished it.  I then
vacuumed the car and truck.  After lunch I washed the pickup.  Mae came out and
helped me wash the windows.  She then wiped the inside of the car and the truck
with armorial.  After dinner we watched the show Felicia 2, although I saw it
the other night with Bob, while Mae had the girls here.  I am having a hard
time with depression lately.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 2AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so I finally got and after reading my
scriptures I indexed a batch of immigration records.  Mae got up at 5AM having
slept quite well.  I did lay down for a little while to get some more sleep. 
It was almost 9AM by the time we got on the lake.  The water is really down and
fishing was really slow.  I tried fishing deep but still didn’t get any
action.  We finally went back to trolling and Mae caught 2 fish.  It was after
2PM when we got home, very tired.  We did take a nap and then this evening the
High Priest leadership split with the Bishopric and went visiting.  Brother
Taylor and I visited with the Thurman’s and the Greenhow’s however only Weston
was home as Brother Greenhow is working out of town and Sister Greenhow had a
Wedding Reception to attend.  We stopped by Casey’s but they didn’t answer the
door.  Maybe they saw Brother Taylor and so did not answer, I don’t know.  It
was a good evening visiting and enjoyed Brother Taylor.   I am tired this
evening and ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep last night and was still up when I woke at 4AM.  She went to bed
at that time in the 2<sup>nd</sup> bedroom.  I also went back to bed and slept
until after 7AM.  When I got up I worked on Indexing.  I had several questions
regarding the batch that I opened so I called Support.  When I shared the batch
with support, she said </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'> “Wow, you
did get a dosey”.  I worked on the batch several times during the day and will
still have more to do.  Mae got up before I left for my appointment with the
School District.  I got my same route that I had last spring before school
ended.  This year that route is officially assigned to the Free Port Center. 
That was my big concern about bidding for that route.   I don’t know yet who
will be my assistant.  After getting home I went to Wal-Mart and ordered some
new eye glasses.  I had to go to Roy to a jewelry store there to get a new band
for my watch.  I made a repair to the irrigation pipe for our garden.  Mae made
homemade bread and Zucchini bread and does it smell and tasted good.  Mae also
called and ordered a new medical alert unit for Bob, as he lost the other one. 
This evening Bob and I went Home Teaching to Patriarch and Sister Johnston.  Mae
has the house all cleaned back up by the time we got back.</p>

woke about 2AM and slept the rest of the night in the rocking chair.  Mae woke
about 7:30.  After breakfast we went out and worked in the garden.  We picked
most of the pears and put them in the garage to finish ripening.    After lunch
Mae and I took a nap.  I did finish the Indexing batch that I had started.  Bob
has mowed the lawn so I guess I had better get out and trim the edges.  I am not
sure why bob wanted to mow the lawn so early in the day.  He had started to mow
it earlier while we were working in the garden.  I told him to wait until it
cooled down but he did it in the heat of the afternoon.  After mowing the lawn,
I cleaned the chicken coop.  We picked tomatoes for the dinner tomorrow
afternoon.  Before going to bed we watched a show from Netflex.</p>

breakfast I met Randy Higley and Morgan Thomas at the bowery on 800 North where
we installed eye bolts and hung canvas to give shade in the afternoon.  We also
picked up the 12 dozen ears of corn and chucked it so that it is ready to
cook.  When I came home Mae prepared lunch and we took a nap.  I got the camp
chef hooked up and started to heat the water for the corn.  It was soon time to
go back to the bowery and get the dinner ready.  The dinner went well and all
that attended seem to enjoy it.  I think we had 70 to 80 but fell short of the
150 earlier estimated.  We had lots of food left over.  It was late when we
finished and settled down for the night.  We watched a little TV before we went
to bed.</p>

back to sleep in the recliner.  I woke again at 5:30 and stayed up working on
my journals.  Mae prepared a nice breakfast when she got up.  Mae and I pit up
15 quarts of tomato sauce.  It took the morning to get it ready and then we
simmered it for 4 ½ hours before we bottled and sealed it.  It really turned
out good.  We watched a three of movies on TV while it cooked and it was late
when we got to bed.</p>

Mae and I slept well last night.  Meetings all went well today.  Sister Fallis
came up between Sacrament meeting and choir practice to let us know that she
had company and didn’t want us to come visiting today.  This could be our visit
this month.  Bob prepared very nice dinner after we returned home.  Mae and I
took a nap.  I gathered the eggs and again I am afraid that the one chicken is
hiding her eggs and the big problem is that the other chickens follow her and
then we can’t find them.  I am beginning to think that maybe I need to chop off
her head and make chicken stew.  I took some tomatoes, cucumbers and a bottle
of tomato sauce to the Johnston’s this evening.  Mae asked me to pull some
pictures off our computer to give to Bryce and Deanna.  Deanna wants them for a
book she is making for her family.  Mae has been writing a letter to David
(Elder Browning).  It getting late and I have to attend a meeting at Davis High
in the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept quite well last night but Mae didn’t get to sleep until after 4M.  I got
my own breakfast and then off to the bus drivers back to school orientation.  I
was at the back to school for almost 4 hours.  After the class I went over to
the Desert Mill and took a picture of the section of the grainer that I help
build and I stepped of the distance.  I wanted this information to enter into
my journal.  I was in hope of finding the year that that section was done, but
the Sister that was there did not know that information.   On the way home I
called Mae and she said that Bob and Pauline Hein would be at the Sub-Way about
noon to loan us the tapes on the “Miracle of America”, so as I was almost there
I went to wait for them.  When they didn’t come Mae called and said that I had
just as well come home.  I bought us a Sub-Way sandwich and went home.  I just
walked in the door and Bob called to tell Mae that they we almost there.  I
went right back and they were waiting for me.  They are going to the Brigham
City Temple open house and then to Bear Lake for a family reunion.  When I got
home some of the chickens were out.  They are crawling through some holes in
the fence so I repaired the fence.  I spent almost 2 hours trying to find out
why our internet is not working.  Mae and I picked some vegetables from the
garden and then it was time to get ready for the Porter Family reunion.  It was
good but a lot of the third generations are not coming, even with the free
Surf-&amp;-Swim pass for all the family.  Mae had the grand children wanting
her to join them for the swim.  By the time I cleaned up our vegetables and the
desert pan I didn’t feel like getting into the pool.  I set on a chair but
would have felt much better if I had stayed in the car and gone to sleep.  It
was almost 10PM when we got home.  I entered this entry and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
go up this morning in a depressed mood and several things seemed to add to it. 
It was a busy day; I sprayed part of the garden when the sprayer broke.  I
drove my new bus route and found some errors in it but did find all the pickup
stops.  I had to buy a new sprayer as replacement parts might work but cost only
a few dollars less than a complete new unit.  Bob and I got the lawns mowed. 
Mae cut my hair and we watched part of the Republican National Convention and
was very impressed with Mitt Romney and the support that he has backing him in
his run for the Presidency.  I was able to get my new eye glasses this
afternoon and they seem to fit well.  Before going to bed I again tried to get
the inter-net to work on my lap top but didn’t have success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 7AM.  I went out to the garden and sprayed part of the plants with a
fungicide.  We then ate breakfast and soon left for the Brigham City Temple. 
Bob and Cole followed us until we got to Wal-Mart in Brigham City.  Bob and
Cole then rode with us to the Temple parking lot.  The Temple is very beautiful
and we enjoyed the tour thru it.  Bob could not hear much of the film that
started the tour but seem to enjoy the rest of it.  Mae and I took Bob and Cole
back to their car and then Mae and I left for Logan.  It took us about ½ an hour
to get there.  We called Page to get directions to where she lived.  It took us
longer to get to her place than it did to get to Logan as Page didn’t know how
to give us directions.  We finally found her.  She had us come up to her
apartment and then we took her out to eat at Golden Corral.  We enjoyed being
with her and then I took her back to a class she had.  I went back to Golden
Corral where Mae had stayed because she and I were not finished with our meal. 
After eating we drove up to the Temple where we parked in the shade and took a
short nap.  We got to the 3:30PM session in the Temple.  We enjoyed that,
finishing about 5:30P.  When we left for home I suggested that we stop for a
frozen yogurt at a Maverick.  Well we got lost in South Logan trying to find a
way back to the main highway back to Brigham.  I was ready to turn on the GPS
to give us directions.  It was after 7PM when we got home.  I gathered the eggs
while Mae prepared us a bacon &amp; tomato sandwich for dinner.  We lessoned to
some of the Republican National Convention and I still wonder if it is a lot of
words without any real action.  I guess only time will tell.  I just don’t
think this nation is ready to repent.  It’s late so we had better get to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep well last night so I let her sleep in.  Kate and I took a test run
with our route this morning.  We drove both the In run and the Out run.  We
especially found problems with the Out run, so when we got back to the compound
I went in and visit with Sherrie about it.  She had me work with her on the
computer and first we found that one student had been left off our run.  We
then adjusted the route for the best route as I saw it.  It was after 2PM when
I returned home but I felt that time was worthwhile.  After eating and taking a
nap I started work on the door to our shed.  After eating dinner I called the
parents of each student to let them know that we would be picking up their
child for school on the 4<sup>th</sup> of September.  I couldn’t reach one home
and also had one parent tell me that they would be driving their child to and
from school.  Mae turned the TV onto the Republican Presidential National
Convention.  We were very impressed with the Romney / Ryan nomination team.  We
then watched the BYU vs Washington State football game.  We turned it off at
11PM with BYU carrying a substantial lead.  I entered my journal entry before
we went to bed.</p>

were late getting up and after breakfast we went out and worked in the garden. 
I tried to cal a couple of students that I have not been able to reach yet. 
Sherrie called from dispatch and added another student to our route.  I sanded
and repaired the door to our shed and got it painted.  This evening we went
over to Jeff and Gail’s.  Jeff and I discussed his ceiling on the patio.  I
thought Jeff had it all figured out as to what he wants but tonight it was
still undecided.  I really don’t want to tell him what he wants so it ended up
not making a decision tonight.  We played a game of rook which Mae and Gail
won.  It was late when we got home so we soon went to bed.</p>
