woke a little after 5AM and didn’t go back to sleep.  I started this entry and
tried to set my journal up for this New Year.  I did get frustrated working on
the computer.  Bob knocked just before 9AM and was ready to go to Priesthood
meeting.  He had forgotten that with the New Year our times changed to 11AM. 
Mae got up when I received a phone call from President Parks called me to let
me know that they would like to set me apart during our quorum meeting.  I told
him that would be just fine with me.  He also invited me to have my sweet wife
attend that meeting.  When Mae came into our quorum meeting Bob was a little
surprised but then when they announced that there would be some business taken
care of during the first of our meeting Bob commented that now he understood. 
I was set apart as 1<sup>st</sup> assistant to Brother Thomas and Brother
Charles Saunders was set apart as 2<sup>nd</sup> assistant.  I look forward to
work with these two Brothers.  Bob prepared dinner for the three of us after
meeting were over.  I came down and took a nap.  I had asked Mae to lonely let
me sleep for a few minutes but she didn’t wake me and I slept until 6PM.  This
evening I again spent some time setting up my journal and finally had to call
Scott for help.  With his help we got it set up.  Mae and I read the “The Life
and Ministry of George Albert Smith” from the Priesthood and Relief Society
study manual before going to bed.</p>

woke just after 5:30AM and read from the Book of Mormon.  I sure wish that my
children would make that a daily habit in their lives!  I made the bed and
helped Mae get some items gathered up for the washing.  After breakfast I set
up the tool in Bob’s garage and started working on Kylan’s science project.  I
helped Mae get the containers for the Christmas decorations so she can put them
away.  I worked on the project until lunch and then Kylan and Scott came over. 
We tried the fan out and we don’t think it is going to work.  They have another
airplane motor that might work so they will get the parts for it.  We worked
until it was cold and quit.  When I came in Mae and I played some Rummy and Mae
won.  We watched a show on TV while Mae put our pills together.  We then went
to bed.  I got a call from the sub-line asking me to take a bus route tomorrow
afternoon, I told them I would.</p>

going.  Time seem to go in a hurry so I was all morning getting the animals
cared for and then I had to go over to the Bus shop on a couple of maters. 
While there I got a bus run for Friday afternoon.  I was able to work for a few
minutes on the science project.  The afternoon run went well after I was able
to find a bus to use.  When I got home Roberta called and has a Field-Trip for
me to take Wednesday afternoon.  They are getting me busy but that is what I am
working for.  This evening we watched a movie on DVD, Alfred Hitchcock’s
“Shadow of Doubt”.  It was a good movie.  I sure love my sweet wife and she is
so good to me.</p>

got up at 4AM in order to take the Bountiful High Drill Team to UVU in Provo.  I
was at the Bountiful High school by 5:50AM and soon had the Drill Team loaded
with all their equipment.  I had hardly started for our destination when all 30
passengers were asleep.  The coach woke in time to help me find a frontage road
to get us around the Highway construction in the Provo area.  After letting the
team off at UVU I parked the bus.  I swept the bus and then took a nap.  After
waking I found a rest room and then went for a walk.  At 9AM the girls all came
to the bus and we started home.  Within minutes from leaving the parking lot
all the girls were again asleep including the coach.  That has got to be the
quietist field trip I have taken.  After unloading the group and starting back
to the bus shop Roberta called me on the radio and told me to park the bus on
top as the mechanics still had some work to do on the bus.  I had planned on washing
the bus upon my return but did as she asked.  I had to hurry home and get Mae
and then we went to the Park-N-Ride lot at the mouth of Weber canon where we
met David and Shauna and went to dinner at Maddock’s in Brigham City.  We did this
as a Birthday gift to David.  It was a very special time.  After taking Mae
home I went back to the shop to wash the bus but it was already back in use.  I
entered my field trips into the payroll and visited with Roberta as to the
assignment she asked me to do in trying to keep track of the maintenance and
service of the spare busses.  When I got home I took a nap and had beans for
dinner.  I attended a High Priest Group leadership meeting this evening.  After
returning home I caught my journal up to date.  I have a bus route to go on in
the morning so we need to get to bed.</p>

that I could take it this afternoon.  In between runs I checked out three buses
for Roberta.  Mae went up to Jeff’s at noon to tend the children while Jeff and
Gail went out for the afternoon.  On my afternoon run the horn on my bus
started beeping on its own.  I finally had to have a mechanic meet me at North
Davis Jr. High and adjust it.  That worked until I was almost finished with my
High School run and then it started again.  I left it for the shop to repair. 
I went up to Jeff and Gail’s and Mae and I stayed overnight.  That let us eat
dinner with them and play some games before we went to bed.  </p>

could get home to work on Kylan’s science project.  Scott and Kylan didn’t make
it over until almost 11AM.  We got up to snow this morning.  I cleaned up my
truck and Mae’s car before coming home.  I fed the animals and was going to
shovel the snow off the driveway but when I opened the garage door to go out,
Robert Taylor was just finishing the job.  He is sure special that way.  After
Scot and Kylan came we work all afternoon and until 9PM before quitting.  Bob
prepared cabbage casserole and invited us for lunch.  Kylan especially liked
the casserole and ate at least four dishes of it.  Mae didn’t attend Connor’s
game because of the snow.  She stayed and enjoyed playing games with Jeff and
Gail.  </p>

meetings start at 11AM for this year so we slept in.  I went to a High Pries
Group Leadership meeting at 10:45AM.  Meetings went very well today and I
enjoyed the Testimony’s that was given in Testimony Meeting today.  At 3PM
Brother Thomas and I went visiting to Cork and Susan Greenhow for a few
minutes.  Mae prepared a nice dinner and had invited Scott’s family to eat with
us.  She had a wonderful dinner and after Scott and I finished the science
project.  Michelle told Mae, after dinner, that Scott and Kylan had gone to one
of Kylan’s friends and saw his Science project.  His project consisted of
taking two steel rods and inserting them into a lemon.  You could then  test ,
with a low voltage meter, a small amount of electrical current.  When they
returned home and told Michelle about it she asked Scott if he was now sorry
that he had invested so much time and money in to Kylan’s project.  Scott replied,
“No!  It was worth it because he got to spend time with his father.”  That was
quite a complement to me.  It took most of the evening for us to finish the
project up.  We could not test the project as Kylan had not brought the power
supply, some drinking straws and the motor control with him.  I sure hope the
test will work like we expect.  It’s now late and Mae is ready for bed so I had
better join her.</p>

started on the garage getting all my tools loaded up and then sweeping up all
the sawdust.  I got a call from Roberta asking me to take a afternoon bus run. 
I had time to finish the garage clean up and have some lunch before going.  The
bus route went well and I was home about 4:45PM.  Bob prepared chicken dinner
for us and tomorrow I guess he is cooking steak for dinner.  This evening I
read the next lesson for Priesthood and relief Society while Mae prepared next
week’s pills.  We watched a show of Gun Smoke on TV before going to bed.</p>

got up early but Mae was sleeping in the extra bedroom.  I was up for a little
while but then laid back down.  I got up at 8AM and Mae soon woke also.  After
doing some of our exercisers we got breakfast.  I took care of the animals and
then went to the bus shop where I took a driving test.  I did well and the hardest
test was driving between two rows of five sets of markers.  Each marker had a
pivot arm with a rubber end on the arm.  The first set of markers gave the bus
16 inches of clearance and as the bus proceeded through, the distance decreased
until the end set there was only 2 inches clearance.  As the bus came out the
end of the rows there was just enough room to sharply turn the bus or run into
a chain link fence.  The first time through the course I touched three arms. 
Marsha Hamblin, my tester, said that was good but if I wanted to try again she
would take the best of the two tries.  I tried again and this time I made it
without touching a marker.  Overall I felt very good with the test.  When I got
home Mae had dinner about ready.  She had invited both Scott and Jeff for lunch
but Jeff called and said that he was just too swamped to take time off.  It is
nice to have the boys come and visit.  This afternoon Mae and I went to the
Temple.  At the desk they had a sign indicating that they needed help with
Sealing’s so we volunteered.  That didn’t take long so we went to the
Initiatory area and helped there.  Both were very enjoyable experience with a
lot of blessings to contemplate as to their meanings.  After getting home Mae
prepared dinner while I took care of the chickens.  There were two lights burned
out in the chicken coop that I replace.  Mae prepared a nice dinner and after
eating and cleaning up we both worked on our talks for this Sunday.  My talk
isn’t coming together very well at this time but it is getting late so I will
work more on it tomorrow.</p>

slept in until 6:30 before getting up.  I worked on laying out a form for
checking spare buses for Roberta.  I also checked for any field trips and bid
on the following weeks trips.  Mae went over for a treatment with Deanna.  Bob
prepared steak for lunch and that was sure good.  I went over to the bus shop
and checked out 4 buses.  The first one was really in need of attention.  It
was almost 1,000 miles over for a service, very dirty, two seats completely
loose and the alarm on the emergency door did not work.  I swept the bus and
emptied the trash, put some trash bags in the bus, got a new window cleaner
bottle with cleaner and fastened the seats back down.  I wrote the bus up for
service and to have the alarm repaired.  The other 3 buses were in pretty fair
shape.  I took a nap after getting home.  This evening Bob and I went Home
Teaching.  We had our normal quick and short visit with Brother Casey and then
at Patriarch Johnston’s we started to visit when Sister Johnston excused
herself and went into the bed room where their son was trying to hang their
curtains.  I finally ask if I could help and found that one hanger had pulled
out of the wall.  The screw was too large for the hanger, plus too long for the
depth of the sheetrock.  I found that there was a framing strap in back of the
sheetrock and the screw was not able to penetrate it.  I used a #16d nail and
punctured the strap.  Then with a smaller diameter and longer screw, I
reinstalled the hanger.  It only took a few minutes and we had the job done. 
She was very appreciated of my help and I was glad I could help.  After getting
home Mae gave me a haircut.  I worked on my talk for a while and now it is time
for bed.</p>

on my way home.  I got home after 4:30PM to find that Mae had dinner about
ready.  After dinner I changed clothes and then took a nap.  Mae and I went to
the University of Utah for P.A.’s White Coat ceremony.  This completes 6 months
of the program and tomorrow they will start the Friday Clinical Lab Program. 
This will go for another 18 months.  David is assigned to work at the West Side

I took a few minutes to show Kylan what to do and he did a pretty good job. 
Scott came home from work just before I quite.  We plan on hanging sheetrock

Thing”.  Mae came home about half way through the show but watched the ending
of it with me.  We went to bed about 10PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3:30AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so I finally got up.  I worked on
my computer trying to find the files in my IPOD as I am concerned about a
backup.  In the past couple of weeks I have noticed that it doesn’t turn off
and on very easily.  Mae woke a little after 6:40AM but didn’t come into the
front room until almost 7:30AM.  We laid down in bed for a little while and I
went back to sleep.  I didn’t wake until after 10AM so I had to hurry to get to
my appointment with Peterson Medical supply until almost 11AM.  I was able to
get a new face mask and other parts, plus they checked out my CPAP machine. 
Mae has been on the comuter or phone most of the day trying to get things going
for the Bushnell Family Reunion.  On the way home I stopped at Smiths and
bought a few items for Mae.  This afternoon I work on my 1970 thru 1974
journal.  I did take care of the animals and this afternoon I found that the
chickens have again started using a nest in the big shed.  We watched a show on
TV staring Frank Sinatra that was quite a suspenseful movie.  We soon went to
bed after it ended.</p>

woke at 6:30AM and Mae got up at 7AM.  I helped Mae with the vacuuming and
other items as she is trying to be ready when June and Sherman Mecham comes
today.  I then got on the computer and printed my awarded field trip sheets.  I
called and visited with Charles Hyer for a few minutes.  He said that he got tired
of the house so they flew down to St. George for a while.  He is healing quite
well and thinks very positive about everything.  He also informed us that
Brother Maharry is doing very well.  Brother Sherm and Sister June Mecham
arrived here about noon.  They are on their way to St. George for a few days as
the Idaho Falls Temple is closed for annual cleaning and renovation.  We
enjoyed dinner and a nice visit with them.  I got a call to drive a bus route
so I had to leave at 1:45PM.  They stayed a little longer and visited with Mae
before they went on.  They plan on stopping to see Mike and his family this
afternoon.  My route went well and I got home after 4PM.  I did get a little
more of my 1970 – 1974 journal entries typed up.  This evening Mae and I went
over to see the Science Fair displays at Creek Side Elementary school.  Scott
and Kylan were there also.  Michelle did not come because she is not feeling
well.  We were a little disappointed with rating Kylan received but was not
sure just how it was rated.  Without question, Kylan’s project had the most
work put into it.  After getting home Mae registered both she and I to attend a
Family History Consultant Training class on the 4<sup>th</sup> of February.  We
soon went to bed.</p>

woke at 1AM and went back to sleep in the recliner.  I again woke just before
5AM and just dosed on and off until after 6AM and thought to myself that I
wouldn’t get a call this morning.  They then called at 7AM to see if I could
take an AM route but then they changed because it left the compound at 7:10 and
they had a driver there that could make that.  Roberta called later and asked
me to take the route the rest of the month, starting with this afternoon.  The
route went well as I have an assistant to help.  This evening Mae went over to
help the Neiderhouser’s wedding reception.  Bob and I went over to it a little
later.  I came home and watched a show on TV.  Mae got home about 9:30PM.  We
watched the rest of the show and went to bed.</p>

had planned on working at Scott and Mishelle’s but when I called Scott he said
that Michelle was still sick.  I went after feed for the animals.  The rest of
the day I worked on my 1970 – 1974 diaries.  Mae has been trying to get things
ready for me while she is at Mike’s tending their children.  I really don’t
look forward to her being gone.  It has rained since last night and then about
noon it turned to snow.  This afternoon we picked up Jeff and Gail at 5:30 and
took them out to dinner at the Oak’s in Ogden canon.  This was for Jeff’s
Birthday.  It was nice and after eating we went to their place.  Jeff and I had
to shovel the snow out of their drive and walks before we left, after we
returned and then again before we left at 11:30.  We played card games with
them after returning from dinner.  There wasn’t very much snow at our place
when we got home.</p>

blower, which really helped.  We attended our meetings and when we got home Bob
had cabbage casserole for dinner.  Mae left for Mike’s at 3:15PM with the roads
looking ok.  She called me when she got there and said that the roads were ok. 
After gathering eggs this evening I took Bodily’s 4 ½ dozen eggs.  I tried to find
something on TV but there wasn’t anything that was even close to something
anyone should watch.  Even Bob came down and tried to find something but I
finally just turned it off and worked on my 1970 – 1974 journal entries.  I
quite at 8:40PM and played a game on the computer before going to bed.</p>

ran a bus route this morning.  After finishing the route I took the bus in for
a clip light to be repaired and also to have the rear heater repaired.  After
getting home I went out to feed the animals.  I found the buck dead in his cage
but could not see any reason for it.  This afternoon and after I had lunch I
started work on my journal.  I typed an entry about Linda Pool.  I got thinking
about it and wrote a small history about Linda and then prepared a letter to
Cheryl.  I spent most of the time on that and my journal.  I got over to the
bus in time that was on the route sheet but then found out that the regular
driver left at 2:15 instead of 3:37PM.  We also had to use another bus as the
shop didn’t get 47 repaired for me.  When we got back to the compound I went to
the supply office and got an extension cord to plug the bus into so the block
heater would work tonight.  I also got a broom and swept the bus as it was very
dirty.   I watched a couple of western shows on TV this evening.  Mae called me
this evening.  The TV sure has a lot of filth that is displayed openly. </p>

got there and we visited for ½ hour.  Darn, I sure miss her.  When I looked at
the rabbit it is a Miniature Rex Loop Ear which is too small for breeding for
meat.  I came home, getting gas on the way and then took care of the rabbits
and chickens.  I warmed up some stew and ate and then took a nap.  I worked on
journals while I had time before my afternoon run.  The afternoon run went
well.  I also got on the computer and bid on some Field trips for the 1<sup>st</sup>,
2<sup>nd</sup>,3<sup>rd  </sup>&amp; 4<sup>th</sup> of February.  When I got
home I again worked on my journals.  I got myself some dinner and watched a

and checked on Bob and he was still sleeping.  I think I heard him up during
the night.  He sure gets lonely and would like to find a companion.  I am not  sure
just how to help him at this point.   My afternoon run went well.  When I got
home at 4:30 pm, I found that Mae had already gotten home.  We were glad to be
together again.  This evening I went out with Brother Thomas and Brother
Saunders visiting to a couple of High Priests, Brother Larsen and also Brother
Thurman.  It was after 9:00 when I got home.  I broke my glass frames today so
I have to have Mae type this journal entry for me.  After getting home, we soon

and left just before I had to go for the afternoon bus run.  Mae had dinner
ready when I got home.  I showered and got ready to attend a planning meeting
for the Stake High Priest Social.  We had planned on Brother Gallegos coming
over to get some help with his Family History, but it didn’t work out for him. 
I attended the meeting and brother Hill of the High Council had everything well
planned.  He went over the plan and asked if we had any suggestions or
additions.  We all felt good so closed with prayer and went home.  we had time

examination and Doctor Bowman diagnosed my eyes as having posterior vitreous
detachment.  That is the reason I am seeing light flashes.  He said that it has
not progressed very far at this time but wants me to come back in six months. 
I was given a prescription for new glasses but when we talk to the girl about
them it will cost us between $500 to $700 dollars.  I told her we had to think
about it.  We went out to dinner at Sizzler’s with Scott and Michelle as a
Birthday gift to Scott.  It was a very enjoyable time.  Mae and I came home and
watched “A Star is Born” on DVD before going to bed at mid-night.  </p>

for an appointment with Deanna Davis for a treatment.  I made it on time and
she worked on me for at least an hour or more.  We visited for a little while
after the treatment about a play she had taken two of her grandchildren to in
order for them to give a report on it.  The only play that is on at this season
was at the playhouse in Washington Terrace.  Deanna said that the play got a
little raw so she told her grandchildren that it was up to them but she was
willing to walk out of the play.  Her Grandson said, “Well grandma, the play is
about half way over so I don’t think it will get any worse.”  After the play
finished and they were leaving he said to her, “Grandma, I said that it
wouldn’t get worse but it did.”  She said that the next day she called the director
of the play and told her how disappointed she was with the play.  I stopped to
visit with Nancy but she wasn’t in the store today.  I stopped at Good Earth
and bought a few things for Mae.  After getting home I took my eye glass
prescription down to Wall-Mart and got my glasses about $300.00 cheaper than I
could have got them at Mountain View Eye Clinic.  Mae and I attended Tyler’s
basketball game at Central Davis Jr. High’s courts.  His team lost but they
played well anyway.  David, Shauna and the children came to our place for
dinner.  Mae had made a very nice dinner.  After eating we played a game of
“Marbles” and at the very end Mae and I won.  I filled out this entry after
David and his family left.  Mae laid down and fell asleep.  I was on the computer

home.  I made several calls regarding Home Teaching visits for this month.  Bob
wants me to go with him to visit with Sherri and Eric.  Eric’s father died the
other day and they are having concerns as to what to do.  I told Bob that I
would go with him.  At the time Sherri is asleep so Bob will call when she is
up.  I worked on my journal entries for 1970 – 1974 again this evening.  I am
almost through February entries.  Mae was going to get us something for super
but Terry called so I got us some fruit and toast.  Bob said that Sherri called
him and after getting some sleep she felt much better.  They think that

and took a short nap before going back for the PM route.  I was finished and
home about 3:30PM.  I visited with Bob about a medical alert program and left
it up to him to decide.  I helped Mae get some pictures copied to a CD and
ready to send to Roy and Linda.  Sandi called and we set up an evening to get
together with her and Nick, plus Chelci, Steve and their children.  Mike called
just to tell us that he loved us.  Mae called Roy and Linda and visited for a
while.  They are doing some better, anyway they think they at least know what
Linda’s problem is.  It has been diagnosed liver disease that is incurable but
they don’t know how long she will live.  It sounds kind of fishy to me.  Mae

got talking to Scott about the Church and we just upset him.  I guess that he
feels that I yelled at him.  I didn’t think I did but I am not the best
communicator so maybe he took it that way.  I do not understand how he is
thinking.  My afternoon run went well.  The regular driver of the route called
in and requested that she not come back until Monday.  I called Roberta and
volunteered to continue driving the route this week and she could get someone
else to drive the field trips.  After dinner tonight I entered some of my
payroll and bid on some more field trips for next week.  Brother John Gallegos
came over this evening.  Mae was able to help him with his Family Search.  She
was able to show him how to add information and then he was able to find one
person that he now had enough information to take to the Temple.  Mae is
