<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 7:30AM and read my scriptures and worked on my journal, being as
quiet as possible so Mae could continue sleeping.  She woke at 8:50AM; at least
that is when she started to move.  I sure love that girl!  We enjoyed the day
with our family.  I have a hard time feeling comfortable around Roy and am not
sure how he feels.  Mae and Shellie went shopping and I wish that I had gone
with them.  Roy did help me get my computer and IPod connected to his internet
so that they will work.  They had been set up when we were down her last year
but I guess that when we had the virus problem the connection was erased.  I
started on some indexing but didn’t get very far.  When Mae and Shellie
returned we played some card games.  Garrett and Nora came over to use some of
Roy’s tools.  The Ward is having their Christmas social.  At first Mae and I
were going to stay home but at the last minute Mae wanted to go so we went.  It
was a nice event.  When we returned home, Roy and the boys watched “Lord of the
Ring”, Garrett worked on his project, Nora was busy with collage assignments
and Mae, Shellie and I played Rook.  Later Nora came and joined us.  She hadn’t
played Rook so we taught her the game.  She did pretty well for her first
time.  It was late when we went to bed.</p>

was almost 8AM when I got up and Mae was a little later.  We showered before
getting dressed.  I worked on my journal and did some indexing.  As it is Fast
Sunday today we didn’t have breakfast and it was almost 6PM before we ate
dinner.  We enjoyed the meetings.  Their Ward has Sacrament meeting first in
the block and I rather enjoy that sequence.  I felt like I would have liked to
bear my testimony but there wasn’t a break from the time the meeting was opened
up to the congregation and about half of those were youth.  Even the children
that came up were very appropriate.  This afternoon was relaxing and I did call
my Home Teachers to check of last month and the needs of any families.  Dinner
was very good with the main dish being a salad that was very good.  It had a
little of everything in it, from cut up tangerines to chunks of fried chicken. 
We ended the day with Shellie, Mae and I playing board games.  Jase did join in
one game for a few minutes.  Roy just does his own thing and seldom joins in
with the rest unless it is watching a movie.  </p>

and I slept in very late this morning.  We fixed our own breakfast about 11AM. 
I finished the batch of indexing this morning.  Mae, Shellie, Kevis and I went
shopping this afternoon.  I worked on my journals after we got home.  Mae
helped Shellie prepare dinner this afternoon as Garrett and Nora were also
coming over for dinner and Shellie has a Sister, that she is the Visiting
Teacher to, which she is to take dinner over to.  Along with that Jase came
home from school with news that he has a report due tomorrow, that he had
forgotten about.  That pour girl is sure going through hell right now.  She and
Roy are still having serious problems in their marriage.  At 10PM friends from
Washington came to stay overnight before they continue to Tucson.  It was 11:30
when Mae and I went to bed.  They were still up visiting when we came downstairs
to go to bed.  Mae and I discussed Roy and Shellie’s marriage problems before
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t sleep the best and woke early worrying about Shellie and Roy and
wondering what could be done.  I really feel that the only solution would be
for them to get some professional marriage counseling.  If that isn’t a
solution then for Shellie’s sake they need to separate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Shellie
got a text from a realtor that he would bring be bringing someone to the house
between 11AM and 1PM.  We hurried and got our room cleaned up and ready to
show.  Mae went up to help Shellie get some breakfast ready.  When I came
upstairs Shellie asked if I could take Kevis over to Target where Quint works
so that Kevis could get the keys from Quint and take the car to work.  As Kevis
and I went out to get Roy’s truck I asked Kevis if he know where Target was
located.  He didn’t so he went back into the house to ask Shellie.  We left and
Kevis gave me the wrong directions and we went to Wal-Mart where we went
yesterday.  When we got there, there was no Target!  Kevis then asked a lady
that was getting into her car, but I think that Kevis scared her as he was in
his black clothing and overcoat.  I could only see her face and watch her point
different directions.  When Kevis got back into the car he had no idea her she
was directing us.  We called Shellie and found that we had gone totally the
wrong place.  As we drove back Kevis called his mother and got his work place’s
phone number.  He then called there to tell them that he was going to be late
and they said that he wasn’t scheduled to be there until this afternoon.  After
I ate some breakfast we visited with Shellie’s company.  They are from Organ
and know Garrett when he served his mission there.  They have since came down
here and visited with Roy and Shellie and became friends with them.  They were
on the way to Tucson and so stopped in last night and stayed overnight.  After
I ate my breakfast their guest wanted to see their new property so we all went
over there.  After they left Shellie needed to take Kevis to get the other car
and as we needed to be out of the house when the realtor came by we did some
shopping at Target.  Mae, Shellie and I played some rook for a little while and
then Shellie had to get Jase from school.   We played a couple more hands on
our Rook game and then Mae and Shellie took Jase to karate class.  While they
were gone I took a nap and then wrote this entry.  When they returned we again
started our game.  When it ended I won mainly with two hands coming from the
bottom to over 500 points.  I called Lori Braithwaite and we set up a lunch
appointment  with them on Thursday.  I also called Bruce and visited with him a
few minutes.  They want to come to the Sacrament meeting when Quint gives his
farewell address.  Maybe we will get time to visit with them on Sunday. 
Shellie and Mae prepared a very nice dinner.  I expressed to Shellie my
feelings about the need for she and Roy to get professional counseling.  I hope
that I do not live to regret doing that.  Roy, Quint and Kevis watched another
movie in the serious of the Lord of the Ring.  I don’t feel very good at
watching that kind of fantasy.  It’s now after 10:30PM and I am going to go to
bed.</p>

woke about 6:30 and am having some problems with constipation.  I read three
chapters in the Book of John.  When Mae woke we laid in bed and necked.  I
really don’t understand women.  I went for a long walk and while doing so I
bought some batteries for the computer mouse.  It was after 11AM when I came
back.  I worked on my 1970 – 1974 journals.  We ate some lunch about 3:30PM. 
This evening we watched the movie “Dusty” on DVD.  It was a modern Western but
pretty good.  Mae and I played some cards and then before going to bed Shellie
played Rummy with us and won.</p>

I woke my back and neck were really tied up and hurt.  I help them some by
stretching.  After we ate breakfast Mae and Shellie went grocery shopping.  I
worked on my journals.  At lunch time I went upstairs and got talking to Quint
and Kevis.  Quint showed me many of his paintings that he has painted on the
computer.  He really has a talent and does excellent work.  After eating lunch,
Quint and I played a game of chess and I won.  Mae and Shellie got home about
that time.  They put the groceries away and then turned on the show “The
Scarlet Pimperdale” that Shellie has on DVD.  After winning the chess game I
went up and watched the end of that show.  After dinner Roy, Shellie, Mae and I
played Mormon Bridge.  After that Shellie, Mae and I played three handed Rook
before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
and I slept in as neither of us slept very well last night.  That was mainly my
fault but age takes its toile.  Mae made hot cakes for us this morning.  After
eating I had a head ache so took some Tylenol and laid back down for more
sleep.  Shortly after getting back up Mae came in and said that Shellie needed
help.  I went into her room and she was crying almost uncontrollably.  I just
held her for some time.  We talked and she said that she just had to breakdown
and cry.  She said that it was no different than it had been for 25 years.  Roy
seems to be very sexually demanding.  I tried to counsel her that she and Roy
needed professional counseling but if Roy would not go, she at least needs
help.  I believe that it was about a year ago that I tried to give her the same
advice and it sure backfired on me then.  I don’t know how else to help. 
Shellie is trying to be the perfect wife, mother, church leader and daughter of
God.  It’s too bad that she doesn’t have much help from her husband.  He seems
to feel that if he provides the material things of life, that is his share and
she should then be (his) perfect bed companion.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Shellie had
some more shopping to do so Mae went with her.  I worked on my 1970 – 1974
journal entries while they were gone.  This afternoon Mae, Shellie and I went
for a walk.  For evening dinner we just used up some of the left over’s from
the past week.  This evening Roy, Shellie, Mae and I played a game of Croquet. 
Roy ended up winning.  We then watched a show “The Red Tails”.  It was a very
good movie but the Sure Play took out several areas of profanity so that was
good.  It’s now 10:45PM and we are heading to bed.</p>

woke and read a couple of chapters in the book of Acts.  This is a good time
for me to read and my IPOD is handy for me to use.  I am feeling quite low
today.  Mae is such a sweetheart and tries to help me.  I don’t know what I
would do without her.  I feel so bad for Shellie and Roy and their situation. 
I just don’t know what or how to help them.  Carla sent me two copies of Rich’s
Life History so I got those downloaded and saved in my journal area.  I spend a
lot of time with my journals and wonder if in the eternal skim of things if
they will have any value?  Will that time be counted as a waist?  Anyway, the computer
sure helps me in this area!  I am working on my first Five Diary trying to get
it retyped and as I do, I am trying to recall the very short entry and expand
it with more detail.  I now appreciate President Kimball’s comment “A Five Year
Diary has very little value!”.  I guess the one value that that Diary did have
is it was a start for me to keep a daily journal.  Well it’s breakfast time so
I had better go upstairs for now.   Shellie made delicious omelets for us for
breakfast.  Mae &amp; I helped Shellie with some of the housework.  I vacuumed
while Mae did the dusting.  Mae &amp; I played darts and I won by one point –
365 to 364.  Mae went shopping with Shellie and I worked on my old diary,
converting it into a journal.  Mae &amp; I helped Shellie peel potatoes &amp;
yams and I mashed them for her when they were finished cooking.  While they
were cooking, Shellie, Mae &amp; I played a hand of Rook and Mae won.  We also
helped Shellie with supper tonight.  It was delicious.  We had bacon wrapped
steaks and salmon with baked potatoes &amp; yams, broccoli, tossed salad &amp;
Martinelli’s apple cider.  Garrett and Nora came over for dinner and are
staying the night so they can be here in the morning as Shellie &amp; family
are celebrating Christmas tomorrow so that they can have it with Quint, who
will be leaving for his mission on Tuesday.  After dinner Mae helped Shellie
wrap the rest of her presents and I worked on my diary again.  Before going to
bed, we talked with Garrett &amp; Nora and looked at some pictures they had
taken this morning of hot air balloons.</p>

before Quint leaves Tuesday morning for the M.T.C.  We enjoyed being here with
them.  Garrett and Nora were also here.  It was a very nice Christmas.  I was
given a tape measure from Jase, a tie from Kevis, pajamas from Roy and Shellie
and a puzzle from Garrett and Nora (Garrett had made the puzzles, one for both
Roy and myself.)  We then had a nice breakfast and I took a nap before getting
ready for Church.  Quint spoke in Sacrament meeting and did a very good job
with his talk.  We didn’t stay for the other meetings but came home and helped
Shellie prepare for company to come this evening.  Friends and family begin to
arrive about 4:30PM and it was 9:30PM before they all left.  Bruce, Mishiline
and Katie came over so we enjoyed visiting with them.  It has been a very good

It’s a job getting the bags packed and weighed so they are just less than 40lb
each.  Mae made us a nice breakfast of pancakes and eggs.  I got to visit for a
minute with Roy before he left for work, to mainly thank him for all they did
to make our visit enjoyable.  Shellie drove us to the airport at 11AM and we
again flew home on Alleiant Airline flying from the airport just a few miles
from Shellie and Roy’s home and into the Ogden Airport.  Bob met us at the
airport and brought us home.  Although we have had a good visit in Arizona, it
is nice to be back home again.  Shortly after getting home Bob had a nice
cabbage casserole ready for us to eat.  This evening Mae and I went grocery

drove my bus route this morning.  Kate said that the week went well except for
yesterday.  Her car wouldn’t start yesterday morning so she had to call in
asking for someone to take her place.  Somehow they got mixed up and the
morning run didn’t go well.  some of the mothers told me they was glad I was
back and told me of the mix up yesterday.  As I made my first turn around in a cull-de-sack,
Kate commented that I did is so easy where as each time the other driver had to
make that that turn around she had to backup several times and some of the
times Kate would have to get out and move objects.  Anyway it was nice to know
that I was missed.  I got home at 9:30AM and Mae and I soon left to get Quint. 
He flew in on Delta Flight 1243.  Mae drove to the airport so that I could take
a short nap on the way.  We were there and the pickup went very smooth.  We
took Quint out for dinner at the Golden Corral and sure enjoyed that.  Quint
was tired when we got home as he had only slept three hours last night.  We
therefore had him go into the guest bedroom and take a nap.  Mae and I also
took a nap in the recliner.  My PM run went well.  When I got home Mae had
dinner already for Quint and I.  She went to a special Relief Society Social
where they served a dinner and had a program.  After Quint and I finished
eating we then got out a Chess set and played a game.  We had just finished
when Mae came home.  Quint really had me going until he missed a move which
allowed me to take charge.  It was a very enjoyable game.  We read a chapter
from the Gospels and then a Christmas story.  I then finished this journal
entry, took a shower and went to bed.</p>

store as he needed some sheets, pillow case and a blanket.  We left shortly
after 11AM to take him to the M.T.C. in Provo.  We had just a few minutes
before letting him of so we went to the Temple and took a couple of pictures. 
We drove down to the M.T.C. and it was a steady line of cars.  They directed us
where to stop, help us unload his suitcases and we drove out.  We stopped and
bought some gas for the car so we could us the restrooms.  Mae drove back home
and I slept most of the way back.  Mae let me off at the bus shop then she came
on home.  After my PM run Mae came back and picked me up and we went an Open
House for Belva Provost, a very dear friend of ours.  He husband, Ralph passed
away in 2003.  Her son, Mark lives in Seattle Oregon, and her daughter, Robin
lives in Roy.  She is the one that hosted this Open House.  We met Rick and
Georgia there as well as some others we know from when we lived in Sunset.  We
were glad that he had made the effort to attend.  After getting home we had a

and replaced the lights that were out.  I still couldn’t get to the front
signal light so I quite for today and went back to work.  These cars are
engineered so that mainly the dealers are the only one that can work on them
and a lot of the parts have to be purchased through the dealers.  My PM run
went well.  Mae made dinner for Bob and Bruce but Bruce went somewhere else. 
Bob enjoyed the casserole anyway.  It was good.  Irven and Sandy called and
said that they would like to come over.  I decided that there was no since
starting a show and about that time Bob said that BYU was playing UT in
basketball, so I turned that on.  Bruce came down and apologized for missing dinner
but we certainly understood him spending time with his children and their
families.  Mae fixed him a plate of food and he set and watched the game with
me while he ate.  Irven and Sandy came over just at the end of the game so
Irven watched the game with us.  Although UT was a head most of the game, BYU
ended up winning at the end.  Bruce stayed a while after Irven and Sandy left
and visited with us.  It’s getting late so we will go to bed.</p>

she questioned if I had time as I had to leave in ½ hour.  I had her just cook
me some scrambled eggs while I hurried and showered.  She went back to bed and
I left.  It wasn’t until I checked out my bus and started to fill out my report

turned the bus off and waited 20 minutes.  My run went well although we only

little and then took a 15 minute nap.  I then worked on the car.  I was very
disgusted with the cheap way the car was built.  I was able to repair the turn
signals so they are working now.  Mae cooked chicken and noodles for lunch.  My
PM run went well and I got home about 3PM.  We soon got ready and drove to
American Fork.  Becky had dinner about ready when we got there.  Mike soon
came.  After eating, all of us soon went to the Jr. High school where Mattie
sand in the chorus as they put on their Christmas program.  They did very
well.  We went back to Mike and Becky’s where we were able to visit with Page. 
She had just got home from Logan.  She has done very well at Utah State where
she got a 4.0 for her first semester.  Shortly after leaving we saw a
neighborhood that was well lit with Christmas decorations so I turned around
and we drove through it.  Two houses mainly did the decoration but they went
all out.  It was worth stopping to see.  It rained on us all the way until the
Lagoon area when it turned to a light snow.  It was 10PM when we got home.  We
gave each other a haircut and took showers before going to bed.</p>

woke and determined to butcher all the chickens.  I got the water started
heating and then went in for breakfast.  Before going in I got a box out of the
shed and felt that I should check once more for a nest of eggs that we had
overlooked.  I found into the back of the shed on the left side there was a
nest of eggs.  I had to put everything back.  After breakfast I made some calls
concerning my upcoming operation.  I then remade a form for my pre-school
pickup and return children.  After eating lunch I printed a Christmas card
listing for Mae to check off those we received cards from.  We try to remember
those we have met but we don’t want to make anyone else feel obligated.  We
went out to Chelci and Steve’s where we had our entire Family gather for a
family Christmas party.  Everyone, except Shellie’s family; and David who still
has a little over a month left of his mission.  We had a great evening being

went into the front room so she wouldn’t wake me.  Meetings went well except I
did sleep through the youth speakers.  Mae went Visiting Teaching to Sister
Fallis but she is sick again so Bob and I will have to try another day.  Bob
prepared Sunday dinner for us.  He is good to do that for us.  We have tried to
get him to let us at least help pay for some of the meals but he won’t.  We
went over to Glen Higley’s and he installed a new battery into our computer. 
He only charged us $16.25 but I made the check for $25.  That is much cheaper than
if I had taken it into a computer shop.  After returning home we went upstairs
where Bob put on a movie he had recorded.  It was titled “Believe” and it was a
very good show.  When we came back downstairs, I filled out this entry.  Mae
got me some Christmas treat’s for my bus students, ready.  It’s getting late so

and then laid down and took a nap.  When I got up I again tried to contact the
hospital to arrange for the pre-medical schedule but again couldn’t reach
anyone.  About 11:30AM the hospital called me back and after asking me some
questions, said that they would call me back on Wednesday.  My PM run went well
and we were able to find the drop off for the new student.  Mae soon had dinner
ready after I got home.  We watched a Christmas movie on TV while we ate and
also while I made up some capsules.  We saw an ad for Dragon Dictation that
look pretty good.  I called Scott to see if he knows anything about the
program.  He suggested that we look up some reviews about it.  I did and it
doesn’t look to favorable.  Scott said that he would also do more research on
it and get back to me.  It’s getting late so we will go to bed.</p>

she stayed home.  I took two letters to be mailed to the post office and a box
of cherry chocolates with a note attached.  Mae had gone to the post office the
other day and had to stand in a long line with only one clerk.  She had
commented that they needed more help and it up set the clerk.  She sent this
gift to apologize.  I then went to the Tanner Clinic where they gave me a
monitor to wear tonight and then return to the clinic tomorrow.  This will
monitor my oxygen level through the night.  They can then determine if my C-PAC
is working ok or if they need to make some changes to it.  From there I
returned Kaitlyn’s coat to Mishelle.  I then went to Ream’s where I bought me
some Tonny Lama cowboy boots with the gift card the kids gave me for
Christmas.  I also stopped at Big Five and bought Mae a can opener.  Mae had
lunch ready when I returned.  My PM run went well.  This evening I went

gift certificate for $30 for the Ward Christmas tree giving and took it to
Sister Barker.  I returned to the house and took the groceries in along with a
Poinsettia for Mae.  I then took the sleep meter back to the Tanner Clinic. 
Mae prepared me some lunch when I got home.  Both Mae and I took a nap for
almost an hour.  Well! at least I slept but Mae only rested.  I got a call from
the hospital with some questions and instructions.  I am to be at the
admittance desk in the morning at 8:45AM.  I am not sure Mae will be up to
taking me in so I asked Bob if he could.  My PM run went well.  I gave each
child a small gift as they got off the bus and wished them a Merry Christmas. 
Two children were not with us today so I asked Kate if she would give the gift
to them.  I also gave Kate a Christmas card with a copy of the letter that I
wrote last night.  She also gave me a gift.  Mae is still fighting the bug and
I feel worse this evening.  I stayed home from visiting with Morgan and Charles

rested the rest of the day and watched the Poinsettia Bowl foot game between
BYU and San Diego.  BYU was trailed for the first 3 quarters.  The score was 6

Georgia and Rick also came over and joined with us.  We played games and had
pizza and finger foods.  At mid-night we all gathered and welcomed in the New
Year and took pictures.  It has really been a great evening.  I don’t know of a
time that we have had any better time being together as a family.</p>
