<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night and ended up sleeping most of the night in
the recliner.  When I got up I tried not to wake her.  After showering and
getting dressed Mae woke.  I tried to get her to go back to bed but she
insisted on getting me some breakfast.  My route went well and after completing
it I went in and visited with Janet Nance about two days that I drove bus that
was not put on the payroll.  When I got home Mae had gone shopping.  As soon as
I walked in Bob knocked.  There is many concerns about the funeral arrangements
for Eric’s Fathers funeral.  Bob got a hold of Sherri and had her call me.  I
will see what I can do to help.  I took care of the animals and then came in
and then made some phone calls.  I had Sherrie have Eric’s Uncle call me.  He
did while I was o my bus run but we were at a stop where I could talk to him. 
I found out that everything was under control and ready for Eric’s father’s
funeral.  Sherrie had miss-understood several things.  The afternoon run went
well and I was home about 4:30PM.  Mae and I had planned on going to the Temple
but I felt that I should go down to Sherri’s and explain some things to them. 
We tried a couple of times to call them but they didn’t return the calls.  I
worked on my journals most of the evening and Mae worked on the other computer. 
Later I went upstairs and visited with Bob.  I told him that I had tried to
call Sherrie but that she did not return my call.  He called and she answered
right off.  He tried to explain some of the things that I wanted to explain to
her but he didn’t understand what I tried to tell him or he just didn’t
understand what I meant.  Anyway I felt bad that I couldn’t get my feelings
across to her.  I am afraid that I very often come across to other in a wrong
way.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
morning run went well.  Some of these handicap children really humble you.  We
pickup one little boy, his mother always brings him out to the bus.  She is
tall, dark hair fairly good looking, very pleasant and always has a smile. 
This morning when they came out the little boy was fighting her.  He didn’t
want to come.  He didn’t seem to want to leave his dog and I don’t think the
dog wanted to leave him for as they came out the dog came also and the mother
had to chase him back while trying to get her son out.  She literally had to
pick the boy up in both arms and carry him kicking to the bus.  As she greeted
us at the bus she said through an almost forced smile, “it has been one of
those mornings”.  She was smiling and waved as I pulled the bus away.  For the
next mile I really had to work to keep control of my empathy for this young
mother.  Even as I type this the tears are flowing.  Bob prepared fish and
fried potatoes for lunch and it was very good.  I took a short nap before my
afternoon run.  After getting home Mae told me some of the conversation she had
with Michelle.  I have been very depressed the rest of the night.  Mae and I
attended a session at the Bountiful Temple.  I was on the verge of tears
through most of the session.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
again took the bus run.  After returning home I fed the chickens and rabbits
and then took a short nap.  Mae and I went over to the funeral of Erric’s
father, Larin J. Peterson.  I felt sad that none of Sherrie’s siblings were
there to support them.  I had to leave early as I had the afternoon run to
take.  Mae stayed.  I completed the run and when I got home I entered my
payroll time and bid on upcoming field trips.  Mae and I went to the T-Mobil
phone store trying to get her a phone.  She has tried ordering one through the
phone but that hasn’t worked.  At the store they told us that we would have to
wait until the phone order expired and then come back.  I have questions that
the order over the phone might have been too good of a deal and so the
reprehensive let it fall through.  I guess we will just have to wait and see. 
We then went to Wall Mark and I got my new eye glasses.  I then took Mae out to
dinner at Golden Corral.  After dinner we went over to Scott’s and visited with
Scott and the children as Michelle had gone with her mother and sisters.  I went
to bed very tired and somewhat depressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke early to attend a Family History convention in Salt Lake.  Mae read from
the Ensign as I drove and I became very depressed.  I almost became sick before
we got there.  My depression is coming from my three boys and I do not know
what to do about it.  We did attend the program and it was amazing but I felt
so over whelmed and personally very inadequate for my calling.  When we got
home we laid down to take a nap.  We had only got to sleep when Bob knocked to
see if we were home.  I couldn’t go to sleep after that.  We took dinner up to
Jeff and Gail’s this evening.  After eating I took a nap.  Mae played with the
grandchildren.  After the children were put to sleep Mae, Gail, Jeff and I
played games.  We finished with a game of Rook at which Jeff and I won.  It was
late when we got home.</p>

were able to sleep in and sure enjoyed that.  In our group leadership meeting
this morning Brother Thomas told me that I was to give the lesson.  I had a
feeling that I was going to do that when I left home, so I brought both
Ensign’s with me.  I had a few minutes to go back through the lesson as we had
already read the article.  I asked for help in a short prayer and I seem to
have done ok with some appreciations expressed after.  Following Sacrament
meeting Mae and I got interviews for new Temple Recommends.  Bob soon had
dinner ready when we got home.  After dinner Mae and I laid down for a nap.  We
hadn’t slept long when Bob came down with some questions about Family
Research.  Trying to get on Family Search to help Bob plus other phone calls
soon took the rest of the day.  I got a call to take a bus run in the morning
and so had to get to bed.  Mae stayed up talking to Georgia on the phone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up early and was to the bus shop in Farmington early.  I went to the first
pickup getting there early but when I approached the stop right on time, a boy
asked me if this was the bus for Wood Cross High.  I said that it was so he got
on.  There was no other students at the stop and yet the rout sheet indicated
that there should be 18.  I asked the student where they were and he said that
that was not a normal stop.  I asked where the next one was and he showed me
where to turn.  When I asked him where from there he didn’t know.  I called the
dispatch and by then I was lost.  Even with dispatch’s help I was still lost
and when I got to the third stop there was only 3 students.  When I got to the
high school Dispatch said that they had another bus get my Jr. High students,
so for me to get ready to get my grade school.  I replied that according to my
route sheets I didn’t have a grade school route.  They faxed me a route sheet
to the office of Wood Cross.  With that route sheet I was able to complete that
pickup with out to much trouble.  After returning the bus to the compound I
drove to the Clearfield compound and went into dispatch to discuss the route
sheets.  We found out that the sheets were very wrong, plus I visited with
Roberta and got ather routes to take for the rest of the week that does not conflict
with my field trips.  It was 10:30 when I left to go home.  I took a nap and
then we had lunch.  I took a special ed. Run this afternoon and it went well. 
I stopped in the office, when I finished the route and Rose call to me and
asked if I would take a run tomorrow, which I agreed to do.  Mae had pizza for
dinner this evening.  I had Bob come down and I showed him that his Family
History was in order for his children to continue with any research they would
like to do.  Mae went up to Jeff and Gail’s to tend their children this
evening.  Bob and I visited for a while about Dad Browning and some of his
stories.  I worked on my journal until after 9PM and so was late getting to
bed.  I woke at 11PM realizing that Mae was not in bed.  I got up to check on
her and found that she had just returned and was ready to come to bed.  </p>

woke again at 3AM but tried to go back to sleep.  After a while I got up and
did some studding.  I ate breakfast and left for the bus trip.  My runs went
well and I made all the schedules on time.  When I got back to the shop the
temperatures had risen above 32 degrees and the bus wash was open for use.  I
took the bus through it as it needed it quite badly.  It was after 10 AM when I
got home and Mae had already left to take Shirley Olsen to a doctor’s
appointment.  I got something to eat and then took a long nap.  Mae got home
just before noon.  We had lunch together and had just finished when Gail
brought the children for Mae to tend while she went to the Temple.  I blow up
balloons for the children to play with.  I got this entry started before I left
for the afternoon runs.  My run went well.  This evening Bob and I went Home
Teaching to Casey’s and Johnston’s.  With the Casey’s, as normal we were only a
few minutes.  When we went to the Johnston’s we were there almost 2 hours. 
Some of that time was checking Sister Johnston’s printer and found that it was
completely out of ink.  I told her that if they could buy some new cartridges I
would install them for her.  We soon went to bed after I got home.  </p>

afternoon route.  Mae and I watched “Little House On The Prairie” on TV while
we ate our dinner.  At 7PM we went to the Stake House to get our Temple
Recommends signed.  Brother Thomas and went visiting Brother Therman and
Brother Martin.  When I got home I filled out this entry.  It was after 9PM and

hurried home and got cleaned up.  We met Georgia and Rick at the Sizzler for
dinner.  We enjoyed visiting while we ate.  After dinner we went to Georgia and
Rick’s Stake Center and attended a Sweetheart’s dance.  Normally they have the
Davis High School dance band but tonight they had a Disk Jockey.  We were very
disappointed but stayed anyway.  We did have several complement us on our

information and applied for a bus route on my computer.  Mae made us some lunch
before I left for the afternoon run.  That run went well.  On the way home I
went to Wal-Mark and took my glasses in to get them repaired from the
scratches.  I also had them change them to tri-focal.  The way they are now I

This evening Mae and I lessened to a CD training course on finances.  We seem

the closing prayer, said just before he gave the prayer, that when you stopped
to see her for a minute that they called it “the Vica grip” for she loved to
keep you and visit.  It was a very special and appropriate funeral.  I got a
nap in and then took a field trip.  That went very well and I got home about

Chelci  and Steve plus the children came out for dinner and the evening.  Mae
had cooked a very nice chicken dinner.  I grilled part of the chicken.  After
dinner we played games.  It was a very enjoyable evening and they left for home
about 8PM.  Mae gave me a haircut before we went to bed.  We watched the DVD
movie of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers” and both Mae and I Fell asleep during
the movie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 5AM but went back to sleep in the recliner for a couple of hours.  When
I realized that it had snowed during the night I hurried and dressed and went
to the church.  It was already cleaned so I came home and took care of the
animals.  Mae made waffles for breakfast and they were sure good.  We attended
our meetings as normal.  Mae went Visiting Teaching to Sister Fallis.  When she
got home we had dinner and then Bob and I went Home Teaching to Sister Fallis. 
It took us longer and we missed our Home teacher Brother Wayne Thompson.   He
did visit with Mae for a few minutes before we returned home.  Mae tried to get
a hold of Roy and Linda but there was no answer.  I called and visited with
Lois.  Rich had been in the hospital but is doing fine now.  We went over to
Jeff and Gail’s for Rachael’s Birthday.  It was actually last week but because
she was sick they waited until today.  Gail’s mother and Gail’s brother and his
family were also there.  We did play a game of Scum and then when the children
went to bed and the rest left, Mae, Gail, Jeff and I played a game of Hearts. 
When it got 11PM we called it quits and came home.  It was after 11PM when we
got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were late getting up. After breakfast I fed the animals.  Another one of the
new rabbits was dead this morning.  I am afraid that the new buck is not going
to work.  He might be too old.  Mae is going to tend children for Jeff and Gail
while they go out for their wedding anniversary.  I went over to Scott’s where
I worked on their basement for about five hours.  I was tired so came home.  I
again took care of the animals and then got me something to eat.  I watched a
couple of shows on TV but there wasn’t much there.  I entered this entry and as
I typed this Mae came home at 8:15PM.  I have a bus run in the morning at
6:07AM so we had better get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up early for a bus route.  I let Mae sleep in longer.  The run went ok but
I was concerned as I couldn’t get the bus to start.  It took several tries
before it finally started.  When we finished the run I went into the shop and
visited with Curt about the bus.  He said that he would check it out.  I got
gas for the pickup before coming home.  When I went out to take care of the
animals I tried the buck and found out that he is a she.  That makes a lot of
difference.  We had some brunch and then I took a nap before my afternoon run. 
Kim was in the area so he stopped in for a few minutes.  We enjoyed visiting
with him and hearing about his family.  He and Jeanenne are starting plans for
a mission call.  My bus started right up this time.  On the way home I realized
that the right turn light was not working.  When I got home I changed the bulb
and it now works fine.  I took care of the animals, ate dinner and took a nap
before going Home Teaching.  It is now 8:35PM so we had better get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Today
was one long day of driving buses.  It started with my Special Ed. Run and then
I took a Field Trip of 5<sup>th</sup> Graders to Utah Symphony in Salt Lake. 
After returning them to Lincoln Elementary I came back to the bus compound and
took the afternoon run.  I was tired when I got home.  Mae had taken care of
the animals for me today.  I took a short nap and then Brother Charles Saunders
and I went visiting.  It’s now 9 o’clock and I am tired, good night!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
took the bus run this morning but let Mae sleep in.  It went well and I got
home this morning about 930AM.  I was tired so after feeding the animals and
eating some brunch I took a nap.  Mae woke me to go to Wal-Mart’s to get my new
eye glasses.  Mae then took Bob to get a dog dryer that Patty saw advertized. 
I tried to apply for some bus runs that are open for bid, but I couldn’t find
the papers that I needed until it was too late to spend more time on it.  I
took the PM route and that went well.  Mae took Sister Reed and her daughter
Laurel to Salt Lake to see a Doctor.  She returned home just before I got
home.  After dinner I applied for the bus routes.  I then entered some payroll
information and this journal entry.  We watched a J.A.G. series this evening
and just after it finished Mae got a call from the Family History Help so she
spent some time on that call.  I just went to bed as I will get up early for
the Bus route.  </p>

morning run went well.  I did have a car the pulled out in front of me but I
saw him coming and was able to brake and warn him with the horn so that nothing
happened except caused a hart race.  When I got home I fed the animals and ate
breakfast with Mae.  Mae then went shopping with Michelle.  I entered more of
my 1970 thru 1974 diary entries to my computer before going on the afternoon
run.  Because of Fridays early out for the Grade Schools and also because
Syracuse girls basket ball team are playing in a State Tournament, so Syracuse
High let school out early our afternoon run went pretty fast.  After getting
home I was able to work more on my journals and take care of the animals before
we left to go out to eat.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
and Michelle went to a baby shower for Michelle Porter, Kaleb’s wife.  Scott is
having car problems and wanted a jack and safety stands.  I decided that I
should go over and give him a hand.  I went back to where we bought the last
rabbit and checked their rabbits and they do not have a buck that is old enough
to use for breading yet.  When I went to Scott’s I checked the vehicle and
found that the battery was dead.  I suggested that we get the battery checked
first and found that it was gone.  We bought a new battery and the vehicle
worked great.  I am sure glad that we hadn’t removed the starter motor first. 
When I got home I watched a movie on TV and made more almond butter.  Mae got
clothes and equipment packed to go to Soda Springs tomorrow night.  This
evening we went to the Stake Family Dance and was very disappointed in the
music.  We stayed a few minutes and left.  We went to Jeff and Gail’s home and
played games with them.</p>

Sandi, Nick, Mae and I drove to Soda Springs where we stayed at the Trail

to see Sherrie and her children again.  Sid was away for the week with his
work.  They are still hanging on with the lodge and now three children.</p>

got up for breakfast at 8:30AM which Sherrie had prepared for us.  We played
some games and then went snowmobiling.  We were out for about 3 ½ hours and
really had an enjoyable time.  We came back to the lodge for lunch and then
played some more games.  We left for home about 5:30PM.  We stopped in
Tremonton where I bought a buck that I found advertized on ksl.com.  After bring
us home Sandi and Nick went on home.  It has been a very enjoyable weekend and
a special Birthday for me.  David and Irven called to wish me a Happy
Birthday.  We had a light super and I caught my journal up to date before we
went to bed.</p>

slept in until 8AM and then got up and started breakfast.  Mae was still busy
with Scripture study and her exercises.  I took care of the animals.  I bred
the #2 doe with the new buck.  I prepared computer records on the rabbits.  I
spent quite a bit of time looking and calling on pickup campers.  I found one
in Lindon that looked very good but I need some way to get it here as my pickup
still has the natural gas tank in it.  I called all my boys and they all have
short bed and ½ ton trucks.  I checked with Mike about having it put in his
driveway for a couple of days and he is ok with that.  Mae and I drove down and
met Anton Bercich and looked at the camper.  We were very impressed with is and
so paid him $3,750.00.  He will take it to Mike’s tomorrow.  It is now 10PM so
we had better get to bed as I have a field trip in the morning.</p>

and then entered my payroll information.  I entered this journal entry and we
