<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up shortly after 5AM before the alarm went off.  I got my breakfast, fed
the chickens and went to work.  My AM run went well and when I returned home I
fed the rabbits and turned water on the garden.  I had to hurry to get to
Creeksides Elementary to attend the Sixth Grade Graduation.  Kylan was
graduating and no one was there to support him so I attended it for him.  I
couldn’t help think that no one attended those things with me.  I took him home
and ate some lunch with Mae and the children.  I had to hurry in order to get
back for my PM run.  That also went well and we finished up for the year.  I
came home and took a nap for an hour.  After getting myself something to eat I was
going to work on Extracting but Bob came down and visited for a while.  I start
this entry and then took care of the animals.  When I came back in I did bring
up a batch and worked on it until after Mae and the children came home.  We
popped some pop corn and turned on a movie on the TV.  Putting the twins to bed
was a different matter.  I hope for the best.  It was after 10PM when we went
to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were busy getting breakfast and everything else ready to go to Park City.  We
went by way of Morgan so we could remove the artificial flowers form the graves
as they will clean the cemetery of all flowers at 6AM on Monday.  It was after
2PM before we got to Park City.  We did enjoy the hot tub and swimming in the
pool.  We all went down town and enjoyed walking around town, especially
walking to the Shoe Tree Park.  We rode the Free Trolley and then went back to
the hotel.  Time went by fast and it was late when we went to bed.  It has been
a good day to be with Scott and his family.  </p>

got up at 7:30 this morning but should have been up earlier than that.  We were
busy getting things cleaned up and packed so we (Mae and I) could leave in time
to get home to church.  I didn’t get to the High Priest Leadership meeting. 
Meeting went well, Bob prepared dinner for us.  After dinner I had to make a
couple of phone calls to check on the Home Teaching for last month and then to
make a report to Brother Thomas.  We took a short nap before Scott and his
family came over to get their items that we had brought down for them.  Sandi
came about 6:30PM to get Paris.  While she we still here Jeff brought my pickup
and tools back and got his car.  After Sandi left we went up to Jeff and Gail’s
and played a game of Rook with them.  Jeff and I won tonight.  It was after
10PM before we left for home.  I had to catch up on a couple of days on my
journal before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 5:30AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I started typing up my
experience at the Deseret Mills in Kaysville.   Mae got up later and prepared
breakfast.  I started on several projects that I wanted to get done.  I went in
for breakfast and we got a call from Shaun Shuman.  He is the one Mae has been
in contact with to cater the Saturday evening meal at the Bushnell reunion. 
His boss is requiring him to be out of town that week so he will not be able to
cater the meal.  That was quite a bomb shell.  We have spent quite a bit of
time trying to figure out what to do.  I did get the boat ready to go tomorrow
but then this evening we lessoned to the weather report and they are predicting
high winds and thunder storms.  After talking to David we decided to change
fishing to Thursday.  Mae took Sister Reed and her daughter to Murray to the
Doctor so Laura could get a treatment.  This evening we relaxed and watched a
movie on DVD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night so I let her sleep in but she woke about 8:30
anyway.  I took care of the animals while Mae prepared breakfast.  After eating
I built a chicken feeder that I hope will work better for the chickens.  We had
lunch and then we did more planning on the Bushnell Reunion.  It looks like we
will have to do our meals.  Caterers from here want millage and that would cost
over $600.00 plus the meal.  We figure that we can beat that but it will be a
lot more work.  Brody stopped in to see Bob so we went up and visited with him
for a little while.  He sure looks good and he says that he feels good also.  I
made almond butter this evening.  We had planned to go fishing with David’s
children this morning but because of the weather reports we backed out.  We
were glad that we did because the winds pick up and by noon we had rain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well so we were late getting up.  After breakfast I started
to go to the church onion patch to do some weeding but I had a flat tire.  I
was a couple of hours getting that fixed.  We decided to get the tent trailer
cleaned up so I set it up.  I found out that a brace had bent and so the back
side of the roof would not rise all the way.  I worked on that until almost
5PM.  We then went to the Niederhauser’s where we ate dinner with them.  Mae
had wanted to take dinner into them after Joanne’s operation so we took it over
tonight but they wouldn’t let her bring it unless we would eat with them.  We
enjoyed it and were there a couple of hours.  I got the truck and boat ready to
go in the morning.  I got a phone call from Linda to let us know that Roy had a
milled heart attack this morning and has been taken to the Veteran’s hospital
in San Francisco.  She will call again when she finds out more but there wasn’t
a lot of concerns right now.  I let Bob and Irven know and asked Sandy to let
Rich know.  It’s about bed time if we are leaving early in the morning.  Mae
talked to Nancy this evening about the problem with her legs hurting at night
and keeping her awake.  Nancy feels that Mae needs to stay completely off of
sugars.  That really discouraged Mae.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 4:30AM but Mae hadn’t slept very well so I let her sleep a little
longer.  We had planned on getting away by 6 but was a little latter.  We
called before we left to see if David wanted us to drive both the car and truck
or if just transfer the boat to his pickup and take it.  He chose the second
option.  The kids were about ready when we got there and so we left their place
at a pretty good time.  We got on the lake about 8AM and was soon fishing. 
Tyler hooked the first fish but as he started reeling in Emily hooked a fish so
it was a race to see which would get their fish in the boat first.  Emily won
so she got credit of catching the first fish.  Both took it as fun.  We all
caught fish, with Emily catching the first limit.  We caught all twelve fish
with losing a few but all had fun.  After getting the boat loaded on the
trailer, Mae and Emily wiped the boat down and Tyler and I cleaned and filet
the fish.  We had several admire our catch.  On the way home we stopped and
visited with Jeanenne for a few minutes and gave then some fish.  We had
stopped to take her a copy of the book Mae did on Glendon Porter.  Calib,
Mishelle and their baby were there when we got there so we enjoyed visiting
them.  Kolessee was also there.  After taking the children home and switching
trucks Mae and I came on home.  We were both very tired so after getting things
put away we took a nap.  Bob found s sealer to put on the chicken feeder that I
built.  I had thought of buying a sealer that is advertized on TV but they
wanted $19.99 for two cans plus $19.00 for shipping and handling where this can
of sealer only cost $3.00 a can which Bob found at Big Lot in Layton.  A much
better deal!  Mae and I worked in the garden and cleaned out more things from
the camp trailer.  After coming into the house I worked on Indexing and my
journal.  Mae wrote to JaNae, trying to get the problem between Sandi and JaNae
worked out.  It’s now 11PM so we had better get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning I woke early with a dream that was unlike any dream that I have ever
had.  Weather it has any meaning or not I do not know and I do not know if I
can remember or if I should write I do not know.  I dreamt that I had attended
the Temple and after going through the normal Temple Session I was taken
further; what it meant I don’t know but I woke with the most wonderful
feelings.   I cannot explain and maybe this is enough at this time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>I went back
to be and slept until 5:30AM when I got up to go into an In-service training
with the School Bus Department.  Mae hadn’t slept very well so I let her sleep
a little longer.  I was really disappointed with the overall program today and
if rated on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give a 2 or 3.  They did let us out
early so that helped.  Mae tended Jeff and Gail’s children today so that Gail
could take a training class today.  Mae was tired when I got home.  We did go
up to Jeff and Gail’s and played games with them.  It is almost sure that Jeff
is excepting the offer to go to <br>
Redding California.  We are sure hoping it is for the best.  We got home about
10:30PM and as soon as I entered this entry we went to bed.</p>

woke quite discouraged as I thought about a three of items that was presented
yesterday in the seminar; the CHAGS disease and the great increase in Drug and
Alcohol Abuse and the great increase in computer control.  I am glad that I am
getting older but am very concerned for my children and grandchildren.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in but were awakened by Bob vacuuming his floor at 7AM.  We got up and
got start for the day.  Mae prepared waffles and eggs for breakfast.  Mae
finished cleaning the tent trailer and I got the cable brace repaired on it.  I
finished the chicken feeder and added feed to it to see how the chickens will
react to it.  I called Brother Dane Searle and he came over to see what he
thought is the trouble with our lawn.  He thinks we are not getting enough
water to it.  He had us move the water cycle up to 45 minutes every day for a
week and he will come back and check it again next Saturday.  This afternoon we
met at Scott’s home with Jeff and Gail and the five of us, Jeff, Gail, Scott,
Mae and I rode together to Mike and Becky’s home, for Taylor’s graduation
celebration.  Sandi and Chelci also came.  Several from Becky’s family and some
friends also came.  Becky had prepared a very nice lunching.  We enjoyed
visiting and taking pictures.  It was after 10PM when we got home.  I gathered
the eggs and we soon got ready for bed.</p>

slept in this morning and it sure felt good.  I sure enjoy being with my
sweetheart.  We decided that since we had forgotten to fast last week we would
fast today.  After getting ready for meetings I took care of the animals.  The
chickens seem to be adapting to the new feeder although I may need to close the
throat a little.  I attended High Priest Leadership meeting to start the day. 
Time seems to go so fast as I try to get everything accomplished that is on my
addenda.  I slept throw quite a bit of the talks during Sacrament meeting.  The
building was extra cooled today and Mae had to go home to get warm during
Sunday school class.  When she returned for Sacrament meeting she brought me my
suit coat and she had put on a sweater that helped her.  Bob soon had dinner
ready when we got home.  after cleaning up the kitchen Mae and I took a nap. 
Mae and I then went to Ogden and visited with Sister Southard.  She will soon
be coming home but the staff is concerned as to how she will manage without
anyone there to help her.  We also feel the same concerns.  After getting home
I worked on journal entries before we went to bed.</p>

morning Mae started the washing and house cleaning.  I took care of the
animals, adjusted the feeder and mixed grains for the chicken.  We then worked
in the garden.  I started working on the pickup and then decided to check to
see what it would cost to have the air-lifts installed for me.  Dee said that
he would rather not, so I checked for other places.  The one custom truck shop
was closed, Firestone wouldn’t do it, Charlie’s estimated the time would cost
around $150.00 and the RV shop wanted $468.00 just to install them.  I came
home and restarted installing them myself.  I got the first one mounted before
I quite for the day.  Mae has also been busy all day so we quit and had dinner
at 8PM.  We watched a show on TV but never did get the plot.  Shellie and Jase
got here at 9:30PM.  I went to bed shortly after 10PM.</p>

it was mid-night when Mae and Shellie came to bed.  After breakfast Shellie,
Jase and Mae went to Lagoon.  They met Sandi and JaNae’s children there.  I
finished installing the Air-Ride’s on my pickup.  The water didn’t come on last
night as when I used the outlet I bumped the sprinkler control transformer and
disconnected it.  I corrected it and turned it on to run today.  After it
finished I wiped the windows down.  After eating lunch I did take a short nap. 
I went to the Stake onion patch and weeded for two hours.  For dinner I ate
some fish that was left over from breakfast.  I watched an old western movie on
TV this evening.  It’s now 10:30PM and Mae and Shellie aren’t home yet.  I am
tired so will go to bed and let Mae come in a little while.  I just got ready
for bed when they came.  I still went to bed without Mae.</p>

continued the row I had worked yesterday.  At 10:45 I stopped and carried my
weeds out and came home.  Mae and Shellie were ready to when I got home.  They
went out to eat with Georgia.  I got my eye glasses out to use them and the
left ear piece fell off.  I took them back into Wal-Mart and the young lady
looked up my history and said the glasses were under the warranty and then
replaced the frames at no cost to me.  I have been very pleased with the
service of the Wal-mart optical department.   Jase went with me and we went
back to the onion patch.  This time I just had Jase help me measure the length
of the onion rows.  We found them to be 1265 feet long.  I hope to use those
measurements to persuade our Ward leaders to make the assignments a different
way.  Jase and I then got us something to eat for lunch.  We had just finished
eating when Mae and Shellie came home.  I took a nap and then we all went to
Jeff and Gail’s and went with them and Marcie to the Salt Lake zoo.  It was
very enjoyable but I was tired when the zoo closed and we had to leave.  We all
came back to Jeff and Gail’s where we ate and then the six adults played
games.  We played “Settlers” and after a long game Mae won.  It was almost
mid-night when Mae and I got home.  Shellie and Jase will stay at Jeff and
Gail’s tonight.  It’s late so we went to bed after I made this entry.</p>

did not sleep well last night and was still up at 4AM.  When I got up I tried
to keep quiet as to not wake her.  I worked on my journal after reading my
scriptures and saying my prayers.  I really find that I am very weak in my
memory of what I read.  I am so grateful for the Spirit that burns within me
and gives me testimony of the truthfulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the
knowledge that His church is here on the earth to give us strength and guidance
as to the plan of salvation.  I am grateful for the testimony that Joseph Smith
was called to be the Prophet of the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
here on earth in these last and final days prior to the Second Coming of our
Lord and Savior when He shall personal rain on earth and cleans it for the
finial time.   I am grateful to have Prophets to lead His Church and to teach
us.  I am grateful for President Thomas Monson and I know that he holds the
Keys of the Priesthood (The Power of God extended to man to act in His name)
and is the only one that holds that authority so long as he lives.  I also
testify that the perfect plan was laid for succession upon Presidents death,
for the Quorum of The Twelve to continue in the Prophets place.  I fully sustain
and support the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve as Prophets,
Seers and Revelators and the only ones that hold this authority.  I sustain and
accept my Stake Presidency and Bishopric in their authorized calling.  This
testimony and my special Eternal companion are my greatest blessing.  I wish
that all my children could also have this testimony and desire.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
wiped the windows down to remove the hard water from the sprinklers.  I tried
to get things organized and not wake Mae but when I came in from watering and
feeding the animals Mae came out of the bedroom.  I had eaten breakfast.  I got
working on the hallway upstairs patching the hole where the swamp cooler was. 
That took more work than I thought and I didn’t get it finished before it was
lunch time.  Scott came over for lunch but Shellie and Jase were late as they
visited too long with Gail.  They did get here before Scott went back to work. 
After lunch I finished framing and installing the sheet rock.  I went over to
Irven and Sandy’s and patched their front room ceiling and I patched a hole in
their roof.  When I got home I was sure tired so I took a nap but Mae let me
sleep for 1 ½ hours.  Bob and I went Home Teaching to the Casey and Johnston’s
this evening.  I visited with Bishop Smith this evening concerning the Stake
Farm and onion patch.  I offered any help that I can.  Mae and I have visited
this evening and now it is late and we need to get to bed.  Especially Mae for
she has gone every sence she got up and she didn’t get but 5 hours at the most
of sleep.</p>

coat of mud on the patch in Bob’s hall ceiling.  All of our children and most
of our Grand-Children and one of our Great-Grand-Children came.  We had a very
good time.  As we finished the evening we took some family pictures and then
they all had me open some Fathers-Day gifts and expressed their love and
appreciation.  I offered to go to Salt Lake to pickup Kylan at the airport with
Scott.  His plane came in at 11:30PM.  He was home sick and very tired when he
got here.  It was after mid-night when I got home.  Mae and Shellie were

before going to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t have an early meeting this morning so we slept in.  Mae didn’t feel very
well so she stayed home from R.S. and S.S.  It’s been a fairly relaxing day
except Bob and I Did go H.T. to Sister Fallis.  Mae also went V.T. to Sister
Fallis.  We have to do that when we can catch her and Sundays are the best for
that.  I made a table on my computer to assign onion rows out to the Priesthood
brothers.  I think this will be a much better way to get the job done.  Scott
and his family stopped over to wish me a Happy Father’s Day.  Kylan also
brought his airplane over to show it to us.  We did some research on the
candidates on the Republican Ballot and filled out the ballots and got them
ready to mail.   I worked on Indexing for a few minutes after we had eaten
dinner and then we watched a J.A.G. serious before going to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up early and got ready to go fishing.  Nick arrived here shortly after 6AM
and we went to East Canon reservoir.  Nick caught the first fish about 20
minutes after we got the boat on the water.  By 11AM we had our limits and
loaded the boat.  We took the time to clean the fish at the cleaning station. 
We bought some ice when we got to Morgan to pack the fish in.  Nick had to
leave as soon as we got home so that he could take his son into the Dr. to
check his arm.  It looks like Logan strained the arm by pitching.  I filed the
eight fish and sealed them for freezing.  I worked on the onion field
assignments with Brother Morgan Thomas, High Priest Group Leader and Brother
Tomas Saunders, Elders Quorum President.  This evening we watched another
J.A.G. serious before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
slept most of the night in the guest bedroom.  She doesn’t feel very well.  We
think that she mainly has allergies.  We decided that we had better not go
anyplace for our 53<sup>rd</sup> wedding anniversary.  I did some chasing to
get row marker materials, material to build rabbit nest’s and chicken and
rabbit feed.  We ate a Sub-Way sandwich for lunch.  While eating lunch we watch
a show on TV.  I started to get everything ready to build rabbit litter boxes
when I remembered that my one staple gun quite working while I was helping Jeff
so I checked on getting it repaired and found that I was looking at getting
parts ordered with a cost of $35.00 plus freight and an unknown length of time
for the parts to come.  I decided to just buy a new one.  I had used part of my
Father’s Day gift from my children to buy Andrea and Wallis’s wedding gift,
part for materials to build the rabbit nest’s, part for materials to stake out
the onion patch and the rest to buy the staple gun.  I guess I have to be
thankful that I had been given the money as a gift to cover those expenses. 
For dinner this evening I barbequed some fish on the grill.  They sure turned
out good.  I worked on the assignments charts for the onion patch and Mae
worked on plans for the Bushnell Family Reunion.  We both finished about the
same time and soon went to bed.</p>

woke at 5AM.  Mae was in the other bed as she hadn’t slept well so I shut the
door and let her sleep.  She woke about 7:30AM.  I finished a batch of indexing
this morning making 1071 names that I have entered so far.  I really seem to
enjoy this program.  We had breakfast and then Mae went back to bed as she is
really feeling bad.  I decided that I had better stay home to be with her but
when it came close to the time that we needed to leave for S.L., Mae called to
me to get ready.  She felt that even those she didn’t feel well enough to
attend the reception and wedding of Wallis and Andrea, I should attend.  Bob
and I drove down.  When we got to S.L. we couldn’t find any parking close to
the reception area.  I should have read the invitation as it gave pacific
instructions.  I finally dropped Bob off at the Joseph Smith building and I
parked the car west of the conference center.  We walked east another block to
the lunching.  We enjoyed visiting with many of our family.  As usual Rich,
Lois and Elias were there.  Rich isn’t doing very well mentally but is still in
good health physically.  The Temple Sealing was very special and so worthwhile
for all that were able to attended.  I truly felt the spirit of our Lord and
the importance of the Marriage Convenience.  Bob and I drove back home where I
got something to eat.  Mae had gotten up and did her hair but is still not
well.  She also did more planning on the Bushnell Reunion.  I took a nap and
then Bob, Sherrie, Cole and I drove back to the Wedding Reception.  It was held
at Louland Falls in Parley’s Canyon.  I enjoyed visiting with many of the
guest.  Rose Mary and Brent Palmer from Goshen were able to be there along with
others I know, besides many family members, Sandi and Chelci, Bryce and Deanna,
Devin and Betsy, Phillip and Lisa, Grant, plus all of Irven and Sandy’s
family.  Bryce and his family were planning on being there but their plane
flight was just too late.  Mae was missed by many especially by me.  When we I
got home, I fixed Mae and I some fruit and toast.  I wasn’t able to eat very
much at the lunching and there wasn’t anything that I could eat at the
reception.  That makes it kind of hard on both sides.  We watched another
J.A.G. serious before going to sleep.</p>

pretty well but still isn’t feeling the best.  After we ate I went out in the

at the Tanner Clinic in Kaysville.  Dr. Lee was off and we were quite impressed
with Dr. Yates.  He also gave me some needles to remove slivers.  I have been out
of needles for some time.  We took some furniture to the Deseret Industries
that Bob didn’t want.  After getting home Mae prepared lunch.  I took a nap
after eating and then started to build the rabbit nesting boxes.  I needed some
material so was just going for a few minutes but the pickup died and I had to
have Mae come and bring me some tools.  I bought and installed a new battery
but then found that the alternator was also out.  I went to Home Depot and got
the material I needed and then went to the Auto Zone and bought a new
alternator.  I had bought the battery at the Roy store but they didn’t have the
alternator and sent me to the Clearfield store.  It was after 6 PM when I got
home.  Scott called and wants to borrow my compressor and roofing gun tomorrow. 
I will have to finish my nesting boxes in the morning.  We went to bed about
8:30PM and watched the movie “The King and I” before going to sleep.  </p>

then finished building the rabbit nests boxes.  Jeff and Gail brought their
children over to pick peas but I had finished picking them by that time.  After
they left I helped Mae shell the peas.  While we did that we watched some cute
shows on the Hall Mark channel.  I called Scott as he wanted to borrow my
compressor and tools to repair his roof.  I asked him if he would stop and buy
us a bag of ice on his way over.  He did and so after we loaded the tools in
his truck and they left, we started blanching the peas and bagging them to
freeze.  We got ten pints of peas put us in the freezer when we finished.  Bob
knocked and told me that Bruce was up there.  Mae still isn’t feeling well so
she didn’t go up but I did.  I visited with them until 11PM.  I had hoped Mae
would have gone to bed but when I came downstairs she was just finishing
cleaning the kitchen.  We soon went to bed.</p>

I attended Sacrament meeting in the 1<sup>st</sup> ward and then went to the
Country Ward where I had the privilege of Ordain Kylan Scott to the Aaronic
Priesthood and conferring him to the office of Deacon.  It was a great
privilege and honor as his Grandfather but I would have been even more thrilled
had I stood in the circle whit Scott being the mouth.  It was also enjoyable to
meet several that we know from the Country Creek Ward.  After we went to Scott
and Mishelle’s and visited for a few minutes before returning home.  Mae
prepared some dinner for us and then we took a nap.  I got no Indexing and
before I ended the day I completed another batch.  That make a total of 1,111
names that I have indexed into the system.  This evening we invited Scott and
his family over to just hang out.  It was a good evening.  We found out that
somewhere above our bathroom ceiling there is a plumbing leak.  I will have to
investigate more another time.  It is now 11PM so we had better get to bed.</p>

the alternator changed out.  Bob then started mowing the lawn so I used the
small mower and trimmed the outsides.  Mae trimmed with the trimmer.  After
lunch I took a nap while Mae went grocery shopping.  I started getting cooking
equipment out and set up.  When Mae got home we started mixing the recipes for
the potatoes and the baked beans.  We got those started cooking in electric
ovens and I started cooking steak and chicken just as everyone showed up.  We
ate outside on the picnic table.  Everyone enjoyed the dinner.  After cleaning
up we set and talked about early memories.  Everyone then went inside and
visited about the Bushnell Reunion.  We played games for a little while and
then Bryce and Deanna had to leave so Kim, Jeanenne and Koleesee left also. 
Rick and Georgia stayed and the four of us visited and played a game.  We still

for Mae to tend today as she had a class today.  It didn’t take me very long to
do my weeding along with the row next to me.  Our area of the onions look very
clean especially compared to some other areas.  After getting home Bob and I
went to Lowe’s and exchanged the large bucket of sheet rock mud for a small
bucket.  We also got some paint and supplies.  I finished the sheet rocking and
have it about ready to paint.  We pulled the faucet apart on Bob’s bath tub and
then went to Durk’s for parts.  I repaired the faucet and then cleaned out the
filter on the irrigation pump.  Brother Thomas asked to hold a meeting on Home

and Grant might go golfing.  That seems to be one thing he enjoys even though
he no longer has the strength and abilities he once had.  As I read my
scriptures this morning I felt greatly of my weakness and lack of abilities.  I
read from the 76 Section of the Doctrine and Governance and felt so weak. 
Maybe someday I will understand.   I just cann’t understand my failure as a
father in the raising of my children.  They are all good children, with good
accomplishment, far to exceed mine, but with most of them, very lacking in the
things I desired most.  Where I failed as a father I am not sure, but failure I

I really ran into a mess and by noon had found two outlets that were wired
wrong but still not the problem with the circuit in the front room and basement
area.  At noon I quit and came home for lunch.  Both Mae and I then took a
short nap.  After getting back up I got the boat and other items to go
fishing.  Mae was going to go also but she doesn’t feel good.  I picked up
Kylan and Ashley and we went to East Canon.  It took us a couple of hours
before both Ashley and Kylan caught a fish.  They then wanted to play in the so
we quite fishing and found a place to beach the boat and let them play.  After
a few minutes I moved the boat out into deeper water and anchored it.  they
enjoyed jumping of the boat into the water.  It was after 7PM when we quit and
came in.  I cleaned and fillet the fish before we came home.  I think they had
a good time and I guess that is what counts.  It was almost 10PM when I got

the sun room, the ceiling of the furnace ducted fur down in our front room and
the ceiling in our bathroom.  We then cleaned up my mess and put my tools
away.  We put the boat away and got the camp trailer hooked up.  Mae had things
packed and we left for Tooele to take the camp trailer to Sandi.  I showed
Sandi how to set the trailer up and how to turn on all the units.  When we
turned on the water we found that we had a leak.  I opened up the tap of the
shower and found that a connection had broken loose again.  I had repaired that
connection last year but the one clamp had given way.  Nick got home from work
about that time so we ate dinner.  Sandi and I went to Home Depot and bought
some items to repair the trailer.  We took Mae with us and let her go shopping
for a wedding gift at Wal-Mart while we were at Home Depot.  When we got back

setting off the alarm.  I waited until almost 5:30AM and then woke Sandi and
had her de-arm the alarm.  It didn’t take me very long to have the repairs done
so I had Sandi come out and I showed her the rest of the things she needs to

I packed our things and left for Salt Lake.  About the time we got to the
intersection that we should have taken to I-215, Bob called for he had came to
Bob and Cheryl’s and found that no one was there and he didn’t know where to
go.  Mae was talking to him on my cell-phone and asking me how to get there. 
We had forgotten to bring the IPOD with us and that is where I had the
directions.  I wasn’t sure that I know how to get there and as we talked I
suddenly realized that I had missed the exit.  Bob had hung up and I was lost. 
We finally found Bob and Cheryl’s home.  Bob had returned there so we had him. 
I found their Chapel and we found some fellow cleaning the building.  I asked
them and they gave me some directions which we later found out that it was to
the wrong Stake Center.  Sandy called on Cheryl’s Bishops wife’s cell-phone and
then they came and directed us to the Stake Center.  The Bishop had gone ahead
with the Baptism of Emma, Cheryl’s granddaughters but we got there just in time
for me to be voice in her confirmation.  We enjoyed visit after the services
were complete.  When we got home Bob prepared chicken for dinner.  I then took
a nap and worked on my journal.  Bob and I went Home Teaching to Brother
Therman this afternoon.  Bob though that he had a Single Adult program to go to
but when we returned we looked on the invitation and found that it is not until
September.  Mae and I went to the wedding reception of Jessica Kay and Matthew
Scott Richards which was held in Perry, Utah.  Matthew is the son  of Scott and
Tinna (Linderman) Richards.  It was so good to see Tinna again and it made her
so happy.  Scott and Tinna are moving Indiana next week as Scott has a better
job offer which should allow him to retire in 5 years.  When we came home
Brother Campell and his children were here to bring us some chicken feed that
they still had.  We visited for a little while.  Mae and I watched the last half

Cheryl’s talk that we missed and asked her to send to us:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’m so
happy and grateful to be here today for Emmah’s baptism.  It is such a special
day.  It has been five years today that I went through the Salt Lake Temple for
my own endowments.  I also was able to be proxy for the baptism of my daughter,
Sarah, in the Jordan River Temple with the help of Sister Linda Bonella.  It
was such a special experience.  That particular day was fifty years after my
own baptism on September 29<sup>th</sup>.  The Lord has blessed me in so many
ways and I am thankful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>I have been
asked to talk about the Holy Ghost.  I want to start my talk by asking some
questions and hopefully give some answers and ideas for Emmah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>What
valuable gift can you receive after you are baptized?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>I think
Emmah already knows the answer because when Bishop Skidmore asked her on Sunday
“Why do you want to be Baptized?” She said “To receive the Holy Ghost.”  The
gift of the Holy Ghost is one of the great blessings we receive.  In Moroni
chapter 10 verse 5 it says “and by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the
truth of all things.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Who is the
Holy Ghost?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A being who
helps Jesus and Heavenly Father, a spirit, someone who can comfort us.  The
first article of faith “We believe in God, the eternal Father and his son,
Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.”  The Holy Ghost does not have a body of
flesh and bones like Heavenly Father and Jesus.  In 1995 the prophet Gordon B.
Hinckley said “I believe in the Holy Ghost as a personage of spirit who
occupies a place with the father and son, the Holy Ghost is the testifier of
truth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>When are we
given the Holy Ghost?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>After we are
baptized; when we are confirmed members of the church.  Part of the fourth
article of faith says “Laying on of our hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Where can we
feel the promptings of the Holy Ghost?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In our
hearts and minds, at home, at school, at church or wherever we are when we
choose the right.  We can not see the Holy Ghost, but he can help us to do what
is right.  The Holy Ghost doesn’t always speak to us in a voice we can hear. 
Many times he gives us feelings of what we should do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Why did
Heavenly Father send the Holy Ghost to be with us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>To help and
comfort us; to guide and warn us; to tell us what is true; to give us feelings
of love and peace.  The Holy Ghost can help us before we are baptized and
confirmed but after we receive this gift we may have the Holy Ghost as a
constant companion.  This means as long as we do what is right, his influence
can be with us always.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>This is a
gift for you, Emmah.  (Give the vase of “W” Flowers)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Alivia
printed this verse to read:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In cosing, I
would like to bear my testimony that I know that this church is true and Thomas
S Monson is a true prophet.  I’m so thankful for my husband, family, and my
ward family.  Also, I want to give a special thanks for my uncles and aunts who
are always there for me.  If know if Emmah will continue to choose the right
and keep her baptismal promises, she will have the Holy Ghost to help her and
her family.  I say this in the nae of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
