<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, Jan. 01, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We stopped at Bob and Carroll’s for New
Years breakfast at 1:30AM.  Later we went up to Uncle Dale and Aunt Ester’s
cabin for dinner.  When we got to their cabin I realized that two or three
years ago, Bob and Pauline Hein had stopped by our place in sunset, and asked
us to go for a ride with them.  We went and as we drove, I really wasn’t paying
any attention to where Bob was taking us.  We finally turned off the paved road
and traveled 2 or 3 miles up a dirt road.  At the end of the road, Bob stopped
the car and asked me what I thought of the place.  It was a nice area with a
small pond but other than it was just a nice place for a picnic or a camp.  Bob
then told me that I had the opportunity to buy this spot.  I then said that it
did not have any utilities and should they want them it would be quite
expensive to have them brought in.  I think I discouraged them from proceeding
with that purchase.  Bob never did say any more about that day but I have
wondered if I was wrong in my evaluation.  Now today we are in the same spot
and Uncle Dale had purchased the spot, made a nice cabin and planted fish in
the pond.   They had skidoos, skis and tubs for us to use.  We all had a great
time.  We went back to Bob and Carroll’s this evening.  Irven and Sandy also
came there and we played rook, until bed time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 02, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We went to Sunday School at the Clearfield 8<sup>th</sup>
Ward.  We then went to the <i>Clearfield </i>1<sup>st</sup> Ward for Fast &amp;
Testimony meeting.  It was sure wonderful to be back.  Richard &amp; RaNae
Barney had us over for dinner.  Bishop &amp; Sister Murdock, Devin &amp; Daleen
Reed and Dale &amp; Mary Cottral were also there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 03, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Bob and I went to S.L. and checked on jobs. 
We then went to Bob and Carroll’s home they have just purchased in Sunset.  I
helped Bob cut off doors and laid out some new carpeting.  Mae and her mother
had a wonderful turkey dinner ready at 5:30 PM.  We flew home to Phoenix,
leaving S.L. about 8PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 04, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Work went ok but still no news about the
strike.  Mae got all the Christmas trimmings put up except for taking the tree
out.  She also cleaned the house, washed and cleaned the patio.  She sure is
wonderful.  I finished oral evaluations and reports.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 05, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae went to M.I.A. this evening.  I stayed
with <i>our children.</i>  Danny Turp came over <i>to our house</i> and we
filled out the <i>report for the </i>Adult Aaronic <i>Priesthood</i>.  <i>When
Mae came home, </i>Mae and I took <i>the report </i>to the Ward Clerk.  <i>It </i>was
nice to go for a short ride with her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 06, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <i>After getting home from work </i>I took
the outside Christmas lights down.  We were going to go over to Larry and
Tammy’s for the evening but Sandi got sick to her stomach so we stayed home and
watched a TV show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 07, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae and I went out to dinner after I got
home from work.  After <i>dinner we</i> went grocery shopping.  <i>We then </i>stopped
over and visited with Larry and Tammy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 08, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked for Larry for a while this morning
then at 2PM Larry, Tammy, Lonny, Todd Shumway, Mae, David and I went up to the
lake.  We took Frances’s boat and went for a ride in it.  <i>I believe, if I
remember right, Larry also took his boat.  Frances wanted me to try out his
boat, hopping that I would buy it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 09, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae spoke in Sacrament meeting and mainly
talked about her M.I.A. class.  She did very well and <i>received</i> several <i>faveroble</i>
comments afterwords.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 10, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Work went well today.  When I got home from
work we went over to Larry and Tammy’s for Family Home Evening but Larry’s
Grandparents and Aunt and Uncle stopped in form a trip to Mexico.  We ate,
visited with them for a little while and then came home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 11, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae and I went for a short ride after we got
the children to bed.  We went over to Skaggs and bought a ledger book.  We came
back home and I figured the check book and bills.  Mae worked on her Treasures
of Truth book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 12, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae went to M.I.A. tonight so I stayed home
and watched TV with the children.  After Mae got home we made new parts for the
children’s Quiet Books.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 13, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went Home Teaching <i>this evening</i> but
no one was <i>at </i>home.  We played with the children, I pulled a loose tooth
for Sandy, then when the children went to bed, Mae and I went for a short drive
and got some milk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 14, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We had Karen and Jerry Young over this
evening and we played games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 15, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to work for Larry today.  I stopped
on the way home and got a haircut.  I <i>repaired</i> Sandy’s and my bikes <i>when
I got home.</i>  Mae and I went over to Larry and Tammy’s for a little while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 16, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                My Priesthood and Sunday school lessons went
well today.  Mae didn’t attend Relief Society because Shellie, Mike and David
are still sick.  Sandy stayed home and tended the children while Mae and I
attended Sacrament meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 17, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We had a nice Family Home Evening tonight. 
Mae gave the lesson tonight.  Sandy came home from school with a fever so now
all the children are sick.  Mae and I drove over to look at a refrigerator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 18, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae and I went over and looked at some new
refrigerators.  We decided that we should try to get our old one repaired. 
This evening I went Home Teaching.  Sandy is still very sick with the flu.  I
sure love Mae.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 19, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I came home from work early and took the
refrigerator to get it fixed.  Today I also came down with the flu.  That make
all our family, except Mae, that is sick with the flu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 20<sup>th</sup> 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I spent the whole day in bed.  I don’t know
when I have ever been so sick.  The children are still sick also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 21, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Sandy felt well enough to go to school
today.  Her teacher had invited her over to her place for super and games.  I
am feeling some better this evening.  (While I was retyping this journal entry
we were with Sandi on our Hawaii tour.  I told her about what I had entered and
she still remembered the occasion.  She said that that was her favorite
teacher.  She was in the 4<sup>th</sup> Grade.  The teacher would invite two
girls and two boys.  Sandi thinks that the husband would take the boys shopping
and then the girls would prepare the meal.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 22, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We got word that Aunt Marine died at 2AM
this morning.  She has been sick for some time.  I was feeling much better this
morning.  We got our refrigerator back for the repair shop today, it cost us
$40.49 for the repairs on it.  I got feeling much worse this evening having
pains in my chess.  We finally called Bishop Price.  He brought his Father with
him and they administered to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 23, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I had three more pain attacks today with the
last one about 9PM.  We had just finished holding Family Home Evening.  We had
been talking about Aunt Marine’s funeral and thought about Mae flying up to
attend.  With these attacks Mae said that she was not going to leave.  After
the third attacked, Mae took me up to the Hospital.  She got our neighbor,
Jerry Young and our Home Teacher  Brother Lanny to help her.  Brother Lanny
stayed with our children as they were in bed.  At the hospital they checked me
for a heart attack and for pneumonia but neither was the case.  It was late
when the doctors released me to come home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 24, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I am still feeling quite week but am much
better than I was. Mae took me up to Dr. Keep who checked me and gave me a
shot.  Mae went to Lynn Johnstun’s for a treatment.  She then came back home
and took me up to him for a treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 25, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Tammy took Mae to the Airport this morning
so she could fly up to Utak to attend Aunt Marine’s funeral.  Mollie Ascroft
tended Shellie and Mike for us.  Karen Young tended David.  I stayed home and
slept except for an appointment with the Doctor.  Sandy fixed super this
evening and tended the children.  I picked up Mae at the airport at 9:20PM this
evening.  She said that the funeral was very nice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 26, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I am feeling much better but still week. 
Mae had M.I.A. tonight and didn’t get home until 10:30PM.  We set up and talked
late.  She sure is a wonderful person and wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 27, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to work this morning but came home at
noon and went to bed.  I rested most of the day.  This evening, Mae and I went
over to the Ashcroft’s to visit with them for a few minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 28, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I slept and rested most of the day.  Mae and
I went for a ride this evening.  We stopped at Larry and Tammy’s and they went
with us for pizza.  It was a nice evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 29, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I worked on our car, putting in
new spark plugs, new spark plug wires and points in it.  We then took the
children and went to Rawhide Arizona.  It is an old western town.  The children
enjoyed going on a stagecoach ride.  It has been a good day.  Mae and I
attended meeting this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 30, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We participated in a special “Church of Work
for Youth” program for Sunday school today.  I think it went pretty well. 
After Sacrament meeting I attended the Adult Seminar.  Mae and I stayed up
talking before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 31, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Shortly after leaving work this evening the
transmission went out on the car.  I called Larry and he came and towed me
home.  I went Home Teaching to the Deloy Porter family this evening.  Mae and
the children had Family Home Evening without me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, February 01, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When I came home from work I started working
on the car.  It didn’t take very long and I found what was the problem.  A bolt
on the tourk converter had come loose.  I had a meeting about Adult Aaronic
Priesthood work at 7:30PM and so I didn’t get much else done this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 02, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I picked up some parts for the
car.  It was almost 11;30PM when I got the car repaired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 03, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I got up early and built a dog pen for our
dog.  I then went into work.  Mae got things ready to go to Utah and she (and I
think the children) met me at the airport.  We flew up to Utah getting there
about 7:30PM.  Mae’s parents met us at the airport.  We stayed with them
tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, February 04, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Irven and Sandra Lee Watts were married in
the Salt Lake Temple by Elder Monson.  Their wedding breakfast was held at the
Chuck-A-Rama on 4<sup>th</sup> South and 5th West.  That evening they had a
very Wedding Reception.  When we got back to Mae’s parents home, Mae wasn’t
feeling the best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 05, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae isn’t feeling very well today.  We went
over to Bob and Carroll’s for dinner.  Mom and Dad Jensen also were there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 06, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae still isn’t feeling well today.  I went
to Priesthood meeting and Sunday school with Dad Porter.  I went to Sacrament meeting
with Bob and Carroll as they were asked to speak today.  This evening Sandy and
I flew home so I could go to work and Sandy could go to school.  Mae and the
rest of the children stayed with Mom and Dad Porter so that Mae can get feeling
better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, February 07, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I got up early and fixed breakfast
for Dale and Peggie Dransfield.  They have stayed at our place this weekend. 
They left today.  This evening as Sandy and I were finishing dinner I got a
phone call from work about some problems.  I took Sandy with me and we went
into work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, February 08, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After dinner this evening Sandy and I
cleaned up the house.  We then watched TV and had some ice cream.  We picked
Mae and the children up at the airport at 9:15PM.  Mae and I stayed up after
putting the children to bed, and talked until 1AM.  Mae sure is wonderful!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 09, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae went to M.I.A. this evening and I stayed
home with the children.  It is sure hard to not get discouraged over finances. 
It is good that I have Mae to support me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 10, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae went to school this evening with Sandy
for a special parent teacher meeting.  After they returned Mae and I went over
to Bishop Price’s for a Shackly meeting.  We then stopped at Larry’s to borrow
a can of W-2 from him.  He said that he had more work for me to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, February 11, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went into work early so that I could leave
at 2PM.  I went to work for Larry nailing on roofing with a power gun.  This is
the first time I have had the use of a power gum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 12, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Bryce and Deanna and their new baby, Noland,
got here at 2:15AM.  I went to work with Larry at 7AM so that we could finish
the roofing job.  This afternoon I took my family and Bryce, Deanna and baby to
the Phoenix Zoo.  This evening Bryce, Deanna, Mae and I went to the Old Mining
Camp for dinner.  Sandy tended the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 13, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We enjoyed having Bryce and Deanna attend
meetings with us today.  We had a nice dinner on our patio today.  After
Sacrament meeting I had an interview with Bishop Price and was asked to be the
Executive Secretary.  This evening we, including Bryce and Deanna and our
children went over to Uncle Van and Aunt Allison’s for a visit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Insert:
due to lack of room in a Diary I have left a lot of detail out so I am going to
expand on my being called to be Executive Secretary!  </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>                Previous
to this calling, shortly after we moved into the Lehi 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward, we
had the Bishopric come to our home to visit us.  During that visit I was asked
to teach the oldest youth class in Sunday School.  I was excited at this
calling as my experience while in Clearfield, though I was serving in the
Bishopric, I enjoyed being called to teach this age during Sunday School when
the instructor had to be absent.  I had found this age to be eager to learn and
discuss the principles of the Church. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>                Also
during this visit, Mae was asked to teach the Laurel class in the Young Women’s
program.  She too was excited for this and anticipated it with excitement.  </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>                During
my first Sunday School class I was greatly surprised and came home determined
to do a better job in my lesson preparation, as my lesson certainly did not go
over with the youth I taught.  Mae came home from her first M.I.A. class in
tears.  She said that the girls showed no respect to her or to each other. 
Over the next several months neither Mae’s nor my class showed any improvement
and I would come home discouraged and Mae would come home in tears. I finally
had enough and asked to be released.  Mae however continued to persist with her
calling and after 6 months things started changing for the better.  She finally
earned the respect of almost all of the girls.  Over the years she saw most of
these girls get married and most were married in the Temple.  One of the girls
a few years later, when we had moved back to Utah and then moved to Arizona a
second time, even became one of Mae’s councilor in the Primary Presidency.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>                 (Whether
this was the actual date on which this occurred or not I have been unable to
verify.)  </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>                On
November 21, 1971 I indicated that I visited with the Sunday School
Superintendent and asked to be released.  Actually it was a demand to be
released, as I quit!  The problem started first during Junior Sunday School. 
Brother Marsdon, was the advisor to the Adult Aaronic Priesthood group and I
had been called to assist him.  We had gotten permission for those, that we
could encourage to attend the priesthood meeting and class, to be able to pass
the Sacrament during Jr. Sunday School.  Today we had one Brother attend the
Priesthood class and he expressed interest in passing the Sacrament today.  I
volunteered to assist him.  During the Sacrament, I became quite upset at the
two Priests that prepared and blessed the Sacrament as they made (in my
opinion) a mockery of the Sacrament.  A member of the Bishopric was in
attendance and did nothing about the problem.  Had he not been there, I think I
would have dismissed the two boys and found another Priesthood holder and we
would have completely re-preformed that Sacred Ordnance.  With a member of the
Bishopric in attendance, I didn’t feel that it was my place.  I left the Jr.
Sunday school quite upset and went to my Sunday school class.   During my
Sunday school class the youth were again very disrespectful.  But that wasn’t
bad enough; as when I saw a boy and a girl petting, I came unglued.  I walked
out of the room and slammed the door.  Just a few feet away was the Sunday
School Superintendent visiting with the Bishopric Counselor.  I walked up to
the Superintendent, handed him my manual and said “I quit”.  I added that I
would never prepare those youth another lesson and then I left.  This evening
we attended Sacrament meeting.  Prior to the meeting starting, the Sunday
School Superintendent came to me and asked if I could take the class one more
week, to give him enough time to get a replacement for me.  I told him, “If he
wanted me to baby sit them during class time, I would do that, but I would not
waste the time to prepare a lesson for them”.  He agreed to that.  The
following Sunday I finished with the Adult Aaronic priesthood class and I went
into my Sunday school class room.  I was the first there so I just set down by
the door and started studding my next Sunday’s priesthood lesson.  As students
started coming into the room I wouldn’t even look up.  When the last seem to
have come in I looked up as not a person was saying a word.  I told the class
that I hadn’t prepared a lesson but was there just to baby sit the class.  I
went back to reading.  Without anything being said, I again said that I had no
lesson for them, but if anyone had a question we could discuss that.  No one
said anything so I started reading again.  Finally one girl cleared her thought
and said Brother Browning, I have a question. That opened up a discussion and
the rest of the class went well.</i></p>

I also include another experience I had with this Sunday School class, just a
short while before my call to be Executive Secretary.  Again I am unable to
pinpoint the date.  At this time on Fast Sunday, a Sunday School class would be
assigned to give the Opening Exercises to the meeting.  One member was to give
the opening prayer, two class members were to give talks on the Scripture that
the class had chosen and then the entire class was to stand and five a
Scripture Recitation.  The class was given a month advance notice so there was
plenty of time to prepare.  My class had been chosen.  I had tried to get the
youth to participate but I could not get them too corporate at all.  As the
month went by I tried to find ways but to no success.  I finally got one girl
to agree to give the opening prayer.  I asked a second girl if she would give a
talk and I asked the Bishop’s son if he would give a talk. I also got one girl
to agree to just stand and read the assigned scripture.  On that Sunday Morning
I was notified that the Bishops son wasn’t going to be there as he didn’t feel
well.  I thought that as my lesson was on the ability to open the Scriptures,
pick a Verse from the page and give your ideas on that scripture, so I thought
I would do that.  The girl that was going to give the opening prayer, decided
that she wouldn’t come up to the stand and didn’t even though the member of the
Sunday School prescience announced her name. I was also new to the calling as
he had just been put into the calling a couple of week earlier.  This
frustrated him and he had to call on an adult to open the meeting with prayer. 
Then, the girl that was going to give the talk wouldn’t come up to the stand. 
I got up to give my talk but instead I let the parents of the Ward have it with
both barrels and really told them that they needed to teach their children
better respect.  I don’t know just what I said but Mae had taken David into the
cry room and from there she said that she could really see the anger in the
Bishops wife, who was the music chorister and was setting behind me.  Well,
opening exercises were dismissed and my Sunday school class didn’t go very
well, with what few there was in attendance.  On Fast Sunday, Sacrament meeting
follow Sunday School with Fast and Testimony meeting.  The first person to take
the stand where the time was opened for the bearing of testimony said that our
children were good and Brother Browning had no right to criticize them the way
I had.  The next person was the Scout Master and he said that Brother Browning
was right, and our children needed more parental discipline.  Then a parent
disagreed with Brother Browning, then the Primary President agreed with Brother
Browning and that is the way it went the entire meeting went.  I was glad to
get out of that meeting.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>*******</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>                When
the call came to me to be the Executive Secretary, I felt that in reality the
call was just to give me something to do beside be with the youth.  The
position of Executive Secretary was a relatively new calling and as of yet had
little training information as to what the position detailed except to fulfill
what the Bishop needed to be done.  The Executive Secretary was to attend all
meetings that the Bishopric attended.  </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>                I
do not want to, in anyway, downgrade Bishop Price, he was a Brick Masonry
Contractor by profession and worked very hard during the week.  Also, the
position of Bishop, which he had fulfilled for over 4 years, required many
unseen hours of time and responsibility and so it is easy to understand that
after being in meeting from early morning until after noon, bishop Price would
start the Ward Council meeting and then would fall asleep.  His first counselor
would just pickup and continue the meeting.  Each person in the council, in
turn would make reports, requests or receive assignments.  Then it would be the
next person’s turn.  I always sat next to the Bishopric and would be the last
to report.  When it came my turn I would be asked if I had anything for the
meeting.  As executive secretary, I had no assignments unless given to me by
the Bishop or his counselors.  During the first three weeks, I had never been
given an assignment and so I would just say that I had nothing to report. 
During the first three weeks, I was beginning to feel embarrassed to have
nothing to report.  However, I began to see a trend in the meetings.  The first
person to give a report, was the Ward Clerk and he would read the minutes of
the last meeting.  In those minutes, assignments would have been noted but I
realized that very few of them ever surfaced again as far as a check up to see
if the assignment had been completed.  Deciding that I should do something, I
got a note book and wrote down the meeting, the date and the assignment given. 
For example: it had been requested that the High Priest Group Leadership were
asked to check on a family that had some serious sickness.  The Elders Quorum
Presidency was asked to check on a new family that had been reported to have
moved into the Ward.  On the next meeting when it was my turn to report, I
said: last week the High Priests were asked to check on a family about their
health, has that been done?  The High Priest Group Leader, cleared his throat and
said “I forgot, we will do it this week.  I then said, Last week the Elders was
to check on a new Family that moved in, has that been done?”  The Elders
President reported that they had gone by but no one was at home but they would
go by again.  I then said that was all I had.  The meeting was closed and we
went home.  At the next weekly meetings, I again would bring up past assignments
and if completed, I would cross them off, but if not completed they would
remain in my note book.  On the second week when I again reminded the high
Priest that they were assigned to visit a family two weeks ago, the Group
Leader turned to the Elders President and asked he had a piece a paper and a
pencil, adding “he expects me to do this, so I better write it down.”  I
continued with this note book as long as I held this position.  </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>                About
a year later, the 2 Lehi Wards were divided and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Ward was
formed.  The week prior to the division, I was called into the office to meet
with our Stake President.  When I was called into the office, the Stake
President was sitting behind the desk, with Carl Reese setting to his side.  I knew
Carl as he had been the 70’s Group Leader in our old ward.  I entered into the
office and the President welcomed me.  He then informed me that the information
that I was going to be told about was strictly confidential and was not to go
outside that room until the action had been announced from the pulpit during a
public meeting.  I told him that I understood.   He then asked if I knew Carl Reese. 
I replied that I did.  He then told me of the upcoming ward division and that
Carl Reese had been called to be the new Bishop of our ward.  He asked me if I
could support that calling.  I assured him that I could.  He then told me that
Bishop Reese had asked that I be extended the calling of Executive Sectary to serve
with him.  I told him that I was willing to accept that calling.  At that the
Stake President turned to Bishop Reese and said, Bishop Reese, do you have any
instructions for your new Executive Secretary?  Bishop Reese then said “yes!
You know that note book you have been keeping”.  I said “yes”.  He told me that
that was the main job he wanted me to continue to do.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae took Bryce and Deanna around Phoenix and
Scpttsdale today.  I took off work so we could go to Casagrandy but Mae didn’t
get home in time.  While waiting I worked on our income taxes.  When Mae, Bryce
and Deanna and the children returned we went out to eat and enjoyed that.  When
we returned home we played some games before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, February 15, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Bryce and Deanna left for home today.  When
I got home, we held our Family Home Evening as we had missed it last night.  I
then went over to Brother Glen Wood’s to learn a little about my new calling as
Executive Secretary.  When I returned home, I called and had a nice visit with
Roy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae had M.I.A. this evening so I stayed home
and tended the children.  We popped popcorn and watched T.V.  Later I worked on
income taxes and got them ready to send to Roy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 17, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was able to mail our income tax papers to
Roy for him to figure them for us.  Mae had a Stake M.I.A. meeting to attend
this evening.  I stayed home and tended the children.  When Mae got home from
the meeting she and I stayed up and talked, mainly about our finances.  We
decided that Mae might try selling Shackle products as a part time job.  She is
willing to do anything she can to help me with our financial situation.  I am
sure blessed to have such a wonderful wife and companion.  I sure love her!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I started today at 6:30 with Bishopric
meeting.  Meetings continued one after another until 12 noon.  After dinner I
went back to Stake Priesthood meeting followed by Stake High Priest meeting. 
This evening Mae and I set some goals to get up at 5:30AM each morning.  We
planned on jumping rope around the block and then reading for a half hour. 
Mike isn’t feeling very well this evening.</p>

to visit with them and to hear some of the news about the Mount Fort Ward and
how people are doing.</p>

bed.  It was a very nice evening.  We sure seem to have a special relationship
with Larry and Tammy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Work went well today.  I had to take an hour
off so that I could meet with our attorney.  He had an affidavit concerning the
fire in the apartment that we rented when we first moved down to Mesa.  I had
met with an insurance attorney some time ago.  He had asked me questions about
the fire.  I found out that the way I answered to the insurance attorney
questions, we would have been automatic guilty for starting the apartment and
would have been responsible for all cost.  It was a good thing that we hired an
attorney to represent us.  We had a nice Family Home Evening and Mae made a
nice Peach Cobbler for refreshments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, February 29, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At work today Ron Shumway was released from
his position as Manager over the Programming staff.  I am not sure just what
this means but I am worried about it.  I attended Bishopric meeting this
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(I would like to make an insert here.  Maybe more of this
story will surface as I continue to digitize 1970 – 1974 Diary but due to the
small space in a Five Year Diary, I am not sure. I have taken some of the
information here from my personal Employment records.)  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                June 1970 I went to work for Browning Arms
Co. in Morgan, Utah.  I had been out of the Data Processing field for 2 ½ years
and felt that I needed to find a company that would let me back in.  I found
that when most of the companies I applied with, looked at the time I had been
out of the field, that would end the interview.  When I got the opportunity to
apply with Browning Arms, I left the wage question blank.  During the end of
the interview, the Data Processing Manager told me that I hadn’t filled in the
wage that I requested.  I told him that many were concerned about my time out
of the field and I asked him if he could give me an offer.  He said that he
couldn’t and that I had to fill it in.  Being almost desperate for the job, I
put <u>$600 per month</u>.  He said: “Even if you can’t program, I could give
you a broom and dust pan, as I pay my janitors more than that.”  He then said
“If in 90 days you can prove your abilities I will bring you up to where you
should be paid.”  I accepted the job on those terms.  It didn’t take long until
I realized that we could not exist on <u>$600 a month</u>.  Bishop Murdock put
me on Welfare and he also had the McKay Dee Hospital write off the bill from
the birth of David.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was working 60 plus hours a week on salary
and I had been called as First Counselor in the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup>
Ward’s Bishopric.  Anyway, this became a very stressful period in our lives.  I
kept thinking that as soon as the 90 days were up I would get a raise.  Well as
things went, just before the 90 days were up, Mr. Browning sent out a memo to
all personal that he had put a freeze on all wages and that no more than a 1%
increase in pay would be given during the next year.  That was really a blow to
me.  It was early spring and had been a very wet spring.  I came home very
discouraged and down and told Mae that I needed to get away.  Mae asked me
where could we go this time of year?  I said that I didn’t care but I couldn’t
take it any longer.  The thought then came to me of Larry and Tammy now living
in Mesa, Arizona.  We questioned where we could get the money for gas.  Mae
visited with her mother, and because Uncle Van and Aunt Allison also lived in
Mesa, she said that she would pay ½ the traveling expenses if she could go with
us.  We, therefore, took a week’s vacation time and drove down.  While there
with Larry and Tammy and attending Church with them, Larry introduced me to a
neighbor and member of their Ward, Ron Shumway.  Ron asked me to come over to
his home after meetings as he would like to talk to me.  I did and he asked
about my computer programming experience and abilities.  He said that he would
like to bring me a programming manual on the language they were using and have
me write him a short program in that language.  He said that he didn’t want me
to work on it while I was on vacation but when I had time when I got back
home.  During the remainder of our trip I did do a little studying in my spare
time.  When I got home I rewrote a short program in the new language.  I got
one of my associates there at Browning Arms to key punch the program.  As I
didn’t have a computer compiler, I just packaged it up and asked Mae to mail it
to Mr. Shumway the next morning.  When I came home from work the following day
Mae said that Mr. Shumway called and wanted me to call him back.  I was
surprised as I was sure that the program had not had time to get to him that
fast.  I called and he was not home but they would give him the message when he
got there.  The next day Mr. Shumway called me at my work number and asked if I
could come in for an interview.  The day of the week was then Thursday.  I said
that it would take me about 16 hours to drive down, to which he said, no! I
don’t want you to drive.  He said that if I could go to the Hugh’s Air West
ticket counter at the Salt Lake Airport the next morning, tickets would be
waiting for me.  I told my supervisor, Roger, that I needed Friday off.  He
said that I could.  Mae took me to the airport early Friday morning and I flew
down to Phoenix.  Ron met me at the airport and took me to his office.  There
he had some of his staff interview me.  They then took me out to lunch.  We
returned to his office where he offered me a job at $900 a month.  I asked him
if I could talk it over with Mae and call him back.  He said that it was ok
with him.  I flew back home very excited.  We thought it over and I visited
with Bishop Murdock and he also felt good about it although he wasn’t excited
about us moving.  Monday morning I went into Roger and told him that I wanted
to turn in my resignation.  He said that he was afraid that that was why I had
taken off work.  He asked how much he would have to offer me to keep me there. 
I said that if he could give me ½ of the increase that I was offered I would
stay.  He said that he would soon be back to talk to me.  I went back to my
office to wait.  Morning break came and went, noon came and went, and then
afternoon break came and went.  I had given up on Roger even coming to talk to
me when he walked into my office and said “If you don’t take that job you are
the dumbest person I have ever met.”  He had been in Mr. Browning’s office
since he had left me that morning but could not give me the raise.  Two weeks
later I was on my way to Arizona.  We had decided to have Mae and the children
stay until school was out as we didn’t want to take Sandy out of school and put
her in a new school for such a short time.  That also gave Mae time to sort out
things and pack.  I stayed with Larry &amp; Tammy for that length of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Ron Shumway was one of the greatest people I
have ever worked for.  He expected a lot out of you but he also saw that you
were rewarded for the effort that you gave.  Just a couple of days, before the
day Ron was demoted, I was in Ron’s office talking over a project that I was
working on.  A phone call interrupted our visit and I sat quietly while he took
the call.  The call went something like this.  “Hello Mr. Bair.” (I believe
that was the name of Ron’s boss.)  “No, Mr. Bair, I don’t think that would be
legal”.  “Mr. Bair you can go to Hell if you think I am going to jail for do
something like that”.   And that ended the call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Work went fairly well today but I really
don’t think much work got done.  Moral is really low with everyone in the
department.  I took time and went over to American Express to check on any
openings for employment.  I didn’t find much there.  Mae had M.I.A. this
evening so I stayed home with the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, March 2, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I flew to San Francisco on
company business.  Ron Shumway also was there on company business.  This
evening Ron took me out to see the town.  We first went to Fisherman’s Warf
where we ate.  Ron then took me to a street that was very steep.  The street
dead ended and so we had to turn around.  I really didn’t think the car could
tip that far without rolling over.  Next Ron took me to North Bay Street.  We
parked the car and walked a couple of blocks.  We saw many women offering them
self for money.  We also were walking behind a couple in front of us.  The one
in a dress and the man with his arms and hands all over her.  The only problem
was that the one in the dress had a very deep base voice.  As a teenager I had
to go downtown in Ogden and pull or carry my sister Margaret out of a bar on
lower 25<sup>th</sup> Street.  This was the first time I had ever seen so much
sin and filth.  I was glad when we left and went to our hotel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, March 3, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I finished my work in San Francisco and flew
back home.  Mon and Dad had arrived at our place about mid-night last night. 
Mae and Mom came to the airport to get me about 2PM.  When we got home I took a
nap for about 1 ½ hours.  We were going to attend a session at the Temple but
Dad had miss-placed his wallet and so didn’t have a Temple Recommend.  After
some searching, Mom and Dad insisted that Mae and I go without them.   We got
to the Temple just after the last English speaking session closed.  The Brother
at the desk invited us to attend the Spanish speaking session which we did. 
That was quite an experience as we just had to watch for every clue as to where
we were in the session.  All in all it was an enjoyable experience but one that
I never want to do again</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, March 4, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I took Mom and Dad Porter and the children
to the Lehi Day Treck.  Later all of us went up to Pioneer Park for lunch and
to play shuffle board.  We then went back to the Lehi Days.  We came home for
dinner.  We then left the little ones with a baby sitter.  Mom, Dad, Sandy, Mae
and I then went back to the Lehi Days where we enjoyed a play and a dance. 
Sandy is becoming good dancer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today being Fast Sunday I was in meetings
from 6:30AM until 2PM.  Mae had a nice dinner ready for me when I got home.  in
the evening we went for a ride and stopped at Mr. Swiss for a treat.  We then
went to Ron Shumway’s to get my check.  There is a mistake in my pay check.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After I came home from work we took our
family to Pioneer Park for dinner.  We then went for a walk around the park
looking for all the things we could see that was part of Nature.  This all fit
in with our Family Home Evening lesson we had this evening.  We had a wonderful
evening and I sure feel blessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, March 7, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After dinner, I attended Bishopric meeting,
getting home about 10:30 pm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, March 8, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening Mae attended M.I.A.  Dad and I
went to the Golden Health Spa for a couple of hours.  Mom Porter took care of
the children for us.  After returning home I filled out my monthly Home
Teaching repot but was too late to turn it in tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, March 9, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I met Mae, Mom Porter and the
children at the Pioneer Park.  We had dinner there and then played shuffle
board for a while.  The little children just enjoy the park.  I think everyone
had a good time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, March 10, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I drew $20 out of the credit union this
afternoon.  This evening Mae and I took Mom and Dad out to eat at the Old
Miner’s Camp.  The Old Miner’s Camp is a restraint in Apache Junction, east of
Mesa.  They serve dinner on tin plates and metal cups on old wood tables.  It
is very rustic but a fun place to go.  We had a very enjoyable evening.  David
has a bad cold and stuffy nose this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, March 11, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I had a job interview this morning but
didn’t qualify for what they wanted.  Mae and Mom went over to the spa and then
shopping.  I didn’t feel very good so Mike and I laid down and took a nap. 
This afternoon all of us went over to The Lakes and saw the model homes there. 
This evening Dad Porter and I attended the Saturday Evening Stake Conference
session.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, March 12, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended Stake Conference this morning. 
We didn’t do much else as Mae, Mike, Davie and I all have bad colds.  Mon &amp;
Dad Porter, Sandy and I did attend Sacrament meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, March 13, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I had an interview with the 1<sup>st</sup>
National Bank of Arizona today.  It went well except I don’t know if it is
enough money.  This evening we took our dinner to the park.  After dinner we
held Family Home Evening and Sandy led us in a activity.  We finished with ice
cream for dessert.  Mae and I are still sick and it looks like Sandy is coming
down with the same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, March 14, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I stayed home from work today.  Sandy and I
are still not feeling well.  this evening I went to Bishopric meeting any way. 
It was about 11 PM when I got home.  Mae put a spice plaster on both Sandy and
I before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, March 15, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Sandy is feeling much better this morning
but I am not.  I stayed home from work and continued to doctor up.  Mom and Dad
Porter left about 11 AM to go home.  It has been nice having them here.  I
think we have all enjoyed their stay with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, March 16, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I took off work about an hour early to get
home and help Mae pack to go to Fresno California.  We flew out of the Phoenix
Airport at 8PM and Roy met us at the Fresno Airport about 9AM.  We enjoyed
visiting for a little while before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, March 17, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning we got things ready for Roy,
Steve and I to go deep sea fishing with Roy’s Elders Quorum.  We still had some
time left so Roy and Linda drove us around Fresno to show us the town.  Roy
took us to a large sub-division and as we were driving down the road, I looked
behind us and an airplane was following us.  It about shook me up and I shouted
at Roy that he must be on a runway.  He just laughed and told us that this
sub-division was built on a private air-port and the roadways were taxi ways so
the planes could taxi right to the homes.  They had hanger car ports attached
to the homes.  After seeing some of the area, Roy drove to one of his friends,
Dee McMillian.  There Linda and Mae let us off, as we will ride with Dee to
Morro Bay this evening.  Mae, Linda and all the children, except Steve, will
stay at Roy and Linda’s tonight.  Dee invited us to go for a swim in their
pool.  This afternoon Dee, Roy, Steve and I left for Morro Bay.  We got there
about 9:30PM and met up with others from their Ward.  We all slept in sleeping
bags on the beach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, March 18, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We got up about 4AM so that we could be to
the boat dock by 6:15 AM ready to board.  Someone in the group was passing out
a sea sickness pill, and because I woke with a stuffy nose, I felt it might be
wise to take a couple.  Roy and Dee thought it was nonsense and that sea
sickness was all in one’s head.  It was 7AM when the boat left the pier in
quite a windy day.  There was some that were sea sick before we even got under
way.  I believe that the boat had room for 74 fishermen aboard and we only had
71 from our group so the captain let 3 other men on.  They took their cases of
beer up to the bow of the boat and kind of kept to themselves.  The ocean was
very rough with waves that I estimated being possibly 40 feet high.  The winds
continually pushed the boat sideways.  I had to enjoy watching the three men on
the bow.  They would drink down some beer and then hang over and through it up
again.  With all the beer they consumed I doubt if any of it made it to their
blood stream. Dee and his son were soon sick.  Roy did ok until he had to use
the rest room.  When he came out of the little room he was green.  As he would
lean over the railing and heave Steve would ask, what is wrong daddy?  And then
he became sick and he would say, I don’t want to go fishing Daddy.  There was
one man that kept running around offering everyone crackers, saying that they
would help them.  However; before we got back to shore I saw him heave up
everyone he had eaten.   I believe that everyone on board, except the crew and
myself, got sea sick.  The captain said that he had never before taken a group
out in that bad of weather.  I don’t think there were very many fish caught,
though I did catch 4.  Everyone had put a dollar into the pot for the largest
fish caught during the day.  I don’t think anyone even checked that when we got
to the dock.  Everyone just wanted off the boat.  It was about 8PM when we got
back to Fresno.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, March 19, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended Priesthood and Sunday school
with Roy and Linda.  After dinner we caught the 2:30PM flight to Phoenix.  It
has been a very nice weekend.  We had Sandy tend the children while Mae and I
went out for something to eat.  Mae sure is a wonderful wife and sweetheart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, March 20, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After I returned home from work, we held our
Family Home Evening at the Pioneer park with Larry and Tammy’s family.  It was
good to be together with the two families.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, March 21, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae has been busy getting things prepared
for a M.I.A. party.  This evening I attended Bishopric meeting getting home
about 11:30PM.  When I got there Mae was waiting up for me.  She sure is a
beautiful and wonderful doll!  I sure love her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, March 22, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae had her M.I.A. party and was very
pleased with the way it went.  I stayed home and tended the children this
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, March 23, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Work went well today.  Brother and Sister
Sherman brought me some tomato plants that they had extra.  I planted them in
our garden this evening.  Mae went over to a Shakily meeting this evening.  I
stayed with the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, March 24, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae and David went to the Doctor today.  He
said that he thought that David would out grow the limp and everything looked
ok with Mae.  This evening I went Home Teaching.  After I went over to Brother
Judd’s where we took care of some church work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, March 25, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening I made a bid for a fellow to do
some remodeling for him.  He wants to convert a patio into a extra bedroom.  I
then went over to Brother Judd’s and hung 4 doors for him.  He paid me $30 for
the job.  I took Mike with me.  This evening all of went over to Larry and
Tammy’s for dinner and to visit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, March 26, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I had meetings until 12:30PM before going
home.  We met Dale and Peggy Dransfield at the park for lunch and had a very
nice time.  This evening in Sacrament meeting Mae sang with 6 other Sisters. 
Deloy &amp; Lois Porter came to our home and we played Rook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, March 27, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening we went over to Dale and Peggy
Dransfield’s for dinner and we held Family Home Evening.  We got home about
9:45PM.  It has been a very enjoyable evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, March 28, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting home from work and eating dinner,
I went up to the Church house where we met in Bishopric meeting.  It was around
10:30PM when I got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, March 29, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I helped Ron Shumway pour
concrete.  We started at 6AM and by the time we finished and I got cleaned up and
to work at Air West, I was ½ hour late.  Mae had M.I.A. this evening so I
stayed home with the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, March 30, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I stopped at and employment
service to see what is available.  When I got home Mae was defrosting the
freezer and the outside refrigerator.  I had a meeting attend this evening. 
David and Mike are both coming down with colds this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, March 31, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Sandy went to work with me today.  This
evening we let the kids color Easter Eggs.  Mae and I then went grocery
shopping.  When we got home we cooked and colored more eggs.  The boys still
have colds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 01, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After we ate breakfast, the children went
outside to fine Easter Eggs.  When they had found all the eggs and their Easter
Baskets, we all worked together in cleaning up the house and the yards.  We
then had fun making chocolate, marshmallow Easter eggs as well as other items
for Easter so that we were ready for tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, April 02, 1972 Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                          </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I had my regular Sunday meeting to attend. 
Larry, Tammy and their children attended our Wards Sunday school and Fast &amp;
Testimony meeting’s with our family.  Mae had invited them for dinner with us. 
She also invited Larry’s brother Melvin, his wife Doddy and their family for
dinner.  She had prepared a lovely dinner and then we visited and played
games.  It has been a very enjoyable day.  Mike and David were much better
today but Shellie still isn’t feeling the best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, April 03, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When I got home from work we decided to go
for a ride for F.H.E.  We stopped at an amusement called “Smash-n-Dart” and
took everyone for a ride.  Shellie was going to drive one by herself but then
became frightened so I took her on another ride.  When we got home we had 7 up
floats for refreshments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, April 04, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae did quite a lot of work in her flower
garden today.  This evening I attended Bishopric meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, April 05, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today I put a application in for employment
with Air Research. I also had an interview with Valley National Bank but they
can’t offer me enough for me to make a change.  Mae hasn’t felt very well today
but she went to M.I.A. anyway.  Larry, Tammy and I went shopping this evening
and bought the groceries for a trip we are going on tomorrow.  After returning
home I filled out the Ward’s monthly Home Teaching report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, April 06, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I left work at 1:30PM and came home.  Larry
and I changed the refrigerator in his camper.  We left on our trip about 5PM. 
We hadn’t gone far when we had trouble with the car overheating.  We stopped at
a gas station and checked the water fluid. After adding coolant to the radiator
we went on.  As it got dark we realized that we had some troubles with the
electrical connections to the trailer so we had to stop to work on that.  By
then we were all getting hungry. We found a restaurant and stopped for super. 
We then found a place where we could pull off the highway and camp for the
night.  We were about 30 miles from Tucson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, April 07, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We got up and prepared breakfast.  After
eating we again started out.  We hadn’t gone far when the car ran out of gas. 
We began to wonder if this trip was going to be worth continuing.  However, we
had made it to a trailer park where we had a fellow help us with enough gas to
get to a filling station.  We arrived at Nogales, Arizona about noon.  We were
able to find a place where we could park the trailer for the night.  We then
crossed the border into Nogales Mexico.  We did some shopping but mainly
touring.  Larry had a young boy ask if he could shine our boots for a quarter. 
Larry asked if he meant both Larry’s and my boots for a quarter.  The boy said
yes.  Feeling that it was a good deal, we let him shine our boots.  When Larry
handed the boy a quarter, he said no, a quarter each.  Larry told him that is
not what he had agreed on but the boy refused to take the quarter.  Finally
Larry told him either he took the quarter of nothing.  He finally took the
quarter but then followed us down the street, about two blocks, calling “Cheep
sons of a bitch”.  After shopping we drove into some of the housing areas. The
difference between the Mexico and the U.S. residential areas were so completely
opposite.  Where the U.S. side was beautiful homes and yards, the Mexico side was
shacks, without doors or windows and no yards except bare dirt. After a while
we returned to our camp on the U.S. side of the border.  We prepared dinner and
ate, and then we again went across the border.  About 8PM a band began to play
and couple’s began coming out from everywhere to joined in street dancing.  The
amazing thing that we noticed is that the girls were all wearing very beautiful
white dresses or white blouses.  From what we had seen of the housing earlier,
we wondered how they could get so clean or even where they could keep clothes
so beautiful.  At 10PM the band stopped and everyone went home.  It was a
special experience to be there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 08, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning we drove across the border and
then continued south.  We soon realized that if a semi-truck was coming towards
us. you pulled over to give them the right-of-way.  Several times we almost had
head on as they took the entire road.  We first went and stopped at the city
Magdalena, which from the highway just looked like a dirty Mexican town but
when we turned off the highway and went into the town was a very beautiful
community.  There was well kept stores with a well kept board walkways.  The
road way was mainly cobblestone and the area was very clean.  A wedding was just
finishing as we looked across a very clean grassy park to the Catholic
Cathedral.  The bride and groom were getting into a decorated carriage to
leave.  The whole scene was almost like out of a fairy tell.  As we walked
around town we went past a Buick Automobile dealership.  We went in and Larry
asked a salesman the price on the new car.  It was much higher than it would be
in the U.S.  When Larry asked why the salesman explained that the prices in the
border town were cheaper because most items there were manufactured in Mexico
for sale to the tourist but all items manufactured in the U.S. had to be
imported through Mexico City and then trucked back up to the northern towns
which that cost had to be add to the item.  After we left the dealership we
heard the clock on the cathedral tower strike noon.  We then noticed that all
the stores closed and everyone went to the park square, set down under a tree
and took a siesta.  We then left and drove further south.  When we to Santana
it too looked very dirty and when we drove into the town it was nothing like
Magdalena, but it was a dirty Mexican own.  We didn’t stop to look around but
got back on the highway and drove back to Nogales.  We got there about 3PM and
did some more shopping for a while.  We then went back across the border to the
trailer.  Larry and I worked on his car for while Tammy and Mae prepared
dinner.   After eating the four of us played Rook.  This had been an enjoyable
game that we had often done together.  However this time </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Larry had determined that if a person always took the bid,
whether or not he had a good hand or not, in the end he would win the game.  He
therefore would out bid any other player even if he just throw the hand in and
went back the bid.  The game lost all fun and after that trip we never played
another game together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, April 09, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We got up about 7:30AM, ate breakfast and
got ready to leave by 9:30AM.  We stopped about 30 miles north of Tucson and
fixed dinner and rested before going on.  It was about 5PM when we got home. 
We spent the rest of the evening with the kids, not making it to Sacrament
meeting.  Mom Jensen called this evening to see if it would be ok if they came
down tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, April 10, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I left work at Air West at 12:15PM in order
to pick Mom and Dad Jensen up at the airport.  I had planned on taking them
home and returning to work but on the way home the front bearing went out on
our car.  I spent the rest of the afternoon working on the car.  This evening
Mom, Dad, Mae and I were up until 11PM just visiting and playing Rook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, April 11, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today was a very busy day at work.  This
evening we had planned on taking Mom, Dad and our family to the Pioneer Park to
eat but the wind was blowing so hard that we stayed home.  After eating I went
with Larry to look at a remodel job and get things lined up to do it.  as soon
as I got back for that I went up to Bishopric meeting.  I didn’t get home until
11:20PM, very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, April 12, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I left early this morning for San Francisco,
where I was to be in a meeting at Hugh’s Air West headquarters.  When I got
there I was told that the meeting was rescheduled for this afternoon.  I was
able to take care of some other business until noon.  I went out for some lunch
and when I came back, I continued to find things to do, waiting for the
meeting.  At 2:15PM I was told that the meeting was canceled until Friday.  I
made arrangements to flight back to Phoenix on TWA.  This evening we just
relaxed and enjoyed being with Mom and Dad.  We again had a game of Rook and as
usual enjoyed having a cup of hot Postum and ginger snap cookies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, April 13, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today was a bad day at work.  Several of my
systems had problems that I spent a lot of time working on.  Mom and Dad Jensen
flight left about 11AM for Fresno.  I was so busy that I didn’t make it to
terminal to see them off.  When I got home I found out that Mae also had a very
bad day.  I decided to take her out to dinner to cheer her up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, April 14, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked late today because of problems. 
The meeting that I had been told would be scheduled for today was re-scheduled
for next Wednesday, April 19th.  I did get some good news that off set my other
problems.  My supervisor, Scott Fry, called me for performance review and a
$53.00 a month raise, retroactive to April 1<sup>st</sup>.  After work I went
to Chandler to measure and figure materials to give a Lady a bid to install two
doors for her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 15, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Ron Shumway and I work 10 hours for Bob
Willis, building an addition  to his home.  after getting home and cleaning up
I took my family out to dinner.  After eating we went to Dash &amp; Smash, it
is am entertainment center where they have bumper cars.  We all had a lot of
fun riding them. It has been a nice day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, April 16, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Ron and Audrie Shumway and their older
children planned a trip to Nogales Mexico for the day.  They asked if Mae and I
would tend their baby, Ronda which we agreed.  She is about the same age as
David.  I stayed home from Sunday school with David and Ronda, while Mae took
the rest of our family.  Ron and Audrie got back home about 5PM which left us
time to attend Sacrament meeting.  After that meeting we took the children and
Sandy tended them while Mae and I went to visit Lois and Deloy Porter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, April 17, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Ron and I worked two hours, from 5:30AM to
6:30AM on William’s home before we went into work at Air West.  We went home to
clean up and change and then Ron came by my place and we road together into
work.  On the way home this afternoon I had Ron stop so I could go into
Nationwide Finance where I paid of our loan with them.  Mae had bought material
for new drapes for our kitchen so I helped her with them.  Sandy started with
piano lessons this afternoon.  We held Family Home Evening tonight and it went
very well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I flew to San Francisco this morning on
business.  When I go to San Francisco, it takes most of the day to get there. 
I leave Phoenix before 10AM flying to Los Vegas, then to San Jose and from
there to San Francisco.  I think there also was one other stop between Las
Vegas and San Jose which might have been Fresno, I am not sure.  Anyway it
would be almost 4PM by the time I got to the office in San Francisco and the
day would be gone.  I will attend my meeting tomorrow.  I would then have to
get a hotel room for the night and find some place to eat.  Being by myself for
the evening and night is not my definition of FUN.  I sure miss Mae and my
children.  Mae got her kitchen drapes completed today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                My meeting this morning was with Norm
Odonald, (I believe that Mr. Odonald is the director of Air Cargo).  After the
meeting I met Ron Shumway back at the General Offices of Hughes Air West.  Ron
and I then caught a flight on an Air West flight leaving at 1:40PM and 
arriving at Phoenix at 5:40PM.  This evening Mike and Ed Dransfield and their
family came over to visit.  They are here in the area, visiting their son and
his wife.  Their son is in flight training, stationed at the Air force base in
Queen Creek, which is south west of Mesa.  We enjoyed the evening visiting and
remembering old time in the Farr West Stake, in Ogden.  After they left I
helped Mae clean up.  I sure love that girl and it is sure good to be loved in
return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, April 20, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Work went very well today but very busy.  I
had planned on hanging two doors for a lady in Chandler, but when I got home
and called Larry, he had forgotten to pick them up for me.  That was ok with
me, as now I could stay home with my children while Mae attended a Stake M.I.A.
meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, April 21, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I took Mae and my family to the
Airport.  They will fly to Salt Lake where Mon and Dad Porter will pick them
up.  They will then take them to Doctor Stutsnigger for a dental checkup.  They
going to enjoy the weekend with Mae’s parents.  I then went to the office and
worked the day.  This evening I went to the Temple.  Not having anyone to go
home to I stopped at the Visitor Center and enjoyed that.  The Spirit that I
felt this evening sure makes you look forward to the next life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 22, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I hung two doors for a lady in
Chandler.  I worked the rest of the day at Willie’s.  After coming home I
showered, ate some dinner and then went out Home Teaching.  I didn’t find
anyone at home so wasn’t very successful at that.  Being at home without my
family is sure a lonely place.  I sure miss them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, April 23, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I started meeting as 6:30 and
went until 12:30PM.  From there I had been invited for Sunday dinner with Dale
and Peggy Dransfield.  They were very kind to me and I enjoyed my time with
them.  After coming home I tried to call Mae at 3PM.  She had just left with
the children to attend Sacrament meeting.  I took a nap until 5PM, Day light
Saving Time when Mae called me.  We had time to visit for a few minutes before
I had to leave for our Sacrament meeting.  It was sure good to visit with her. 
Our Ward’s Sacrament meet was very good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, April 24, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I straightened the house before going to
work.  I have been very busy at work today.  After getting home from work I
started working on my Home Teaching monthly report for the Stake Presidency.  I
worked on that until 10PM when I went to the airport to get my family.  it was
sure great seeing them get off the airplane.  I sure have missed them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, April 25, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I played with Mike on the floor for a while
before Mae had dinner ready.  Mae and I went to the Church house to meet with
our Bishop for Temple recommends interviews this evening.  Following our
interviews, I went with the Bishopric to our Stake Oral Evaluation with the
Stake Presidency.  After that meeting we met together in a Bishopric meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, April 26, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening Mae went to M.I.A.  We had
Sandy tend the rest of the children while I went Home Teaching.  I got home
about 7:45PM and got the children to bed.  Mike hasn’t felt very well all day
and this evening is running a fever.  I went to the church house and picked Mae
up after M.I.A.  Mae and I stayed up late talking until after 12:30AM.  I sure
love that girl!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, April 27, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I had planned on flying to San Francisco
today but I had some problems arise at the office and had to cancel the trip.  Sandy
came home from School sick.  Later this evening Shellie also got sick.  Sandy
asked me if I would give her a Priesthood blessing so I called our neighbor,
Jerry Young to assist me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, April 28, 1972                      Mike’s 3<sup>rd</sup>
Birthday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I stopped on the way home from work and
bought Mike a new set of pajamas and a toy rifle for his Birthday.  We had
planned on taking all the family to Ledgen City for his Birthday Party but with
Sandy and Shellie being sick we stayed home and had a Birthday Party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, April 29, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked 9 ½ hours at Willies today.  When I
got home I took all my family out to Ledgen City.  It was a lot of fun but we
needed more time.  We got home about 9PM.  Richard and RaNae Barney had arrived
about 8PM.  We got the children down for bed and then Richard, RaNae, Mae and I
stayed up until after mid-night visiting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, April 30, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I attended a meeting this morning at 6:30AM
as normal on Sunday mornings.  After Sunday school, Mae had a very nice dinner
ready.  After dinner we had Sandy tend the children while Richard, RaNae, Mae
and I went for a ride to show Richard and RaNae the area.  After Sacrament
meeting all of us went up for Ice Cream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note of addition:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                One thing that I have left out of this
Diary, is very much detail of my everyday work.  I am making this insertion
here as I cannot remember or find the exact date of an important occurrence
while working at Hughes Air West.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I had indicated that shortly after coming to
work for Hughes Air West that I had been assigned to be the programmer
responsible for the Air Freight Cargo system.  I soon found that it was a very
poorly written system and was a great challenge to keep it running and in
balance.  Also, I found out that the three previous programmers, that had that responsibility,
had been terminated because of the system.  When I first found that out I went
to my supervisor, Scott Fry, and said to him, “I thought you liked me but it
looks like I am an escape goat if the system fails.”  I told Scott that getting
this assignment was like being handed a rope with thirteen loops in the knot. 
The systems main runs were on the 15<sup>th </sup>or mid-monthly and the
month-end run, at the end of the month.  Our computer had the ability to
operate two systems simultaneously, one program in foreground and the other in
background.  When the Freight Cargo system started to run, it held up the
simultaneous operation and took up the complete computer time.   The
mid-monthly run would take approximately 8 hours to run and the month-end-run would
take 16 to 24 hours to run.  90% of the time the runs would be out of balance,
in which case the programmer, in charge of the system, had to find the error or
errors, restore the files to the original information and then start the system
running over.  Probably the greatest concern, caused by this run, is that when
it ran it took up 100% of the computers time, and all other systems were on
standby until it was finished.  That meant that all flight records and
especially the flight maintenance reports were unavailable.  This was a great
concern as every plane in the fleet had exact schedules to be met and
scheduled.  In other words, the entire airline could be shut down or at least
fined for not meeting the required maintenance.  Therefore, 8 to 24 hours is
critical but to have to rerun it again is unforgivable.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                During the next few months I continued to
work with the system and often had to spend many extra hours.  I also got an
assignment to develop a tape library system that would keep track of the data
tapes that are kept with various data files on every system controlled by the
computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As I worked with the Freight Cargo system my
lead programmer and I looked at what it would take to get the system to work. 
We finally concluded that it would be easier to completely write a new system
rather than try to correct this one.  We went to Ron with our proposal but he
turned us down.  He said that he could never get it approval to rewrite a
working program, no matter how bad the system is, when he had so many other
systems yet to be written.  That ended the conversation and I just had to
continue to baby sit the Freight Cargo system </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Then somewhere around the first of April, I
got a call from Ron asking me to come to his office.  I went down and when I walked
into the office, there were several men sitting around Ron’s office.  I
recognized one of them as being the head of Air Line Planning.  The others I
don’t think I had ever seen.  As I entered, Ron just handed me an envelope.  I
looked inside of the envelope wondering if there was a pink slip in there.  It
wasn’t pink so I removed the letter and read it.  It was a letter from the
Federal Department of Airlines, if I remember right.  The letter required every
Airline in the United States to supply the total Freight Cargo Air Mileage to
that Department by a given date.  They also asked that each airline send a
representative from each Airline to a meeting in Washing DC on May 21<sup>st</sup>,
1972.  After reading the letter, I folded the letter back up and handed it back
to Ron.  He said, well?  I said well, what?  Ron then asked if we had a system
that could provide the information that was being requested.  I told him, no,
we didn’t.  Ron then asked, “Do we have a system that could be modified that
would provide the information?”  To this I said, no, we don’t.  You are
referring to the Freight Cargo system, but it will hardly operate now, not
alone asking for additional information from it.  I then added, that if we
rewrote the system we could get the information that was wanted.  The Freight
Cargo System is where the information should be retrieved from.  Ron then said
that he would give permission to do the rewrite.  He then asked how much help I
needed.  I told him that for now I only needed Jerry Hanselman, I would let him
know when I needed more help.  Ron then said, “You are it!”  I asked him what
he meant.  He said that the letter requested a representative from each airline
and said “You are that person.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, May 1, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I flew to San Francisco on business this
morning getting there at 12:30PM.  I first met with the Supervisor and her
assistant as to some changes that we will have to implement in the input to the
Freight Cargo System.  After that meeting I met with Mario Geiantery (I didn’t
record what position Mario held) and Jay Krammer, Vice President over
accounting.  We discussed the accounting procedures and needs of the Freight
Cargo system.  Our meeting lasted for three hours. I made reservations with
American Airlines and flew home this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, May 2, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening I stayed home from Bishopric
meeting to visit with Richard and RaNae Barney.  We charcoal grilled hamburgers
and ate outside.  It was a very nice evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Wednesday, May 3, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke up early and figured our bills.  When
I finished I was able to pay all the outstanding bills and had some money left
in our Banking account.  I believe that this is the first time I have been able
to do that since I left employment with Commercial Security Bank, 4 ½ years
ago.  Work went well today.  Mae and RaNae went to M.I.A. this evening. 
Richard and I stayed home and tended all the children.  I was able to work on
the car and repair the back window so that it now works properly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, May 4, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I needed to go to San Francisco
on business.  When I fly on Air West Airlines, it takes me most of the day,
because of flight connections, to get there.  I then have to stay overnight to
finish my work.  Last week I checked with other Airline’s and found that for
$16.00 (Air Line Employee cost), TWA has a nonstop flight that leaves Phoenix
about 7AM.  That would put me in our San Francisco office with plenty of time
to get my work done and instead of having to stay overnight in a hotel; I could
catch an afternoon flight on Air West and be home for the evening.  I had
presented the idea to Ron a few days ago and he approved it.  I, therefore, had
the secretary make those reservations for me.  Having flown quite a few times
since being with Air West, I have become familiar with the flight patterns. 
However, this morning, after takeoff and the plane had reached the first climb
level and the stewards had started serving breakfast, I noticed that the
stewards started picking up any empty cups and wrappers and seemed to be encouraging
everyone to finish eating.  Also the plane leveled off to a no climb position. 
Then the captain came over the speakers and asked all passengers to please help
the stewards to finish up with breakfast as quickly as possible.  This was very
unusual.  Within just a few more minutes the captain again came over the
speaker  and said, “I would like to inform you that shortly after we left the
Phoenix airport. A male person called the TWA office and said, “you had better
get the TWA Airliner that just left the Phoenix airport back on the ground, as
there is a bomb on that plane.”  The caption then continued to explain that
there was a problem as the person did not say which plane and there were three
planes that took off within five minutes of each other.  Therefore all three
planes were to land at the closest airport that could be available.  Our
destination would be the LA Airport.  That announcement caused some tension on
the plane with the passengers.  One lady that was sitting near to me exclaimed,
“Oh no, this is the third time I have done this since getting on my flight with
TWA in London.”  Anyway the plane remained at the low altitude but moved up to
normal traveling speed.  As we came closer to LA the plane did not go into the
standard flight pattern, nor did it decrease in speed until just as the plane
wheels touched the runway, then all breaking systems were applied and as soon
as the plane slowed enough to turn, the pilot pulled the plane off the runway,
completely away from any buildings or other planes.  As the plane completely
stopped a truck with stairs pulled up to the plane.  However the stairs were
pulled to the galley door and had to be backed up and brought around to the
opposite side to the front passenger side.  We were instructed not to take
anything, including personal items off the plane but were instructed, starting
with the front passengers, to move off the plane as quickly as possible.  We
were then lead to a terminal that was completely off by itself.  I noticed that
as we proceeded to the terminal that plain clothed F.B.I. persons moved into
the line as though they were regular passengers.  As we entered the terminal
they were making notes, of anyone that used a telephone or who was visiting
with someone else.  I also noticed an older coupler that had become quite
excited from the first announcement of the bomb scare.  A shuttle car came
within a few minutes and picked that couple up and took them away.  I later
found out that this couple was flying to San Francisco because they had a
grandson in a San Francisco hospital that was dying and they were trying to get
there before he passed away.  We were at that terminal for quite a while. 
Finally, person by person was called up.  We went out and identified any carry
on item that belonged to us and then we were taken to where the entire checked
luggage was stacked.  We picked up out luggage and took it to a table some
distance from anything else except an armed guard.  He then instructed us to
place one piece of luggage at a time,  put it on a table and open it up.  We
were then to remove all contents, one item at a time and let the guard examine
the item.  After all items had been removed from the luggage, the guard then
searched completely through the piece of luggage.  We then put all items back
into that piece of luggage, moved the luggage to the side and then proceed to
our next piece until all our luggage had been cleared.  We then had to wait for
everyone else to be cleared before they put us on another airplane and flew us
to San Francisco. All in all it was 4PM before I made it to the office and so I
had to spend the night in a hotel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, May 5, 1072</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I completed my work in San Francisco and
flew back to Phoenix, getting there at 4:30PM.  Mae and I went to the Temple
this evening.  After the session we just walked around the Temple and through
the Visitors Center.  We met a Brother Murdock, a night watchman, and after
visiting for a few minutes he sang some hymns for us.  He has a beautiful tenor
voice and sings very well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, May 6, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to work at Willis’s this morning. 
Mae needed the car so she took me to work.  Mae came up at 6:30PM to get me
from work.  We stopped at Larry’s and they invited us to stay and eat dinner
with them.  Mae drove home and got me a change of clothes and the children.  We
enjoyed the evening and didn’t leave for home until about 10PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, May 7, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today was a very busy day at the Bishop’s
office for me.  I did get a lot accomplished.  Larry and Tammy came over this
evening.  We visited and played a game of Rook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, May 8, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked at Willie’s this morning, starting
work at 5am.  I worked for 2 hours and then went home.  I showered and cleaned
up before going to work at Air West.  When I got home this evening we ate
dinner and then weld Family Home Evening.  That went fairly well but I think we
need to do more planning and preparation for our Family Home Evening’s.  Much
of that should be my responsibility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, May 9, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I worked at Willie’s from 5AM
to 7:30AM.  I then hurried to go into work at Hugh Air West.  I had Bishopric
meeting to attend this evening.  I got home about 11PM.  I sure have a
wonderful wife that supports and encourages me in my responsibilities.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, May 10, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to work at Willie’s at 5AM for a
couple of hours, before going into work at Air West.  At 2PM Ron Shumway and I
flew to San Francisco.  When we got there I was able to do some work.  This
evening Ron took me sightseeing.  Ron took me to a street in which I think is
the center to Hell.  It was one bar after another, all advertising nude
dancers, and prostitutes everywhere.  Ron parked the car and we got out and
walked down the street.  I noticed a couple walking with arms around each other
in front of us.  The woman was dressed in a bright, tight fitting, red dress. 
When they stopped at a street corner waiting for the light to change, we caught
up to them.  The gal had a very deep male base voice.  My mouth dropped.  I
felt very uncomfortable in that area and was glad when we left.  From there Ron
had me drive the car with him giving directions. We went up a very steep hill
that dead ended.  I had to back around and that was very scary as it felt that
the car would roll over as it turned sideways.  We then went out to eat at a
restraint on the Warf.  That was good but all in all I was glad to get back to
our hotel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, May 11, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I flew out of San Francisco at 8AM on Air
West, getting to Phoenix at 10:30AM.  Mae met me at the Phoenix Airport.  After
getting home I went to a Doctor’s office where I cut two doors of so they
cleared the carpeting that had installed.  I charged him $19.00 for the few
minutes it took me.  When I got back home I took the children shopping to buy
gifts for Mother’s Day.  Mae and I then went shopping and out to dinner.  This
evening we went to a school meeting for parents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, May 12, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I left work at noon, so Mike and I could go
camping with Larry Braithwaite and his son Lonie and Ron Shumway and his son
Tod.  We left Larry’s about 2:30PM getting to Big Lake in the White Mountains
of east Arizona.  We got there about 7PM and set up our camp sight.  We slept
out under the stars, a first for Mike.  It was on the cold side but all in all
we slept well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, May 13, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We got up about 5AM, prepared and ate
breakfast and then went fishing on the lake.  We fished there until 9:30AM and
then came back to camp.  We cleaned up our camp sight and then left for home. 
We stopped and fished several creeks on the way but didn’t catch any more
fish.  It was about 6:30PM when we got home.  We were tired but it was a good
trip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, May 14, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I went to meetings this morning and then came home and got
my family for Sunday school.  They had a good Mothers Day program for Sunday
school.  When we came back home, Sandy and I prepared dinner.  After dinner we
also cleaned up and did the dishes.  Sandy sang in the Sunday school program. 
She also had a part in the Sacrament meeting program.  Mae and I attended a
Indian meeting this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, May 15, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to work at Willis’s for two hours
before going in to work at Air West.  Work went well today.  I was relisted
from the responsibility of the Honeywell system today.  That has really been a
bad system.  Ron has been working with Honeywell and had convinced then that
the technical problems we are having with that system, was a mechanical
problem.  In reality we are quite sure that it is a programming but Ron figured
that if he convinced them that it was mechanical, that they would have to show
us that it was a program problem.  Well he just got them convinced and as they
started working on the computer, the original programmer that had been
responsible for the system saw them.  He asked the technicians what they were
doing and when they told him, he said, “Oh no! He know that it was a
programming error.”  Well! They immediately picked up and left.  I have never
seen Ron so mad at anyone before.  I don’t know who or how the problems will
get solved, but at least I don’t have to worry about it anymore.  Tonight for
Family Home Evening the entire family camped out in the back yard.  We sure had
fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, May 16, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I didn’t feel well when I got home from work
this afternoon.  I was very tired so I went to bed at 8PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, May 17, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                All of our children have came down with what
someone, I don’t remember who it was, told us that it was “Infantigo” and the
cure for it was to put Calamine lotion on each spot.  The spots looked like a
small boil that breaks and runs.  We were told to bathe each child, then apply
the lotion to each and every spot, night and morning.  What a job that turned
out to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, May 18, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae took the children into the Doctor this
morning.  After examining the children he said that the spots looked like an
insect bite.  She told him that we had slept outside Monday evening as a
family, but that neither she nor I had any bites.  The only explanation was
that the children slept on the ground in a blanket bed and Mae and I had slept
on our mattress.  But he was sure that the spots would clear up in a couple of
days.  This evening Sandy had a music concert at school.  I stayed home with
Shellie, Mike and David while Mae went with Sandy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening Mae and I went to the Temple. 
We enjoyed a very nice session and after we left the Temple, we took Brother
and Sister Rowley with us to get ice cream cones.  Mae and I were up quite late
just talking.  Mae is a very special wife and sweetheart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, May 20, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked at Willie’s today, putting in 10 ½
hours.  When I got home, I took all my family to a Drive-in movie.  It was a
fair show and we all enjoyed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, May 21, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I attended Priesthood meeting
but then I got such a bad headache that I went home and went to sleep.  We
attended Sacrament meeting as a family and then I stayed for a Ward Finance
meeting.  Our Ward is behind in bills some 8 to 9 thousand dollars.  When I got
home I helped Mae pack for a trip to Washing DC.  I have a business meeting to
attend there Tuesday morning as a reprehensive for Hugh Air West Airline.  I
had made arrangement through Ron Shumway to take Mae with me.  We had to pay
her Airline ticket, but as an Airline employee, that was only $16.00; and Mae’s
meals.  The rest of the trip was on my expenses account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, May 22, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae had made arrangements with Marilyn Allen
to tend our children.  We took them to her home at 7:30 AM.  We then left for
the Airport.  We parked the car at my office and took a shuttle to the
terminal.  I had a little trouble getting tickets for Mae as the secretary at
the office had misunderstood that I was taking my wife with me.  We had a
wonderful flight to Washing DC.  It was such an enjoyable trip to have Mae with
me.  Before I had left the office Friday, Ron had told me that I needed to be
very careful while in Washington.  He said that during the day time we would be
ok to use the public transportation but during the evening hours until mid-night
that if we needed to go somewhere we were to take a taxi.  He told me that
after midnight we were to remain in our hotel room.  I thought he was getting a
little eccentric about it and didn’t really worry about it.  Anyway, we arrived
at DC at 5:30PM.  We took a taxi from the Airport to the Sheraton Hotel in
downtown Washington DC.  We enjoyed walking around the Hotel.  The interior
design and architectural indicated that it was a very old building.  While we
were downstairs looking at the building I decided to find out where the address
was that I need to go for the meeting tomorrow.  I asked the lady at the
registry desk and she said, “You are not going to leave the hotel tonight”.  I
told her that I wasn’t but just needed to know where the address was.  She
again said, “You are not going to leave the hotel tonight”.  Again I assured
her that I wasn’t going out tonight but that I needed to be at that address
tomorrow at 9AM.  With that assurance and a promise that I would not leave the
Hotel until morning, she told me what bus I could get on, just out front of the
hotel and it would take me 5 or 6 blocks to that address. I began to think more
seriously about Ron’s advice.  Anyway, we had a wonderful evening.  It is great
being with Mae.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, May 23, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We had breakfast in the hotel dining room
and then I caught the city bus out front of the hotel.  It let me off just
across the street from the building that the meeting was to be held.  When I
got there several other people were starting to gather.  At first we were just
gathering in a lobby but finally they took us into a large conference room. 
There was quite a few as every Air Line in the U.S. was to have a
representative at the meeting.  By the time we got settled and the ones from
the US Aviation Commission got there it was 9AM so they had us take a coffee
break.  They supplied coffee or orange juice and sweet rolls for everyone. 
Well it was almost 9:30AM before the meeting got started.  Those in charge were
vague as to what was to be reported.  They seemed unorganized as to who was to
give us direction and after stumbling around they finally opened it up to
questions.  Again they really didn’t have any concrete answers to the questions
that were presented until everyone quit asking questions.  One of the men
finally asked if anyone else had a question for them.  No one raised a hand so
I finally raised my hand.  When I was recognized I bluntly said, you haven’t
been able to answer anyone’s questions yet so why should we ask any more?  They
admitted that they weren’t very well prepared for the meeting.  They assured us
that if we would all give them an address and a phone number where we could be
contacted, they would get more information to us shortly.  The meeting was then
dismissed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was back to the hotel before noon.  I
found Mae in the back garden reading and preparing for her talk for Sacrament
Meeting on Sunday.  We got a quick lunch and then went down town Washington
D.C. sightseeing.  We had picked up a tourist guide pamphlet at the hotel.  We
took the bus to the White House, which wasn’t open to tourist.  We walked the
outside of the fence and then down the block.  We continued down the street
where we saw a art museum that was open.  We went inside and looked around at
various arts on display.  The main thing I remembered about the museum was a
large room that was empty except one large picture that took most of a wall. 
The picture was framed, all white background with one red spot, about the size
of a baseball in the center of the picture.  There was nothing else on the
painting or in the room.  From there we walked to the Lincoln Memorial, which
we found very impressive and spent some time there. To stand at the entrance of
the Memorial and look east, you see the Capital Building at the far end.  About
half way between the Lincoln Memorial and the Capital Building stands the
Washington Monument. The landscape in that area is mainly beautiful well kept
lawn with gardens and water ponds.  The Washington Monument was constructed in 1848
to commerate the first American President, General George Washington. It is 555
ft tall.  There is an elevator that will take you to the top on the monument
where you can look out to see over the city.  At that time they would let you
ether ride the elevator back down or you could walk down the stairs.  I
convinced Mae that we should walk down the stairs, just to be able to say that
we did.  After all it was all down so that would be simple.  Well I don’t know
how many stairs there are but by the time we got to the bottom, we were tired. 
From there we walked south east to the Smithsonian Institute.  By the time we
got there it was 4:45PM.  We just got inside the front door when they announced
that closing time was 5PM so please exit the building.  We then walked to the
Capital Building but it too was now all locked up.  After walking around the
building we went to a bus stop on the north side.  There we waited for quite a
while for a bus.  I finally decided to see if we could find a pay phone.  Just
then we saw a bus approaching and we were happy as it was getting late.  When
we got on and found that this bus would take us to our hotel, we set behind the
driver.  The bus stopped at several more stops where people got on the bus with
none getting off.  After a while, as the bus was about filled, Mae whispered to
me, do you realize that besides the driver, you and I are the only white people
on this bus.  I told her that I had noticed that.  When we finally got to our
stop for our hotel, we were across the street from the hotel.  Also, there were
many people standing in groups around barrels with fires in them to give off
warmth.  When the bus stopped I took Mae by the hand and we ran across the
street and into the hotel.  It was a relief to feel safe.  We sure enjoyed the
experiences of the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, May 24, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We had to get up early this morning and get
checked out.  We took a taxi to the Airport where our flight left at 7:45AM. 
We arrived at Phoenix Arizona at 10:30AM.  We took the shuttle over to the
office.  Mae took the car home where she spent the rest of the day preparing
for a Laurel Bride Night to be held this evening.  Ron gave me a ride home
after work.  I stayed home this evening with the children.  Mae was at the
activity until quite late.  She told me that the evening went very well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, May 25, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting home from work, Mae had dinner
ready.  She then had a meeting to attend at the Ward Library.  I took the
children with me to Checker Auto Parts where I bought some oil and grease for
the car. We then stopped for everyone to have some ice cream.  When Mae got
home, she and I went for a walk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, May 26, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work we took our family to the park
where Tammy had invited other friends and their families for a Birthday party
for Larry.  We had a good time.  This evening Mae went to a M.I.A. Young
Wemon’s slumber party.  I took care of our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, May 27, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked at Willis’s 7 ½ hours today.  I
came home and ate dinner and then showered and changed clothes and went to a
Stake Conference Leadership meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, May 28, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended a very enjoyable Stake
Conference this morning.  Elder Joseph Anderson, an assistant to the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles was our visiting authority.  Mae sang in the Stake Choir. 
Mike had an ear ache this afternoon so Sandi stayed home and tended him while
the rest of us attended Sacrament meeting this evening.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, May 29, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked at Wilis’s for a while and then
came home and changed the oil and greased our car.  At 5:30PM we went over to
Larry and Tammy’s.  We ate dinner, visited and played Rook.  Our children all
seem to enjoy playing to gather.  We got home about 11PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, May 30, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It was a busy day at work today.  I had to
get ready to go to San Francisco in the morning.  I came home from work and ate
dinner.  I then went Home Teaching before going to Bishopric meeting.  It was
mid-night before I got back home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, May 31, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We went into the Phoenix Airport to meet the
flight from Salt Lake this morning.  Mom Porter arrived on the 5AM flight.  She
came because Tommy Bushnell, the son of Van and Allison Bushnell died Monday
morning after a long fight with Leukemia.  I also flew to San Francisco this
morning to have meetings about the Freight Cargo System.  I believe the
meetings were very beneficial.  I didn’t get home until 7PM.  Mae had M.I.A. to
attend this evening.  Mom Porter went with Uncle Van and Aunt Allison to Jeff
Bushnell’s High School Graduation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, June 1, 1972 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The school year ended today for Sandy.  She
was able to tend our children for us as Mae and I attended the Viewing and
Funeral Services for Tommy Bushnell.  The services were well attended with many
members of the ward, friends and family of Uncle Van and Aunt Allison.  The
services were also very appropriate for such a brave little boy.  Mae and I
attended classes of the Church Education Week, this afternoon and evening.  We
really enjoyed the classes we attended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Friday, June 2, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                First thing this morning I went thru all the
water taps in the house and ether replaced washers or replaced the complete
water tap.  This water here has so much mineral and chemicals in it that it is
very hard on plumbing.  Mae and I then attended Education Week classes the rest
of the day.  The classes were so excellent and educational.  We were very
impressed with all we learned.  The only problem I had was the realization of
my human weaknesses.  I guess that is why we were sent here to this earth, that
we might learn and develop Faith in Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, June 3, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I feel that I have had some success with my
Goals for today, but still have plenty of room for improvement.  I built some
shelves in the boy’s bedroom closet, before Mae and I left to attend more
Education Week classes.  Again the classes were very enjoyable and gave me many
more good ideas.  The cost and the time were sure well worth it, for all we
have been taught.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, June 4, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I tried making a written plan of my day,
when I got up this morning.  We were taught this in the classes that we took in
Education Week.  I felt like it really did help.  Rhis evening Deloy and Lois
Porer came over to visit and play some games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, June 5, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I got up early this morning and went to work
for Ken Groscost, he had talked with me a few days ago about helping him on the
house is going to build.  I told him that I would be glad to help him at home
for no charge, but if I went on to the job sight I felt that I would have to
charge him $10.00 per hour.  He said that he had another person that said that
he would only charge him $5.00 per hour.  I told him that it was fine with me
if the other person helped him, but to take the time away from my family, I
just felt that my time should be worth the $10.00 per hour.  I spent two hours
this morning with my Transit, helping him lay out the corners where the
footings were to be dug.  I explained that he could now run a string from stake
to stake and then he should drive a stake about every 8 to 10 feet along the
string for the backhoe driver to follow.  I gave him the corner elevations and
told him that by using a straight 2 X 4 with a level on it he could drive each
stake along the string level.  He was concerned at the amount of time I was
spending there this morning at $10.00 per hour.  He felt that he could follow
my instructions for there, so I left. I went home to change and then into
work.  When I got home Mae had a very nice dinner ready for us.  We then held Family
Home Evening and Mae had the lesson prepared.  I was quite tired so went to bed
early.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, June 6, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I flew to San Francisco this morning on
business and didn’t get home until 7:30PM.  I stopped at home just long enough
to say Hi to my family and then went right up to the Bishops office, not
getting home until 11PM.  David didn’t sleep very well last night.  We are not
sure why but Mae and I were up several times during the night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, June 7, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I got my Home Teaching report turned in this
morning before I went to work.  Mae had M.I.A. this evening so I stayed home
with the children.  I read a Bible story to the children and then put the
little ones to bed.  Sandy and I played a game of Jacks before she went to
bed.  I then read until Mae came home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, June 8, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting home from work and eating
dinner Mae and I went grocery shopping.  I then attended a special meeting at
which all Priesthood holders were invited to attend.  The meeting was called to
discuss our Ward’s finance situation, which isn’t very good.  The Bishopric
recommended that we hold a special Dinner for all the adults in the Ward to
attend and suggested that a donation of $100.00 per plate be given.  All in
attendance supported the Bishopric recommendation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, June 9, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I didn’t feel that I had accomplished very
many of my goals today.  This evening Mae and I went over to Larry and Tammy’s
just to visit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, June 10, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After breakfast I installed a new muffler
and tail pipe on our car.  I had just finished when I got a phone call from our
Ward Elder’s Quorum President asking me if I could drive a pickup car to
Anaheim California, to pickup several Brothers in our Ward that are driving
Rental car to California for Avis Car Rental.  The Elder’s are doing this as a
fund raiser for the Quorum.  I told him that I would have to quickly clean up
and then I could leave.  He told me that the others had already left in the
rental cars and he also told me where to go to pick up a station wagon from
Avis.  When I got to Avis Car Rental, they had a new 1972 Plymouth Station
Wagon all ready to go.  I was told that some of the drivers had left as early
as 12:15 PM.  I figured that the others had at least an hour head start on me
so I hurried.  That car could go.  In as much as I have never been to
California I just followed the directions that Avis had given me.  I am not
sure where or when I passed the other drivers but when I got to Anaheim I
passed the address and had to go around the block.  Two cars pulled into the
lot just ahead of me and the rest soon arrived. After checking the cars in at
the Avis dealer, all the drivers got into the car with me.  We left Anaheim in
the late evening.  I drove while the rest went to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, June 11, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I didn’t drive quite so fast on the return
trip home.  We got to the Mesa Avis Rental at 4AM.  I started with Bishopric
meeting at 7:30 AM.  The Stake Presidency called for a special meeting at 730
PM at which time the Lehi 1<sup>st</sup> Ward and the Lehi 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward
were divided making a Lehi 3<sup>rd</sup> Ward.  Carl Ries was called as Bishop
of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Ward with Delbert Opie as 1<sup>st</sup> Counselor,
Brother Tryon as 2<sup>nd</sup> Counselor, Brother Shield was called as the
Ward Clerk and I was called as Executive Secretary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I did not record the night that I was
interviewed by the Stake President so I will add the event here. We were told
last Sunday that there were plans to divide our Ward.  I was asked to meet with
the Stake President; I believe it was last Tuesday evening.  When I was invited
into the Stake Presidents office, not only was the Stake President there but
Carl Ries was also there.  Carl has been our 70’s Quorum President in the Lehi
2<sup>nd</sup> Ward.  After being invited to set down, the Stake President
informed me that on Sunday a new Ward would be formed.  He said that Carl Ries
has been called to serve as Bishop of the new Ward.  He then asked me if I
could sustain Carl in that calling.  I told him that I could.  He then said
that Bishop Ries had requested that I serve as his Executive Secretary and
asked if I could except that calling.  I told him that I would.  He then turned
to Carl Ries and asked him if he had any requests of his new Executive
Secretary, to which Bishop Ries said:  “I want you to keep that note book”.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When I had been called to serve as Executive
Secretary in the Lehi 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward, I soon found out that I really
didn’t have anything to do, unless the Bishop gave me an assignment.  We would
hold our leadership meetings each Sunday.  After a few minutes of comments and
assignments by the Bishop, the time would be turned over to one of the
organizational leader for their input.  Each organization would take their turn
for any comments.  That process would continue around the room until it would
reach me. Usually the Bishop would fall asleep within the first couple of
reports and the First Counselor would finish the meeting.  Some assignments
might be given but most of the time there was never any follow up reported. 
When it got to be my turn, I had not been given an assignment, therefore, I had
nothing to report.  Prayer would be given and the meeting adjourned for that
week.  After the third such meeting I decided that I should be doing something,
so for the next meeting I carried a note book with me.  I would enter the name
of the meeting and the date.  I would then make an entry for each assignment
that was made.  The next week when it came my turn I read the assignment, the
date made, and to whom the assignment was given.  The first time I did this, I
read that last week the High Priests were assigned to visit a certain family
and then asked if that assignment had been completed.  The High Priest Group
leader reported that he had forgotten and didn’t make the visit.  I then read
that the Elders Quorum president had been assigned to visit a new Family that
had moved into our Ward.  He reported that he had gone by but did not make
contact as the family was away.  I said that was all I had to report and the
meeting was closed and we adjourned.  The next week when it was my turn I again
brought up the assignments from the two previous weeks.  When I asked the High
Group Leader about the assignment he had been given two weeks ago and hadn’t
completed last week, he turned to the Elders Quorum President and asked if he
had a pencil and paper so he could make a note, as that guy really expects us
to do those assignments.  That type of report continued until the assignment
had been completed or the Bishopric canceled the assignment.  We had one
assignment that was given to the Relief Society President that remained on the
book for over a year.  It was not necessarily her fault but never-the-less it
had not been completed, so it remained in the book and was asked for a report
each week.  It got so that prior to the start of the meeting, the Relief
Society President would speak to me privately and report that it had not been
completed, so please don’t read it in the meeting today.  When it finally did
get completed she was so happy to report that the assignment had been completed. 
It was surprising what that type of reporting did for our Ward.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, June 12, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening we held Family Home Evening. 
After getting the children down for the night, Mae packed clothes for her and
the children to go to Utah tomorrow.  I got a call from work and had to go in
to solve a problem.  By the time I got back home, it was almost mid-night
before we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, June 13, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I took Mae and the children into the Phoenix
Airport so they could catch the 7AM flight to Salt Lake.  I went from there to
the office.  Work got hectic today and as the day went on things got worse.  I
felt that Satan was right with me.  This evening I attended the Mesa Temple
that I might rid myself of the feelings that I have felt today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, June 14, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I went to a Mrs. Bell and gave
her a bid on some work she would like me to do for her this Saturday.  I then
went up to the church house and worked on membership records and other
supplies.  I didn’t get home until mid-night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, June 15, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Ron Shumway and I did some work for Larry
this morning from 5AM until 9AM.  We then went to work at Hugh’s Air West. 
After getting home this afternoon I laid down for a nap and slept until
8:45PM.  I went up to the church and worked on records until 11:30PM.  I really
don’t like being home alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, June 16, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Before going to work this morning I gave Mae
a call to see how they are doing and too let her know how much I missed her and
the children.  I had some problems at work today and didn’t get off work until
after 5:30PM.  I was still able to get to the Temple.  Our Ward attended as a
Temple Day.  Following the Temple attendance several of our ward went to the
Brother and Sister Opie’s for dinner.  I attended and enjoyed it but missed not
having Mae with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, June 17, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was able to get the job done for Mrs. Bell
this morning.  I made $49.00 after expenses so that will help.  I then went
home and cleaned up the house before flying up to Utah.   Mae, Bob, Carroll,
Irven and Sandy met me at the Salt Lake Airport.  We then went out to a Chinese
Restraint for dinner and a good visit.  It was almost 1:30AM before we got back
to Mom and Dad Porters and got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, June 18, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended Priesthood meeting and Sunday
school with Mom and Dad Porter this morning.  Mom Porter had a very nice dinner
when we got home from Sunday school.  Bryce and Deanna and Jean came out for
dinner also.  This evening we attended Sacrament meeting at the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup>
Ward.  It was sure good to see so many of those we grow to love while we lived
here.  This evening Irven, Sandy, Mae and I went over to Bryce and Deanna’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, June 19, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae and I left for Salt Lake at 7AM.  Mom P.
agreed to tend our children for us.  I had an appointment with Dr. Stutsnigger
to have my teeth checked.  After that we went to the Salt Lake Temple and
attended a session there.  We went through the Visitors Center while we were
there.  We then went out to eat at Harmon’s on North Temple.  We have many
memories of that restraint when we were dating but it is not as nice as it was
then.  This afternoon I went over and visited with Bob and Carroll.  They are
much happier now they have moved back up to Utah.  At 9:20PM I with all my family
flew back to Phoenix together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, June 20, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After I got home from work, we took all the
family swimming.  I then went up to the office at the church and worked on
supplies.  Mae spent the evening getting things ready for Shellie’s Birthday
Party tomorrow.  We were late getting to bed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, June 21, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae had a nice Birthday Party for Shellie
today and Shellie seemed to have a very fun day.  It rained this evening so we
didn’t go swimming as we had planned.  Mae received a call to be 2<sup>nd</sup>
counselor in the Ward Primary Presidency this evening.  I am not sure why but
for some reason I feel just a little funny about that calling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, June 22, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The rain continued all night and through the
morning.  It has caused a lot of flooding in the area. The rain stopped this
afternoon and it turned off quite nice.  After I got home from work we all went
swimming.  I went Home Teaching after eating dinner.  When I got home Mae and I
went for a ride.  Mae sure is a wonderful wife and sweetheart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, June 23, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When I got home from work we took our family
swimming again.  Larry and Tamy and their family also joined us.  Mae had
bought a family summer pass to the swimming pool at the Junior High School that
is not very far from us.  It sure makes it nice to be able to use it whenever
we like. Larry and Tammy’s family also joined us at the pool.  After swimming
we all went to Larry and Tammy’s for dinner.  We stayed late mainly just
visiting and the children playing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, June 24, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked at Willis’s today installing
cabinets.  We attended the Ward Banquet this evening.  The dinner raised about
$7,500 for the budget and operating fund.  After getting the children down we
left Sandy to tend them while Mae and I went over to visit the Porters.  We are
enjoying our relationship with DeLoy and Lois.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, June 25, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Because we were in Utah last Sunday, this
morning is the first time we met as the Lehi 3<sup>rd</sup> Ward.  Meeting went
very well and it is sure surprising how many new faces there are out to
meetings.  One can sure see the need to divide the Wards when they get large. 
The division gives so many more opportunity’s to participate in the program. 
We are looking at a small economy car to purchase.  This evening we drove it
over to visit with Uncle Van and Aunt Allison and their family for a little
while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  Monday, June 26, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Work went fairly well today but I was sure
tired when I got home.  I stopped and looked at a couple of used cars on the
way home.  Mae sure had a nice dinner prepared when I got home.  We enjoyed a
nice Family Home Evening after eating and cleaning up the dishes.  We spent the
rest of the evening just playing with our children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, June 27, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting home from work, I took some
Shakly vitamins over to Larry.  He has been sick for a while and we hope these
will help him get to feeling better.  I also started taking them myself as I
don’t want to catch whatever is going around.  This evening I was set apart as
Executive Secretary by Bishop by Bishop Ries.  I then spent some time at the
Bishops helping get things organized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, June 28, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I left work a little early this afternoon so
I could stop and pickup some parts for the car.  When I got home we all went
swimming.  We had to come home in time for Mae to attend M.I.A.  I worked on
the car getting it running pretty well.  I mainly changed the plugs and points.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, June 29, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work this evening I tended the
children as Mae went up to the church to help put make up on the youth for a
Road Show.  When she finished with that she attended a Primary Leadership
meeting.  I changed the oil and filter in the car.  I also wrote Mom and Dad
Jensen a letter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, June 30, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After I got home from work this evening, Mae
and I went to the Temple.  When we got home from there, I figured our budget. 
It really doesn’t look very good but somehow we will get through this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, July 1, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning the DeLoy Porter family invited
us to go with them tubing down the Salt River.  This is a great sport with many
in this area.  We saw several that were diving off high cliffs into the water
below.  Many groups would tie their tubs together and have a party as they
floated.  Often there would be coolers tied into the center of the groups
filled with everything from pop to beer and liquor.  We had a very enjoyable
time but we did come home with some Arizona sub burn.  After getting home I
went back into work for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, July 2, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I started early with Bishopric meeting and
with other meetings and working in the office, I was at the Church all
morning.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home and after dinner we put the
children down for a nap and then Mae and I joined them.  This evening Larry and
Tammy stopped in for a visit.  Before going to sleep this evening Mae and I
visited with each other quite late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, July 3, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After I got home from work and we had
dinner, we then enjoyed a nice Family Home evening.  Mae and I set up and read
for a little while.  We then drove over to Kent Marsden’s and paid him $235.00
for a 1965 Ford Taunus.  (It is interesting that neither Mae nor I remember
this car.)  On the way back home we stopped at a post office and bought some
stamps and then at a store for milk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, July 4, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We took all our family to the church at 6AM
for a Flag Raising ceremony followed by a breakfast.  I had some work that I
needed to do at my office so after eating I went into work.  Sandy wanted to go
with me so I took her.  I showed her around the computer area and the offices,
then we also went into the aircraft maintenance area.  This evening when I went
to bed I wasn’t feeling the best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, July 5, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I woke at 4AM quite sick.  I stayed home and
slept most of the day.  This evening we did take our family to see the Road
Shows, held in the Recreation Hall at our Ward building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, July 6, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked late today and when I got home Mae
and the children had gone up to the church house to watch and enjoy the Road
Shows.  When she got home and we got the children down to sleep, she and I sat
and talked for a while.  I then went up to the church office and did some work
on Home teaching.  It was almost mid-night when I got home.  Mae and I again set
up and talked for about another hour before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, July 7, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting home from work and having
dinner, I worked outside and repaired the lawnmower.  This evening Mae and I
vacuumed and shampooed the carpet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, July 8, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I got out and mowed the lawns while Mae
prepared breakfast.  We then took the children tubbing down the Salt River. 
After returning home I tended the little children while Mae and Sandy went
shopping.  This evening Mae and I went out to eat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, July 9, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I spent most of the day at the office at
Church.  This evening Mae and I went over to the Porter’s where we played Rook
with DeLoy and Lois.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, July 10, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When I got home from work this evening Mae
had a nice dinner ready.  We then took our family and went to the Arizona State
University Experimental Farm.  It is just south of our place to Baseline Drive
and then West into Tempe a couple of blocks to the farm.  Uncle Van was the one
that told us of the farm.  It was a very enjoyable experience for all of us. 
We stopped on the way home and bought everyone ice cream.  After getting home,
Ken Groscost called and came over to visit with me.  They are going to build
themselves a new home east of Mesa.  He had some questions and also wanted to
know if he needed some help building the home if I would be willing to help.  I
told him I could help with plans and advice at home almost any time, and I
could do some evening and Saturday work.  He asked what I would charge for that
help.  I told him that work at home I would not charge him anything, but I felt
that I would need to get paid for time away from my family and for that time I
would charge $10 an hour.  He hesitated and then said that he had another
fellow that would help for $5 an hour.  I told him that it was fine to have the
other fellow help him but I felt that my time from my family should be worth
the $10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, July 11, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked 2 hours this morning for Ken before
going to work at Air West and then another 2 hours this evening.  Using my
transit, we got his house laid out on his property.  I also told him how to
stake the footing lay out for the backhoe operator to dig the footings and then
how to set the grade stakes to know the elevation of the concrete when he poured
the footings.  David has quite a bad cold today and Mae also isn’t feeling very
well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, July 12, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae had MIA this evening so we had Sandy
tend the children and I took Mae to the church.  I stayed at the office and
took care of some paper work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, July 13, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After dinner this evening all our family
went over to Jerry Hanselman’s.  Jerry had invited us over to watch some of his
movies.  It was a very enjoyable evening and Jerry is a great host.  He had pop
corn and ice cream refreshments.  The children really enjoyed being with him.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, July 14, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I got some of our camping gear packed in the
car this morning before going to work.  I caught a ride with Ron Shumway to
work.  Mae finished packing the car and the children and met me after work.  We
left from there to go camping at Oak Canyon.  Someone at work had suggested
that Oak Canyon was a good camping area.  It was a lot greater distant to
travel than I had thought, plus in the Arizona heat and a station wagon without
air-conditioning, along with three tired, hot children it seemed forever.  When
we got to the canyon we found that everyone else had got there ahead of us.  We
traveled from the bottom entrance on the South to the upper exit on the North
without finding even enough room to pull a car off the road even if it were an
emergency and we were in a long line of traffic going both ways that we also
looking for some place to stop.  It was mid-night by the time we got to the
south side of Flagstaff.  We turned South on the freeway going back to Phoenix
where we found a rest area.  Mae and the kids slept in the station wagon and I
slept on a sleeping bag beside the car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, July 15, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We woke early and to a beautiful morning. 
We prepared a nice breakfast using the tailgate of the station wagon for a
table.  After eating we tried to find a stream to go fishing.  We ended up back
at Oak Canyon but just drove through the canyon and then on home. The canyon
was still packed.  This evening Mae and I attended a High Priest social.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, July 16, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was busy at the Church most of the day. 
This evening, Mae and I took our children and went up to the park to relax and
let the children run and play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, July 17, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was called into work early due to some
problems with the Freight Cargo system.  Later this afternoon more problem
arose with the system and I ended up working until 10PM.  The Freight Cargo
System is a very poorly designed system and I have recommended that it needs to
be totally rewritten. Ron just tells me that there are so many systems that are
waiting to be written that he cannot allot any time to rewrite a system that is
working, no matter how badly it works.  Mae and the children had to have Family
Home Evening without me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, July 16, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to work for Larry right after I
finished at Airwest.  We worked until after midnight.  When I got home I found
out that there was some problems at Airwest so I went back in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, July 19, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening Mae went to M.I.A. and I went
to Bishopric meeting.  The M.I.A. had a water fight as a closing social.  As a
Bishopric we went over to see how the social was going.  We ended up getting
involved with the social and got wet also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, July 20, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I flew to San Francisco this morning for a
business meeting.  I got back home about 7pm.  I felt that I had accomplished
quite a bit while at the head quarters today, but was sure tired when I got
home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, July 21, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I slept in and went into work a couple of
hours late.  When I got home this evening, Mae and I went grocery shopping. 
Brother and Sister Allen brought their children over this evening.  Mae is
going to tend their children for a couple of days, while they take a week end
trip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, July 22, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to work for Larry this morning and
worked late getting home about 5PM.  Mae has had quite a busy day with the
addition of the Allen’s children.  We watched TV this evening.  Althouge Mae
was tired she sure is a wonderful wife and sweetheart to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, July 23, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was up to the Church most of the day but
only attended the opening of Priesthood.  The rest of the time I was in the
office working on records.  I came home for dinner and stayed this evening with
the children so that Mae and Sandy could attend Sacrament meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, July 24, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae went shopping for school clothes today. 
She also looked for a Colman camp stove.  Ron Shumway and I worked for Larry
this evening.  Mae took Shellie into the Doctor. She may have a bladder
infection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, July 25, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went Home Teaching this evening.  I then
went up to the Bishops office where I joined the Bishopric in an Oral
Evaluation with the Stake President.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, July 26, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I took off work at Air West so that I could
pick up some materials to build a case that would hold all our camping
equipment.  This evening I attended Bishopric’s meeting.  I worked on the
camping case after getting home and worked on it until after mid-night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, July 27, 1972 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work Ron and I went out a job for
Larry.  We worked for 5 hours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, July 28, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening after getting home from work
and having dinner, Larry and Tammy invited us to go to a movie with them.  We
saw the show, “What’s up Doc”.  We really enjoyed the show and evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, July 29, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Ron, Larry and I went to work, for Larry, at
5am and worked until 12:30 pm.  When I got home, being quite tired, I lay down
for a nap for a couple of hours.  When I woke up I worked on the camping case
until mid-night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, July 30, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We weren’t quite so busy at church today. 
Georgia arrived here at 9:30AM and will stay with us for about 10 days.  We are
excited to have her come and visit with us.  This evening Georgia went to a
Young Adult Fireside.  We had also invited DeLoy and Lois Porter to come over
and play Rook with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, July 31, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting home for work and having
dinner, I went to work for Larry for a couple of hours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, August 1, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Before going into work this morning I worked
1 ½ hours for Larry.  This evening I went up to the church for a while.  Mae
sure is a wonderful in her support in the things I do.  I am concerned that I
am not spending enough time with her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, August 2, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went into work early this morning.  After
work I went up to Lynn Johnson for a treatment.  <i>I don’t remember how Mae
became acquainted with Lynn but he reads your eyes and worked on your feet. 
The one problem I find in him is he starts talking and his hands stop working,
but the clock doesn’t stop.</i>  (This next entrance I do not understand what I
meant when I wrote this next sentence.)  Mae hurt her back while tubing on the
river today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, August 3, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went into work early this morning.  Scott
Fry had me come into his office before I left for the day.  He gave me a work
evaluation and said that they were very pleased with my work and he had been
given permission to advance me to a Senior Programmer and of course it also
means an increase in salary. I worked for Larry for a while this evening.  Mae,
Georgia and the children went to “The Big Surf” in Phoenix today and had a good
time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, August 4, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I stayed home this evening and it seems very
good.  I worked for a while on my camping box.  Hal and Mollie Ashcroft stopped
by, just to visit.  It was good to visit with them again.  Mae and I stayed up
and just visited for a while after getting everyone else to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, August 5, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went into work for a little while this
morning, as I wanted to get some computer time for some programming testing.  I
took Shellie with me, as she wanted to be with her Dad and see where I worked. 
After returning home, I went to the European Health Spa, where I joined the
program.  I am getting a little over weight and with my job I get very little
work out.  I set at a desk most of the time.  This evening Mae, Georgia and I
went out to eat dinner.  After dinner, Bob Burk joined us at a drive in movie. 
We had been there very long when it started raining hard.  We finally gave up
on the show and came home where we played Rook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, August 6, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It was a long day at church today.  I
started at 6am and didn’t get home until 6pm.  This evening Mae and I went to a
neighborhood surprise wedding reception party for Donna and Mike (I didn’t put
the sir name in).  It was a swimming party at a privet pool.  This is the first
time I have every gone swimming on Sunday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, August 7, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After dinner, for Family Home Evening, we
took all our family to the movies.  It was a double feature, “Bed Knobs and
Broom Sticks” and “In Search of the Castaways”.  We were late getting home and
after min-night getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, August 8, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went into work early this morning and so
left a little early this afternoon.  I went to the Health Spaw and worked out. 
That sure felt good.  Mae and my children went with Tammy and her children to
Cannon Lake, swimming today.  They all had fun but all of them came home with
sun burns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Wednesday, August 9, 1972</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went into work this morning at 4AM so that
I could get some test time on the computer.  It was 3:30PM when I returned
home.  Having a little time I worked on the camping box that I am making.  I
was able to get it finished.  This box is made out of 1/4<sup>th</sup> inch
plywood with compartments just the size to hold each of our major camping

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to work again at 3:30AM but this time
I came home at 10:30AM.  I stopped at the Hugh Air West ticket office and
shipped our camping box to myself at the Idaho Falls ticket office.  As an
employee of the airline I can ship from one terminal to another terminal a
package that weights less than 100 lb., free of charge.  The camping equipment
box that I built, when completely packed weight 99LB.   I slept for a couple of
hours and then went into the Health Spa where I worked out for.  Mae and I
spent the evening packing for our family to go on a vacation.  I did take time
to visit a couple of my assigned Home Teaching Families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
breakfast Mom drove my family to the Teton Valley where we went to the Lone
Stare campground.  We set up our tent and camp.  Mom and I then went out
fishing.  This is the first time that I have ever fished with my mother.  Dad
Jensen made a big change in her attitude about fishing.  When I asked her about
it, she said that one day Dad wanted to go fishing so she went with him.  While
he fished, she set in a lawn chair reading a book.  Dad started catching quite
a few nice fish, so she walked over and watched him.  As he was bringing one
fish in, Dad asked her to take the pole and real the fish in?  She did and it
was quite a thrill.  After removing the fish from the hook and re-baiting, he
then cast out and caught another and again had mom real it in.  Next he showed
her how to cast and she caught a fish.  He then set her up with her own pole
and he baited the hook for her.  She again caught a fish and brought it in but
Dad removed the fish from the hook and re-baited.  After a little while of
that, with mom catching all the fish and he removing the hook and putting the
bait on, he finally said to her “Hay lady, if you want to fish, go right ahead
but I am going over here to fish.  You can fish where you want.”  She decided
that if she was to fish she needed to bait and remove her own hook.  While mom
and I were fishing, between the two of us we had 19 pan size fish.  It was a
lot of fun.  When we returned to camp Mae had dinner ready.  Mae told us that
the ranger had came by and told her that there was a sow bear and her three
cubs in the area.  They had been going through several camps, so we should keep
all food items stored in the car.  He also said that they had traps out for
them and would keep us informed.  The problem we had was mom was going back
home after dinner and we wouldn’t have a car.  I roped a small pine tree and
bent it down, then put all our food items in a burlap sack, tied it to the top
of the tree and let the tree swing back up.  We were a little nerve through the
night but weren’t bothered by the bears.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was a beautiful morning when we got up.  We had a wonderful day and enjoyed
camping.  We stayed around the camp site most of the time.  I did take Sandy,
Shellie and Mike down to the creek fishing.  We only caught o fish so I put it
on Mike’s pole and let him fight it in the water.  He was excited!  In the
evening I again went fishing and caught 10 fish with one of the about 14 inches
and weighed about 1 ¼ lb.  The ranger stopped by to let us know that they
hadn’t caught the bears yet.  We again put the food up the tree, for the night.</p>

again had a wonderful day camping.  There were signs that the bears had came
into our camp last night but they didn’t get into our food or cause any harm. 
This evening I again caught my limit in fish.  The ranger came by and told us
that the bears had gone into a camp on the other side of the highway and the
old sow had started after a child.  The child’s father retrieved a 12 gage shot
gun and killed the bear.  Also the tree cubs had got into the traps and the
rangers hauled them away.  That was a relief to have that worry taken away.  We
did still take percussions by putting our food up the tree, but we slept
better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Several
of us went out fishing early this morning.  I caught over 21 fish this morning
and then in the afternoon I caught 6 more.  When we came back in the afternoon,
Phil Winterowd returned about the same time.  I asked him how he did and he
held up 4 or 5 beautiful fish that made my 6 look like minnows.  I asked him
how he caught such nice fish.  Did he release the small fish, to which he replied,
“No, I don’t catch small fish.”  I then asked him how he did that and he said
that you can tell by the way the fish takes the bait,  a small fish will dart
and grab the bait, while a large fish will gently take the bait and then settle
to the bottom of the creek.  You then wait until he is calm and then slowly
pull the line tight and when the bait starts to leave the fishes grip it will
grab hold and you have a large fish.  I guess I am not that skilled.  Many of
the living descendents of William and Zinna Hill gathered with us today.  It
rained this afternoon but cleared by evening.  Uncle Albert had taken a walk
out of the camp area just as it was getting dark.  He heard something in the
bushes making a grunting noise and thought it was Billie, his oldest son,
called to him.  When he didn’t respond he called to him again and said that he
should quite fooling around.  He almost through a rock in his direction but
changed his mind and came back to camp.  When he walked into camp, the first
person he saw was Billie.  We didn’t know what was in the bushes, but maybe it
was a bear.  We all assembled around the campfire for a Family meeting.  It was
a great Family Reunion.</p>

work at Air West until 1AM.  I came home and got a little sleep but Ron and I
had planned on working on the remodel job for Warner’s for a couple of hours. 
We did that and then I took the rest of the day off work at Air West.  Mae and

David to go to Utah.  She then drove over to the office so I would have the
car.  I took her and David to the Air Port Terminal where they took the 3:25PM
flight to Salt Lake.  When I got home I went up to Dr. Opie’s for a treatment. 
The kids and I went out and bought hamburgers for our dinner plus we rented a
TV for the evening.  <i>I did not indicate why Mae went to Utah but that would
have been the season for peaches to be on and Mae went up to help her mother

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning started out about normal at work.  Then my phone rang and when I
answered it, Ron Shumway asked me to come down to his office.  When I opened
the door to Ron’s office, the room was filled with several men, who were all
looking at me.  My first thoughts were “Oh Boy, what have I done!”  Ron just
handed me a envelope, which I slowly opened.  As I looked inside the envelope,
I could see that it wasn’t a “pink Slip”.  I pulled the letter out and read it. 
The letter was from the Federal Aviation Commission in Washington D.C. and they
are requiring certain data to be sent monthly to them, concerning Freight Cargo
transportation from every Airline in the United States.  It also requires that
a reprehensive from each Airline be in attendance at a meeting to be held in
Washington D.C.   I then folded the letter and put it back inside the envelope
and handed it back to Ron.  Ron then said “Well!”  I responded back “Well
what?”  Ron asked if we had a system that could provide that information.  I
told him “No we do not”, to which he asked if we had a system that could be
modified to supply that information.  I again replied “No, we do not.  I told
him that the system that should supply that information was the Freight Cargo
System, but that system could not run properly even now, but if it was totally
rewritten it could meet all the requirements that were needed for the operation
of Air West as well as the new requirements requested by the Federal Aviation
Commission.  Ron then looked at the other men in the room for a minute, then
looked back and asked if it could be done by the given dead line.  The Dead
Line was approximately 1 year from the date of the letter.  I told him that I
was sure that it could.  He then told me that I had total authority to rewrite
the system and would be given whatever assistance I felt I needed.  Then he added
“Your it.”  I responded back “I’m it what?”  To which he told me I would also
be the representative for Hugh Air West to attend the meeting in Washington
D.C.  I was then excused from his office.  Wow! What did I just get into?  From
work this evening I went over to the Health Spa and worked out for a while. 
After dinner this evening, Mae and I watched the last of a show on TV.  After
the children went to bed, I explained to Mae what had taken place at work
today.  She totally gave me her support and confidence that I could do the
job.  She certainly is a wonderful wife and sweetheart!</p>

time job for me.  He had contact with a person that needed some special
shipping crates built for shipping a special milled part for space rockets. 
The parts were milled to a very precise calibration and had to be packed in a
shipping crate that would be padded so that there would be no chance of the
part getting bumped in any area.  He had a drawing of the exist detentions and
padding of the completed crate.  We estimated the cost of building such a cart
and figured the equipment we would need to cut and form the crate.  We also
estimated the man hours each crate would require to build each crate.  We also
determined that we could use Larry’s construction listen and Business Name but
I would be in complete charge of the project.  After talking it over with Larry
and talking it over with Mae, Larry would write up a bid and turn it in to the

The unit will fit under our bed and will replace the bed frame.  It will have
two layers of slots that will allow canned foods to be loaded on one side of
the bed and will roll to the oppose side.  We came up with this idea because we

finally quit raining this morning.  Dad Jensen and I went to the Health Spa for
a while this morning.  After we got home, all of us went to Dale and Peggy
Dransfield’s place.  They had invited us out.  They took us out to a very large
cattle feed yard.  I and Dad Jensen were quite impressed with the operation. 
From there they took us to the Air Force Base in the Queen Creek area.  That is
the base where Dale is receiving Pilot Training.  The airplane that he is
training in is really a very light weight rocket to deliver bombs to a target
with a pilot to guide it.  The fuselage is aluminum and holds the jet engine.  
The cockpit sits almost on the engine like a saddle on a horse, except the
pilot leans back farther.   The wings are Styrofoam with a very thin covering
of aluminum sheeting covering.  That sheeting is so thin that the pilots are
instructed that when they fill out their reports, they are to use a clip board
and not put the paper on the wing as the pencil point might poke a hole in the
wing.  Under each wing were mounted 3 or 6 rockets (I don’t remember) with war
heads.  Inside the wings are the fuel tanks.  They hold enough fuel for takeoff
and reach flying altitude, where a refueling tanker is waiting for them to
refuel.  They can then fly to their target and dive while firing their payload. 
They again climb to flying altitude, refuel and return to base.  Dale said that
they did let family and friends come to watch the graduation flight but that on
one such flight take off, the pilot pulled back on the stick too hard, the
plane started to butterfly back and forth and the pilot ejected as the plane
was tipped sideways causing him to shoot towards the grandstand and sliding to
a stop in front of the audience.  The plane continued, crashing on the
runway.   There was a policy that if a pilot wanted to resign at anytime during
training, all he had to do was to go to the office and sign a sheet.  That day,
even though the pilot was ok, several pilots, with their wives on their arm,
lined up to sign the roster.  The tradition of guest being invited for the
graduation was discontinued at that point.  From the base we went to a park
where we had a nice lunch.  It has been an enjoyable day.</p>

children we again had our evening with Rook, Postum and Ginger Snap’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mom
and Mae had cut out and sewed Mae a very cute dress today.  When I got home
from work, Dad and I went over to the Spa for a little while.  Mom and Mae had
dinner ready when we got home.  I went up to Bishopric meeting and it was late
when I got home.  It was too late for our evening of Rook, Postum and Ginger
Snap’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
probably rode to work with Ron Shumway this morning.   Mae needed the car
today, to take Mom and Dad to the Airport.  They are going to fly, first to
Tucson, Arizona, then to Fresno California where they will spend a few days
with Roy and Linda.  Next they will fly to Salt Lake and spend a little time
there with Margaret, Bob and Carroll and Irven and Sandy, before flying back
home to Idaho Falls.  We have sure enjoyed having them spend a few days with
us.  When I got home from work, we bought some Harmon’s fried chicken and took
the children to the park to eat and play.  Mae and I stayed up late watching a
show on TV, after putting the children to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
am going to add some information at this point, concerning things going on with
my job.  I had not entered this information into my Diary due to so little
space.  My work with Hugh’s Air West has been very challenging but very
enjoyable.  I have really enjoyed Ron Shumway, not only as my boss, but also as
a personal friend.  A few months ago, while I was visiting with Ron in his
office, about the Freight Cargo System, a phone call came on Ron’s phone.  He
answered it and recognizes Mr. Bared (I am not sure if that the correct name
but it will do for now.  Also I was only hearing one side of the conversation,
so that is all I will put here.) “Yes Mr. Bared; I don’t know about that. Mr. Bared;
I don’t think that we can do that.  Mr. Bared; I don’t think that is legal.  Mr.
Bared; You can go to Hell, but I am not going to go to Jail for you.  And he
hung up the phone.”  Needless to say, within two days Ron was demoted from Data
Processing Manager to Data Input Supervisor.  His replacement was from the
planning department.  He was a retired Sergeant from the Army and he was
usually smoking a big cigar.  When he came in the room you felt like he wanted
you to jump to attention. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Also
at this period of time, the Air West Mechanic Union had called for a strike of
all mechanics.  Just as they started the strike, President Richard Nixon had
made an executive decision and put a freeze on all union raises.  Without any
real financial benefits to gain, the Union wanted to hold off any settlements
until the President’s freeze would be released.  So that the Union members
could go back to work, they went on a slow down work until the freeze was
lifted.  That in itself, was a circus and caused all kind of confusion with the
airlines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Being
that the programming department, along with the accounting department, were
non-union employees, plus were salaried employees, that  left us open to fill
in where workers were needed.  With long hours and bad management, moral fell. 
With my work on the Freight Cargo going well and about to conclude, I was still
managing pretty well - until one morning.  Jerry Hanselman, my co-worker, came
back in our office after having been called into the manager’s office.  When he
walked in, I could tell that it hadn’t gone well.  I asked him what had
happened.  He said that he was told that his vacation leave had been canceled. 
When he asked why, he was told “I might need you”.  Jerry had scheduled this
vacation over a year ago.  He had made plans to take his parents to Europe,
where he had spent 3 years in the military, and show them around.  All plans
had been made in detail with reservations already made and paid for.  His
parents were at that time already on a flight to Phoenix where he would meet
them and then he and they would leave tomorrow.  That really upset me and I
suggested that he go to Mr. Bared and try to get the decision overturned. 
Jerry did and was given 1 week off instead of the 2 weeks he had planned on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                From
the time of Ron’s release as manager and the new manager took over, almost
every time a conversation started in our department, the subject became
centered on the puzzling question as to what to do.  Many were looking for
other opportunities of changing employment.  Several in our department had
talked about joining a Union but no one had the nerve to do anything about it. 
I was in the final dead line stages of having a new Freight Cargo up and
running.  Because Jerry and I had our own office, with most of the rest being
in a large room with partitioned area, our office seemed be a place where
individuals would come to vent their frustrations.  My work was being hampered
by others.   Being upset, I called the union office.  As soon as I told them
that we might be interested in joining a union, I was told that I needed to be
very careful and sure before making such a decision.  I was warned that if this
information was to get out before a union was officially in place, I would be
fired.  I was told that I would need over 50% (that % may have been 75%) of the
department agree to hold a meeting which would be held off company property,
for the Union to explain what they could do for us, should we decide to form a
union.  At that meeting we needed to have over 50%, in attendance, vote in
favor of the union.  I would need to furnish, to the office of the Union, a
list of every person in the department, by full name and complete address, that
worked in our department.  From that list the union would send to each person’s
home a card requesting them to sign and return by mail, indicating their
willingness to hold the meeting.  The card also indicated that under no
circumstances, even should the case be taken to the Supreme Court, could
anyone, including company attorneys, ever get access to the cards to see who
had signed the card. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Although
I was careful as I visited with every person in the department, excluding 3 (as
I knew that they would not be in favor of the union) and got a very positive
approval, if someone would make the initial venture.  On one particular day
someone found out that I had started the process and made a slip about it.  At
that time I said “No more! If this couldn’t be kept quiet now, I wasn’t going
any further.” This individual and I had a private discussion for well over an
hour before I was convinced to continue.   Over the next few days I gathered
the needed information and sent it into the Union Office.  The card arrived at
my house with Friday’s mail delivery.  When I went into work on Monday morning,
I noticed one of the 3 that I suspected, standing in front the Managers office
door waiting for the manager to come to work.  He had the card from the Union
in his hand.  Within minutes, from work starting time, everyone in our
department was called into a meeting.  Supervisors were stationed outside the
doors to the meeting room and all phones within the room were disconnected. 
The Manager, with his cigar smoking and being chewed, informed us that someone
was trying to organize our department into a union.  He said that we had each
received a card from the union and that if any one signed the card they were to
clean out their personal belonging and leave the company property as they were
fired.  We were then dismissed to either go to work or to leave.  As we left the
room, almost everyone threw their card into the trash can.  I later found that
out of 36 (I believe,) only 3 plus myself sent out cards into the Union office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                At
that point management started looking to find out who was the instigator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                At
work this morning I was told that management wants me to go to Boston on the 13<sup>th</sup>
of November to learn the Siera Data Collection system.  This system runs on a
Honeywell computer that is in the San Francisco Ofice.  There is no one in our
programming staff that is familiar with the system.  From the information that
I was given this system has been given the company problems for some time.  Ron
Shumway had convinced the Honeywell Company that the problem was with the
computer itself.  Honeywell sent two representatives from their company to
research the problem.  The one programmer that was currently managing the
system met with the two from Honeywell and said that he was convinced that the
problem was in the programming.  With that they picked up their bags and left. 
Ron was so upset with the programmer on our staff that he fired him on the
spot.   I am unsure what I should do, especially with the uncertainty with Air
West.  After getting home and having dinner, Mae took Shellie and Mike with her
and went shopping.  I stayed home with David and Sandy.  We watched a show on
TV.  When Mae got home and we carried the groceries into the house Mae realized
that she was one sack short.  Mae called the store and told them of the missing
bag and they told her that somehow her bag got mixed with another order.  The
lady returned to the store when she found the extra sack with her groceries. 
The store had Mae’s groceries, so she returned to the store and got them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
rained hard again today.  This is the raining season here in Arizona so it is
not something that is unusual for the long time residences.  Most of the time the
Salt River is a dry river bed, but with all the rain, is now a flowing river.  Many
of the roads that cross the river are closed to traffic, because of the water
flow.  There is one bridge in Tempe and then the Freeway is bridged over the
river.  The next closes bridge is quite a ways east.  The other roads just
drive down the river bank and up the other side.  With those roads now closed
to crossing it really hinders the flow of traffic.  As I have to cross the
river each morning and evening to get to and from work, it is requiring 2 or 3
hours extra each day.  Also, due to the rains, many schools are closed.  I
guess that being raised in Idaho where schools often were closed due to snow
storms, it seems strange to close school due to rain.  After getting home from
work I got a haircut.  When I got home I gave Mike and David a haircut also.</p>

Opie for spinal adjustments.  After dinner and holding F.H.E., I met with Larry
Braithwaite and we discussed the possibility of starting a side Business. 
Larry had an acquaintance approach him about building shipping crates for the
company he works for.  The crates are for shipping highly accurate machined
parts that are for the Space Shuttle, Space Program.  They must hold the part,
cushioned and succor during shipping and storage.  The company presently
providing these crates can only provide 1 to 2 crates per month and they are
charging a very high price.  As we discussed the idea we figure that we can
provide 15 to 20 crates per month at less than ½ the current price.  Larry will
write up a purposed bid for the company and I will figure the machinery we will
need to manufacture the crates.  We will both look for a building in which we
can rent for the operation.  This could also expand to a much larger business
by expanding to build pallets and shipping crates for other companies.  It does
sound quite exciting.  </p>

he said, what is this I have heard you have done?”  To this I replied “If you
are asking about what I think your are asking about, how did you find out so
quickly?”  He then told me that before quitting time in San Francisco, the news
of my resignation was all over the main office.  He then said, “You have got to
be nuts to quit, with the completion of the new Freight Cargo System, you have
just made a name for yourself that is known throughout the Airlines main office. 
Knowing Jay the way I have got to know him over the past several months I know
that this conversation would go no further than between he and I.  I therefore
told him how I had tried to get the union in to represent the programming
staff.  After telling him this he just replied “Good Luck Ken, it has been good
working with you”.  He know as well as I did that if I tried to stay with the
Airline it would only be a matter of time until management found out that it
was I that had contacted the Union and I would be fired.  A few minutes later Ron
called me into his office and said that our tickets to Hawaii had come.  We
were excited and started making plans.  I called and made reservations at a
hotel in Hanalei, located about 2 blocks from the beach.  It was cheaper than
those located on the beach.  I also called a car rental that was advertised on
the bullion board in the lunch room at work.  It was exciting to be making
these plans.  This evening after dinner we held Family Home Evening and for the
activity we carved Jack-A-Lanterns.  The children really enjoyed that.</p>

Audry, Ron and myself left Phoenix on Air West for San Francisco on Hugh’s Air
West.  We then transferred to United Air Lines, flying out of San Francisco on
a 747 for Hawaii.  We got to Hawaii at 10:30pm and went directly to the Hanalei
Hotel to check in.  We were told at the check in desk that they did not have
our reservation, however as I had the reservation information, they apologized
and asked us if they could change our accommodations for the night to the
Princes Quanta (I believe that is correct) hotel which is a sister hotel.  We
agreed and they took us to the hotel.  This hotel is located right on the ocean
beach.  If I remember right Ron and Audry’s rooms were located on the 7<sup>th</sup>
floor and our room was located on the 9<sup>th</sup> floor.  From our balcony we
over looked the ocean beach and was just higher than the palm trees on the
beach.  It was a beautiful room.  After getting settled in our room we met Ron
and Audry and went for a walk along the beach.  It was a beautiful evening.  I
don’t think that Mae went to sleep but after I fell asleep she set out on the
balcony just enjoying the view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                When
we got up, I called Ron and asked them how they liked their room.  They said it
was perfect!  With their approval I called the Hanalei Hotel and asked if it
would be possible to pay the difference in the cost of the rooms and just stay
at the Princes Quanta.  The clerk said that if we were ok with it they would
just leave us there and there would be no additional cost.  That was a joyful
new to us.  We met Ron and Audry for breakfast.  We went to a Fruit Buffet,
just across the street from the front door of the hotel.  It was wonderful.  We
then went back to our rooms and changed into swimming suits and met on the
beach.  Ron and I decided to try surfing and so rented surf boards and started
out to sea.  Ron is almost blind without his eye glasses and had forgotten to
bring his sport strap, so he left his glasses with Audry.  We swam out quite a
ways and then decided we were out far enough to try surfing.  When the first
wave started towards us I started paddling but when the wave came it just
lifted me up and went on.  I decided that I must need to paddle sooner and
harder, so when I saw another wave coming I started paddling.  This wave didn’t
only lift me up but flipped me head over heal and I went under the water.  For
a little while I wasn’t sure which way was up and when I came up I hit my head
on my surf board.  Gasping I caught hold of the surf board and having all I
wanted of that I swam back to shore.  As I approached the beach, Audry came
down to the water edge and asked me if I had seen Ron.  I told her that the
last I had seen him, was that he was going to go out further to where the big
boys were.  Audry said that she could see an empty surf board but couldn’t see
Ron.  She said that without his glasses he couldn’t see 50 feet.  I started
back out and after several minutes I saw Ron swimming toward shore.  He was
about excused.  I had him get on the surf board with me but the board wouldn’t
hold both of us up.  I therefore slid back into the water and had Ron rest on
the board while I held to it and paddled.  After resting for a little while we
took turns paddling.  Just before getting into shore, as I kick to paddle, my
foot struck something sharp.  When we got to shore blood was running down my
leg.  We found someone form the hotel and asked for a band aid.  He got a band
aid and some alcohol and cautioned me that if redness started around the wound
I should get to a doctor.  He said that most likely I had cut myself on coral
and coral is very infects.  We then dressed.  Ron and I then met someone from
the car rental at which I had reserved a car.  We were taken, along with
several others, in a long van to the rental office.  As we went into the
office, a lady called to get everyone’s attention and asked that at least one
person for each car come over to where she was.  Ron went as I took care of
registering for a car.  She took a large map of Honolulu and drew circles
around every place that was worthwhile seeing or visiting and a large X over
everyplace that was a tourist trap or of little worth taking time seeing. 
After she finished she said that anyone that wanted could take a map and copy her
suggestions.  Ron asked her if he could just take the map she had filled out,
to which she said that he could as soon as everyone that wanted to copy it had
done so.  We finished with the car registering and went back to get the girls. 
I then became the driver and Ron became the navigator.  It really worked well
and we had a great day.  We follow the map carefully and there wasn’t any place
that circled that was just great.  One of the main places that we were told to
see was the Hawaiian Polynesian Center, but cautioned not to eat there because
they didn’t use enough seasoning in their foods.  She also recommended a sunken
garden restraint on the south east corner of the island that was very, very
enjoyable.  We went to a bird refuge which mainly featured parrots, this we all
enjoyed except that parrots seem to take a dislike to Audry and started chasing
her.  We had to hurry and get her out of there.  We tried to go up a mountain
where by legion a Princes was to be sacrificed, but when she was thrown over
the cliff, the winds blow her back to safety.  However we could not go there as
the road was closed due to high winds during the night had blown trees over the
road blocking travel until road crews could clear the trees off.  It was an
absolutely wonderful day in Hawaii.</p>

try to better elaborate on my Five Year Diary, I am not sure if my entries of
our daily activities, I indicated that we went swimming on this morning.  I
don’t know if that is correct or not.  Mae also feels that we only went
swimming and surfing the one day and we believe it was yesterday.  Anyway we
again had breakfast at the Fruit Buffet, then Mae and Audry went shopping for a
little while.  We again went sightseeing, going up the West side of the
island.  We went to a pineapple farm and while there we bought two cases of
pineapples.  We went across the north end of the island and saw the area where
the main surfboarding contests are held.  Ron said that he would like to have a
coconut.  We stopped at a store where he and I went in to see where we could
purchase a coconut.  We were almost laughed out of the store.  They told us
that you didn’t buy coconuts on the island but just went to where coconut trees
grow and pick what you want from off the ground.  We soon saw a empty lot with
coconut trees growing in it so we stopped and picked up several coconuts from
the ground.  They still had the husks around them but yesterday at the Hawaiian
Polynesian Center, we were shown how to break the husk off.  We needed a strong
stake in the ground and on the other side of the road was a T post.  We figured
that it would work for a stake and so went over there and started breaking the
husks off.  There was a man that came from a home deep off the road walking
towards us.  He asked us what we were going to do with the husks.  We said that
we planned on taking them back across the street and leaving them under the
palm trees.  He said that would be fine and then started to leave.  He turned
back and asked if we had checked the coconuts to see if they were still good. 
We said no we didn’t know how to do that.  He explained that we should shake
the coconut and if we could hear the milk slosh, them they were good.  He further
explained, asking if we had heard of the Tawana Revenge, (which being from
Arizona we had), he added that if we ate a coconut that was spoiled, we would
think it was a Sunday school party compared to the sickness we would have from
eating the spoiled coconut.  We were sure glad because 4 out of the 6 coconuts
were dry.  We threw the four coconuts away and got 4 more that tested ok.  We
also stopped at a Sugar Cane plantation and got some samples of sugar cane.  We
stopped at the Hawaii LDS Temple and walked around the grounds but we did not
go in as the Temple was closed.  It was another wonderful day in Hawaii.  </p>

met Ron and Audry and again went to the Fruit Buffet for breakfast.  We then
took another walk on the beach, did a little more sightseeing and then turned
the car back in before noon.  We checked out of our hotel rooms and went to the
airport.  I had taken 3 or 4 rolls of film with our camera but when I loaded
the next roll, for some reason I looked inside the empty camera and clicked the
shutter.  Nothing happened!  I repeated the process several time but each time
the shutter remained closed.  We didn’t know when the camera had failed but
after returning home, we developed the 4 rolls of film and gound that we didn’t
have one picture of our trip.  We left the Hawaii Airport at 3pm.  We got us
hotel rooms in San Francisco, rented us a car and went to the Warf where we had
dinner.  We did a little sightseeing before going to our rooms for the night.</p>

San Francisco until we returned back to the Warf.  We then drove throw China
Town, then up a steep hill that Ron had shown me on a previous business trip in
which it came to a dead end.  The problem was that the road was so steep that
you were afraid that the car would roll over when you turned it around.  We
then started for the Golden Gate Bridge, but was having trouble finding
directions from our map.  I stopped the car to the side of the road and before
I could even look at the map a police officer was at my window asking if he
could be of assistance.  He showed me on our map, where we were and drew out
the directions to the Golden Gate Bridge.  We drove there and then drove across
the bridge.  On the way back we had the windows down and we passed some crews
that were sand blasting the bridge and repainting it.  As we passed them Mae felt
something fly into her eye.  We couldn’t get it out, so it was a little
uncomfortable the rest of the day for her.  This evening we flew back home and
it was good to get back home and get our children around us again.  It was a
remarkable and unforgettable trip.</p>

voting precinct and cast our ballets after I got home from work.  We haven’t
studied the candidates and issues very well and so weren’t very informed, but I
always remember what my Grandmother Hill told Uncle Lee when she asked him if
he had voted one election.  He remarked that he didn’t know anything about the
ones running for office, so why waste his time to vote.  She replied, if you
don’t vote then you have no right to complain when thing don’t go the way you

Afterwards we stopped at a Pizza shop and bought a pizza.  We had left Sandy to
tend the children.  She is getting old enough and she wants to tend them.  The
children prefer that Sandy tend them than us getting another sitter.  We told
Sandy that if she did a good job tending the children, then we would pay her
what we normally would pay a baby sitter.  Sandy protested, saying that she
didn’t want to be paid.  We compromised, saying that if she had an opportunity
to tend someone else’s children but we needed her to tend, then we would pay
her.  She felt that that would be ok then.  </p>

for me at work.  I don’t like just studying but would rather have an assignment
to get started on.  I remember that that is the way it was when I started
working at Air West so finally I went to my supervisor and asked him for an
assignment.  He gave me one and I learned quickly how the computer works.  That
seems to be the way I learn, doing!  I may have to do the same here.  When I
got home Mae said that she had been busy all day, getting ready and haveing a
Birthday Party for Sandy, along with packing for the trip to Utah for
Thanksgiving.  Mom and Dad Jensen stopped over for a few minutes this evening. 
They enjoyed having some cake and ice cream for Sandy’s Birthday, with us. 
After that we went over to Larry and Tammy’s as Bob and Pauline Hein’s had un-expectantly
came down for a visit.  It was late when we came home but after putting the
children to bed, Mae and I stayed up and packed.</p>

we set the dinner table up in the family room downstairs using the Ping Pong

Salt Lake where I had a job interview with Skaggs.  With me not working for AW
and not having fighting privileges, Bob would like us to live closer.  The
interview went ok but no offer or commitment was made on either side.  When we
returned to Bob’s, Irven and Sandy were there and we spent the evening playing
games.  I believe that this might have been the time when my Browning felt
Sports Hat got wrecked.  When we came into the house I had removed my hat and
set it up on the back of a chair.  Bob seeing it there was concerned that one
of the children might knock it down and it would get crushed, he therefore put
it on top of a floor lamp, this way being out of reach of the children.  As the
evening came on someone flipped the light on and within a few minutes we could
smell smoking felt and leather.  The hat was totally ruined.  Bob sure felt bad
at that.</p>

Session we stopped at Bishop and Sister Moulton’s and enjoyed a short visit
with them.  This afternoon Dad Porter, Bryce and I went into a health spa for a

day’s work at Air Research I went over to a Dr. Young’s home in Mesa.  His wife
had called me yesterday, having had someone refer me to her that I did handyman
work on the side.  They had a back door to their home that needed replacing. 
When I got there, she explained that someone had broken into their home two or
three week ago.  The police suspected that they were looking for drugs.  She
said nothing else was taken and they didn’t find any drugs, as her husband
never kept drugs in their home.  Her husband had gone to a door shop and
purchased a solid core door and new lock sets.  She also said that they had
hired a carpenter to replace the door.  When the carpenter came he started work
on the door.  He had removed the old door, measured the opening and cut the bottom
off the new door.  At that time she had an appointment in which she had to
attend and the fellow indicated that he would be ok without her there.  Before she
left, he was getting ready to drill the door for the new lock sets.  When she
returned from her appointment, the old door was re-hung and a new door that had
not been cut or bored was leaning against the wall.  She said that there was no
note of explanation but the fellow never returned.  When they tried to contact
him, he would not return their phone calls.  A friend then gave them my name
and they called me to do the job.  I started on the job, first removing the old
door and as it did fit the door frame opening, I used it for a pattern to lay
out the new door.  As soon as I laid the old door, on the new door, I
immediately realized what had happened with the other carpenter.  Only one side
of the old door was cut straight and square.  The other three sides were all
custom cut to fit the frame.  I presume that the other carpenter had just
measured the height and width and then cut the door.  With the door being cut
square, it now would not fit the opening.  He had wrecked the door and now he
had to go to town and buy a new door.  That would have cost him everything he
would have made from doing the job, so he just bought a new door and went
home.  The job still took me four hours to get it installed but when I finished
the door fit and operated properly.  </p>

got home from work so I suggested that we go out to eat.  We took all our
family, plus we invited Mom and Dad Jensen to go with us.  Larry came by this
evening to let me know the outcome of a project we have been looking into. 
Larry had approached me with an idea a couple of weeks ago.  A fellow in his
ward had approached Larry asking if he could build shipping crates for the
company he worked for.  The company, which this fellow worked for, machined
parts for N.A.S.A.  These parts are machined to a very fine tolerances and are
very susceptible to be being damaged during shipping and handling, so each part
had to be placed into a special shipping box in which the part is padded and
could not move or be jarred during transportation and storage.  Presently they
have a crating company that produces a crate for them, but charges over $250
per crate and would only produce 1 to 2 crates per month.  The machining company
needs more than 12 crates per month.  Larry and I figured material and labor to
manufacture the crates and we put a bid in to build them for about $175 per
crate and could produce whatever quantity they needed.  Our thoughts were that
I would run the shop, with Larry backing it with his financing.  We figured the
tools we would need and even located a building we could rent for the shop and
even took some tools over to the building.  This project could get us initially
started and we could expand from there.  I even started contacting other
companies that might need our services.  Larry wrote up a proposal and turned
in our bid.  We have been waiting to hear back before making any solid
investments and commitments.   However, Larry received word back today that a
Boys Youth Training Program, that was Government subsidized, had put a bid to
provide the crates for $45 each, so we lost out.  We had figured that the
materials themselves would cost more than that.  Oh well! That’s life.</p>

Opie for another treatment.  I also took Sandy Christmas shopping this
evening.  Mae made a batch of homemade candy to take into work tomorrow.  David
slept quite a bit better tonight.</p>

from work I went Home Teaching.  While visiting the Essley’s, Sister Essley
gave me a copy of a talk given at a BYU Devotional, entitled “The True Story of
Christmas”.  After finishing my Home Teaching I went up to the Bishop’s office
and attended Bishopric meeting.  I got home a little after 10PM and when I came
in I found Mae busy sewing for Christmas.  While she worked I sat beside her
and read the story to her.</p>

held a Christmas party, which I really didn’t enjoy and when I could I slipped
out and came home.  After getting home I went up to the spa and worked out for
about an hour.  I then went to the Temple where I worked in the Baptistery. 
When I got home I had quite a bad headache so I soon went to bed.  David is
still sick.</p>

the day off.  I spent most of the day assembling bicycles for Shellie and Mike,
prior to Christmas Eve.  We invited Jim and Marion Frazier and their girls over
this evening.  We enjoy the friendship we have developed with them.  While we
were visiting, our door bell rang and Santa Claus (Brother Lannie Owen) came in
and visited with the children.  We had a very nice evening although David and
Mike are still sick.</p>

worked for Larry today on a home he is finishing up.  We did painting, putting
and installing door hardware.  Mom and Dad Jensen came over and stayed with the
children for us.  After dinner this evening I did some Christmas shopping. 
When I returned home we watched a Christmas show on TV as a family.  We then
put the children to bed and Mae and I stayed up until after mid-night working
on Christmas peperations.</p>

morning meetings.  This afternoon Mae sang in our Ward Choir as part of the
special Christmas program held in conjunction with our Sacrament meeting.  It
was a very enjoyable and Spiritual meeting.  We invited Mom and Dad Jensen to
spend Christmas Eve as well as Christmas day, with us.  This evening Uncle Van
and Aunt Allison and most of their family stopped by to wish us a Marry
Christmas.  It has been special having them living down here with us.  Uncle
Van is finishing his Masters Degree at Arizona State University; this will be
his last year before graduating.  We got to bed about mid-night knowing that
the children will be up early.</p>

5:30am to open gifts.  Our main family gift was a stereo.  Shellie and Mike
were especially excited with bicycles and being in Arizona it wasn’t long
before they had them outside to ride.  Mae had sewn pajamas, dresses, pants and
pajamas for most of us.  The children were all excited with their gift
exchanges to each other.    Although it wasn’t an elaborate Christmas we all
enjoyed it.  We are still doing a Gift Exchange with my siblings and this year
Roy and Linda had our name.  They sent us a nice box of Cheeses.  I am always
in favor of cheeses although Mae doesn’t enjoy them that much.  After enjoying
a very nice Christmas dinner we took all the family to visit Larry and Tammy’s
family.  We stopped over and visited the Shumway’s and Uncle Van’s family.  It
has been a great day with everyone tired and ready for bed this evening.</p>

gave us today off for the holidays.  We enjoyed a leisure morning.  After
breakfast I gave both Mike and David haircuts.  I then gave Mae a hand with the
house work and vacuumed the floors for her.  Sandy and I then went outside and
played ball for a while.  I took a 2 hour nap after lunch.  Then I trimmed and
cleaned up our roses.  It is a beautiful day and so pleasant.  This evening we
invited Mike and Donna Young, neighbors that live across the street from us,
over to play some games.  We also got out the box of cheeses to snake on.  In
the conversation, Mae commented that she really didn’t like cheeses and when
they got ready to leave Mae offered then some cheeses to take home.  I am not
just sure how the offer was taken but they took the hole box and left.  I just
stood there with my mouth open.  Mae apologized to me after they left as she
only expected them to take a couple of small packages, not the whole box.</p>

this morning and went to work.  Work went better today and I feel some better
about that.  When I got home, Mae seemed to have had a good day.  She and the
children have been sewing most of the day.  Mae made her a blouse and me a
couple of neck ties.  Work went some better today and I am feeling a little
better with my job.  This evening Larry, Tammy, Ron, Audry, Mae and I went out
to dinner for Mae’s Birthday.  We probably went to a Chinese Restraint East of
Mesa.  Ron had found this restraint a couple of months earlier and all of us
really enjoyed.  We would ask for the owner to take our order and when he came
we would just ask him to bring us dinner for as many as were in our party. 
Whether it was on this occasion or another time, when the food was brought to
our table the owner would use a little pen light and shine on each plate and
tell us what is was.  On the one occasion as he ended the pointing and telling
what the food was, he said that this is our Dog Food.  We all got quite a
chuckle over that as recently someone reported that they thought one of his
foods contained car food.  When we asked him if the article hurt his business,
he responded that if another article like that came out he would have to open
another Restraint to handle the custumers.</p>

we changed our minds and returned home.</p>
