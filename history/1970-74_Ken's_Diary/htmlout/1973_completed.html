<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Monday Jan.
01, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We took out our Christmas tree this morning
and put up the decorations.  I then went to work for Larry and worked 3 hours. 
We had an appointment with Dr. Opie at 4:30PM.  This evening we held Family
Home Evening as a family and had a good time.  We finished the evening playing
game as a family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 02, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                David woke several times, with an ear ache,
during the night.  He feels ok this morning.  After work I played hand ball
with Scott Frye.  I then went over to the spa.  I was sure tired when I got
home.  Mae sure is a wonderful <i>wife</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 03, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I took a nap after work and then went up to
Bishop’s meeting for oral evaluation.  Sandi had her first baby sitting job
while Jim &amp; Marion Frazer went to the Temple.  Mae waited up for me, she
sure is great.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 04, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae had a hectic day today with primary and
trying to get ready to go to Utah.  I went to the Temple to work in the
Baptistery.  We finished packing and went to bed late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 05, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mom and Dad Jensen drove us over to the
airport at 6AM.  Mom and Dad Porter met the airplane in Salt Lake City.  <i>We
went to their home.</i>  <i>There we </i>visited with <i>Mae’s </i>family <i>for
a while. We then </i>went over to Bob and Carroll’s for a while.  <i>We </i>came
back <i>to Mae’s parents home</i> and played games until late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 06, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
went <i>slay riding</i> at 10:30 AM in Ogden with Jean and Cindy.  <i>At 12:30
PM, we </i>went to Morgan, to <i>Uncle </i>Dale and <i>Aunt</i> Ester’s cabin. 
<i>There we </i>ate and went snowmobiling. <i>This evening Mae and I </i>went
out to an Italian restraint with <i>Richard and RaNae </i>Barney.  We visited
with them for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
will insert a note that I found in the back of my Diary, here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were visiting in Utah and I had planned on taking the children sleigh riding
into a park in Ogden.  I know that it was cold and so I tried to talk David (2
years old) into staying home with Grandma Porter, as she would be lonely if we
all left.  After some time not getting very far with my argument with David, Mike
(3 years old) came up to me and said “I will stay home with Grandma and you can
take David”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 07, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended Stake Conference this morning.  <i>This
afternoon</i> Hal &amp; Jean, Bryce &amp; Deanna, Georgia &amp; Ross Merklick,
Mae &amp; I and all our <i>children</i> had dinner with Mon and Dad Porter.  <i>We
</i>then played a few games.  We, <i>Mae, our children and I</i> , went over to
Bob and Carroll’s in the evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 08, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went over to Commercial Security Bank and
visited with John Howard for a while.  Bob and I then went to Salt Lake to
check with a couple of places about job opportunities.  <i>I believe that one
of the companies was Mountian Bell Phone Company.  The girl at the reception
ask me if I had a degree and when I said that I didn’t she called her
supervisor to tell him that I didn’t have a collage degree and ask him what she
should do with me.  </i>I didn’t have any luck at finding a job.  <i>While I
was gone, </i>Mae got everything ready <i>to leave.</i>  We left for Phoenix at
9:30 PM on the last flight on <i>Hughes </i>Air West.  Mon and Dad Jensen met
us at the airport to take us home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 09, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After super <i>this evening</i>, I trimmed
more of the Rose bushes.  I then came into the house where I played with the
children.  I helped Sandi with her math.  I then went to the Health Spa to work
out for a while.  Mae and I were both tired tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 10, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I went out with Daniel Price to
look at a home in Apache Junction.  <i>The home had been damaged by a flash
flood with the one end of the home being swept away.  He had rebuilt the
exterior walls, furred them out and sheet rocked them but now needed to have
the sheetrock finished. I decided to do it for him in the evenings, after
normal work.</i>  This evening I attended Bishopric meeting. <i>When I got home
from meeting, </i>Mae and I talked about going back into contracting. <i>(Larry
has been talking to me about going back to work with him.) </i> I just don’t
know???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 11, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae and I are fasting today that we might
receive guidance in making the right decision, as to going back into
construction.  I worked at the Temple doing Baptisms, this evening.  After
finishing I joined Mae and other Ward members who had gone through a session
with Brother and Sister Bullock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 12, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After supper I went over to Larry’s and
talked with him about getting my Contractors License.  I then came back home
and stayed with the children while Mae went to the Spa.  This evening, Hale and
Mollie Ashcroft came over to our home just to visit for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 13, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked 7 hours for Bishop Price today.  In
the evening all the family went over to Marian and Jim Frazer’s for dinner and
to visit.  Mom and Dad Jensen left to go back to their home in Idaho Falls this
morning.  Dad Jensen isn’t feeling very well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 14, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended meetings this morning, then
after dinner I went to sleep with the boys.  Mae attended a Stake meeting. 
Sacrament meeting was very good this evening.  Mae and I<i> </i>attended a Fireside
at 7:30PM.  Mae and I talked until mid-night, both being discouraged over my
job and our finances.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 15, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                For Family Home evening we went with Larry’s
family to Pioneer Park.  After eating we let the children play for a while.  All
of us then came to our place for a lesson and refreshments.  Mae and Tammy then
went to the Spa, while Larry and I visited while tending the children.  It was
a very nice evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 16, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                David and Mike woke up sick this morning. 
By evening Mike was feeling better but David is worse.  I was to work this
evening on a job for Larry but Larry called me to tell me that all the material
had not been delivered to the job site, so I stayed home.  I held David in my arms
this evening while we watched a show on TV.  I later gave Brother Freeman a
call and came over to our place.  He and I administered to David.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 17, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                David had slept most of the night and was
feeling much better by the time I got home from work.  We took all our family
to Dr. Opie’s when I got home from work.  Mae and I attended the Temple this
evening, along with other Ward members, to support Brother Dennis and Sister
Carol Hollie, as they were married for Time and All Eternity.  We enjoyed
refreshments with Ward Members after leaving the Temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 18, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mike isn’t feeling very well today.  Mae has
been busy most of the day with her Primary calling.  This evening I went to the
Temple to work in the Baptistery.  Tonight I was assigned to do the baptizing
for the dead.  I did the baptizing for 613 people that have died not having
that opportunity in this life. I got home at 10:15PM from the Temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 19, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After getting home from work, I ate dinner
and then went to work on the house for Bishop Price for another 5 ½ hours.  The
children all seem to be feeling better this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 20, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning I finished reading the Book of
Mormon.  I know that it is true and I pray that I may always have that testimony
and it will ever keep growing.  Larry and I went out in the desert (I believe
that day we took our motor cycles.  We had followed a dirt road for several
miles until it ended.  There we found a wallet along with other evidences of
the activities that took place there.  Larry checked the wallet and found the
drivers license, so when he got home he called the person.  When he told him
where we found it and that he wanted to return it, the man said “No you didn’t
and hung up.  Larry mailed it to him anyway.)  After returning home Larry and I
took Tammy and Mae out to eat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 21, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This has been a bad day for me today.  I
feel that I have had Satan on my back all day.  I didn’t sleep well last night
and have been on edge all day.  Mae and I watched a T.V. show and then set up
late and talked.  She is sure a wonderful wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 22, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When I got home from work today, Mae and I
decided that we should go to a public hearing at Arizona State University where
there is a hearing on the proposed Sex Education classes for Public Schools in
Arizona.  We also got Lois Porter, Bob and Marilyn Allen to attend with us.  I
felt that it was worthwhile that we attended and I feel good at the proposal
being recommended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 23, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I registered for an O.S. Concepts class
taught at Maricopa Community College and attended the first class this
evening.  Jerry Hanselman brought me home after the class.  I watched a show on
TV and while doing that I also cut out items for a class Mae is going to teach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 24, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I went to Bishopric meeting this evening.  I
got home from there at 9:15PM.  I helped Mae with some preparations for the
Primary Daddy Daughter’s Date.  I also watched some TV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, January 25, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae has had a busy day today, getting ready
for the Daddy Daughter’s party and attended Primary meeting.  This evening
Sandy and I attended the Daddy Daughter’s party and had a great time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, January 26, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I didn’t feel the best when I came home from
work this evening but felt better after dinner.  We watched TV for a while and
then went over to Larry and Tammy’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, January 27, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The Peace Treaty was signed at 3:10AM this
morning with Vietnam.  I worked 8 hours for Bishop Price today.  We went over
to Finch Park for a Ward Cook Out.  There was a good turnout.  I figured bills
this evening.  We are not doing very well in our finances this month but some
better than we were.  The extra work for Larry and the job I am doing for
Bishop Price helped out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, January 28, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended out church meeting today as
normal.  After Sacrament meeting I went Home Teaching to the Weight’s.  Victor
and Ruth Townson, from Ogden, came over and visited with us.  We knew the
Townson’s from the Mound Fort Ward when we lived there.  It was good to visit
with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, January 29, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening for Family Home Evening we
invited Brother and Sister Harley as well as Sister Essley to join with us.  We
had a very nice evening and it was a good experience for our children to have
these older members with us.  After we had our lesson and enjoyed refreshments
our company left.  We put the children to bed and I figured on our income taxes
while Mae did some reading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, January 30, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At work I spent most of the day learning how
to put JCL and Source programs on to a library.  After work I went my class at Maricopa
Community College.  From school I went to the Church House for a Priesthood
interview with the Stake President.  When I got home I called Roy and Linda to
see how they are doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, January 31, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It was a busy day at work today.  When I got
home Mae told me that Tammy had called her to inform her that Sister Hansen and
the Townsend’s had came to visit.  Mae invited all of them and Tammy’s family
to come for dinner.  At 5:30PM Sister Vera Hansen and her sister, Victor and
Ruth Townsend, Larry, Tammy and their family came over. We had a wonderful
dinner and enjoyed visiting.  It was a very nice evening.  Although we hadn’t
expected company this evening, Mae was a perfect Hostess and made everyone feel
very welcome.  I sure have a great wife!  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Just an added note: Vera Hansen and her husband were some
of the senior members of the Mound Fort Ward in Ogden, when Mae and I lived
there.  The Hansen’s took Mae and I under their wings and treated us as one of their
children.  We went to the Logan Temple with them a few times.  I believe that
at this time Brother Hansen had passed away.  Sister Hansen had asked Vic and
Ruth to bring her down to Mesa as her sister invited her to come down and live
with her.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 01, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I came home from work quite sick so I took
vitamin C and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, February 02, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I felt much better this morning so went to
work.  After work all of us (my family) went into Dr. Opie.  This evening Mae
and I attended the Temple.  On the way home the front wheel bearing went out on
the car.  We were not sure that we would get the car home, but just said a
prayed and drove on.  We made it!  Mae and I stayed up late watching a show on
TV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 03, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This morning, being Ground Hog Day, Mae and
I were invited to attend a Dutch oven breakfast with the menu being Ground Hog,
at Lanny Owens.  They had invited many couples, including Bishop and Sister
Rice, who did not attend because of the menu.  When invited, we were told that,
because it was Ground Hog Day, we would be having “Ground Hog” for breakfast.   The
breakfast menu was biscuits, grave, eggs and sausage (ground hog) cooked in
Dutch ovens.  It was delicious and we had a very enjoyable time.  Those that
did not attend were disappointed to think they had stayed because they thought
it was Ground Hog that they were cooking.  After returning from breakfast
Bishop Rice and I went to the Church house and did some remodeling on the
Bishopric and clerk’s office area.  This afternoon I started repairing our
car.  Mae took Sandy and Shellie to a movie.  I tended the boys while they were
gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 04 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended meetings this morning as a
family.  Larry and Tammy invited us for dinner at 5PM.  We had a very nice time
and got home about 10:45PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, February 05, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I went to the parts store to get
parts for the car.  We had a nice Family Home Evening and then I worked on the
car for a while.  Mae and I had planned on setting up and reading but I was too
tired so we just went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, February 06, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After dinner this evening I went up to the
Church house.  I built and installed door jams and casings for the door ways we
put in last Saturday.  I was sure tired when I came home.  Mae is sure
wonderful!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 07, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work Mae and I went up to Doctor
Opie’s for treatments.  Mae still isn’t feeling very well.  I went up to the Church
house for Bishopric meeting and I didn’t get home until 11:30PM.  Tonight Mae’s
back is still giving her a lot of pain.  Sandy had taken care of the younger
children so that Mae could rest.  Mae told me that Sandy had really been good
with the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 08, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today Mae’s back is still hurting her
although she says that it is better than yesterday.  Mae went up to Doctor Opie
for another treatment.  David has come down with another cold.  We are not sure
just what to do for David but he is sick a lot.  I worked at the Temple again
this evening.  I also got our tax returns mailed in.  We called Mom Jensen and
visited with her for a while.  They had arrived home ok and Dad Jensen is
feeling better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, February 09, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work Mae and I took the children to
the park.  We bought hamburgers for dinner.  We then left Sandy and Shellie to
play at the park and took the boys grocery shopping with us.  Tonight Sandy
stayed at her friends.  Mae and I attended a wedding reception at the Power’s. 
When we got home we watched a show on TV before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 10, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I worked 3 ½ hours for Danial Price.  I took
Shellie and Mike with me.  This afternoon Mae and I worked in the yard.  This
evening we attended a High Priest party.  Later we attended a dance put on by
the 1<sup>st</sup> Wards Elders Quorum.  We had a great time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 11, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended church meetings as normal
today.  I was tired all day.  After dinner we took the children to get ice
cream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, February 12, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I went to work for Bishop Price. 
Mae held F.H.E. with the children without me.  I worked 4 hours this evening
and it was mid-night before I got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, February 13, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I went to school, getting home
about 8:30PM.  Mae had made a Birthday Cake for Tammy so we took it over to
her, wishing her a Happy Birthday.  We stopped at Bishop Price, on the way and
got a check from him for the work I have done.  The check was for $189.50. We
stopped at the bank and deposited the check.  Before coming home we also
stopped and got a ice cream Sunday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 14, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work we took all the family to Doctor
Opie’s.  All the children checked out ok but as normal Mae and I needed some
adjustments.  After returning home, Mom Porter called and talked for a while.  This
evening Sandy tended the children for us while Mae and I attended the Temple
and went out to eat with the Bishopric.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 15, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Our furnace went out at 5am this morning, so
I didn’t get to work until 12:30PM.  This evening I was the Baptizer and
Baptized 4 people, doing a total of 467 names.  This evening Sister Verna
Hansen from the Ogden Mount Fort Ward gave both Mae and I a new Temple Robe
that she had made for us.  She is visit or staying with her sister here in
Mesa.  She looked us up when she came down.  That was very special of her. 
Raymond L. Brown, 1<sup>st</sup> Counselor in the Mesa Temple Presidency set me
apart as a Temple Worker this evening.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, February 16, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I got a raise in pay and a good work review
today.  That was good news.  After work our family went camping with Larry and
Tammy’s family.  We have found several good camping areas north of the Salt
River and east of Mesa.  We have found that the desert still has some special beauties
as part of God’s creation.  Cora and Dale Tinnes and their family from Ogden, are
visiting and so we invited then to join us.  They are not prepared for camping
over night  but they did come out and had dinner with us.  After eating and
visiting for a little while they went back to Mesa to stay.  After they left
and it became late in the evening, we putting the children to bed.  Larry,
Tammy, Mae and I stayed up and talked until quite late.  We have a very
enjoyable relationship with those two.   Larry and I slept in the car but the
rest of our family was able to sleep in the Larry and Tammy’s camp trailer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 17, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Larry and I took his motorcycles out into
the desert this morning.  We just had a great time just riding and exploring
the desert.  (I believe this incident happened at this time so I am going to
add it here.) We followed a dirt road for quite a while until it came to an
end.  As we stopped at the end of the road we saw a wallet and some other tell
tells as to what had taken place there.  When Larry opened the wallet there was
a little money in it plus other normal cards including a driver’s license. 
Larry said that he would call the owner and get it back to him.  He later told
me that he looked up the name in the phone book and called.  When he told the
man that he had found his wallet the man said “you did not and don’t you call
again” and hung up the phone.  Larry did mail the wallet and condense to the
address he found in the phone book.  Anyway Larry and I had a very relaxing
time  We got came back to camp, pack and got home about 2PM.  This afternoon
Mae and I bought some material and made a new trellis to go on our carport. 
Mae also got her hair done today.  This evening we watched some TV before going
to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 18, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I spent most of the day in meetings today. 
David didn’t feel well this morning so Mae stayed home from Sunday school.  We
had the Full Time Missionaries, Elder Reese and Elder Wright to our home for
dinner today.  This evening Uncle Van brought Uncle Dean and Aunt Stella and
their daughter Shellie over to our place to visit for a little while.  We
enjoyed having them come to visit with us.  It was special that Uncle Van wanted
to have them also visit with us while they we in town to visit Uncle Van’s
family.  After an enjoyable visit and they went back to Uncle Van’s, our family
watched the movie “The Ten Commandments” on TV, before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, February 19, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae bought wheat, flower and sugar for our food
storage today.  The children were home from school today in honor of
President’s Day.  This evening we had a very nice Family Home Evening.  I was
also able to finish building the trellises to go on the west side of our
carport.  I sure am blessed to have such a great family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, February 20, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I went to my evening class.  When
I got home Sandy was having trouble with her math home work.  I spent some time
helping her with that.  After dinner Mae and I went up to the hospital to see Aunt
Allison.  When we got home we talked until 11:30 before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 21, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This evening I attended Bishopric meeting

going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, February 22, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was late getting home from work.  I had to
go straight up to the Temple, to perform my calling as a Temple Worker in the
Baptistery.  Mae also had a busy day today so when I got home we went right to
bed.  David isn’t feeling very well today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, February 23, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was sure tired when I got home this
afternoon.  Sandy had a baby sitting job this evening.  After dinner I did the
dishes and tended the children while Mae studied for a talk.  We went to bed
early and sure slept well tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday, February 24, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We slept in until 8AM and it sure felt
good.  I hung three doors at the Church and finished about 4PM.  I then went
over to Willis’s to check on a job I will do next week.  This evening Mae and I
went with Louis and Deloy Porter to a Western show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, February 25, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We attended our regular Sunday meetings. 
This afternoon I took a nap.  Mae and I went up to the hospital to see Aunt
Allison.  We had a nice visit and really enjoyed it.  On the way home we
stopped at a car lot just to look.  We then stopped and got an ice cream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday, February 26. 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When I got home from work, Mae and the
children had everything ready for my Birthday.  It is a day early but they know
that tomorrow evening I have school.  I had to go to the Church house and
adjust a door.  When I got back we held Family Home evening with Sandy giving
the lesson.  After the children went to bed, Mae and I painted the trellises
that I had built.  I sure love my family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Tuesday, February 27, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After work I went to my class at Maricopa
Community College.  I got home about 8PM.  Larry and Tammy, Milvin and his girl
friend, Mae and I went out to eat at the Lost Alaskan for my birthday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday, February 28, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We didn’t hold Bishopric meeting this evening
so I was able to stay home tonight.  I got a few things repaired around the
house.  I figured our bills, we were able to cover them but that is about all. 
We received word that Bryce and Deanna got a baby girl today.</p>

confusion in my Diary as to this next experience and what date it occurred on.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At work I had one of my co-workers ask me if I know anything
about Tape Library Systems?  I told him that I had designed and programmed a
Tape Library System for Hughs Air West.  He went straight into my supervisor,
who met with the Data Processing Manager, Mr. Wamper.  A little later I got a
call to come into the Managers office.  There I was asked to explain my
experience with the Tape Library system.  In the room were the manager, all
three supervisors, which included Ron Shumway and the co-worker.  I told them
that I had designed and wrote the Tape Library system now used by Hughes Air
West, which Ron confirmed.   I was then assigned to compare my system with one
that was used by the Hugh’s Tool Co.  Also I was asked if I could be ready to
make a presentation by next Thursday.  I said that I was sure that I could.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mae had Primary this afternoon but
when I got home from work she still had my Temple clothes ready for me.  She

have the car.  Mom Porter flew into Phx. Airport at 1:04PM today.  Mae and the
children picked her up at the airport.  They also picked me up at 3PM.  Mike,
David and I got a hair cut at the Barbara shop and then we took the children
into a photographer to get the children’s pictures taken.  I set some forms for
concrete for the Willie’s.  I was there until 9PM.  Mae, Sandy and I then went
to the Lehi Day’s dance.  It was 11:30PM before we got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                At
work the same group met in the conference room as met last week.  The Data
Processing manager turned the time over to me and as I started my presentation,
the senior  supervisor spoke up and said that we didn’t need a new tape library
system as our computer already had a system on it that kept track of the
tapes.  The Department manager looked at me and said, “Is that right?”  I
looked at him and said that I wasn’t aware that our computer could do that.  To
which he just said, “It doesn’t look like you are very well prepared.  This
meeting will be dismissed until next week and by then I hope you will be better
prepared.”  I really felt embarrassed and deflated.  I went back to my desk and
started research on our computer system.  Soon I found that it was true that
whenever the computer generated a tape for storage the programmer had to give
the length of time that the tape was to be stored before the tape could again
be reused.  When a tape was inserted into the computer the first thing the
computer checked for was that the data on the tape had expired the length of
time that the data on the tape was to be kept.  But it did not and could not
tell where the physical tape was located.  That was the purpose of a Tape
Library System, so that the computer operator could find the physical tape when
it was needed.  With-in a couple of hours, I had total evident that the Senior
Supervisor was completely wrong.  My goof now was that I told another co-worker
what I had found out.</p>

to come to their place for the evening.  Mae and I went to the Temple anyway. 
Mae went through a session while I worked in the Baptistery.  This evening I
was assigned to be the baptizer.  I preformed the baptisms for 602 people this
evening.  After returning home Mae and I set up and visited until uncle Van

a Stake meeting to attend at 4PM.  I believe that it was this meeting that
Elder Perry counseled us that the most important date that we put on our weekly

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
had Primary today, also this evening she had a special Stake Relief meeting. 
Mae had arranged for a sitter with the children, as this evening is my regular
shift to work at the Temple in the Baptistery.  When we both got home this
evening, we just enjoyed visiting together for a while.  We then watched a cute
show on TV before going to bed.  We sure enjoyed the time to be together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                At
work this morning I had one of the planners stop at my desk and asked me if I
know anything about tape library systems.  I told him that I did as I had
designed and programmed one for Hughes Air West.  He got excited and said that
he would be back in a few minutes.  He went to my supervisor and they went to
Mr. Womper, the director.  A few minutes later I got a phone call asking me to
come into the Directors office.  Besides Mr. Womper, there were the three
programing group supervisors and the planner in attendance.  Mr. Womper asked
about my experience in writing the Tape Library System and after explaining
what I had done he asked me to compare the system that they had received from a
Sister Co. in L.A. with the one I wrote for Hughes Air West.  He concluded the
meeting by asking me if I could be ready to report back in a week.  This
evening Mae and I visited the Caldwells.  Mae and I then went to the hospital
to visit Marion Frazier.  After a short visit with Marion Mae and I then went
to a show.  The show wasn’t much good but it was sure nice being with my
sweetheart.  </p>

Salt River.  We got home at 7:30PM.  Mae and I stayed up after getting the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got some work done around the house.  I went over to Doug Caldwell’s and helped
him get a garden area ready to plant.  This afternoon all our family went out
in the desert with Ron and Audrie Shumway’s family; and Larry and Tammy’s
family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                <i>I
will insert an experience that “I believe” took place previous to this date.</i> 
I had bid a job to add a patio cover to a home.   The home set on a lot in
which the lot tapered almost like a piece of pie.  The patio had already been
poured with a rectangular concrete slab attached to the back of the house. 
When I went to the city, too get a permit to do the job.  The city denied the
permit because the cover would come to close to the property line.  In order to
comply with the city code, the cover would have to follow the same angle as the
fence line.  It left the owner with the option of not extending the roof to the
full end of the house or build the roof to the same angle as the fence with a
corner of the slab not being covered.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> was the option that
the home owner chose, except he wanted the corner of the slab to be cut to the
same angle also.  That we agreed on and I called a concrete cutting company to
cut the slab for me.  After they had made the cut I went out to check the job
and the cut was not a straight cut.  I therefore caulked a new line for the cut
to follow and called the company back.  I told them that the home owner would
not except such a crooked cut and told them they would have to re-cute,
following my marked straight line.  When I checked the cut the next day they
had done a worse job than before.  I first called the company and told them it
was unexcitable.  They said that there was not enough slab left for them to cut
it straight.   I called another company, explaining the previous situation and
asked if they could re-cut the patio.  They said they were sure they could and
came out and cut a very straight cut.  I paid the 2<sup>nd</sup> company and I
built the cover which was accepted by the city and the home owner.  As we left
home to go on the trip, I stopped at a service station to fill the car and
motorcycle with gas.  The first fellow that I had hired to cut the concrete
came over and demanded that I pay him for his work.  I told him that I would
not pay him and he would have to get a lawyer if he wanted.   I would see him
in court, before I would pay him.<i> Now back to our trip.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
spent the afternoon riding motorcycles in the desert.  After a while Mae tipped
over and bruised her leg quite badly.  At first we were concerned that she
might have broken it.  Mae didn’t feel that we needed to see a Doctor at this
point so we just came home.  She felt it was ok, so I went to the Stake Center
to attend General Priesthood meeting.</p>

Brother Trendler. I got home in time so that we were able to listen to the

some tools and starting a business.  Larry had a fellow that he seems to be
well acquainted with that works for a company that manufactures parts for space
missals.  These parts have to fit in packing crates that will hold the part
totally padded against movement while shipping.  Currently the crates are
costing them a great deal but as we looked at the requirements we feel that we
could make them at a much lower price and still clear a very good prophet.  It
might be an opening to start and expand into a pretty good company.  We
discussed the need for nomadic mail and staple guns, also the need to find a
building to work in.  We agreed on a price per crate to turn in and Larry will
get back to me.  I helped Mae with some decorations she needs for Primary.  Mae
and I also talked about Larry’s proposal for some time.  I think she fills
better about it after our long talk.</p>

worked 5 hours for Larry this morning.  Larry has his own framing company and is
building homes in a subdivision.  Each home has a carport and a shed attached. 
Larry is paying me to nail off the siding on the carport shed.  It really goes
quite fast with my new staple gun.  When I got home I had to work on our
Chevrolet Station wagon.  Mae took all the children shopping for Mikes
Birthday.  When they got home we all went to the Phoenix Zoo.  This evening Mae
and I went to David Jobnston’s wedding reception.  From there Mae and I went to
a movie.  While just teasing, I hurt Mae’s feelings and it took the rest of the
evening to make her feel better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                At
work Ron had me go with him to Tomas mall in Phoenix.  He always went there to
get his hair cut at Sandy’s Barber Shop.  He had talked to the owner, Sandy
about some remodeling she wanted done.  He had told her that I did work on the
side and might be interested in doing the work for her.  She needed a portion
and a cabinet built.  She had previously had someone finish her shop in a
Chinese Cheery Tree paneling and wanted this remodeling to match.  When I got
back to the office, I figured the materials that I would need and made some
calls about the materials.  I called several lumber yards for the material and
some of them remembered the paneling but didn’t carry it anymore.  I finally
reached one lumber yard that had 10 sheets of the paneling left.  I asked him
to hold it for me until I could come over and see if it was what I needed and
pay him for it.  He said that he would hold it for 1 hour.  I jumped in my car
and went right over.  The lumber yard was on the north side of Phoenix and it
took me 50 minutes to get there.  Another man was waiting there to buy all ten
sheets but the owner told him that he had promised that he would hold it for 1
hour.  It was exactly what I needed and I bought 8 sheets of it at $80 per
sheet.  The owner of the yard told me that as far as he know, this was all that
was in Arizona and if I needed more, it would have to have the 1<sup>st</sup>
ply of cheery wood manufactured in China, then shipped to Washington State for
the other two ply to be attached and then shipped back to China for the finish
before sending it back to Arizona.  Time wise would probably take 3 months and
the cost would be close to $200 per sheet.  I paid for it and we loaded it into
the back of my station wagon. I felt like I was carrying gold.</p>

morning I worked at Opie’s for 2 ½ hours.  I came back home and built part of
the portion for Sandy’s Barber Shop.  That was the hardest thing I think I ever
built.  Each cut of the plywood was as nerve racking as anything I have ever
done.  I would measure each cut of plywood paneling, carefully mark it and then
reach for the saw.  Before I would turn the saw on, I would freeze up, go back
and re-figure the cut and recheck the measurements.  I would do that two or
three times before I could make each cut.  I really sweat each cut, thinking at
what would happen if I made a mistake.  I would wish that, just for backup, I had
bought all ten sheets of paneling. This weekend is our Stake Conference so I
had two meetings to attend.  A Stake leadership meeting was held at 4PM and
then at 7PM a meeting for all adults of the Stake.  (I have a short note that a
film was shown about President Lee, but I did not indicate what it covered.) 
After the meetings were over we got together with the Porter’s and the

and the Shumway’s who had gone camping yesterday.  The determining factor was
the station wagon.  Then Jim and Marion said that they would like to go camping
with us.  (I am not quite sure how we got both families in their truck.  We
didn’t have the seat belt laws back then.)  After attending meetengs we packed
up and left for the camp site.  It was 9:30PM when we got there.  We had joined
the camp site with the Braithwaite’s, the Shumway’s and the Nelson’s.  They had
came out on Saturday morning.</p>

that.  We did enjoy riding the motor cycles and just relaxing and visiting. 
Braithwaite’s, the Shumway’s and the Nelson’s packed up about 4PM and left for
home.  The Fraizer’s and our family stayed for dinner and held Family Home
evening before we left for home about 8PM.  It was about 10:30PM when we got
home but we did have a good time.</p>

work I went over to the Thomas Mall where I worked on Sandy’s Barbershop.  I started
on some of the areas that were not in use until they closed the Barber Shop.
The sink had been a self hanging sink and I had built the cabinet top so that
the sink could easily be set into the cabinet.  I did not have to disassemble
the faucet at all form the sink with the exception of disconnecting the water
supply lines and the drain. When I reinstalled the supply lines and hooked up
the drain pipes, turning on the water, I had water leaks at almost every joint
in the faucet and drain.  I was puzzled as it was leaking where I had never
even disconnected a joint.  It was already late and the night watchman kept
looking in the windows to see what I was doing there.  Finally I gave up and
left signs on the sink that they weren’t working and so I would come back when
they opened in the morning and try to find the problems.  It was 1:30AM when I
got home, tired and discouraged.</p>

customer’s hair in the sink.  I asked Sandy what she had done to stop the
leaks.  She said that when she saw my signs, she just turned on the water
supply and couldn’t see a leak either on the drain or on the faucet, so she
used it.  I didn’t have any answers.  Sandy was very satisfied with my work.  I
sure felt good about that.  When I went back to the office I found out that Ron
Shumway had turned in his resignation.  He has been given an offer with the Tanner
Brothers Construction Co.  This afternoon we took all the family to Dr. Opie. 
I attended Bishopric meeting this evening, not getting home until 9:30PM.  We

don’t know if I have explained the situation at Air Research or not so I will
insert it here.  Air Research is one of the many companies owned by the Howard
Hughes Corporation.  As far as I have gathered Hughes Air Research developed
and manufactured turbo jet engines.  The Data Processing department, where both
Ron and I worked, consisted of a Planning Department that coordinated between
the Data Processing Department and the users throughout the rest of the
company.  We had three sections of programmers, each having a Supervisor with
about 5 programmers under them.  Ron had filled the position of supervisor of
Group 2.  I work in Group 3, under John Brown as my supervisor, and then there
was the Supervisor over Group 1.  Over the three programming Supervisor, was
the Data Processing Manager.  I never did understand what authority the Group 1
supervisor had but he seem to be the one that had most of the authority, even
over the D.P. Manager.  I never did feel that Ron felt like he had much
authority and so when this position with Tanner’s opened up Ron jumped for it.</p>

way.  With this Arizona heat and the car being old, that wasn’t too
surprising.  </p>

nice creek nearby so most of us went in swimming and used a little soap while
there.  The Warner’s came up and joined our group this evening.  David was also
quite sick with Flew like Simpsons this evening.  He kept us up quite a bit

morning after breakfast all the men took the motor cycles out for a ride.  We
came upon a herd of elk and so started chasing them.  At one time I looked at
the speed-o-meter and I was going over 30 miles per hour.  It was surprising
that none of us got hurt or damaged the bikes as we were going through some
very wild timber.  The elk soon found a canon and disappeared over the edge. 
We also did some riding this afternoon.  We got playing around the creek and
Sue Warner ended up being thrown into the water.  Ron Shumway and Joe Nelson
drove into town this evening for some supplies.</p>

evening I went to the Temple as normal to work in the Baptistery.  When I went
to the East door, where we normally enter, no one answered the door bell, plus
the lights were off.  I therefore went around the Temple to the main entrance. 
I walked through the hallway to the Baptistery and as I passed the Temple
Secretary’s office I gave a “Good Evening” and went on to the Baptistery.  All
the lights were off and no one was in the area.  I presumed that I must just be
a little early so I started getting out the carpets and towels to be ready. 
The Temple Secretary then appeared and asked me what I was doing here?  I just
answered with, “What I normally do on Thursday evening.  He then asked if I
didn’t get the call that no one was coming this evening for baptisms.  I told
him that I hadn’t been informed, so I would put things back then and go home. 
A couple of minutes later he reappeared and said that a couple from
Philadelphia had just came to the Temple to do some work for deceased family. 
They would need to do the Baptisms and Confirmations tonight, before they could
take care of the rest of the ordnances tomorrow.  I therefore got thing ready. 
I performed the baptizing, with the Temple Secretary and I signing as witness,
then I Confirmed membership and gave the Gift of The Holy Ghost, and again the
Temple Secretary and I signing as witness.  With that work done, I then cleaned
up the area, turned off the lights and went home.  What a wonderful experience
that was.  I spent the rest of the evening relaxing with my family.</p>

Bishop Reis, about Larry’s offer and he couldn’t give me much to think about
either.  I am not sure but I don’t think I will do it.</p>

figured bills this morning and they aren’t looking very good.  I went up to
Opie’s to work but I couldn’t get the material that Sister Opie wants, so
couldn’t get much done there.  Mae and I talked about our bills, my job at Air
Research and the offer that Larry is making us.  We are just not quite sure but
maybe that would be for the best.  We went to the Ward 24 of July party.  Sandy
got all the children dressed up and they entered the parade contest.  They won
1<sup>st</sup> place.  We were very proud of them and felt that Sandy deserved
all the credit.</p>

Twelve Apostles presided over that meeting and was the main speaker.  What a
thrill that was to be there.  A few weeks ago, as Mae and I were visiting, we
commented that most everyone in the Ward were related one to another except for
us.  At this reunion we found that there at the family reunion we know many
from our Ward and also from our Stake.  Following the meeting, there was a fun
rodeo and then lunch.  Mae and I took a nap after lunch.  This evening we

help with Georgia’s wedding plans and preparations.  It will also give us
transportation to return to Utah when I Fly up for the Wedding.  I have an
uneasy feeling about this trip but just hope that it is just me.  After getting
home from work, I worked at Opie’s for a while.  Larry called me this evening
and told me that if I come to work for him, that the insurance he carries with
his company, will cover David.  Insurance coverage was one of the concerns we

counsel personally.  Following the Temple ceremony, pictures and a wedding
breakfast, we returned to Mom and Dad’s home.  I then went over with Bob at his

He said that David had to be completely well for a two weeks prior to the
operation.  I told Dr. Shield that David had never been well for two weeks at a

a Blessing also.  Just before putting the children to bed, David dropped a can
of vegetables on his toe.  I had to take him into the hospital to get it
lanced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning I went into Executive Leadership meeting and then to Priesthood
meeting.  (I am going to add an experience that I had in one of the High Priest
Quorum meeting, not sure when it occurred but it did take place while we lived
in Lehi.  The Brother that was giving the lesson commented that Damnation was
not Eternal.  I questioned the statement asking what he meant.  He then said
that we didn’t know how long it would last but it would not continue forever. 
I again questioned that “Eternal Damnation” meant just that, forever is
Eternal.  We got in quite an argument and it became a little heated, until I
finally just shut up and let it go.)  After those meetings ended I came home
and we put the house back together.  Larry and Tammy’s then invited our family
to come over for dinner.  While the kids were playing outside, Mike fell on
their trampoline and cut his head.  We had to take him into the hospital where
they took three stitches above his eye.</p>

for this day doesn’t give much detail and we are not quite sure what happened. 
To the best of our recollection, this was for a Tonsillectomy.  Dr. Shield
would have been the Doctor that operated on David.  However, there are some
details that doesn’t work out quite right.  </i>I spent the evening with
David.  Mae brought the children up to the hospital to see David about 7:30PM. 
David didn’t want to stay the night but when we explained that it was
necessary, he accepted it without a fuss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                When
I got home from work, Mae had our dinner already packed and we took our family
to Pioneer Park to eat.  We also held our Family Home evening there.  This Park
is such a peaceful area, even thou it is right in the middle of Mesa.  The park
sets just north across Main Street in front of the Mesa LDS Temple and is just
a perfect setting.  There is lots of play equipment that the children to enjoy,
as well as tennis courts and horse shoe pits.  Often we would see an older gentleman
practicing there by himself.  He would throw 4 horse shoes from one end, making
a ringer with each, and then going to the other end, doing the same act again. 
I watched him do this for quite a while, never missing.  I finally asked him if
he ever missed when playing someone else.  He said that he seldom ever missed
but then those that he played against also seldom missed.  I asked him how when
playing that well, how do they determined the winner.  He said it was the one
that won the starting coin toss.</p>

of it being General Conference Week end there was no other meetings held.  That

Stations in the Phoenix area would broadcast.  The rest of Conference we have
to waite until the Ensign comes out.  Larry called me and told me that I would
have to call Lyle Book and tell him that we didn’t have enough work and I had
to let him go.  My Paycheck was quite small this time, due to the shortage of
work.  We are concerned as to how long we can remain solvent if work continues
to slow down.  This evening Mae and I stopped by the Porter’s just to visit for
a few minutes.</p>

come to the Temple if he need help.  As always she came right over.  I also
volunteered to be a proxy.  I was baptized for 157 people.  I think the other
little girl was baptized for a 150 names.  After I was confirmed for those
names that I had been baptized for, I was voice for confirming those that the
sister was baptized for.  While I was at the Temple, Mae did some work on our
bills.  When I returned from the Temple we looking at our budget and with

is less than two blocks from our old home, we decided we could move this way. 
That was a mistake!  Of all the moves this move took us longer than any move we

came over in their car.  We parked the pickup backwards so that the children
could sit in the back, on the blankets to watch the movie.  With the Lawn

I am not sure if this incident occurred tonight but I haven’t seen where I have
added it before so I will add it here.  We went to the “King’s Fork” restraint in
Mesa.  At this restraint they serve an all you can eat salad bar.  As we got
the food Mae saw some round deep fried balls and added some to her plate.  When
we got back to our table she cut one of those balls into.  When she looked at
it she screamed and throws it off her plate.  It was a breaded deep fried
oysters and they have a sickening green inside and so when eating them you just
put the whole oyster in your mouth without looking at it.  That was the first
and last time Mae had ever eaten oysters.  Everyone in the restraint was
staring at her and she was so embarrass.  I just broke out in a roar of
laughter.  </p>

Executive Secretary.  At the conclusion of the drive we all returned to the
church where we had a pot luck dinner.  The drive was very successful.  Mae was
sure a good support to me in my assignment or whatever I have to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                When
I got home from work, Mae told me that Shellie felt better this morning and
attended school.  However Mike is sick this morning and didn’t feel good all
day.  It must be going around.  After eating dinner we watched a little TV and
then David and I played on the floor.  However I soon fell asleep on the
carpet.  Mae had to wake me to go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I stayed home
today and after breakfast with my family, I started painting the door in our
house.  It is cloudy today and so the paint is slower drying.  Do to that I
didn’t get all the doors painted.  Mae and I went grocery shopping this
afternoon.  This evening we took Brother and Sister Caldwell out to dinner to
show them our gradated for all the work Doug did in helping us purchase this
home.  It was Doug’s idea and help that made it possible.  I would have never
thought about trading our home, nor did I think that we had built up enough
equity in our first house to make such a trade.  I don’t think that Doug even
took any commission out of the trade for himself.  We had an enjoyable evening
with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                Bob called me
this morning mainly to see how we are doing.  He feels bad that now he is out
of the Air Force, and can be here where the family lived, now both Roy and I
have moved our families out of the Utah area.  My Family and I attended meeting
today as normal, with me going in early for Priesthood Leadership meetings. 
Following Sacrament meeting we invited Tammy, Larry and their children to come
over for dinner and to spend the evening.  We sure enjoy being with Larry and
Tammy and our children have a very good time together.  (As I make these
entrances into my computer Personal History and I record an entry in which I
mention Larry and Tammy, I have a sick, lonely feeling in my heart.  I hope
that sometime we can correct these feelings.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Monday, November 05, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                Today at work,
we finished up the job we have been doing in Sun City, Arizona.  That has been
an interesting experience but it has also been quite a drive each day.  The job
consisted of remodeling a Church there in Sun City.  Sun City is a retirement
village and so has only elderly people that live there.  All facilities are
designed for the Elderly including recreation center, golf course, etc.  Golf
carts are a normal thing to have on the streets and they mainly have the
right-a-way.  This chapel is the only chapel that I have seen.  With the
residency, there are many funerals held there as well as many social
activities.  The building was original constructed in somewhat of a U shape,
with the chapel running east and west and wings extending to the south.  The
wings contain office and class rooms extending southwards about 100 feet.  There
was about 80 feet of space between the two wings.  The remodeling was to build
a large room in between these two wings, closing it in, making a recreation
center out of that space.  When Larry sent me out there, they had just set the
trusses between the two wings.  Crews had laid roofing sheathing on the east
side trusses and were now carrying sheathing from the east side to the west
side.  I reported into the superintended who was busy getting crews lined up
for the day.  Seeing his schedule, I started helping the crew carry the sheathing,
(sheets of 4’ X 8’ X 1/2” plywood) up the east side to the crew that was
installing it to the west side.  As I walked up the roof, carrying the
sheathing, I noticed that by the time I got to the ridge of the roof, there was
a very notable bounce to the roof.  I had only worked for a short time when the
superintended assigned me to take three men with me and go to the west side of
the chapel and start framing a canapé that was to extend from the building to
the curbing of the street.  He gave me a set of plans for that section of the
remodeling.  As we started to lay out the structure, it was definitely easy to
realize that the pillars, which had already been poured of concrete, were way
outside the measurement of the planned roofing.  I went back to the
superintended and told him that there was a problem.  When I pointed out the
problem, he reassigned me and the men to start working on a build up beam that
was to cross between the center of the two wings and then from the center of
that beam to the south wall of the chapel.  From these beams were to hang ten
foot byfold doors that would section the large room into three rooms.  As I
went over the plans and the engineering of the beams, I told the superintended
that the beam would never hold up the weight of the doors.  I explained that
the nailing design would pull apart, plus I felt (because of the bounce I felt
when carrying sheathing across them) that the trusses were not strong enough to
hold that weight.  He assured me that the trusses were engineered for the
weight.  When I explained the nailing design, with 16 penny nails driven up
vertically would pull out as they were designed to hold horizontally, he
considered that thought and asked what he thought we should do.  I suggested
that we build it to plan, plus we have steal 4 inch angle iron plates made and
bolt then into the framing.  Then instead of just nailing the finish paneling
onto the framing, that we also use construction glue to secure the ¾” paneling. 
He agreed with my ideas and said that he would get the angle iron plating and
for me to go ahead with the framing.  I told him that I was still afraid that
the beam would not hold that weight.  We framed the beam as to engineered
design and then bolted the angle iron braces into place before gluing and
nailing the paneling as to engineered nail pattern.  Completing the interior
beams completed the portion of the construction that Larry had been asked to
do.  (Several months later, after we had moved back to Utah, I got a call from
Larry, asking if I remembered working on the Sun City job.  Of course I did and
he asked if I built the interior beams as to Engineered Specification.  When I
said no, I could almost hear his heart stop.  I then added that we had built
the beam exactly to plans, but then we added the angle iron bracing and the
gluing of the paneling.  His heart again started beating.  I then told him,
“The beam is coming down isn’t it”.  He said it was. The doors were hung and
within a week they were dragging on the floor.  The door company came back and
cut the doors off shorter.  Again a second time they were called back to cut
the doors off but when the third time they were called, they refused to cut the
doors.  A law suit was now taking place and he was asked if the beam had been
built to engineered speciations.  I told him that if they would pull a straight
string down the roof ridge, or sight down it, they would find that the roof
sagged down where the beam was attached underneath.  It was several months
later that I again had the opportunity to ask Larry, how the law suit ended
up.  He said that when he told them of how I had added steel reinforcement to
the design, but that the engineered plans had been followed exactly, he never
heard any more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                After I got home
from work I finished the painting of our doors.  We had a very enjoyable Family
Home Evening.  After putting the children down for the evening, Mae and I set
up and talked for some time.  Mae is sure wonderful, in every way!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Tuesday, November 06, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I went into work
this morning but when I got to the job site, the materials were still locked up
and there was no power available.  Maybe I should explain here.  Because of the
great amount of theft of building materials in most construction areas,
contractors have found it necessary to put up 10 foot chain link fencing with
bobbed wire topping and locked gates.  Some also release watch dogs into the
area.  This morning the security had not been removed.  Also because of the
high demand of new construction the power company no longer installs temporary
power supplies and so either the contractor or each crew has to furnish
generators for the crew.  As a result that neither power nor materials were
available this morning our crew just went home for the day.  Having the day off
(without pay) it gave me time to finish the painting and re-hanging the door in
our house.  This evening Mae and I went Christmas Shopping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Wednesday, November 07, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                Work went better
today.  After I finished work I went over to Larry’s.  he has a Palm tree in
his front Yard that was planted to close to the house.  He needed help to
remove it and since it was a good looking tree, we thought that we might
transplant it into our front yard.  Larry had already arranged for a tractor, a
trailer and chains, so we dug around the base of the tree, tying canvas around
the root ball and using chains and the tractor, with great effort was able to
load the tree onto the trailer.  We had not estimated the great weight that the
Palm tree had.  The trailer that we used had the capacity to haul a medium size
tractor but it still was overloaded with the tree.  We had to drive very
carefully from Larry’s to my place.  When we first got to our home, we dug a
hole, deep enough to hold the tree ball.   Again with chains, come-a-longs and
a lot of physical labor we put the tree into the hole.  It was a lot harder to
move than we thought it would be.  Although we tried to care for the tree, it
never did take root and finally had to be removed and hauled to the dumps. 
This evening Mae and I went out to eat at a Chinese Restraint, with Lois and
Deloy Porter.  We had an enjoyable evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Thursday, November 08, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I left work
today with an uneasy feeling about the way we are coming out financially with
the jobs.  I am concerned that Larry cannot continue this way.  It looks to me
that we are going into a down slump with construction here in the Phoenix
area.  When Larry had me come to work for him, he had five crews of men working
full time but now he is starting to lay men off.  This evening I worked in the
Temple Baptistery as my normal assigned evening.  Mae, Jim and Marion came with
me although they went through an Endowment Session while I worked in the
Baptistery.  We met afterwards and the four of us went out for pizza and to
enjoy visiting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Friday, November 09, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I worked late
today, trying to get some things finished up.  This evening there was a special
large group coming to perform Baptistiams for the Dead and so they had asked
for extra help.  I had volunteered to help and so went into the Temple.  I got
home after 9:00 this evening.  Sandy had been called to do some Baby Sitting
and so Mae and I waited up until she was brought home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Saturday, November 10, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I did a few
things around the house for Mae.  Later I took Mike and David with me and we
went up to Vic Shield’s where I cut a door off for him.  When I finished that
task, we took our family to the church house where we had out pictures taken
for a Ward Directory.  After taking the children back home, Mae and I went over
to Jim and Marion’s where we weeded their garden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Sunday, November 11, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                Everything went
well at Church today.  This evening I prepared dinner and then played with the
children on the floor.  We went over to Larry and Tammy’s this evening.  We
enjoyed just visiting with them along with playing rook.  It was late when we
got home and put the children to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Monday, November 12, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                When I got home
from work, all my family was looking forward to having Family Home Evening. 
However I got a call asking if I would help with a Ward project.  Then at
7:30pm I had to go up to the Church House where I joined with the entire ward
clerks to have our picture taken for the Ward Directory.  By the time I returned
home it was bed time.  The children were disappointed that we missed our Family
Night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Tuesday, November 13, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                When I got home
from work today, I built a fence around our furnace and air conditioner.  After
dinner this evening we held a Family Home Evening in place of the one we missed
last night.  Someone must have given Sandy a kitten as I have noted that it
kept us awake most of the night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Wednesday, November 14, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                At work today,
we poured concrete at Larry’s home.  If my memory is correct, for the past few
days of work, it has consisted of Larry’s five crew leaders digging, forming
and pouring a swimming pool.  The concrete was for the patio around the pool. 
Larry had previously purchased a plastic pool liner that had corrugated liner
to hold up the plastic liner.  We dug the hole for the pool to set down in and
formed the patio around it.  As crew leaders, we realize that Larry is doing
this just to give us work.  He has let all the rest of the workers go as there
is no work right now.  I wonder just how long this can last.  When I talked to
Larry about it, his answer was that if he let his crew leaders go he was out of
business.  When I got home from work, Jim, Marion, Mae and I went to the Temple
to do an Endowment session.  When we got home I was sure tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Thursday, November 15, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                We, the five
crew leaders, went out on a job.  When we got there, the material had not been
delivered.  We waited until 10:30 and then came back home.  No work today!  I
didn’t get much done around our home when I got there either.  This evening I
went into the Temple for my normal Baptistery assignment.  When I got home, Mae
and I watched a show on TV before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Friday, November 16, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                My Diary didn’t
contain anything about going to work.  This evening we tended Larry and Tammy’s
children as they went out of town after fire wood.  Brother and Sister Tryon
came over this evening just to visit.  We sure enjoyed their visit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Saturday, November 17, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                After breakfast
I weeded our garden, then changed the oil and greased our station wagon.  We
then took our children, Larry four children, Marion and Malinda Frazer to the
Phoenix Zoo.  I don’t remember if Marion drove her car or not.  If she didn’t,
we sure had a car full but at that time we didn’t have the seat belt law and
our station wagon could really be packed.  When we returned home I packed the
wheel bearing in the station wagon.  This evening we attended a Ward Dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Sunday, November 18, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                It was a fairly
normal Sunday except that this evening Mae had a meeting to attend.  I stayed
home with the children.  Sandy also had an interview to receive a Limited
Temple Recommend.  This will make it possible for her to be proxy to be
baptized for the dead.  She wants to be able to attend with me on my normal
Thursday evening assignment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Monday, November 19, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                Today was a cold
day and we noticed it at work.  As I arrived on the job site, men were standing
around a small fire to warm them self.  On the radio the weather man announced
that it was a cold 70 degree this morning.  I couldn’t help smiling to realize
how we have become acclimatized to the Arizona weather in the past three
years.  Mae has been very busy today and when I got home from work she was sure
tired.  We had a nice Family Home Evening tonight.  After putting the little
ones to bed I worked on finding our winter clothing in preparation to go to
Utah for Thanksgiving.  Mae and I decorated for Sandy’s Birthday before going
to bed.  We are going to celebrate her Birthday tomorrow as we will leave for
Utah on Wednesday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Tuesday, November 20, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                We let Sandy
open her Birthday presents this morning.  I was able to get the main order for
our Wards Church Magazine drive, in the mail this afternoon.  Mae fed the
little children before I got home from work.  After I got home, Mae and I took
Sandy out to dinner in honor of her Birthday tomorrow.  This evening we had the
Premax‘s over for ice cream and cake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Wednesday, November 21, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I went to work
but took off at 12:30PM so that we could get packed and off to Utah.  It was
about 3pm when we finally got away.  We went by way of Las Vegas so that we
missed the mountain snowy roads.  With the station wagon the children were able
to sleep when they got tired.  With the exceptions of bathroom breaks we drove
straight through.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Thursday, November 22, 1973     Thanksgiving
Day</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                We didn’t arrive
at Mae’s parents until 6am.  We carried the children in and then Mae and I went
to bed.  I slept until 9AM but Mae slept until 11AM.  Mom and Dad Porter had
Thanksgiving dinner at their place.  Rick and Georgia came for dinner as well
as Terry and Kim were there.  About 4PM we took our family over to Bob and
Carrols where we again had pie and ice cream.  Mom and Dad Jensen also got
there about 4PM.  We enjoyed visiting and playing games.  This evening we went
back to Mom and Dad Porters where we slept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Friday, November 23, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                Today Bob and
Carroll again invited us down to their place at 4PM.  They had a wonderful
dinner with all the trimmings.  Mom and Dad Jensen along with all of my
siblings and family except Roy’s family were there.  We ate, visited and to
play games.  This evening Mae went over to Shirley Murdock’s where Shirley and
RaNae Barney gave her a baby shower.  We were mid-night before getting back to
Mom and Dad porters and to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Saturday, November 24, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                After getting
going this morning, Mae and I went over to Georgia and Rick’s and visited with
them.  We then went over to Bishop Delmar Moulin and his sweet wife June.  From
there we stopped over and visited with Nike (Marrine) Dransfield who was the
Stake Young Wemon’s President and had called Mae to serve as one of her
counselors.  Before going back to Mom and Dad Porter’s we stopped and bought
some vitamins and some apples.  This evening Mae’s mother invited some of her
family to come and have a Christmas party as we will not be here at Christmas
time.  Mae stayed there and played games and I went over to Bob’s where I
played games with some of my siblings.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Sunday, November 25, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                We attended
Priesthood and Sunday school in Mom and Dad Porter ward.  When we returned Mom
Porter had prepared a wonderful dinner.  My family attended Sacrament meeting
at the Clearfield 1<sup>st</sup> Ward.  We sure enjoyed seeing so many of the
people that we had grown to love when we lived here.  This evening I got the
car packed so we can get an early start for home in the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Monday, November 26, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                We left Mae’s
parents at 6:45am, stopping at Bob’s for just a few minutes before leaving for
home.  It snowed last night and so the roads were quite bad until we got to
Cedar City and then they cleared up.  We again stopped only when necessary but
it was still 12:30AM when we got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Tuesday, November 27, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I went back to
work this morning although I was tired.  This evening I took Sandy over to the
Stake Presidents office where she got her Temple Recommend signed.  Mom
Porter’s has some friends that are spending the winter here in Sunny Arizona. 
When they came down from Utah Mom had sent a box of fruit with them.  Mom had
bottled the fruit last fall, for us.  After getting Sandy’s recommend signed,
we drove over to their place and picked up the box.  We are sure going to enjoy
those perseverates.  This evening I attended the Stake Oral Evaluation whit the
Bishopric.  After returning home this evening we had a salesman give us a
demonstration on a water softener.  It would be nice and with the hard Arizona
water, we could us it, but we can’t afford one now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Wednesday, November 28, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                Work went ok
today.  After getting home and having dinner, Mae and I went over to Dr. Opies
for a treatment.  When we returned we rested for a while and then played games
with the children.  When bedtime came for the little ones, Mae put them to
bed.  Sandy and I played a game of marbles while she did that.  Mae and I then
went over to the Allen’s just to visit with them.  When we came back home we
watched a show on TV before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Thursday, November 29, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                When I got home
from work and had some dinner, Sandy and I went to the Temple.  Sandy acted as
proxy and was baptized for 10 sisters.  I was assigned as the baptizer this
evening and so was able to baptize Sandy.  After finishing this evening and as
Sandy and I drove home, we had a good visit as to the importance of Temple work
for the Dead.  Mae and I again watched a show on TV before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Friday, November 30, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                This evening
after dinner I played with the children on the floor until they had me worn
out.  With this being the last day of the month, I still needed to visit the
Essley’s as their Home Teacher.  I took Mae with me to be my partner tonight to
make the visit.  We did have a nice visit with them.  We then picked up our
proofs for the Ward Directory.  From there we went over to Larry and Tammy’s
and visited for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Saturday, December 01, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I worked today
to help make up some of my time that I lost during our Thanksgiving trip to
Utah.  After getting home, I cleaned up and then we took our family shopping
for a Christmas tree, but there were no lots that have opened up yet.  To
overcome the disappointment we stopped and bought hamburgers for dinner, then
went to the park where the children enjoyed playing for a while.  When we got
home we let the children stay up and we watched some TV for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Sunday, December 02, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                This morning was
a busy morning for me.  Starting with Bishopric meeting, then Priesthood
Executive meeting, followed by normal Fast Sunday meetings.  I also started
preparing for yearend Tithing Settlement appointments with the Bishop.  After
meetings we had invited Jerry Hanselman to our place for dinner.  Mae as normal
had a lovely dinner.  Jerry had brought some of his slides that he had taken
while in Europe to show us.  Jerry is a great friend that I have enjoyed being
with every since we met at Hugh’s Air West.  It has been quite a nice day, but
we went to bed early and quite tired.  <i>** I may have already explained about
the appointments that I have been making for Tithing Settlement this year, but
I am not sure and so I will enter some explanation here.</i>  Last year in early
November, the Lehi Ward, which we lived in, was divided into the Lehi 1<sup>st</sup>
and the Lehi 2<sup>nd</sup> wards.  Bishop Price was released and Bishop Carl Reese
was sustained as Bishop of the 1<sup>st</sup> Ward and Bishop Shield was sustained
as Bishop of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward.  A week or two after the reorganization
Bishop Price came into the office asking for Bishop Reese.  I was there and
told Bishop Price that Bishop Reese was in his office but he was in an
interview and could not be disturbed right now.  Bishop Price explained that
due to Ward division being late in the year, Salt Lake Presiding Bishopric
office had sent the Tithing Settlement Receipts to his mailing address.  He
therefore devided the receipts up according to the new Ward boundaries and he
gave me our Wards receipts to give to Bishop Reese.  When Bishop Reese was
finished with the interview and came out of his office, he saw the package.  He
asked what the package was and I told him that it was his surprise for the
year.  I then explained that for a new Bishops, there first Tithing Settlement
was usually a surprised.  He replied, “Brother Browning, I have lived in this
ward for many years and I know these people, it will not be a surprise to me!” 
Following the end of last year tithing settlement and at the first Ward Council
meeting Bishop Reese’s opening comments were “Brother Browning told me that
tithing settlement would be a surprise to me.  I told him that it wouldn’t be a
surprise to me.”  He then added, “Was I wrong and was I surprised!”  Nothing
else was said about it until this year when he got this years, Year End Tithing
Settlement receipts; he told the Ward Council that last year he had to sign the
majority of the Tithing Settlements Receipts as signed by Bishop.  This year he
wanted at least one person from each family in the Ward to come into his office
and report for that family.  His plan was to announce in each meeting for two
weeks that Signup Sheets for Tithing Settlements are posted at the Bishop’s
Office.  After the two weeks, and he turned to me, you will call each family
that has not signed up and make an appointment for them to come into the office
and meet with him as Bishop.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Monday, December 03, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                When I got home
from work, we had dinner and then we had a Family Home Evening lesson.  I had
to go up to the church to be in a picture with the clerks of our Ward.  When I
got home we had out refreshments and then we all loaded into the station wagon
and went up town looking for Christmas trees but the trees still hadn’t
arrived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I was late
getting home from work this evening.  Mae had dinner ready and when I finished
eating I went up to the church house to help with Home Teaching Oral
Evaluations between the Priesthood Leaders and the Bishopric.  I didn’t get
home until 10:45pm.  Mae was busy with Primary preparations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                When I got home
from work, Mae informed me that David had woke with a cough and has been sick
all day.  I set down with the kids and watched a show on TV with them before
dinner.  I then met with our Ward Librarians, at the church, to demonstrate the
new copy machine that our Ward reassembly purchased.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Thursday, December 06, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I finished up
the job at Fort McDowell, which I have been working on for the past while.  I
came home a little early.  Mae and the children were at Primary when I got
home.  When they got home Mae told me that David was feeling much better today. 
This evening I went to the Temple on my regular assignment.  After returning
home I found Mae busy with Primary preparations.  I watched a show on TV while
I waited for Mae to finish her preparations so that we could go to bed
together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Friday, December 07, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                Mae has been
busy all day preparing for a Primary Christmas Lunching with all the Primary
leaders.  When I got home we took all the family out looking for a Christmas
tree.  This time we were successful and found a nice tree for $13.50 that we
bought.  After getting home we had dinner and while the rest of the family
watched a Christmas show on TV, I got the tree into the house and got it
decorated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Saturday, December 08, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                After breakfast
I went up to the Opies where I finished the remodeling I have been doing for
them.  When I got home at 3pm I took my children Christmas shopping.  At 4:30PM
I attended the first session of our Stake Conference, which I believe was for
Bishopric’s and Ward Clerks.  If my memory is correct Elder Tom L. Perry was
the visiting author, at that time I believe that he was an Assistant to the
Twelve.  He talked to us as to what was the most important date we were to put
on our calendar as we made our monthly plans.  He opened it up for comments and
got several ideas.  After some thoughts were presented he said “The most important
date to calendar was a weekly date night with our wife’s.”  “Some time needs to
be planned for spending one on one time with our Eternal Partner”.  Marion and
Jim Fraizer went with Mae and I to the 7PM session.  Following that session the
four of went out to eat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Sunday, December 09, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                We had Stake
Conference this morning so that took the place of today’s meetings.  Mike
didn’t feel well this morning so Mae stayed home from conference with him. 
After conference was over and we had dinner, I went up to the church house
where I worked on Tithing Settlement and also preparing for the sale of tickets
for the upcoming “Know Your Religion” classes.  I also called both Rich and
Irven about my concerns with the construction work down here.  I just let them
know that I was putting out feelers for what I might be facing.  This evening
we went over to the Fraizer’s just to visit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Monday, December 10, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                After getting
home from work today, I trimmed the palm tree way back as it isn’t looking very
good.  After dinner this evening we held our F.H.E.  That went well and every
seemed to have a good time.  We then discussed Christmas plans.  After putting
the little ones to bed, we left Sandy in charge while Mae and I walked over to
meet Don Studson and his family.  They are a new family that has just moved
into our sub-division.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Tuesday, December 11, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                When I got home
from work, I finished building the fence around the air-conditioner.  Larry and
Tammy came by to visit for a few minutes.  After dinner I went up to the Church
House where I was busy in the office until 9:30pm.  (I believe tonight I
received instructions from Bishop Reese that I should start making appointment
for those that had not sign up for Tithing Settlement.)  When I returned home,
Mae was watching a show on TV so I set with her until it finished at 10PM.  We
then visited about our concerns over finances and how stable work will be with
Larry and the building slump we are in.  It seems that I always get into the
building trade just before a big slump takes place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Wednesday, December 12, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                This evening
after returning from work and having dinner all the family got into the station
wagon and we went to the Owen Mills Portrait Studio at the Thomas Mall in
Phoenix, where we had pictures taken.  Following the pictures, we decided that
as we were already at the Mall, we took the time to walk through the mall and
see the Christmas Decorations.  This evening I made more appointments for Ward
members to meet with Bishop Reese for the year end tithing settlement.  Mae
sure is a supportive and wonderful wife.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Thursday, December 13, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                When I returned
home from work, Mae and the children were at Primary.  Mae drove me up to the
Temple tonight as she has need of the car.  While there I visited with the
supervisor over the Baptistery and explained that Mae and I felt that with my
calling as Executive Secretary and with the stress of work, we felt that I
should be released from my Temple Calling.  He expressed appreciation for my
work but felt that he could realize my needs.  This evening we had an extra
large group of proxies, but it went well.  When Mae came to the Temple to get
me, we took the time to go to the cafeterias where we had a bowl of soup.  I
will certainly miss this experience of each week being in the Temple.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Friday, December 14, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                At work today
there wasn’t enough work for me to put in a full day.  I got home early and
built some drawers for Larry.  This evening at 7PM Mae and I attended a
Christmas party but on by the Bishopric in honor of the Ward Clerks.  It was a
wonderful evening and I felt it a great privilege to be able to work with these
Brethren.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Saturday, December 15, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                This morning
Mae, Shellie, Mike, David and I went with Larry and his family, to the
mountains above Pine, Arizona to get firewood.  It is also a chance for the
children to play in the snow.  Sandy stayed home as she wanted to go to a
production “The Nut Cracker Ballay” with Lori Premack.  After returning Mae and
the children went to a Ward Christmas party.  This evening Mae and I went to
the Know Your Religion classes.  It was a great evening!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Sunday, December 16, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                This morning I
attended Ward Executive meeting.  I reported to Bishop Reese that in making the
calls for the appointment to Tithing Settlement, I had one person refuse to
make an appointment and when I put some pressure telling her that the Bishop
wanted to visit with her, she slammed the receiver down hard.  Bishop Reese,
after a moment turned to Brother Opie, asking, aren’t you her uncle?  When
Brother Opie said Yes, Bishop asked him to contact her to make the
appointment.  The rest of the morning was busy as normal.  In Sacrament Brother
Robert VanBeekum was sustained as 2<sup>nd</sup> Councilor in the Bishopric. 
This evening we had invited Deloy &amp; Lois Porter over.  I have a note that
we attended an open house at Brother and Sister Leon Wright’s this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Monday, December 17, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                This evening we
joined with the Braithwaite’s for Family Home Evening at their place.  We had a
nice dimmer and following that the children under the direction of Sandy and
Lori put on a Christmas Nativity.  It was very well done with all of the
children participating in the program.  Following that we watched slid pictures
that brought back many great memories.  It was a very enjoyable evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Tuesday, December 18, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                On the way to
work this morning the Chevrolet broke down.  <i>I didn’t indicate what went out
on the Chevrolet or how I got to work or back home! </i>Mae picked up some food
storage today.  Following dinner this evening we went to the Whitman Elementary
school where we enjoyed a concert.  Sandy was singing in the chorus tonight. 
This evening I again work on making Tithing Settlement appointments.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Wednesday, December 19, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                After work I had
to stop and get some parts and some tools so that I can repair the car.  Larry
wanted me to stop at his place for a few minutes and he suggested that I buy a
van for work.  That way my tools could be inside where they were locked up for
security and I would have a heaver vehicle for work.  When I got home Mae ahd I
went over to Phoenix to pick out picture proofs.  This evening we took all our
family Christmas Caroling especially stopping at selected widows homes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Thursday, December 20, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                I took off work
early today so that I could look for a van.  I also had some errands that Mae
wanted me to do.  At 6pm I found a van that looks pretty good, but I want to
think about it.  I had to hurry to get to the church house to help with Tithing
Settlement.  The first three appointments did not show up.  When the fourth
appointment showed and was taken into the Bishops office, before the Bishop
closed the door he gave me instructions to call the first three families and
tell them that he, Bishop Reese, had been waiting for them for over an hour and
he expected them to make a new appointment with him and keep it.  The first one
that I called said, “He is serious, isn’t he!”  I said that he was.  They
re-scheduled and I believe the word soon go out as from then on everyone kept
their appointments.  Bishop Reese told me that he would sell me his Suborn at
Low-Book.  I wish I could but the price would still be out of my range.  It was
mid-night when I got home and to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>Friday, December 21, 1973</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>                As closing time
came for work, Larry came around and gave me a new $100.00 bill and a nice size
ham as a Christmas Bonus.  I stopped at the car lot and got the papers on the
van, taking then to the Credit Union and applied for a loan on the van.  They
approved the loan and gave me a check which I went back to the car lot and
picked up the van.  I then went home and took my family for a ride in the van. 
We then went up to the church house where my family had an appointment with
Bishop Reese for our yearend report, it went just as normal as any other
Tithing Settlement we have attended.  I have often wondered what Bishop Reese
said to the others when they came in.  Whether it was the fact that he just
visited with every family or if it was something that he said, but this much I
know that in the future our wards statics rose dramatically.  After meeting
with Bishop Reese, we took the children home where Sandy tended them.  Mae and
I went to the store to do some shopping and then we went out to eat.</p>
