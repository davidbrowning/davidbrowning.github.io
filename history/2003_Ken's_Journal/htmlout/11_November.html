<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in until 6:30 this morning, took a
shower and could smell breakfast cooking.  Sister Hyer made us a nice
breakfast.  We had a very special time visiting with them for a while before
leaving to go home.  As we got back to Tarlac I drove over by the C. E. S.
building just to show Mae the small drive way to get to it.  We drove around
and got into the holiday traffic as today is also the Philippines Memorial
Day.  Flowers and candles were being sold everywhere and traffic was terrible. 
We went to the mall and did some grocery shopping, and then came on home.  We
were both very tired so laid down for a nap.  This afternoon we got on the
computer and checked our e-mail.  We had an e-mail from Jeff, Scott, Maggie
Klass, Gale, Maryon Frazier, Billie Ririe, Kim Porter and Linda Browning. 
Scott and Maggie’s e-mails were to let us know that on Wednesday, Keith Nelson
drowned when he and two other men were fishing at Strawberry reservoir.   They
got into a storm and the boat capsized.  The other two made it out but Keith
did not.  This was very sad news.  Jeff and Gale’s e-mails were very special,
expressing lots of love in them.  Kim’s was quite humors telling about a hiking
and biking trip he, Bryce and Noland had.  Linda’s was just a poem she sent on,
but it fit me quite well today.  I wrote a letter to Sister Nelson expressing
out sympathy and love.  I e-mailed it to Scott, asking him to print it and
deliver it to Sister Nelson.  I spent some time catching my journal up to date. 
We also talked to President and Sister Clark on the phone this evening.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We again slept in until 6:30 AM then we had to
hurry to be ready to leave at 7:30 AM for Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  I
worked on their I. O. S. until time for Sacrament meeting.  Their records are
really a mess so it is going to take some doing to get them corrected. 
President and Sister Brimhall attended Sacrament meeting with us, and then they
had some other business to take care of.  I worked on records between the two
branches meetings.  I gave a 15 to 20 minute talk on Home Teaching during the
Priesthood meeting.  We attended the rest of the block with Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch.  President and Sister Brimhall also came back for part of the
meetings.  We came home after Sacrament Meeting and prepared a casserole and
put it in the oven to cook while we went to a meeting on the Health Fair. 
After that meeting we came home and ate even though the missionaries weren’t
here yet. When Elder Clam and Elder Ragasa came we fed them.  We visited for a
few minutes and then when they left, we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking at C. L. S. U. this
morning.  It was a very beautiful morning and with collage being out, it is
quite peaceful.  At 10AM we got on line with Jeff and Scott using instant
messaging.  It was great to visit with them, asking questions and having them
reply right back.  We visited for about 45 minutes.  We got a special e-mail
from Shellie.  We are sure blessed with a neat family.  I took the car and got
it washed.  It started to rain just as they finished with the car.  I had to
chase around trying to find some place to service the car, finally getting it
done in San Jose.  This evening I started sorting the I. O. S. sheets from
Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> branch into alphabetical order.  Mae worked on entering
the C. M. I S. data into our computer for the Rizal 1<sup>st</sup> Ward and
finished it quite late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in until 6:30 AM and so didn’t go
walking today.  We were busy all day but did do some chasing trying to get a
power point projector for this Saturday.  We were on the phone trying to get
everything arranged for the Leadership Training this Saturday and the plans for
going to the Manila Temple on Monday and Tuesday.  Elder Maharry called and got
the use of a projector for Saturday.  Mae and I spent a lot of time on the
C.M.I.S. for Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  Mae finished getting them in
alphabetical order while I worked on them to check for errors.  There are lots
so I will have Brother Sargun help me tomorrow.  Mae got on the internet at
8:55PM and we noticed that Scott was on also, so we checked to see if we could
get him.  We did and he was just getting up and wanted to check for a
web-sight.  We visited for a few minutes.  It is quite neat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up late but still went walking at the
collage.  Mae prepared breakfast while I showered and got ready to go.  I went
out to Guimba and picked up the Elders at their apartment.  We went over to the
chapel and worked on Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch I. O. C. S. getting it ready
to return to the P. B. O. on Monday.  We then drove over to the Doria family
and I took them a large bucket of cookies and checked to see if they had
received the books we had bought for them.  They have not received the books. 
I asked the Elders to check to see if they can find what happened to them.  I
came home after taking the Elders back to their place.  Mae had been working on
her presentation along with other things on the computer.  Just as I got home,
President Brimhall called and felt that we should not stay at the Missionary
Reception Center.  I said that was fine with me.  He said that he would call
Brother Hyer and talk to President Clark.  Mae also told me that Sister Clark
called and said that her son could get us a power point projector for $1,000 if
we wanted.  I have got to think that over.  I balanced our checking account and
worked on my presentation for Saturday.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday, November 05, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went walking for a few minutes at the
collage.  We had Elder Clam and Elder Ragasa over for breakfast, and then they
helped us write up an announcement to be passed out at District Conference
informing people of the Employment Fireside on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of
November.  Mae did go over to the copy store and get the announcement printed
and I went down town and paid the phone bill.  Other than that we were on the
computer working on our presentations for Saturday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday, November 07, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We left for Paniqui at 7AM to attend District
meeting with the Paniqui Elders.  Mae made a Texas Cake for the Elders before
we left.  She also gave me a hair cut.  After District meeting we went over to
the Camiline area and waited to see Elder Stokes’ parents who came to get him
as his mission is complete.  They had been waiting for his parents to come to
start their District Meeting as Elder Stokes hadn’t seen his parents yet and
wanted them to be there for the District Meeting.  Finally, they decided to
start without them.  It wasn’t the usual District Meeting as Elder Stokes’
companion asked all the Elders to stand and give a tribute to Elder Stokes and
also another Elder who had finished his mission and will be going home next
Wednesday.  The tributes were beautiful, they all had wonderful things to say
about Elder Stokes especially, as he was their zone leader.  Then they had the
4 Samoan Elders sing a beautiful “farewell” song to him in Samoan.  They had
beautiful voices, and harmonized so great, I loved it.  All the Elder stood and
sang “Army of Heleman” and Elder Ling-a-ling accompanied them on the piano.  He
is fantastic.  He can’t read a note and has never had a piano lesson, but he
can hear the music and play fantastic.  He is so talented.  He is from Samoa
and has a beautiful voice also.    Mae also stood and gave a tribute as we had
been invited to come to this zone and give our H.T./V.T. presentation to them
and we had been very impressed with this young zone leader.  By this time,
Elder Stokes’ parents had arrived.  They asked the parents to speak and they
did a beautiful job.  His mother said that she had a dream the night before
that she was speaking here, so she was prepared and did excellent, so did the
father.  Then the two Elders, who were leaving spoke and did excellent.  Elder
Stokes said he had no regrets; he had given his best to the Lord.  That was so
neat.  They sang “Army of Heleman” again so the parents could videotape it, and
again we loved it.  Brother Stokes gave Mae and I a treatment as he is a
chiropractor.  President Brimhall stopped by and met the parents and spoke with
them a few minutes.  He told them that when a zone was having struggles and not
doing so good, he would transfer Elder Stokes there and immediate it would
climb and improve dramatically.  From here, we went over to Elder &amp; Sister
Maharry’s and visited with them about this leadership training.  They fed us
dinner at 4PM.  From there we went to San Jose and bought some groceries and to
the bank to withdraw some money for Monday.  We are sure tired tonight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in a little later than usual as we were
still tired from the day before, so we didn’t go walking.  After our usual
morning routine, I helped Mae with a couple of things needing to be done around
the house.  Mae worked all morning cleaning, baking a Texas cake and making a
chicken &amp; rice casserole as Elder &amp; Sister Clark are coming for dinner
today, spending the night with us and then after dinner tomorrow they will head
back to Clark Field in Angeles.  We had Guimba District Conference training
today and Sunday will be the conference meeting.  It is 4 to 5 hours away, so
we told President and Sister Clark they were welcome to stay overnight, in
fact, we were hoping they would so we could enjoy visiting and teach them how
to play “Mormon Bridge” as we brought a set of Rook cards with us and haven’t
had much chance to use them yet.  I worked the rest of the morning on my
presentation, taking pictures of different records and inserting them into my
power point presentation which I gave with Elder Maharry and Brother
Montemayor.  It went over well.  Mae was doing training with Sister Brimhall,
Sister Clark and Sister Maharry, and she said it went well also.  It was a
3-hour training, but they were attentive and seemed to enjoy it and understand
what we were telling them.  We came home and enjoyed eating dinner together
with President and Sister Clark and then watched the beautiful “Joy to the
World” video which Sister Clark brought us.  Her cousin is over the Church media
and so he sent them to her.  We then played Mormon Bridge until 10:30.  It’s
been a good day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We prepared breakfast of French toast and
Scrambled Eggs and really enjoyed having the Clarks here with us.  We attended
District Conference and really enjoyed that meeting.  The district Presidency
each spoke and I assume that this will be the last time the three of them will
be speaking together as President Nuque will be going to Panama to work on the
20<sup>th</sup> of this month.  He will really be missed.  President and Sister
Brimhall gave wonderful talks.  Sister Brimhall really gave straight talk about
the children running around during meetings.  I hope it helps!!!  We stayed
after for a meeting with the Health Faire committee, although I got very little
out of it.  There was usually 2 or more speaking at the same time and they were
mostly in Tagalog.  The Clarks came back home with us and stayed for dinner and
to visit a little longer.  They were just leaving when Elder Clam and Elder
Ragasa stopped to pickup the mail.  We offered them a dish of cake and Ice
cream, which the excepted and then they left for some appointments.  Mae got on
the computer and got a letter ready to send to our family.  I got some things
ready for our trip to the Manila Temple tomorrow, while Mae was working on the
letter.  It was them time to write my journal entry and get to bed.  Good
night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We got up early to get ready to
leave by 7AM that we might meet at the Hyers in Tarlac by 10AM.  As I tried to
start the car, the battery was almost dead and would not turn over the engine. 
We tried to find a neighbor that could jump the battery, but no one was
available.  We called the Zone Leaders to let them know we were running late, as
we had told them we would stop by to pick up some items.  I told them my
problem and in a few minutes they were there with Brother Marlin Dator on his
trike.  Marlin had a wrench and we removed the battery, then he took me to
downtown Munoz, where we bought a new battery.  We came back and installed
it.   I asked him how much I owed him and he said: “Whatever you feel is fine,
Elder”.  I handed him 200 pesos and he said “no, that is too much”.  I was
about to take 100 back, but then the thought came to me that he went out of his
way to do this for me and he was missing getting fares from his trike business,
so I had him keep the full amount.  He was grateful and I felt good because it
helped us both.  We called the Hyers and told them that we were late and that
we would just meet them at the mission home in Angeles.  When we got to Clark
Base, we bought some groceries at the Duty Free Stores.  The Hyers and Maharrys
didn’t get to the mission home until almost 2PM as all of them went shopping at
the Duty Free Stores also since we can get American groceries and other items
there.  We all went out to lunch before leaving for Manila.  When we got to
Manila, President Clark tried to follow Elder Hire, as Elder Hyer knew where
the Holliday Inn was located.  That was really quite an experience driving in
the Manila traffic and trying to keep up with him.  We finally found it and
checked in.  The rooms were very nice, probably the nicest Mae and I have been
in.  As you entered, you came into a room which had beautiful large mirrors, a
beautiful desk, couch &amp; coffee table, beautiful pictures, marble topped
table, etc., then you passed by the kitchenette with fridge filled with drinks
and food (you pay for if you take any) and snacks on another table.  There was
a large beautiful bath room and then the large beautiful bedroom with tables,
comfortable chairs, king sized bed, etc.  It had beautiful mahogany crown
molding everywhere and chandeliers, etc.  It was wonderful, we couldn’t believe
they had this beautiful hotel in the Philippines – but guess wealthy people
come here too.  Elder Hyer was brought to the Holiday Inn by one of the
brethren that worked at the Presiding Bishoprics Office and because of him; we
were able to get the Filippino rate, instead of the American tourist price so
it was only $50.00 instead of $170.00.  Our room was on the 20<sup>th</sup>
floor, with a beautiful view of the city.  It is quite nice that far above the
city, you can’t see the poverty.  Plus we overlooked a very wealthy housing
area.   The hotel has 30 floors.  We had a full wall window overlooking the
city and it was spectacular looking out at the lights of the city at night.  It
reminded us of movies, we have seen, where apartments or offices looked like
this.  All of us met, after putting our things in our rooms, and went walking
through the large beautiful mall that is attached.  We got us something light
to eat.  When we went back to our room, I turned on the TV and J. A. G. was
playing.  We had missed most of it but I watched the end of it anyway.  After
it ended we tried to find something else but couldn’t so after enjoying the
lights of the city again, we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We got up early and went down
stairs to meet the others at 6:30 AM for breakfast.  The hotel furnished a very
nice buffet breakfast.  There was practically everything you can imagine to eat
there - table after table of food.  After eating, we went over to the P. B. O.
(Presiding Bishoprics Office) where we met President and Sister Brimhall.  We
rode in a van, out to the World Trade Center, to attend a Bazaar.  President
and Sister Brimhall had rented a van and driver for us.  The women enjoyed
shopping.  I stayed with Mae for a while, but then I sat down in the food area
and ate and visited with others.  Just before we left, Mae and the other
sisters met Sister Oaks and Sister Maynes  (not sure if her name is spelled
correctly.  Her husband is 1<sup>st</sup> counselor to President Oaks)  Mae and
the other sisters enjoyed visiting with them and then Sister Hyer, Sister Clark
and Mae were able to have their pictures takes with them.  Sister Brimhall and
Sister Maharry were still shopping so didn’t see them.   Sister Maharry was
disappointed that she didn’t see them, but her and her husband did see
President Oaks and President Maynes.  This afternoon all of us went through a
session at the Manila Temple.  That was very enjoyable.  We then went to
Chilli’s Restaurant for dinner.  That was very good.  Again, Mae and I rode
with the Clarks, as we left Manila for Clark Field.  We told the Hyers we would
pick up their groceries and other supplies; which they had left at the Mission
office, and bring to them.  When we got to the mission office and I went to get
the car, I remembered that I had put my car keys in our suit case, which was in
the Hyer’s van.  I called Brother Hyer and told him my problem.  He said he had
two choices, 1<sup>st</sup> to forget that he knew me and 2<sup>nd</sup> to
come back.  We had to laugh.  About that time Sister Clark asked Elder Clark if
he had an extra key, to our car, in our file in the office.  He did, so we were
able to use our car.  It was 10:30 PM when we got to the Hyer’s.  They invited
us to stay at their place for the night.  We were grateful to accept their
offer, as we were very tired by then.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We got up and ate breakfast with
the Hyers, then left for home.  We stopped in at the Honda Dealership to see
about getting a couple of items checked on the car, but they said it would take
them until 3PM to complete it so we just let it go and came home.  We laid down
and took a nap after getting home.  Marlyn prepared a nice lunch for us and we
invited Elder Ragasa and Elder Clam to eat with us as Elder Ragasa is being
transferred so this would be the last time to see him, at least in this zone. 
He had called and acted sad to leave us, so Mae invited them over.  We got some
e-mails that we enjoyed, especially one from Scott, with a recording of Kylan
singing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game”.  We really enjoyed that.  After the
Elders and Marlyn left, we took another nap as the trip seemed to completely
wear us out.  This evening we met and visited with some of our families and
explained to them that our assignment has been changed so we won’t be meeting
with them on a regular basis any more, but that we had grown to love them and
we hoped they would keep preparing to go to the temple to be sealed as a
family.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We got up and went walking this
morning.  I was going to adjust the lights on the car, but I didn’t have the
needed wrench to do it.  We were on the computer a lot today, plus reading and
studying.  This evening we had Eve &amp; Eliza Gajonera over to see the new
church video “Joy to the World”.  We also showed them some pictures we had
taken of them on different occasions, plus we showed them pictures of our
family.  We had invited her sister Jean and her family, plus their mother, but
Eve had changed her phone number again and didn’t receive our txt, so just the
two girls came.  They came about 6PM.  We walked them up to the road about 9PM.
where they caught a jeepnie to go home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mae let me sleep in as I didn’t
sleep very well last night.  My stomach was giving me trouble with acid reflex
and my feet and lower legs felt like they were on fire.  I set up in my chair
but didn’t sleep well.  We attended District meeting and was explained the
changes along with meeting the new Elders.  San Jose was made one Zone and
Munoz &amp; Guimba was made the Guimba Zone.  Elder Clam and Elder Webber are
the Zone Leaders in the Guimba Zone and Elder Wilkinson and Elder Stewart are
the San Jose Zone Leaders.  We have heard such good things about Elder Webber
that we are excited to have him as our Zone Leader.  Elder Wilkinson used to be
in our zone and was assigned in Guimba, when we first arrived here, so we went
out to Guimba a couple of times and went with him and his companion to meet and
visit the members and leaders.  We were really impressed with him, he is an
outstanding Elder.  Elder Steward will also be great, I commented to Mae, a
couple of weeks ago, that Elder Stewart would make a great Zone Leader – and
now he is.  Marlyn had dinner ready for us when we came home.    Robin &amp;
Jenny Porter, and their two sons, Chad and Ryan came this evening.  Chad was
just released from his mission so they came to get him and Ryan just received
his call to Ohio.  We prepared dinner for them and their van driver; we then
enjoyed visiting for a while before going to bed.  Jenny brought me some
Vitalis hair tonic and some Mennen aftershave.  She also brought Mae some
toothpaste and then some other pills, Fiberplex, for her Fibermyaglia, from
Nancy.  When I asked how much we owed them they refused to take anything for
them.  They said that was the least they could do for the missionary cause and
besides they were staying with us and we were feeding them.  We borrowed some
mattresses, from the Zone Leaders house, for beds for Chad &amp; Ryan, and the
driver slept on the couch.  Robin &amp; Jenni slept in our guest room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We all slept in until about 6:00
a.m.  Robin, Jenni and Ryan had jetlag the night before and were so tired. 
They had arrived the night before in Manila and slept in the Patron House by
the temple, but they didn’t get there until 4:00 a.m. and at 6:00 a.m. people
were up and noisy so they couldn’t sleep any longer.  They had eaten and seen
some of the sights of Manila and then had driven 6 hours to get to us so they
were really beat.  They felt much better this morning.  By the time, Mae and I
were dressed; we found Robin and Jenni sitting at the table out on the patio as
the boys and driver were still asleep.  We visited out there until we heard the
boys up and then we went in to fix breakfast.  We made muffins, hash browns,
scrambled eggs, lots of fruit and juice.  Chad especially enjoyed it as he
hadn’t eaten like this since he came on his mission. He enjoyed the meal the
night before too.  We enjoyed visiting with all of them around the table and
about 10:30 a.m. they had to leave, so we all took pictures and they had their
video camera going.  It has been an enjoyable time having them here.  We wish
they could have stayed longer, but they had lots of plans to see Chad’s areas
and visit with the people he knew and loved, plus they were going to resort
areas.  Mae and I cleaned up the dishes, then took a nap and worked on more
leadership presentations as we will be doing more of that now.  We quite and
went to bed about 11PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We woke at 5AM with the cell phone beeping to
let us know that the battery was low.  We attended Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
Sacrament meeting, then came home.  I got two chickens ready to cook on the
rotisserie for dinner this evening.  I worked on a presentation for the Branch
Presidents.  That took longer than I had planned, so we had a quick lunch, did
the dishes and took a short 10 minute nap and went back to Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch, Branch Conference.  We had a Sister from San Jose ask if she could
visit with me about a problem she is having.  We visited with her a while but I
don’t think there is any thing I can do about it.  She needs to talk to her
Bishop and Stake President about it.  This evening we invited the Z. L.’s,
Elder Clam and Elder Weber to have dinner with us.  We enjoyed visiting with them. 
It looks like we will be having 22 Elders over here for Thanksgiving Dinner.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we woke, I didn’t feel too good, so Mae let
me sleep in.  After breakfast I wrote an e-mail to President Clark’s son-in-law
about having him purchase and send us a projector for power point.  We got on
instant messaging with Scott, Jeff &amp; Mike for about an hour.  It is fun,
but I am not sure I like the format.  We bounce back and forth with our
messages.  We will see how it works out.  I still felt tired so took another
nap.  After lunch I wasn’t feeling good and again slept for a couple of hours. 
We took a walk up to Ronald Dator’s shop and got our Christmas decoration that
Ronald repaired for us.  We worked this evening on bills and then on our
Bishopric training presentation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We went walking this morning at the collage. 
After breakfast we started on the computer to work on our presentations when we
got a message from Elder and Sister Swenson that there was a dedication program
at the Triala High School in Guimba.  They wanted us to attend.  We got ready
and went out, but the program was over by the time we got there.  President
Manuel Garcia, President Cabuyaban and his family, and the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
and 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch Elders were all in attendants.  The dedication was
for the new C. R. (restrooms) that the church welfare program built for the
school.  All of the schools facility and student body were in attendance with
the school band in full uniform and majorette.  They also had a nice lunching
prepared for us.  That puts us in a awkward position as Elder &amp; Sister
Swenson are not under the same food direction as the Angeles mission, so they
ate freely.  The Elders didn’t, Mae had a banana, but I ate as the Principle handed
me a plate and insisted that I get what I wanted.  That makes it hard.  I
commented to Elder Gardner (from Las Vegas), and ask if he thought that kind of
celebration would take place at Las Vegas High school if they were to get two
new toilets?  He laughed!  From there we went with the Swenson and Pres. Garcia
to a hospital North West of Guimba to over look their facilities for possible
help to them.  This hospital has 5 Doctors, 18 Nurses, 2 Mid Wife’s and a
Dentist and they told us that they provide services for a population of over
150,000 people.  The one Doctor is the head of the hospital and the others
rotate on a 24 hour shift.  We left with out making any promises but a maybe
there can be some help.  It was quite an experience.  This afternoon we worked
on our power point presentation for the Branch Presidents.  Brother Silvia came
over this evening to help us try to send an e-mail to Micro Soft concerning the
problem we are having with the mail-merge, but we couldn’t get through without
a credit card and we can’t get our card to except because of the address. 
Roger suggested that we take the latest Access program off ands reinstall the
previous one.  He will come tomorrow to try that. We went to President
Gajonera’s and gave him our presentation this evening.  It went well and he
acted pleased that we came.  We got on the inter-net and didn’t get to bed
until late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Today sure went fast and we are not sure just
what we accomplished.  We did go walking this morning.  We received several
phone calls and text messages.  We spent some time on the computer, but didn’t
get a lot done.  It’s after 10PM so we will go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in until 5:45AM then had to hurry to
get breakfast ready for Elder Clam and Elder Weber.  They came at 8AM and after
breakfast we visited about several items; Thanksgiving Dinner, the Health Fair,
a Community Service project of painting the hospital beds at the hospital Mae
and I visited Tuesday, and a Fireside on the 29<sup>th</sup> that they would
like us to help with.  We were just about finished when President Neito came. 
He had our Fast Offering check and said that the bank in Munoz would no longer
accept checks drawn on another bank.  We gave him the cash.  We then discussed
the Health Fair in quite lengthy detail.  It was good to have the Elders in on
the discussion.  It was noon when President Neito and the Elders left.  We
worked on our day planner, budget and the Health Fair this afternoon.  This
even we had Brother &amp; Sister Gasmania and their family, including their
Mother, Eva, Eliza and their three children, come to our home.  We showed them
some pictures and then watched the new film “Joy To The World” put out by the
Church.  We walked them up to the highway to catch a ride, and then we went to
President Neito’s and met with him and the Zone Leaders.  We have solved some
problems but ran into others.  After returning home I called Elder and Sister
Hyer.  We visited about the presentation they are giving on Saturday in Guimba,
also about their week in Manila.  They will stray with us Saturday Evening
after the Fireside they will be giving.  It’s late and we aren’t ready for bed
yet.  Good night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We attended Missionary District Meeting in the
Paniqui District this morning.  While there the District President called us on
our cell phone to set up a time when he might meet with us.  When Mae told him
that we were currently at their Stake Center, he laughed, for he was in his
office, just a few rooms away.  We went to his office and visited with he and
his councilor.  He asked us to help them on two dates,__________________.  When
we returned home at 12:30PM Marlyn said that Mike and David had tried to call
us.  We have been confused at to just which day is Thanksgiving, the 3<sup>rd</sup>
or 4<sup>th</sup> Thursday in November.  We know that our family was trying to
get together for Thanksgiving, and that David and Mike were getting together
early to go fishing, so thought this was a call from them.  It would be late in
the evening in the Idaho, so we didn’t return the call then.  (Had we only know
the reason for the call.)  We ate dinner and then went to San Jose shopping. 
We deposited our money in the bank and got Decembers draw out.  We picked up
some shirts for the Health Fair.  We then went to C. V. C. and bought a set a
pillows and pillow cases for Alvin Pilipa and Christen Mercado, for their
wedding gift.  I stayed upstairs and had the items gift wrapped, while Mae went
downstairs and did the grocery shopping.  Being that it made a large gift it
took a 5 sheets of wrapping paper.  The clerk was quite a while wrapping it. 
He then asked if I wanted a ribbon on it and I said to add a bow.  Well the bow
was ribbon around the package twice and a beautiful bow to match the size of
package.  I was concerned sa to what the cost was going to be, but when it was
finished, they only charged me P60, that is just over one dollar, wow.  Mae was
just about finished getting the groceries when I got downstairs.  Roger Silvia came
over and worked on our computer, changing our version of Micro Soft to an older
version.  That allowed us to get the Mail Merge feature to work on our Home
Teaching files.  However, after he left and we went into our presentation for
tomorrow, we found that it had also affected that.  We were up until midnight
getting that files changed and practicing once.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            At 2AM, Mike called to tell us that Terry had
died.  I asked if it was a heart attack, but he said he was involved in an
automobile accident.  He had gone to Wal Mart in Tooele to get some Christmas
lights.  Another vehicle had veered across the centerline from the oncoming
traffic and hit him head on.  Terry was killed instantly and the driver of the
other car is in critical condition, not expected to live.  What a shock.  We
spoke to Sandy for just a minute.  The hardest thing was when she said, “Daddy
I miss you.”  We of course couldn’t go back to sleep, trying to decide what to
do and being in grief.  We went to Tarlac where we were to give a Home Teaching
Visiting Teaching seminar, not knowing if we could emotionally give the
presentation or not.  The Lord seemed to help us and it went quite well.  As we
drove this morning, Mae made several phone calls from our cellar phone.  We
informed President Brimhall and he has been so good in helping us to decide
what to do.  He said that though he did not want to, we could be honorable
released and the Church would fly us home.  He said if we wanted to go home for
a couple of weeks, we could, but that would have to be at our expense.  He then
suggested that we see if Sandi would come over here after the funeral was over
and her family and friends returned to normal life.  He told us that we could
take whatever time we needed to be with Sandi and to take her where ever we
would like.  This would give her something to look forward to and an experience
she would remember all her life.  Mae also made several calls concerning the
Health Fair.  After our presentation, we returned home, but got detoured in
Tarlac and took a long ways home.  We tried to take a nap, but we had several
calls.  Elder Clam called and said that the Guimba Elders had killed the
turkeys today.  That really concerned me that they might spoil before we could
cook them, plus I wasn’t sure if the Elders know anything about dressing a
turkey.  Elder Brown, from Guimba, called and in talking to him I realized that
he know what he was doing in regards to the turkeys.  He is from Canada and his
family raised several turkeys each year.  We tried to call Sandi but only got a
recording.  We got two special e-mails, one from Mike and one from Jeff that
were really exciting to hear how our children are all coming to Sandi’s aid. 
President Brimhall also e-mailed us asking for all our children’s addresses and
e-mail numbers so he could contact each of them.  Wow!  He is awesome.  We were
late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept until 6AM, and then hurried to attend
Church at Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch.  We were thinking that they started at
9AM but they started at 8:30AM, so we were late getting there.  President and
Sister Clark came to be with us, just to show us support.  They are so
special.  After meeting we spoke to the Branch President and he wanted us to
meet with him at 1PM to give him some training.  President Clark had us ride
with them and we took a drive and went to Ramos to see where it was.  The
training went very well with the Branch President.  I worked mainly with him,
with his 1<sup>st</sup> councilor and clerk in attendance.  Mae, Sister Clark
and President Clark also set in.  Just before concluding, President and Sister
Brimhall also came.  After the training presentation, we went over to the
Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch Sacrament meeting.  We were late but President
Cabuyaban had all six of us, President &amp; Sister Brimhall, President &amp;
Sister Clark, and Mae &amp; I, come up to the stand.  Today was their Primary
Children’s program and it went very well, with Sister Brimhall, Sister Clark
and Sister Browning being the concluding speakers.  After meeting was over,
President and Sister Brimhall visited with Mae and I.  They just wanted to
express their sympathy and love for us.  They traveled from the mission home,
attended the meetings with us, took the time to visit with us and then had to
travel back to the mission office to take care of some importance matters. 
President and Sister Clark followed us home and they brought a nice dinner with
them for the four of us.  We enjoyed having them so much.  They left to go back
at 8PM.  We were concerned about having them travel that distance so late in
the evening, but they felt they had better.  We got on the Internet and that
always takes longer that we plan.  At 10PM I went to sleep, but Mae was up
until 1:20AM.  We received e-mails from Roy &amp; Linda, and Bob, Carroll and
Mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I woke early but let Mae sleep until 7:30AM.  I
got on the computer and tried to catch my journal up to date.  We went through
the e-mails that Mae had written last night, and then sent them off.  We ate
breakfast, and then got on the instant messaging with David, Jeff, Mike and
Scott.  We enjoyed that, although it gets confusing at times.  We were with
them for over an hour.  At 1PM Monday our time and 10PM Sunday, Utah’s time, we
called Sandi.  We visited with her and Shellie (who has came up to be with her
sister) for over an hour.  It was so good to talk to our daughters.  Sandi is
doing well with the help of her siblings, family (JaNae, Brad and Chelci),
friends, Ward support and Terry’s son’s and their wives.  Sandi was excited at
the suggestion of President Brimhall’s, for her to come over here after things
settle down there. She said she would like to have us there with her, but wants
us to stay here on our mission.  She will make plans and let us know when would
be best for her to come here.  I finished catching my journal up to date.  We
went to town to pay the electric bill and bought some celery at the palanki
also some carrots.  We think we should have Marlin do the shopping for us, for
she gets more for less.  We stopped and visited with Sister Nuque.  We picked
up some copies that we had ran off for us the other day, but hadn’t picked them
up.  We came home just before President Neito came to have us go visit one of
the leaders at CLSU.  She will help us with volunteers for the Health Fair.  We
came home and ate super and finished my journal.  It’s late again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We slept in, so didn’t go walking.  After
breakfast we designed a time-scheduling form for the schools that are
participating in the Health Fair.  We took it to President Neito.  He was at
the city municipal building waiting to visit with the city mayor.  He asked us
to go with him.  We were given time with the Mayor and explained the problem
that was caused with the change in the schedule for the Health Fair.  We also
recommended that we change our location to Central Elementary and he agreed
with that decision.  He invited Sister Browning and I to attend the activities
that are scheduled from Dec. 4<sup>th</sup> through Dec. 16<sup>th</sup>.  He
also had his aid to escort us to the principles office at the school and clear
the arrangements with the school.  They were very gracious and accommodating
with everything being approved.  As we looked at the facilities we think this
is a better venue anyway.  We next went out to Guimba where we met with Elder
Brown and Elder Sovic and we visited the Doria family, to see how the boys are
doing.  Sister Doria showed us some artwork they have done that is very good. 
Armando wanted to give the picture to Sister Browning and when she accepted it,
then Fernan also wanted her to have his.  That was special and we will treasure
those drawings.  We dropped the Elders off at their apartment and then went to
the Guimba District Hospital where we visited with Rosemarie (Rose) A. Bautista
the head nurse, about a service project of painting the hospital beds.  She is
excited and feels the 24<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> of December would be
good days as most people do not want to be in the hospital during the
Holidays.  She also showed us the tire to the only wheelchair that the hospital
has and the tire is worn out.  They are running the chair on the bear rim.  We
came back to the Elders and picked up the turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner. 
They are quite small turkeys.  We came home and got some lunch and then laid
down for a nap.  Mae only slept for about 15 minutes and then got up and took
e-mails off the computer.  We got e-mails from Bryce and Deanna, Kim and
Jeanenne and from Sandra Peterson.  I slept for about an hour.  We went
shopping in San Jose for our Thanksgiving dinner and some misc. items.  This
evening we went over to a wedding reception for Alvin and Christine Pilien.  It
has been a busy day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and went walking at the collage this
morning.  We then went to President Neito’s to borrow his keys to the church. 
He then came down to the church with us and helped us load three tables and
some chairs.  We will use them tomorrow for a Thanksgiving dinner with the
Elders from the Guimba and San Jose Zones.  We will have 22 Elders plus Mae and
I.  I started cleaning the three turkeys but they had so many pinfeathers and
are so small that I gave up, skinned them and cut them us to cook them.  I got
the onions, garlic and celery cut up for the dressing and for the meat.  The
turkey and chicken are ready to cook.  Mae prepared two Texas cakes for
tomorrow.  I had to go buy some LP gas as we ran out in the one tank.  We
thought often of our Family and especially Sandi and Terry’s sons and the
viewing that took place about 9 AM Philippine Time today. I sure hope it went
well.  We got more e-mails today, plus Mike sent us a picture that all our
Children and we went in to buy for Sandi.  We have had heavy hearts about this
and wish we could have been there for Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were heavy at heart as we thought of our
Family and Terry’s Family and especially our daughter Sandi, and what they went
through today.  It is Thanksgiving morning here in the Philippines and we
prepared a dinner for the Guimba and San Jose Elders.  We were busy all morning
and by the time they came at 2PM we had a nice Turkey dinner with all the
trimmings prepared.  The Elders had helped with some of the preparations and every
thing turned out great.  We had a lot of food, but everything was eaten when
they finished. After dinner and desert of ice cream and Texas cake, they
watched a Disney video.  It was a good day.  We were tired and ready for bed,
but I started a request for financial help with a service project, so we were
late getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We got up and had to take a bucket shower as we
had no water pressure.  We left at 7:40AM for District Development meeting,
picking up Elder Clam and Elder Weber on the way.  We met at the Guimba
Chapel.  There was a brown out so we had no air conditioner.  After the meeting
we came back to Munoz and met Brother Mico at the Rural Bank where I loaned him
P1500 to pay a loan off and he is to get the money back to me on Monday.  We
bought a card for Sister Neito and attended her graduation party, as she
graduated from collage with a teacher’s degree.  President Neito sure shows her
a lot of love and is very proud of her.  We came home and Marlyn had lunch prepared
for us.  After lunch we took a nap, then worked on our presentation for
tomorrow.  We went over to the Silvia’s for a few minutes this evening.  We
showed them our presentation as a picture of their family is in the power point
slide show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We didn’t get up until 6AM so took showers and
started the day.  We invited Elder Webber &amp; Elder Clam over for breakfast. 
After breakfast I was explaining the Gorilla approach to Home Teaching to the
Elders and I upset Mae.  We worked on the budget this morning and on our
presentation for this afternoon.  We picked up the Elders 12:30 PM and went to
Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  There was to be a Home Teaching training and
then we were going to go out Home Teaching, but there wasn’t but the Branch
President, 1<sup>st</sup> councilor, Elders Quorum President and a Sunday
School Teacher that came.  At first the Elder’s were going to just reschedule,
but Mae suggested that we give the Branch President training.  We did and that
went quite well.  We then went to Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch where we
attended the baptismal of Marlon Oresudos.  It was well attended and was a good
program.  He the only member of his family and is 20 years old.  We went back
to Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch to get their report, but no one was at the
church.  We drove out to President Cabayuban’s, but he had given the report to
the Elders.  We stopped at President Neito’s to get his report.  He will give
it to Elder Clam &amp; Elder Weber tomorrow.  We came home very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sunday, November 30, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We got dinner started this morning,
and then left to meet President and Sister Clark at the San Jose Stake Center
where they were asked to speak in Stake Conference.  Whenever they come our
way, we invite them for dinner.  We had planned to go visit some of our branches
in Paniqui today, but President Clark called on Friday to tell us they were
coming, so we changed our plans and went to San Jose.  When we walked in,
President Apao visited with us and asked Dad and I to sit on the stand along
with President and Sister Clark.  We shook hands with many of the people first,
we love doing that and seeing their beautiful smiles.  Soon after, a young man
pinned a corsage on Dad and a young woman pinned one on me.  Dad said “Oh, Oh,
I have a feeling this means we might be speaking also.  Sure enough, we were
asked to speak.  They had a huge crowd, but the Lord blessed us as we spoke and
we felt his spirit.  President and Sister Clark’s talks were great, as well as
the stake presidency and others who spoke.  They had a single adult choir and
they looked great in their white blouses or shirts and dark skirts or pants and
they each had corsages on also.  They sang beautifully.  After conference
Sister Lorna Carurucan Delos Santos visited with me about the problems she and
her husband are having.  She had visited with me a few weeks ago at the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch Conference.  Knowing that she was aware that her husband to be was
legally married to another woman they falsified the license.  She is getting a
cancellation of the marriage, as it was not legal.  I told her that if that was
what she wanted she should not try to get the church leaders involved in it but
should just try to put her life back in order and not worry about trying to get
revenge.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We enjoyed eating and visiting with
these good friends, the Clarks, and then President Brimhall called and asked if
President and Sister Clark would leave and go to the Guimba chapel where people
were waiting to have their temple recommends signed.  As they left, Sister
Clark said “I hope we’ll be friends forever.”  I assured her that we would.  We
are looking forward to the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> of December as
we will accompany them to BelAir where we will attend their branch conference
and the four of us will give training to the Priesthood and Auxiliary leaders. 
BelAir is by the ocean and they say it is beautiful there.  They were telling
us that BelAir has a cute hotel on the beach and a restaurant with wonderful
food.  It should be a great weekend.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After they left, Mae and I took a
nap, then went to the church for another Health Fair Meeting.   After it was
over, Mae was talking with the District President’s wife, Sister Karen Mercado,
and she asked her when we were going to invite their family to our home?  She
said other families have told them that they have been invited to our home to
watch the “Finding Faith in Christ” video and now the “Joy to the World” video
and how Mae had made brownies or other desserts for them.  Mae told her to find
out when her husband was available since he works in Manila all week and is so
busy with district business and meetings on the weekends, and we would be happy
to invite them.  We had to chuckle about that when we got in the car.  She is a
darling lady, but one who just says what she is thinking.  We try to invite one
family a week over to watch one of these good videos as we know the active
families need to watch these uplifting videos as well as less-actives.  We took
the zone leaders home with us and we all ate leftovers for supper.  They stayed
and visited longer than we had hoped, as we needed to get on the computer and
make the corrections for the district report, which needs to go to President
Brimhall tonight.  We had received the branch reports from the Elders in each
of the branches and needed to get this done.  Mae finished the reports, but I
fell asleep, so Mae decided to finish the family letter.</p>
