<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Because
of the cold matters I didn't sleep very well and woke with a sour throat.  Mae
got me some of my Mannatech pills and when I woke again, I felt much better. 
We got up so we could tend the children while Scott and Mishelle attended the
Temple with Mishelle's sister who will be getting married next week.  It snowed
quite hard this morning, putting down six to eight inches.  I returned some
photographs to Georgia and Rick, stopped by the Dr. office but it was closed,
picked up some pills at Mary's Health Store and got a couple of items at the
grocery store.  We took our language class with our tutor from 1PM to 3 PM, and
then Mae attended Kyron Craven's baptism.  I stayed home with Kylan as he fell
asleep and Scott and Mishelle went shopping.  This evening Scott, Mishelle,
Ashley, Kylan, Mae &amp; I met Jeff, Gail, Marcie and Malone at Appleby's and
had dinner.  After dinner Mae &amp; I took Kylan with us and got two movies,
&quot;Whiney the Po&quot; for Kylan to watch and &quot;Guess Who Is Coming to
Dinner&quot; for the rest of us to watch.  We then went to the store to get
some ice cream.  As soon as we went into the store, Kylan saw the shopping cart
that looks like a truck and wanted to ride in it.  It was fun pushing him
around in it.  Mae had to get the camera and take a couple of pictures.  Jeff
and Gail didn't come over.  We watched the show until almost mid-night before
going to bed.  Scott and Kylan fell asleep before the show finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in.  Scott &amp; Mishelle had prepared breakfast and had forgot that
today was Fast Sunday, so we will try to remember to Fast next Sunday.  My cold
is worse this morning.  I stayed home from meetings today.  I slept some,
studied some and played computer games, winning Solitary twice.  Mike and his
family came up for dinner, but I stayed down stairs to be away from my family. 
Jeff and Gail came over and brought me some shower clods for my Birthday.  I
needed them for the mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
left Scott and Mishelle's about 9 AM and went to Farmington to get our drivers
record, but when we got there we didn't have our Mission Address, so went
home.  I am not feeling well.  We did a few things at home, and then Mae went
to lunch with Sharon Cottel and Pam Hewitt.  I took a nap, also called Jay
Well's.  We are going to drop our auto insurances as of the 16th of March, as
we will have both vehicles in storage by then.  This afternoon we went back to
Farmington and were able to get both our drivers record and verification that
we had never had a criminal record.  We stopped at the post office and mailed
the criminal records to the Missionary Department.  Mae had to do the driving
from there for I felt so miserable.  We tried to get Mon's history printed, but
ran into problems as the disk with the pictures on is in Word Perfect and not
in a Jpeg file.  We decided to get some printer paper and do the printing our
self.  That didn't work the best as we weren't use to printing pictures and
then we ran out of ink.  We spent a lot of time working at it.  I decided to
take a hot bath and go to bed.  David called and had some questions about
building some cabinets.  Mae had problems with the printer so I helped her. 
Before going to bed Bob and Mark came down and administered to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Today
may be a FIRST!  Because I wasn't feeling well, I slept in the other room.  I
woke hearing Mae talking to David on the phone.  She hung up just as I got up. 
She explained that David had heard on the news that an Airport had been bombed
in the Philippines by Terrorist.  Hundreds of civilians were killed or injured,
the US has sent 50,000 troops to the Philippines and that it is highly possible
that the US will be at war with in two weeks.  He feels that we are wrong to go
there on a mission and wanted us to call the Missionary Department and refuse
to go there.  Mae explained that we just needed to have Faith.  I guess that
didn't satisfy him, so he called Mike.  Mike was out of his office, so he left
a message that it was an emergency that Mike should call him.  Mike later told
me that when he got the message that it really shook him.  When he returned the
call, David told him that he wasn't going to let us go.  Mike ask him how he
was going to stop us and that the last he know we were adults and could make
our own decisions.  David told him that he was going to call the Missionary
Department and tell them that they weren't sending his parents into a war
zone.  I guess he talked to Brother Jack Peck who assured him that the area we
are being assigned to was very safe.  They are aware of the conditions, and
that the area talked about on the news is the very South Philippines where it
is heavily populated and a large percentage of Muslims and that in that area
the Church only have Native Missionaries assigned.  The area where we will be
is the Northern Philippines, sparsely populated and away from any area that the
Terries will have any interest in.  I am not sure all that he was told, but it
satisfied him and he felt much better.  He called Mike back and also called me
and said how relieved he was and that he now feels good that we are going. 
Although it wasn't his place to call as to our assignment, I was glad he did,
that he could be satisfied.  We worked on our language training all morning and
had our tutoring session at 1 PM.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>We were
both tired as we completed that.  We watched a &quot;JAG&quot; show on TV just
to unwind.  This afternoon we worked on other items needed to do before leaving
on this calling.  I got new ink cartridges for our printers and printed one
more set of pictures for the History that Mae is printing on Margaret Jensen. 
We will print copies for my siblings and our family.  We watched the recording
of tonight's &quot;JAG&quot; that we recorded earlier, before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up early and went into the Social Security Office in Ogden.  The wait
wasn't to long and we were able to get forms needed to change our address to
the Philippines.  We also found that Mae's S.S. check had returned because the
routing number was wrong.  We think that is now corrected.  We then went to Yes
Printing and got Mom Jensen's history printed.  We went to Dr. Bennett for
treatments, bought some items our mission.  We came home and ate some lunch,
then met with Ed Dresch and got a Power Of Attorney for Mike to be able to sign
for me.  Ed is also making us up a Truss.  We got back just in time to shower
and go to the Temple, where we met Bryce, Deanna, Kim, Jeanenne, Georgia and
Rick and went through a session.  Jeanenne informed us that Dezaree is engaged
to be married.  After the session, we ate in the cafeteria then went to Bryce
&amp; Deanna's and sorted out Mom Porters photographs.  We didn't get home
until after 11:45 PM.  It's been a Busy Day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
woke having a dream of moving the storage shed and every thing going wrong.  I
then started to do my journal and my laptop computer froze up on me.  Joanne
Nichol's called to see if I had had time to visit with our children about Long
Term Care insurance.  We are also trying to decide if we should refinance our
home at a lower interest rate.  All this, along with learning Tagalog, which I
am doing poorly and getting ready to leave, is just about more than I can
handle.  Mae is very peasant with me.  Although Mae can't eat today, because of
a colon scope tomorrow, she fixed me a nice breakfast.  We studied until time
for our lesson.  After our lesson I fixed me some lunch.  I contacted Toshiba
tech support, about the problem I am having with my laptop freezing up and he
had me turn off the Hibernate switch on the power saver control.  This evening
I went to Kristen Dillingham's Wedding Reception, then took some items to Jeff
&amp; Gail's.  Mae has been packing to move and cleaning cupboards.  I spent
sometime just correcting the work for today's lesson.  We were late getting to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up and took Mae into the Hospital to have a colon scope.  That went well
and all is ok, so that is a relief to know.  When we got home Mae didn't feel
well, so went to bed and slept about three hours.  This afternoon we met with
Jack Passel to try to refinance our house.  We also went to the attorneys, Ed
Dresch, having him draw up a Power of Attorney for Mike on Mae.  He had already
made a Power of Attorney for Mike on me.  He also had the pulmonary draft of
our Living Will and Truss for us to read over for any corrections or additions.
We stopped and ate dinner at a Chinese restaurant.  We came home and worked on
the bank statement, getting Quicken on our lap top.  Mae worked on our language
lessons.  It was late when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
woke with a migraine headache and had to go back to bed to sleep it of.  I
think this is the first of those I have ever had.  I didn't get up until almost
noon.  Cheryl called to wish us well on our mission.  She and Bob are going to
take a short trip and she wanted to call before we left.  She is special. 
David had called, so I called him back and visited a few minutes.  They will be
down this evening.  We were busy all day and yet fill we got very little done
that we need to.  I helped Bob load his TV so he could take it over to be
repaired.  Mark helped me load my generator into the pickup.  I am going to let
David take it up to his place while we are gone.  We got together with the
Porter Family this evening in a Family Missionary Farewell.  We had a nice
dinner, and then we had a program at which we watched a DVD that Mike and Bryon
had assembled from family pictures.  Mae and I were presented a copy to take
with us.  Rick then gave a short tribute to Mae &amp; me, which was very
special and kind of him, then he had Mae &amp; I each comment.  It was a
wonderful evening with most of the family being there.  Mae &amp; I stayed
after to help clean up and to visit.  We were late getting home, but stayed up
and watched the DVD again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up about 7AM and was just busy on the computers and before we realized it,
the morning was gone and we had to hurry to get to church.  Rodney &amp; JoLynn
Stevenson spoke in meeting and the Hawks family sang a song.  After that Mae
and I were ask to share our testimonies.  In priesthood quorum, Brother
Laprevote gave a lesson on the Atonement.  I guess there is so much that we
don't understand concerning that act, yet it is the one act that gives us the
greatest hope.  Mae and I studied in the car for a few before going to Jeff
&amp; Gail's for dinner.  They had a nice dinner prepared and had invited Marci
and Melanie to also eat with us.  We had a nice evening, playing games for a
while after.  I forgot to attend Stake Priesthood Meeting this evening.  When
we got home Jack Persil had left us the loan papers to sign to refinance our
home at 5.5% interest on a 15 year mortgage.  That will lower our payments over
$200 per month and will save us, even if we carry the loan to completion, over
$3,000 in interest.  We discussed and studied these papers this evening.  I
then transferred our photos off our camera to our computer files.  We then went
through things we still need to take care of this week and I went to bed almost
overwhelmed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up early so Mae could attend a breakfast in Honor of Betty Spencer and
Marilyn Junk who are retiring from the School District.  She also did a little
shopping while she was gone.  I called the Missionary Travel and checked on our
Visa and Passports, which they said they have received.  I also spent a couple
of hours checking with Social Security as to the insurances I would need when I
turn 65 years old.  The said that I would receive notice 2 or 3 months before I
turn 65 and would have the option to turn down MEDICARE at that time.  If I
didn't reply, I would automatically take affect at age 65.  I am still trying
to check out MEDICADE.  I defrosted the freezer and with Bryce's help, took it
over to Jeff &amp; Gail's.  I made a copy of the Porter Family pictures and
gave to Bryce.  We worked a while on our lessons.  At 5 PM we went over to
Irven and Sandy's, where Bryce and Deanna joined us for dinner.  They then took
us to Bountiful where we enjoyed the VHS Musical Theatre Company presentation
of Les Miserable.  It was very well done.  We stopped on the way back to Irven
&amp; Sandy's and got Frozen Yogurt.  We then moved the kitchen table out and
danced to some 50's music.  We had good time and enjoyed being with them this
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were mainly busy this morning trying to get ready for our tutor lesson.  I had
Bob do some chasing for me to get the items that I need to put the truck and
car in storage.  From 1 to 3 PM we took our class.  By the time that was
through I was totally drained.  I started scanning some of our family pictures
that Mae would like to have with us.  We had to stop over to Irven's and get a
fax, then return it.  At 8 PM we were at the Stake Presidents office to be set
apart as Missionaries.  Jeff and Gail came to be with us.  Scott wanted to be
with us, but he and Ashley are sick.  After being set apart, we went over to
Scott's and got my car jack.  We stayed with Jeff &amp; Gail tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
will enter a few of the things that were pronounced in the blessings given to
us as we were set apart.  President Greg Saunders was spokesman with President
Ron Richins and President Brent Craven standing in.  Mae was first set apart. 
Jeff and I were asked to also stand in.  President Saunders first indicated
that through the Authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood and being authorized
by the First Presidency, he set Iva Mae Browning apart to the position of a
Full Time Missionary for the Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to
serve in the Philippines Angeles Mission, with all the responsibilities,
authority and blessing associated with that calling.  </p>

Layton and bought some boxes for clothes, checked on Medicaid insurance and
tried to get me some new white pants at Dessert Clothing.  We stopped at Bugger
King for some lunch before going home.  We worked until evening when Mae went
to the Relief Society Birthday social.  I went over to Jeff &amp; Gail's and

repaired the pickup windshield.  When Mae got home we spent a couple of hour
cramming for our tutoring lesson.  Brother Black didn't call until 2:30 PM
today.  At 5:30 PM our Attorney came with our Living Will, Power of Attorney
and Truss papers for our signing.  His secretary, Bob and Carroll signed as
witness and Scott signed as Executor of the Truss.  David called and talked to
me about the cabinets he is building.  Mae made a casserole that we took over
to Jeff's for dinner.  Jeff &amp; Gail had a counselor from their Bishopric
visiting and then he made a call for them to serve in the Primary.  After diner

let me take a nap this afternoon, but she didn't stop.  We were both very tired
when we went to Scott and Mishelle's at 7 PM for dinner.  Scott was asked if he
would take a business trip to Las Vegas tomorrow.  Both of them feels bad that
they won't be here to help us tomorrow, so they had Jeff, Gail, Mae &amp; I for
dinner.  Scott asked if I would give him a Fathers blessing which I was very
pleased to do.  Scott is a special young man and as I am with all my children,
they make me very proud to be their Father.  About 9:30 PM we went back to Jeff

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
attended Jeff &amp; Gail's ward for meetings.  We saw the Sherman's and a few
others that was in the Layton 7th Ward when we lived with Mom.  It was good to
see them again.  After getting home we realized that Mae had left her purse in
the Relief Society room.  When we went back, another Ward was meeting and the
purse wasn't there.  We checked at the Library and the lost and found area,
then at the Bishop's office.  The counselor remembered of a Sister having found
a purse.  He called and she had it at her home, having stopped by Jeff's but we
hadn't got there yet.  We went to her home and got it.  We were glad because
Mae had $600.00 plus important papers and credit cards in it.  We went over to
Scott, fed the fish, got the mail &amp; borrowed Scott's pickup.  Mae &amp;
Gail prepared a nice dinner.  Marcie and Maloney also come over.  After eating,
we played a game of &quot;Skip O&quot;.  I then gave Jeff &amp; Gail each a
Priesthood Blessing.  Mae took Bob &amp; Carroll's car back and visited with
them for a few minutes.  We still ad a few things to finish up before going to
bed.  I soon fell asleep, but Mae had trouble going to sleep and kept
remembering things and getting up to make notes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>Monday,

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were up about 5:30 AM to finish packing and prepare to leave for the MTC.  Mae
&amp; I got treatments from Dr. Bennett's before we left.  Jeff drove us down
to Provo in Scott's pickup.  We got to the Sr. MTC at 11:15 AM and checked in. 
While Mae &amp; I checked in, Jeff took our entire luggage to our room for us. 
We then went over to Wendy's and ate with Jeff, before he said &quot;Good
By&quot; and went home.  We had orientation for most of the afternoon.  We were
assigned to District C and I was assigned as District Leader.  We have three
other couples in our District, Elder Sister Johnson, Elder &amp; Sister Case
and Elder &amp; Sister Brady.  We had dinner before 6 PM, and then we were
aloud to watch President Bush's speech on the pending war with IRAK.  He gave their
current leader 48 hours for him and his sons to leave the country or we (the
U.S.A.) will remove them.  We then went to our room and unpacked and studied
our agenda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were up at 5:30 AM to get ready for the day.  Breakfast was at 7:30 AM, and
then classes started at 9 AM.  We were taught how to make a lesson outline,
then started an outline for the 1st Discussion.  After lunch we finished
preparing an outline that we could use this afternoon in a mock Discussion with
a person pretending to be an investigator.  That went fairly well for us,
although we realize that there is plenty of room for improvement.  We then went
back to a summery class.  We had Sister Lois Falck (last name was Porter, but
now remarried) from Mesa Arizona, come up to us and ask us our name.  It has
been years since we have seen her.  She introduced us to her husband Lou
Falck.  It was good to visit with her and her husband.  They work at the MTC on
a Mission Call.  After class we went up to the main MTC where we received
additional shots that we need before we go to the Philippines.  We ate dinner,
and then tried to call Sandi.  She was not home.  We attended a devotional
meeting at which Elder Richard G. Scott of the Counsel of Twelve Apostles spoke
and taught us.  After the meeting Elder Scott took the time to shake hands with
many of which we ad that privilege.  We called Sandi and found that JaNae gave
birth to a baby boy, 7 lb 13 oz, 20 1/2&quot; and lots of dark hair.  JaNae is
now doing ok, but the baby was to long in birth and has a collapsed lung and
has pneumonia, so is in ICU until he gets well.  We also called Mike to let him
know our plans for Friday evening.  Becky is still doing ok, but is feeling
like she would like to get this birth over.  We studied and Mae pressed some
clothes before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were up at 5:30 AM getting ready for the day.  After breakfast we were
instructed on Teaching by the Spirit.  All our instructions are aimed to this
end.  Again we put an outline for the 2nd Discussion, and then this afternoon,
we again gave the 2nd discussion to a pretending investigator.  We felt this
went well.  We went back to the class room, then to dinner.  We went back to
our room and took a 15 or 20 minute nap.  Then we met with Brother Black and
were tutored in Tagalog until about 9 PM.  We were exhausted by the end, so
walked to the Ice Cream store and got a dish of ice cream and yogurt.  We then
came back to our apartment and read some of the assigned information and
writing of my journal entry before going to bed &quot;tired&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Again
we were up before 5:30 AM starting the day.  One thing they keep us going, but
it is great.  We were to have another roll play as to contacting a less active
member.  We had Sister Fay Crocket as our volunteer.  We spent a few minutes
becoming acquainted, then she ask if she could ask us if we could give her some
ideas as how she could help her Granddaughter who just announced that she is
marring a young man that is no a member of the church.  He feels that the Bible
is the only scripture that is needed.  Although we did not follow the planned
outline, we felt the Spirit and followed the promptings.  It was a great
experience and pleasure.  Mae had spent our lunch break in preparation for this
evening's language lesson.  I took a short nap, and then helped a little with
our lessons.  After these afternoons' classes, we had dinner.  We tried to cut
dinner short to have some time in preparing for our class with Brother Black. 
We still didn't get our assignments completed before going to class.  We went
to 8:15 PM before quitting, we were beat when we finished.  We stayed up studding
our assignments for tomorrow and entering journal entry.  We got our airline
tickets this evening.  We also got a card and note from Lou &amp; Lois Falck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>Friday,
March 21, 2003                      &quot;You are almost done here&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Today
has been another fast fully filled day.  The Spirit of our training sessions
and meetings has been so enjoyable, but almost more than you can fully accept. 
We took several pictures of the couples that have been with us this week, also
some of our trainers.  As we started our tutoring class in Tagalog, we took a
picture of Mae &amp; me with Brother Dan Black.  He has been great with us and
very patient with us.  I was very tired and drained by the time we started our
language class.  I wasn't prepared and forgot or rather picked up the wrong
binder, but any way didn't have what I needed to help me with the lesson. 
Brother Black wanted me to bear my testimony in Tagalog and I couldn't.  By the
time we closed the class I felt like I had been beat.  Mike and Becky were
waiting for us when we finished.  On the way to Mike's home I was tired and Mae
pushed me to get traveler checks.  I had felt that we could get along with our
credit card and some cash.  Mae had felt that we needed to take more cash, so I
had walked to the Wells Fargo Bank during lunch and with drew more cash.  After
hearing from other couples Mae wanted me to change the cash to the traveler
checks.  Well it was to late now, so I spoke cross to her and she felt bad the
rest of the evening.  At Mike's we visited and played a game of Rook before
going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>Saturday,
March 22, 2003                  &quot;We are excited to see you&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Mae
and I got up early and borrowed one of Mike's cars.  We drove up to the
Bountiful Temple where we met Scott, David, Shauna, Sandi, Terry, Jeff and Gail
and went through a Temple Endowment Session.  We had an opportunity to visit in
the Celestial room and talk about the Temple Ceremony and it's importance's. 
Mae and I then found a Wells Fargo Bank and got $1,000's worth of traveler
checks.  We met all the family out to Sandi and Terry's where we had lunch and
visited.  Scott and Mishelle brought us some mail that had come.  One of the
letters was from President Brimhall who discouraged us from carrying traveler
checks.  Oh well, now we can make more changes.  Boy was it hard to say good by
when we had to leave.  This is the hard thing about going on this mission.  We
went to Tooele and visited JaNae and Brad and saw our new Great Grand Son. 
They also had Jadon there and he sure seems to want to be included in the
family.  We were there until after 7 PM.  We stopped at the Wal Mart store in
Provo, getting some last minute items, also something to eat.  We stopped at a
station and got gas, also called Mike, finding out that he was waiting at the
Sr. MTC for us.  It was after 10 PM when we got there.  Mike had thought we
would be there by 9 PM and was worried something had happened to us.  It is
kind of amusing to see our children worry when we think of the night we have
spent worrying when they were teenagers and they couldn't understand why.  We
stayed up until mid-night cleaning up, then until after 1:30 AM packing and
getting ready to leave Monday morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were up early enough for me to make it to a 7:45 AM leadership meeting.  At
8:15 AM we attended Sacrament meeting.  Elder Brad and I had the privilege the
blessing the Sacrament.  President ____ gave the main address on the subject of
&quot;To know God&quot;, and gave an impressive talk.  It was a very
enjoyable   meeting.  All the Sisters went to Relief Society meeting up to the
main MTC.  The Elders had a wonderful Priesthood on Agency of Man.  It was
presided and conducted by President Bowin, 2nd Counselor in the Sr. MTC
Branch.  We broke for lunch, and then were to have a Study session.  Mae and I
were so tired that we missed that and took a nap.  We attended a Farwell
Fireside for all missionaries leaving before next Sunday, which took most of
our Sr. Missionary group.  It was great.  We went from there to a missionary
devotional at which Stephen B. Allen; the managing Director of the Missionary
Department spoke.  From there Mae and I spent the rest of the evening packing
to be ready to leave in the morning.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
put these two days together because we crossed the International Date Line and
lost a day.  We were up about 3:30 AM and on the bus at 5:40 AM.  Our plain
left at 8:47 AM from SLC, United Airlines, and flight 1697.  We had 8 Elders
that flew with us.  They often helped us with luggage.  At San Francisco, we
transferred to United Airlines flight 805 and had a 2 1/2 hr. layover before
leaving about 12:15 PM.  We arrived at Hong Kong at 7:00 PM, but with crossing
time zones we lost a day and 9 hours.  Our plane was late leaving Hong Kong due
to mechanical problems, so we arrived after mid-night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Elder
Tennent met us at the Manila airport.  He had transportation to take us to a
Missionary Reception Center there in Manila.  We got to bed some where around 3
AM, very tired.  We were up by 5 AM for breakfast, and then we went to the
Manila Temple and went through an Endowment Session.  Mae and I were asked to
be witnesses for the session.  Mae had packed her purse for our flight here and
we were unable to find her Temple Recommend, but they let us go anyway.  It was
a very enjoyable morning.  After returning from the Reception Center we had
lunch.  Mae lay down and took a nap.  I caught my journal up to date and
visited with some of the Elders.  I did lie down and got 30 to 40 minutes nap. 
Shortly after 5 PM President and Sister Brimhall and Elder &amp; Sister Clark
came.  President Brimhall took Elder &amp; Sister Clark, Elder &amp; Sister Tennent
and Mae &amp; I out to dinner at Chili's Restaurant for dinner.  Mae &amp; I
shared a squid dinner.  We then left for the mission home in Angeles.  Brother
Clark drove our car and Mae &amp; I road with them.  President &amp; Sister
Brimhall and another Elder went in the other car.  Brother Clark followed
President Brimhall.  I was sure glad that I didn't drive, for the traffic
scared me.  We got to the mission home about 9 PM.  Mae and I visited with
President &amp; Sister Brimhall until almost 11 PM.  They are sure inspirational
people.  We called Mike and visited a few minutes.  Becky still hasn't gone to
the hospital.  The Dr. said if she hasn't started labor by Friday, he will
induce her.  I ask Mike if he could call our other children to let them know we
had arrived ok.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Elder
and Sister Clark prepared breakfast for us and we ate at 7:30 AM.  They then
took us to the Bank where we were able to exchange our cash and traveler checks
for Philippine currency.  Had we not had Elder Clark with us, we wouldn't have
been able to exchange the traveler checks.  Elder Clark drove the car and I was
glad for that.  They then took us to Munoz.  What an experience that was. 
Driving in this traffic is crazy.  We also saw so much poverty.  I have never
seen anywhere in the U.S. as such total poverty as we saw everywhere here. 
Nogales Mexico is the only place that compares but the population here on this
island is 80,000,000 and the island is the size of Arizona.  As we drove and
saw the congestion and poverty I just became sick to think of what I brought
Mae into.  We arrived late for the Zone meeting, in fact they were just
concluding with a testimony meeting.  Sister Erma Santiago and her family had
prepared wonderful box lunches for us.  After eating and meeting and visiting
several of the Elders, Elder &amp; Sister Clark and four Elders, took us to our
home.  We were very impressed with the home, but it is still a change.  The
home is fairly clean, but we will still have a lot of cleaning to do.  It has an
iron rod fenced, with locked gates around it.  A little grass in front, a
covered front patio and part of the car port is covered.  Inside there is a
large Great room (living, dinning, and kitchen), two bed rooms, a food
preparation room and a bath room.  The bath room is all tiled so it is also the
shower.  Elder Kendall and Elder Irorita, the Zone Leaders, took us shopping;
they were absolutely great in their help with us.  We were until 8 PM
shopping.  They left us for the night and walked home.  I offered them a ride,
but they said it wasn't very far.  We worked quite late trying to get some what
organized.  We finished eating some left over box lunch and went to bed.  We
then realized that we had forgotten our pillows when we left the mission home.

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Mae
wasn't feeling the best this morning so I had her stay home while I went with
Elder Kendall and Elder Irorita to District Meeting.  It was really inspiring
to see these young elders conduct and lead the meetings.  I understand more the
comment that President Kimble made years ago when he said &quot;If it wasn't
for the missionary system the Church would fail&quot;.  These young men are
being taught Leadership not only for now, but will be the leaders when they
return home.  After meeting I dropped the Elders off at their place, and then
came home.  Mae and I had lunch, and then I took a short nap.  Mae is feeling
better; I think it is still Jet Lag, and the New Life style.  Elder Kendall and
Elder Irorita came by and the four of us went out visiting members so Mae &amp;
I could meet them.  We visited the Branch President of the Munoz 2nd Branch. 
He was not at home but we visited with his in-laws Brother and Sister Cortez. 
We then visited Brother and Sister Noque and Brother and Sister Umipid.  It was
a very enjoyable experience.  We ate dinner after getting home, and then stayed
up late cleaning and putting things away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
attended a Branch Teachers Development meeting at 9 AM, But the only ones that
showed up was the instructor and two Sisters.  We waited for a while, and then
came home.  We came back home, did some planning with the Elders, then after
the Elders left we took a nap.  This afternoon Mae and I went shopping in San
Jose.  We enjoyed being together and getting around by ourselves.  Mae was
tired so I had her lay down, but she first did some straighten up.  We had a
water dispenser delivered this afternoon, along with another bottle of water. 
It was late again before we got to bed.  We had found some pillow while
shopping, so it was good to have something a little more comfortable to sleep
on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were up before 5 AM but were busy trying to get things done, such as recording
our finances and catching up my journal.  Mae felt we should be studying
Tagalog and reading our scriptures.  That had her upset.  We were late getting
to the Munoz 1st Branches combined Priesthood / Relief Society lesson.  The
lesson was given on the importance of holding regular Family Home Evening. 
After meeting, we came back home to eat.  I took a 5 minute nap.  We picked up
the Elders and attended the Munoz 2nd Branches full Block.  Mae was asked to
introduce you selves and bear our testimony during Sacrament meeting.  We were
sure made welcome from both Branches'.  Almost everyone shook our hands.  After
the block we visited a while.  We next attended Ward Counsel and enjoyed that
meeting.  The Elders took us over to meet the District President before we went
home.  When we came home the drive way was blocked so it gave us an opportunity
to meet our neighbor across the street, his name is Ed and he is Catholic but
we got to wait for a few minutes.  Our next door neighbor also came home before
we went in, so we got to meet him.  We prepared some dinner, ate, cleaned up
and went to bed very tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Elder
Kendall and Elder Irorita took us shopping at the palanki to get fresh meats
and fruits.  That was quite a new experience.  Marlyn Pilipa came over to
interview to be our house maid.  We settled on 750 Paso per week.  She will
start tomorrow and will come at least three days per week.  The Elders then
went with us to a mall in a town about 300 kilometers South of Munoz.  That was
another new experience.  We met many Elders there on P day, also four Sisters. 
We looked at buying a new range for 14,000 P, but I didn't feel we should at
this time.  Mae &amp; I did some shopping while the Elders went bowling.  On
the way home we stopped to get our Philippines drivers license and after all
the paper work, drug test, eye test and paying out about 1,000 each they
wouldn't issue them to us with out a A.C.R. report.  Elder Kendall called the
Elders in the Mission Office and requested that they get the report for us.  We
visited a couple of families after getting back to Munoz, then went to a
Internet Cafe and tried to send a E-mail to our children, but didn't get it to
go through.  We came on home and ate dinner.  I cleaned up the dishes while Mae
took a short nap.  She then got up and typed a letter to our family.</p>
