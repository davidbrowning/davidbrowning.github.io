<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
had Elder Kendall and Elder Irorita over for breakfast.  They then worked with
us on Tagalog for about 1 1/2 hours.  We then went to San Jose shopping for a
mirror, a chain for the gate, some clothes line wire, a toilet seat, a tape
recorder, keys for the house and gas for the car.  We came back for lunch and
took a short nap.  This afternoon we signed up for telephone service to our
home.  That will probably take a week to get a phone installed.  We then went
visiting several families.  Some have nice homes, but most have a very modest
home and your heart just aches for them.  We visited Brother Grandes last.  His
circumstances really humbled me.  His wife works in Hong Kong in domestic
help.  She came home after being gone for 7 years, then came back for 3 years,
then has been gone 2 years.  She will come home on the 24th of this month. 
Brother Grandes works six days a week from 8 AM to 6 PM, then takes care of his
family, does all the house work, cooking and shopping.  Before leaving, I felt
impressed to ask him if he would like a Priesthood Blessing.  He did, so I was
spokesman.  We left the Elders at 8 PM and came home.  We were beat by the time
we got something to eat and got ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Elder
Kendall and Elder Irorita came over at 7 AM to tutor us in Tagalog.  They then
went on a service assignment.  This gave us time to catch up on some of the
items we needed to do.  We went over to the internet cafe, and found that none
of our e-mails went through last night.  Mae kept working on the internet,
while I went back to the Elders apartment to get them.  The pouch mail and
letters from the mission home came today.  We also received word that Becky had
given birth to a baby girl, born Friday 28 March, they named her Jessica Joe
Browning, and she weighted 8 LB 15 oz and is 19 1/2&quot; long.  She has lots
of dark hair.  Both Mother and baby are doing well and are home from the
hospital.  What great news and great blessings.  We also got a letter from the
Social Security stating that they have suspended my social security payments
because we are living in a country that the U.S. don't have an agreement with. 
We tried to call Social Security office in Manila but it was closed for the
day.  We will have to try again tomorrow.  We went with the Elders to visit an
elderly couple age 68 that have a very nice home.  He is a farmer that raises
&quot;palay&quot; or rice.  His farm is about 5 acres, but I guess that is a
good size farm for here.  I ask him quite a few questions about his farm.  They
also have a lovely family of nine children, 3 sons and 6 daughters, all of
which are very educated.  He and his wife were baptized three years ago but are
about inactive now.  I ask him when he was going to take his bride to the Manila
Temple to be sealed together for ever.  We encouraged them to have their
children read the Book of Mormon.  I felt impressed to read from the D &amp; C
where it states that were much is given, much is expected.  I hope I wasn't to
strong, but felt they needed to know that they have been given much.  From
there we went to a Sisters home, her husband was not home from work, but her 19
yr. old son was there.  The Elders gave the 2nd discussion and that went well. 
We came home, ate dinner and soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Elders
Kendall and Irorita came over and worked with us on teaching us Tagalog.  I
feel so weak in this ability.  Mae is doing so much better than I and yet is
feeling the frustrations of not being able to communicate with these humble
people.  That frustration is heightened with me.  I don't know what he Lord
would have me do?  We were able to reach the Administer of Social Security and
found that another letter is on its way telling me to ignore the last letter. 
Benefits are ok, but they still need some information from us on our address.
He will send us the forms.  After lunch Elders Kendall and Irorita had us go
with them to the city if Kimba where we did companion splits with the Elders in
that area.  Mae &amp; I went with Elder Welsh to visit members to become
acquainted.  The Branch President of the one Branch was not at home.  We drove
to his home in the farm area.  The humble constancies these people live here is
just indescribable.  Many of the homes in this area are just bamboo shells with
thatched roofs and dirt floors.  Water is pumped by hand from wells.  Elder
Welsh explained that the inactivity of this area is so great that they are not
allowed to proselyte here but can only try to activate.  While in that area we
did visit one Sister and her Daughter.  Although she could speak very little
English, and Mae and I very little Tagalog, the visit was very delightful.  Her
husband is a police officer and is required to be at his job full time every
other week.  He is then home for a week and they can attend church together. 
They were baptized three months ago and are doing well.  From there we went
into town to the Church House.  We met the two counselors in the Branch
Presidency.  Both are fairly young and neither is married.  They cold speak
broken English and we enjoyed meeting them.  We next visited the home of a
recently returned missionary, Brother Ramazaros.  He was very delightful to
visit with and will really be a great strength to the branch.  At his home was
a young man, Jereck, 16 years old, who was just visiting.  After visiting
there, the young man wanted us to visit his family.  As we left, he ask if he
could ride in our car.  He introduced us to his mother, Facitas and two
sisters, Julie and Jennalynn Dupitas.  Again though we had the language
beerier, we had a delightful visit.  The family has just recently been
baptized.  The father was working while we were there, but as we were staring
to leave in the car, returned home.  The young man stopped us and wanted us to
meet his father, Christao Dupitas.  What a delightful experience.  We then left
the area with Elder Kendall and Elder Irorita to return back home.  After
dinner, I was so tired that I laid down for a nap.  Mae stayed up to study. 
About 10:30 PM I woke, just as Mae was coming to bed.  She said that she had
tried to wake me, but couldn't.  I said prayers with her, and then stayed up
writing this journal entry.   How to help this people is beyond me.  They need
leadership, but what am I to do to help, that is my concern.   I can surly see
the truth to the statement that President Kimball made several years ago,
&quot;With out the missionary system of the Church, the Church would
fail.&quot; It is not the lack of converts that would be the problem, but the
lack of leadership developed in the young men as they go through the training
of being a missionary.  As this people gets returning missionaries to take
leadership the Church will become strong here.  What to do until then, I do not
know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up and had our showers, scripture study, prayers and breakfast then went to
District meeting.  We are amazed as we watch these young Elders conduct and
teach.  This is surly the collage for future Church Leadership.  After meeting
we came home and worked on language, letters to mail to our family for as of
yet we haven't been able to get through no e-mail.  We sent a letter to Tina
Linderman requesting information as to how to set up a library.  We worked on
teaching aids for Ward and Branch Leadership Training.  Marlyn was here all day
cleaning and cooking.  She had me take down the drapery in the Great Room and
she pressed them.  I then rehung them.  Time goes so fast and by the time we
finished it was after 11 PM before we got to bed.    I wish I know what the
Lord would have us do and how far to go in teaching the Saints here in the
Philippines.  We will present these training materials to Elder Kendall and get
advice from them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
had expected the Elders over this morning at 9 AM so when they hadn't come by
9:45 AM we drove over there.  They had just returned from Sam Jose.  We went
back to our house and went over some the ideas Sister Browning and I had on
Counsels, Meetings, Visiting Teaching and Home Teaching.  We then went to the
Stake Center in San Jose so Elder Kendall could use the computer to generate
some reports.  We met President Apoa and he invited Sister Browning and me to
attend a Seminary Graduation.  It was a very enjoyable experience.  We stopped
at the store and purchased some groceries before coming home.  Mae and I worked
on the computer until after 9:30 PM before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were up early so we could attend the satellite broadcast of General Conference
at the San Jose stake Center.  We picked up Elder Kendall and Elder Irorita at
4:30AM as the broadcast started at 5 AM.  It was great to see and hear the
Conference.  At 5 AM was the Saturday Afternoon session, at 9 AM was the
Priesthood Session and from 11 AM was the Saturday Morning session.  I took Mae
home during the Priesthood session, and came back.  There was a power outage
half way through the Priesthood session, so we missed the last half of that
session.  We enjoyed visiting with many members before and after the sessions. 
We had the Elders over for dinner this afternoon.  Mae cooked a nice beef roast
with potatoes, gravy and vegetables.  I later took a nap while Mae worked on a
talk that Sister Brimhall had asked her to give next week at District
Conference.  When I got up, I did the dinner dishes and helped Mae with her
talk.  I then entered my journal entry for the day before we went to bed. 
Conference was wonderful and I have again realized the great need this
wonderful people have to trust totally in our Lord and prove them self where in
if the Lord will not pour out His blessings unto them.  I just don't know how
to put this over to the people.  The noise piece of my glasses broke of this
morning before we left the house.  Mae used achieve tape to temporarily mend them. 
Sister Erma said she knows where to get them repaired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up early so we could attend the Sunday Morning Session of General
Conference at the San Jose Stake Center.  We really enjoyed the messages from
our Prophet and general authorities.  After the session was over, Erma took us
to an eye glass store and they repaired my glasses with supper glue.  They did
it with out charge.  We stopped at the store and bought a few groceries before
returning home.  We worked on the computer getting a letter ready to e-mail to
our family.  Mae took a nap, while I was on the computer and then I took a nap
while she was on the computer.  I am so grateful that we bought this computer
for it is sure a helpful tool.  As we work and adjust to this assignment, we
have many emotions.  Mae was studding the language and I looked over and saw
her crying.  When I ask her what the matter was, she replied that the word for
happy (maligaya) had made her think of little Kylan and how she missed him.  This
is certainly a complete change in life style.  I can't think of one phase in
our life's that hasn't had significant changes, the way we eat, bath, wash our
hands, our food, speech, and even our prayers.  You name it and it has changed,
and this is hard.  We again went to bed discouraged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Elder
Kendall and Elder Irorita came this morning to work with us on the language. 
Mae's doing quite well, but I feel that I'm still floundering.  We went over to
the Dator's family in the 2nd Branch where their son, Ronald repairs electronic
items and he repaired the flat iron that was in our apartment.  Mae and I
visited with his mother and married sister while he did the repairs.  They were
so pleasant and gave us some green mangos as we left.  We took the Elders to
the Elders home in San Jose so that they could inform one of the Elders that he
was to be transferred this afternoon.  We then took them to Erma's, then we
came back home.  We ate some lunch, took a nap, and then Mae gave me a haircut. 
This afternoon we went down to the internet cafe and checked to see if we had
any e-mail.  We didn't but there were no rejected messages on the last ones we
sent.  We then found the Umpig's home and visited with them for a while.  They
will try to set up a couple of appointments with less active members that they
will go with us to visit.  We came home and warmed some diner and I entered my
journal before we retired.  Sister Umipig told us of her experience in Saudi
Arabia, as a head nurse in a medical university.  The thing that most amazed me
was that she left her family here in the Philippines for 16 years while at that
job.  They wanted her to stay for another 5 years, but she was diagnosed with
cancer so came home to be with her family.  She under went treatment there
before returning home.  The Umpig's have built a nice home and are a great help
to this Branch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up at 5:30 AM and drove over to the university where we went for a walk. 
It has beautiful landscaping with large trees and flowers.  It was still cool,
so very enjoyable.  We came back for showers and breakfast, and then attended
District Leader Training with the missionaries.   As we have already
experienced, they are great.  We found the Municipal Building and got a map of
the area from the Planning Engineer.  It really covered more area than we had
wanted, but he was so nice to us that we just thanked him and left.  We came
home and I had to redo the Branch Organization chart I have been working on.  I
did get a short nap.  Later we met Elder Kendall and Elder Irorita and they
copied some maps they had for us.  We went visiting the Mario Gaznema family. 
Brother Gaznema is the Elders Quorum President, but he wasn't home.  We visited
with his two sister's in-laws and his wife.  They have three children Colleen
age 5, David Bruce age 3 and the baby Jared age 3 mo.  We then stopped at
Brother Rodolfo B. Bustos who we had visited last week.  His wife Nellie is in
Manila to see the Dr. about high blood pressure.  From there we met with
President Gajonera of the Munoz First Branch and went over some of their Branch
Organization, Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching.  Pres. Gajonera is 24 years,
has a beautiful wife and a 3 month old baby.  I hope we can help them with his
great calling.  We came back home and got something to eat, I entered my
journal then we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
didn't sleep really well last night because of the mosquitoes that continued to
bite us as we tried to sleep.  I was awaken about midnight with mosquitoes all
over my arm.  I turned the cooler up, and then we pulled the sheet over our
head to get some protection.  We got up at 5:30 AM to start the day.  Time went
by so fast, then at 8 AM Elder Kendall and Irorita came for breakfast, and then
spent time with us studding Tagalog.  I am getting very discouraged over trying
to learning the language.  I am just not remembering it.  I woke this morning
with thoughts concerning the work here.  I feel that if President Brimhall will
approve, that Mae &amp; I might act as President Gajorena's Executive Secretary
on a temporary basis and get the Branch records up to date and the Home
Teaching and Visiting Teaching going.  Then when we have the 1st Branch
working, we should help the next Branch.  We can continue to work on the
Library and the Jr. Sunday School in our spare time.  We would use the Home
Teaching form that I designed form memory of the first H. T. forms the Church
used when the H. T. program was first introduced in the 60's.  We would use our
computer to enter all the church records by families.  Then select all the
known members out, having individual members try to locate those families that
are not known.  The full time missionaries would also help locate unknown families. 
At the same time we check out the membership, we could deliver an invitation
with Branch information on it, to invite the family to attend the Branch
meetings.  Elder Kendall agreed with my ideas, with the approval of President
Brimhall and caution that we do not do all the work for the Branches, but train
others as we proceed.  We then went with the Elders to visit a couple of
Families.  The one family wasn't home but we were able to see some of the farm
land that is North of Munoz.  We came back for lunch, a nap and did some
studding.  We again went with the Elders and split with Elder Irorita.  We
visited an investigator that is having problems believing in reincarnation.  He
was very polite but we couldn't get him past his feelings.  He tried to pray,
but couldn't so ask Sister Browning to pray.  We then visited a brother that is
on the District High Counsel.  We enjoyed getting acquainted with his family
although his wife wasn't home.  We joined again with Elder Kendall and visited
an investigator and a member family before we came on home.  I feel badly that
I can not commutate with better with these families.  Mae stayed up and studied
but I went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
attended District Leadership meeting this morning.  We got home about 11:30
AM.  Marlyn prepared a nice dinner for us.  We ask her if she would be willing
to work tomorrow to prepare dinner for President Brimhall, Sister Brimhall,
Sister Clark and Elder Clark.  We were going to go to San Jose to get some
items we will need to buy before tomorrow, but just as we were about to leave,
the phone co. came to install our telephone.  It took them over an hour, so we
didn't get to San Jose today.  We left Munoz at 2:30 PM and went to Guimba
where we met Elder Welch and Elder Bybee and went out visiting with them.  We
went to a man that is 83 years old.  He was a scout for the U. S. Army during
the 2nd World War.  He was very interesting.  He had a nice home with tile
floors, smooth painted walls and nice furnishings.  The next home was a young
mother with a 3 year old son that was just darling and a 2 year old daughter
that wasn't going to let go of her mother while we were there.  I didn't
understand the situation but the husband wasn't there.  We had a delightful
visit with the mother, her sister-in-law and a friend.  The home was a two room
home with dirt floors and built out of bamboo walls and a corrugated metal
roof.  The only furniture in the room we were in was plastic chairs and a
hammock for the baby's bed.  She was so pleasant, but so poor as to the things
of the earth.  At the next home, it belonged to a lady about 36 to 38, her 17
yr old son, her mother-in-law.  She has a daughter that is13 who wasn't there. 
Again the husband wasn't there and the Elders didn't explain why.  Shortly
after we got there the lady left and we thought she had gone to get her
daughter, but soon returned with Ice Cream Sunday's for the four of us.  That
was just heart breaking to have to tell her that we couldn't accept them.  They
cost her 40 Pecos for them and I know that she couldn't afford them.  That was
so hard to refuse, I just wanted to cry.  These people are so loving and want
to show us hospitality.  Mae and I left the Elders and came home after that. 
Mae is doing very well with trying to use the language, bearing her testimony
and saying prayers in Tagalog.  Again it is quite an experience to drive in
this area and especially after dark for you never know when there will be some
kind of a vehicle or cart on the road with out lights or even reflectors, not
to mention people and animals.  After getting home we ate dinner prepared for
us by Marlyn before she quit today.  We feel very blessed to have her as our
house maid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in a little this morning, and then went to San Jose shopping for a table,
chairs and some groceries.  While looking at chairs and trying to decide on the
style to get, the sales person took us over to their warehouse in a trike. 
That was a first and we didn't have far to go so it was kind of fun.  We were
able to find every thing we went for.  We quickly put things away when we got
home for we didn't have much time to get to District Conference.  There weren't
very many members there at the first leadership meeting but it went forward with
a good Spirit.  The following meeting had a better attendance.  After the
Conference we had President Brimhall, Sister Brimhall, Elder Clark and Sister
Clark come to dinner at our home.  Marlyn prepared dinner for us as the rest of
us visited.  President Brimhall asked if I would accept a calling to be an
Executive Secretary over Home Teaching, to the newly called District
President.  President Mercado will be presented and sustained in tomorrows
Conference Sessions.  He wants me to help organize the Home Teaching in the
Branches, starting with Guimba 1st Branch.  I showed President Brimhall my form
and ask if it would be proper to use my computer.  He said I had his full
approval and was excited with my plans.  It was exciting to know that the
thoughts I have had were in correlation with President Brimhall's.  After they
left, we helped Marlyn do up the dishes, then took her home.  We were sure
grateful for Marlyn's help and food preparation.  The meal was very delicious
and enjoyed by everyone.  We have tried to call home, but can't get the call to
go through.  It was close to 10 PM when we went to bed.</p>

attended a meeting for new members prior to District Conference.  President
Brimhall conducted the meeting and gave a wonderful talk.  The Spirit was there
and very enjoyable.  We then attended the General District Conference.  It was
quite well attended.  President Brimhall took Care of the main business of
releasing President Pasardan and sustaining President Mercado.  When President Mercado
bore his testimony he said that he and his wife were seriously planning on
moving to Manila when this call came.  With this call they decided to change
their plans.  His second Counselor also told that they had planned to move to
Manila before this calling and now is not sure what they will do, but he told
me that he couldn't refuse the call.  I am impressed with the faith of these
people.  If we can just get that Faith to spread.  In the reading in of the
Stake Officers, I was sustained as an Assistant Stake Executive Secretary.  We
were quite a while after the conference concluded before we went home as there
were a lot of people to be set apart and I wanted to visit with President Mercado
before leaving.  Elder and Sister Clark brought Mae home to settle up on some
of our bills.  I stopped and got the Elders to have them eat dinner with us. 
We visited a while with the Elders after dinner.  Mae and I took a nap, and
then Mae wrote a letter to our family, that we will try to send tomorrow.   I
made this journal entry; we studied a while before going to bed.</p>

down to the Internet Shop to check on our messages.  We were delighted to find a

also sent two pictures with his E-Mail.  We then took the three Elders with us
and we went to Cabanatuan to check on our drivers licenses (which they still
won't let us have with out ACR report) then to the mall to do a little
shopping.  Mae and I purchased a few groceries, a phone line splitter and a
line to connect our computer to the land line, some shoes and some office
supplies.  We returned to San Jose were the Elders left us.  We bought a gas
range and a few groceries there.  Marlyn had some diner ready for us to warm up
when we got home.  After dinner I brought up the pictures that Mike sent and
they are great.  Oh how home sick they made me.  Mae then wanted to see some of
our family pictures.  That really made me home sick.  This is great but it also
is also the hardest experience we have gone through.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up and went waking at the collage then came back, ate breakfast and
prepared for the Elders who came over and helped us with Tagalog.  We went over
to the Dator's and ask Ronald if he would install an electrical outlet for the
range.  He came over at 3 PM and installed the electrical outlet.  I was able
to help him and we got it done quickly.  Mae and I then met Elder Kendall and
Irorita at the home of an investigator and were with them to give the 3rd
discussion.  We went out to another investigator but they were not at home.  We
visited a member and then stopped at the previous District President's home and
visited with them.  It was after 9:30 PM when we got home, then fixed something
for dinner.  Elder Clark called and had me talk to Elder Pearson who is trying
to check on what record information we can get electronically.  We were after 11
PM getting to bed.  We did get a letter from Shellie today.  It was great to
hear from her.  She wrote the letter on the 24th of March.  We also got a
letter from the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security
Administration in Manila asking for information as to our address and telephone
number here in the Philippines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were a little later getting up, but went walking at the collage anyway.  We
returned home and took showers before Marlyn came.  The Elders had a service
project so didn't come over this morning.  I worked on Home Teaching forms and
other forms we feel will be useful in our assignment.  David called about
10:45AM.  We only talked for a few minutes as it was costing him $10 per
minute.  After he called we had to have a little cry.  Mae talked just a minute
with Tyler and Emily.  The real tear jerker was when Emily said &quot;Come
Back&quot;.  That about tore us up.  At about 11:15 AM Mike called.  Mike had a
question for us about the money I sent back to him for him to deposit.  Both
said they are all doing well.  Again we had to have another cry and thank our
Heavenly Father for our beautiful Family.  Boy was it good to hear from them. 
We took a short nap after eating lunch.  Marlyn fed us a very good meal as usual. 
We went to San Jose and paid for the water cooler, then stopped at the store to
get a few groceries.  We went to Guimba and worked with Elder Welch and Elder
______.  We particularly looked up the Branch Presidents for Branch 1 and
Branch 3, to get their help in filling out Branch Organizational charts and ask
for the C.M.I.S. listing.  We took a few pictures of some of the homes in the
area.  We did visit one investigator, Gil M Batang, they were very pleasant and
willing to have us share a scripture with them.  She gave us crackers, pop and
bananas until we were stuffed.  It was a very good visit, but I don't think
they are very interested in changing their lives.  We left the Elders and came
on home.  Mae made dinner while I worked on the computer.  We were tired so
went to bed about 9:30 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were going to go walking this morning but we thought District Meeting had been
changed to today, so Mae wanted to make cookies to take to the meeting for the
Elders.  She got up and made the cookies while I slept in a little longer.  I
was preparing breakfast when Elder Kendall called to see if they were to come
this morning for Tagalog tutoring.  Next week District Meeting will be held on
Thursday, not this week.  Elder Kendall and Irorita ate the majority of the
cookies while tutoring us.  We then went down to try to get our phone service
straightened out and pay our power bill, except all of the businesses are
closed this week for Holy Week.  We will have to wait until Monday.  We visited
a family, anyway a mother, who she had most of her children and grandchildren
home for vacation.  She said that all her family was active, then she went away
to work and while she was away, her children grew up, married and left the
church.  We shared a scripture and visited with her about her testimony.  Her
one daughter came in and stayed while we were there, but the rest of her family
would not come in.  These people are so poor and work so hard for so little
that your heart hurts for them.  We then took the elders to San Jose where they
worked with a couple of other Elders.  We did a little shopping; then came home
for lunch and a nap.  We again went out with the Elders from 4 Pm until after 9
PM.  We visited and became acquainted with three families.  I felt very
depressed as we came home.  If I felt that I was making any headway with the
language, then it is so hard to know how to help this people.  I hope our time
spent here will be of worth.</p>

were too tired to get up early and go walking.  We attended the Mission
District Meeting this morning.  It is still amazing to watch these young Elders
conduct and teach lessons.  I am continuously reminded of the leadership
abilities they will take back to their home areas.  President Pasardan was at
the church when we got there as his son was interviewed by President Mercado to
be released from his mission.  We enjoyed visiting with him for a few minutes. 
After meeting we went by Brother and Sister Umibig's and visited just for a few
minutes.  On the way there we saw that the internet shop was closed because of
Holy Week.  We came on home and I took a short nap before lunch.  After lunch I
worked on papers for the District Presidency meeting in the morning.  Mae lay
down and slept for over an hour.  Elder Irorita called and ask if we could go
out with them this afternoon.  We visited three families, Roger and Heidi Silvia
with two children Karen Nicole and Darin Ralph, then Jason ______, his wife and
two children, then a newly married couple, she is a member and he is
investigating.  It was a good evening and we got home at 8:30 PM.  We just
heated some soup for super and went to bed.</p>

was very beautiful and interesting.  I went to District Presidency meeting at 9
AM, but it didn't get started until 10 AM.  While waiting President Nikkei and
I played a game of chess.  President Nikkei won.  Mae stayed home and spent much
of her time studying.  Before lunch I took a nap.  I worked on forms for the
Branches and District this afternoon.  We went over to San Jose to attend a
Baptism, but it had to be rescheduled.  We stopped at the store for some
groceries before coming home.  I spent most of the evening transferring
pictures from our camera to the computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
did sleep in until 6 AM before getting up to get going.  We attended Munoz
Branch 2 this morning and stayed until the end of the block.  President Pasardan's
son gave his Home Coming report in Sacrament meeting this morning.  We invited
Elder Kendall and Irorita to have lunch with us.  We went back for Sacrament
Meeting of the Munoz Branch 1, and then we went Home Teaching with Brother
Roger Silvia.  Brother Silvia is on the District High Counsel.  We stopped and
got Brother _______ to go with us and we visited two families.  The 1st are
getting quite old, but enjoyed us coming.  The 2nd also older but they really
enjoyed us coming.  They have gotten lost when the Branches were reorganized a
couple of years ago and did not know where to attend.  They said they would now
start attending.  I think that if we can get the Home Teaching and Visiting
Teaching going, we will find more like that.  Mae worked on writing a letter to
our family.  I worked on some charts for the Branches and entered my journal
before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up and went walking at CLSU.  It was a very nice morning and we enjoyed the
exercise.  We had quite a list of things we wanted to get done today, check on
our phone, pay the power bill, cash a check at the bank, check on our e-male,
mail some letters, get a little gift for Pres. Gajorena's baby, assemble a
Flannel Board, wash the car, get a light for above the sink and visit the
Bustos to se how Sister Bustos is doing.  We got done the e-mail, mailed the
letters, got a gift for the baby and visited the Gajorena's this evening just
long enough to see how he was feeling,  got the flannel board assembled and let
the Elders borrow it and we visited Brother Bustos and found that his wife is
doing ok and should be back home this Thursday.  We had problems with the rest
of the items.  Oh well!  They will get done another day.  Elder Kendall warned
us to keep our gate and doors locked as the Elders in Guimba had their
apartment broken into and about $500.00 worth of items taken, on Sunday.  We
got e-mails from Mike, David, Scott and Jeff:  it was great to hear from them. 
Mae also got an E-mail from Billie.  We sent e-mails of to all of our family,
extended families and friends also today.  I started a letter to our family,
but had to quite for now because it is past bed time.  Good night!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Wow!
It has been quite the day.  We are late getting home so with Mae's help, we
will make this entry tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
started by having the Elders over for breakfast of fried potatoes, scrambled
eggs, muffins, juice and fruit.  They don't have frozen hash brown potatoes, so
we bought frozen French fries and cut them up.  That works pretty well.  We
then studied Tagalog.  We tried to get an account opened so we can write out
checks from our bank in the U.S.  We need $500.00 to start it up, so just
exchanged $150.00 for now and will get a check cashed when we go to Angeles. 
We went to the phone company to get long distance added to our line, but they
were again closed.  We found out that they will be closed until May 5th.  We
got Microsoft Word 2000 put on to our computer.  This afternoon Mae and I met
Elder Malapitan and Elder Wilkinson in Guimba and went visiting with them.  We
found out that yesterday some one broke into the Elders home in Guimba and took
about $500.00 worth if items.  They took Elder Malapitan's journal and he felt
very bad over that as that has his life story in it.  He just hopes that they
might read his history and be converted from it.  The first Sister we were to
visit was sick, so we didn't go in.  We next visited an inactive Brother and
invited him to come out.  Elder Wilkinson had a Sister Liberty Delacruz and
daughter to interview, so we went to the home where the Branch Mission Leader
lived and they had Liberty and her daughter come there.  The daughter, who is
only 9, was unsure about having an interview.  I told Elder Wilkinson that he
did not have to have a privet interview with children, but could have someone
else in with them.  That worked out ok.  Mae and I had a very enjoyable time
visiting with other family members and friends, while Elder Wilkinson had the
interviews.  We then walked quite a ways out in a field and visited a couple
where he is a member and she is an investigator.  She would like to be baptized
but her first husband had been murdered several years ago, when she found out
who murdered her husband, she killed him with a knife.  They lived in a two
room home, with dirt floors, walls made out of bamboo and any thing else that
could be tied to gather to make walls and a thatched roof.  They used 4 home
made oil lamps for lighting.  She sweeps in the Palanki (an out door market)
all day and he takes care of the fields.  She wasn't feeling well when we came
because of arthritis.  However they found chairs and invited us to stay.  She
is 54 and he is 48.  It was the humblest of home that we have been in yet. 
Elder Wilkinson told me that the information about the murder had been sent in
but they hadn't heard any thing in return.  I told him I would check on it. 
Before coming home the Elders gave us a Branch 2's listing of membership to
start working on.  How blessed we felt as we said prayers before going to bed
tonight.</p>

got up and went walking this morning before breakfast.  We started working on
the Home Teaching records for Guimba 2nd Branch.  We had Elder Kendall &amp;
Elder Irorita come for lunch.  Marlyn prepared it and it was very good.  Elder
Kendall tried to set up a file on Microsoft but became frustrated over it and
finally had to quite.  They had an appointment at 3 PM that they were late
for.  We net and went with the Elders at 4:15 PM to visit Brother Merchano and
Sister Susan Corpuz and their daughter Joy this afternoon.  They also have 3
older boys.  We were able to share a scripture with them and our Testimonies. 
We then went to Brother &amp;Sister _______ where we held Family Home Evening
with them.  They were very special.  It was their daughters 8th Birthday so
Elder Kendall took ice cream for a treat.  Mae taught the children a song.  Mae
&amp; I gave a flannel board story on the resurrection.  It went over very well
with Elder Irorita interpreting for us.  Elder Irorita taught them a game.  We
also took some pictures when we first got there.  They really enjoyed that. 
Many of the neighbors and extended Family came to join in with us. Who knows,
maybe we will get some contacts from it.  We came home about 8 PM, ate dinner,
filled out my journal and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
attended Missionary District meeting this morning.  The date was changed from
Friday to Thursday as there is a special training meeting that Elder Kendall,
Elder Irorita, Mae and I are to attend tomorrow.  Mae had made a fruit cake
desert that we took with us.  Just before the meeting was over, I went over to
the store and bought Ice Cream, bowls and spoons and at the end of the meeting
Mae and I served the Elders desert.  We stopped at the Internet cafe and got
our E-mail.  There was a short one from Shauna, sending a picture from Tyler,
one from Jeff and one from Sandi.  Those were sure welcomed.  Sandy Peterson
also sent Mae an E-mail as did another one of Mae's co-workers.  That part of
the day went well.  This afternoon didn't go as well.  I got frustrated trying
to figure out the Microsoft program.  Mae got after me because I was wasting
time and should be studding Tagalog and let the program wait until Elder
Pearson in the mission home can help me.  I took a nap to try to settle down. 
That didn't help much and I still felt unsettled when I got up.  We took the
car over and got it washed.  It cost me P80 but they sure do a good job of it. 
We went into San Jose to get an Internet card and also got a few groceries.  As
we drove, Mae told me that I came on too strong during District Meeting about
Bishops and Branch Presidents not doing their jobs right.  I worked on the
computer a while, but that seemed to upset Mae for she felt that I should be
studying the language, which I know that she is right.  This is really
frustrating for me as I don't seem to know how to study.  I am not learning the
language.  I can't communicate with these people.  I don't know how to get
people to do their jobs.  I don't know how to run my computer.  When Mae prays
I don't understand even 1/2 of what she says.   I can't remember enough Tagalog
words to pray. The next door couple evidently was having a fight this evening
and though I could hear them, I couldn't understand a word they said.  I feel
so inadequate and don't understand why the Lord called me here.  Everyone tries
to give me advice, but that just seems to upset me more.  I really don't know
what to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
went to Tarlac, about 2 hours away, for a special training seminar which was
broadcast world wide by Satellite Transmission to 336 missions from Salt Lake
City.  Those invited were Mission Presidents, Assistants to Presidents, Zone
Leaders and Senior Couple Missionaries.  It was great, and covered the
&quot;Teaching by the Spirit&quot; program, now in effect through all missions
in the world.  The one sad thing for us is that Elder Kendall got transferred
to be an assistant to the President.  We will sure miss him, for he has become
so special to us.  Elder Jex came back with us as Elder Kendall's replacement. 
I am sure we will love him also.  He has been an assistant to the President. 
After we got home we went over the special instructions that President Brimhall
gave to Elder and Sister Clark and us after the training seminar.  He wants us
to spend our full time in three areas.  Fellowshipping of New Converts,
Reactivation of selected families with emphasis on current or potential
Melchizedek Priesthood holders, and Leadership training in Priesthood and
auxiliary functions.  That will keep us busy.  He reported that the world wide
percentage of Sacrament meeting attendance is 45%, in the Philippines it is
10%, and in Africa it is 85%.  The Philippines has a lot of work to do.</p>

slept in, and then while Mae prepared breakfast I prepared an Agenda for
District Presidency meeting.  The District President had told me that he would
call me with the agenda information but he never called.  I did what I could
and went to the meeting.  I went early to try to find President Michol of the
Munoz 1 Branch that I wouldn't be able to help because of the District
meeting.  How ever I wasn't able to locate him.  I got to the Chapel at 9:45 AM
and waited until 10:30 AM, but no one showed up, so I came home.  I tried to
call President Mercado but couldn't get through to him on his phone.  I calling
the Mission office to get other phone numbers, but they don't have the new
presidents yet.  I was quite upset about it.  Mae got after me two or three
times because of my attitude.  I guess that it just upsets me when leaders
don't carry their load.  Maybe I miss understood about the meeting time or it
had to be canceled for some reason, but!  After lunch we took a nap.  Mae
completed cutting out and organizing the flannel board stories.  I finished a
letter to our family, and then we went to the Internet Cafe and sent it.  We
went to San Jose and attended a Fireside for new members.  Before the meeting
started Mae &amp; I walked to the market place where we found a new fan for
Mae.  Mae had left her fan in the training room at Tarlac yesterday.  The Fireside
was a very spiritual and made an enjoyable evening.  Mae &amp; I were asked to
give our Testimony at the conclusion of the meeting.</p>

morning I was still concerned about the meeting yesterday and was thinking
about that when Mae reminded me that I hadn't done my exercises.  It upset me
that she reminded me, and I spoke cross, which of course upset her.  I then had
to apologize to her.  Why I don't think sometimes before I open my mouth, I
don't know.  We attended the Sacrament meet at Munoz 1 this morning then came
home for some lunch and a nap.  We went back and attended the block at Munoz
2.  I am having trouble trying to remember people and their positions.  It is
sure hard not being able to communicate better with the people.  I talked with
President Nuque about yesterday and found that they changed the time because of
the service project and they went out to Guimba to reorganize the 2nd Branch,
and so met out there.  President Mercado caught me after meetings and apologized
for not letting me know of the change in plans.  Had I found the work project,
every thing would have been corrected then.  They could have also used my help,
for not very many showed up.  This evening we invited Elder Jex and Elder
Irorita to have dinner with us.  Mae cooked a nice roast with potatoes and
gravy for dinner.  Elder Jex really enjoyed the meal.  We visited and showed
some pictures.  I took them home just after 9 PM.  Mae straightened up while I
made this journal entry, and then we went to bed.</p>

took us over to the bank to get a check cashed.  The bank wasn't able to cash
it until 10:30 AM, so we left the check and planned on getting back later. 
Elder Pearson went with us get our driver's license and that was a long drawn
out affair but we did succeed this time.  We stopped to see about getting a
cell phone but had to wait on that.  It was 4:30 PM before we got back to
Clark, so we didn't get our money.  Elder Clark then helped me set up a data
file for Branch Membership records and a home teaching report form.  We worked
on that until after 7 PM.  I let Elder Jex drive back home, thinking I could
sleep, but that didn't work as I couldn't relax with his driving.  We didn't
get home until after 9:30 PM, so was late getting to bed.  Although we got a
couple of things accomplished that needed to be done, I felt frustrated that we

Jesus is the Christ foretold by all the Prophets of God from the beginning of
time.  Through His selfless sacrifice He became the First to be resurrected and
made it possible for everyone that has been or that will be born to be
resurrected from the death of the body.  Also that because of His love for us, 
He was willing to suffer and paid the Eternal price for all the sins of those
that are willing to take upon then self His Name and be obedient to His
commandments.  Through this Atonement for our sins, we will be able to be
cleans from our sins and return to live with Our Heavenly Father and receive
Eternal Exaltation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt;punctuation-wrap:simple;
text-autospace:none'>            I know that there was a falling away into
total Apostasy from Christ True Church after His death and the Death of His
chosen Apostles.  The authority from God for man to act in His name was taken. 
Although many men tried to find the truth and many brought about great forces
of change, it wasn’t until April 6, 1830 that The Church of Jesus Christ was
restored through Joseph Smith Jr. and subsequently followed by the restoration
of all the ancient authority and gifts that God had given to the Prophets of
old until there was a fullness of the Gospel as given by Christ Himself.  I
know and bear Testimony that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is
that Church and we have been and am today lead by A Prophet of God, even until
the present, with that Prophet being Gordon B. Hinckley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
pray with all the desires of my hart that I may always bear this testimony and
be obedience all of my life.  I bear this testimony in the Name of Jesus
Christ.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in this morning and it seemed good.  We stayed home working on the
records for the Guimba 2nd Branch for most of today.  We also worked on some
ideas for doing the three tasks that President Brimhall assigned us:  1 -
Effective Fellowshipping of New Convert</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>                                                2
- Reactivation of selected Families w/emphasis on current or potential                                                     Melchizedek
Priesthood Holders</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>                                                3
- Leadership training in Priesthood and Auxiliary Functions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>We are
excited about this assignment but also realize that is a big job.  Mike called
us this about 9:30 AM and it kind of took us by surprise, but a very enjoyable
surprise.  They are all well.  Today is Mike's Birthday, as we are a day ahead
of them.  He said he couldn't stand going to bed not having his parents sing
&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to him, so we did.  It was sure good to hear from
him.  Scott sent us an e-mail the other day asking us to send a written
Testimony to the Ward for Brother Matt Price to but in the Ward History, so we
took about two hours typing those up.  We went to the internet cafe and sent
them, also got an E-mail from Roy, one from Mike, but we couldn't bring up the
attachments he added to it.  Scott sent a letter, which we brought up and two
pictures again.  We didn't have enough disk space so we didn't try to pull
those up yet.  I don't know what we are doing wrong on the attachments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up and went walking this morning at the collage.  We spent most of the day
working on the entering of Guimba 2nd Branch membership records.  We got 119
out of 712 entered, so that is a good start.  We took time to visit Sister
Mercado and ask her to ask President Mercado to get us a The General Handbook
of Instructions.  We need that so as to know what we should be teaching
Priesthood Leaders.  We also got the car washed and got some e-mails at the
Inter-net cafe.  Mike sent us our bank statement and some pictures of Jessica,
we loved them.  I balanced our bank statement this evening.</p>
