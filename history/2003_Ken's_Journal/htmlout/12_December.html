<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in,
so didn’t go walking this morning.  We were busy trying to get e-mails off. 
Almost before we were ready it was time to get on the instant messaging with
the boys.  Jeff was the only one on for a while, but then Scott came on. 
Shauna came in for just a minute.  The boys told us about the viewing and
funeral.  It went well but the weather was bad and stopped some from
attending.  They said that it had been recorded and a copy would be sent to
us.  Jeff had us take a picture of the two of us and send it over the instant
messaging.  This afternoon we went to San Jose for some groceries and to mail
some birthday and Christmas cards.  This evening we tried to watch the DVD’s
that Mike has sent to us, but they would only go part way through and then
stop.  We played the DVD, “Building Faith in Christ”.  The high School band
came into our area and played Christmas carols.  We gave them P20 tip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning at the collage.  The temperature was very nice and we
enjoyed the walk.  After getting back home I mopped all the tile floors. 
Marlyn doesn’t do a very god job on the floors and it was getting to me so I
did it.  It took me until 10:30 to finish, but they are clean now.  We have
been on the computer most of the day with reports and e-mails.  Mae did a lot
of work on the Health Fair through out the day.  She also worked in the yard
trimming and getting them looking better.  We tried to call Sandi but didn’t
find her home, so just left a message for her.  She later e-mailed us.  It was
good to hear from her, but we would sure like to be there for her.  I went to San
  Jose to get some money out of the bank, some parts for the toilet and some
gas in the car.  I decided to take our own pictures for the passport pictures
we have to turn in.  It took me a little while to get the printing figured out,
but finally got them done.  I did some work on the training we are to do in
Paniqui this weekend.  This evening we had the National High School band come
around our neighborhood playing Christmas Carols.  Mae gave them P20.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very well last night so Mae let me sleep in until 7AM. 
Mae called President Neito to find out when he wanted us to meet him to visit
the schools that are invited to attend the Health Fair.  We hurried and met him
at 8:30AM, at his home, where we discussed the plans.  We went to the Central
 Elementary School first and met with the principle.  She was a little
apprehensive at first but soon felt ok with the program and was willing to have
her school participate.  She even became very friendly by the end of our visit
and said that when we go home; she would like to get in our suitcases.  We next
went to the San Sebastan High School, which is a privet school.  The principle
was out when we got there, so we went over our proposal with the vice principal
who said that she would give it to him when he returned.  As we were leaving
the principle returned and invited us back into his office.  He changed the
tentative plans, so it was good that he came when he did.  From there we went
to the National High School.  The principle was very friendly and whished that
we had held the Health Fair at her school just for her students.  She invited Mae
and I to come back anytime, and she would give us a tour of the school and
their facilities.  We felt very good at the way everything went.  After lunch,
I took a nap, while Mae wrote and sent some e-mails.  We worked this afternoon
and evening on our presentation for Saturday.  This evening we had some youth
come Christmas Caroling.  Mae gave them P20, but then they came back a few
minutes later for more, but this time we didn’t give them more.  I hope we
haven’t started something!  President and Sister Neito came over this evening
for a few minutes.  He said he had been to visit with the Mayor this afternoon
and the mayor asked about us.  He extended an invitation from the Mayor, for us
to attend a program at 8AM tomorrow, for all the religious leaders in the
community to show united effort in making our city a better place.  President
Neito also said that an invitation would be coming for us to attend a
“Christmas Concert” cultural show, December 5<sup>th   </sup>at 8AM, with guest
artists; Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra.  We will be pleased to attend
these.  We are also invited to the Barangay Night dance, but I think we will
decline that offer because this will be a “party night” with lacquer being
served.  While we were visiting, President Neito said he hadn’t slept very well
last night.  He woke up at 2:00 a.m. worrying about the Health Fair and all
that needed to be done, and worrying about the scheduling that we were going to
do this morning with the schools.  Mae told him that I hadn’t slept well either
and that the two of us should have gotten together and played “Chess”.  He gave
me a “high 5” and said that showed that I was a responsible person also, as I
was worrying about the Fair.  I said “oh, I thought it just meant that I had
stomach problems.”  Sister Nieto was very impressed with our home and asked how
much we were paying each month.  When Mae told her P7000, she said “Oh, very
expensive”.  It is very expensive over here in the Philippines, but it surely
isn’t in America.  P7000 is only $140.00.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We
left at 7:15 a.m. to go to the Science City Gym here in Munoz for the
Ecumenical Services, which started at 8:00 a.m.  This was the Opening program
for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Charter Anniversary of the Science City of Munoz.  When
we got there we had planned on setting back a ways but Mayor Nestor L. Alvarez,
escorted us to the front of the auditorium.  When he made the opening remarks
and welcomed special guest, he recognized us by name.  This was a uniting of
the faiths.  There were 12 different churches represented, ours being one of
them.  We met several of the pastors and other government dignitaries.  It was
interesting because they gave each of us a program and the prayers, short
talks, messages were all printed out on the program.  President Nieto was
supposed to represent our Church, but he was late getting there so everyone in
the audience just read his part.  Mae and I couldn’t understand it because it
was all in Tagalog.   We came home to find that the power was off, so we went to
  San Jose to do some errorns and I took Mae out to lunch at Jollibees.  We
wanted to see Sugar, but she wasn’t there at the time.  We came home and took a
nap, and then worked on our presentation, practicing until the power came on at
 4:30 p.m. and then made overheads.  We had some young boys come by Christmas
Caroling, but they came the night before and we thought they were good so we
gave them some pesos.  They thought that was great so a few minutes later they
came back again.  We thought it was a different group so we gave them pesos
again.  The third time they returned, we realized it was the same boys so we
refused them.  They didn’t want to take “no” for an answer as they thought they
had a good thing going.  Tonight they came again and were very annoying.  We
had a personal invitation, from the City Mayor to come to the cultural arts
night tonight.  He told us that the “Pride of the Philippines” – National
Singers would be performing, plus others so we would enjoy it.  Not only did he
invite us in person when we were with him this morning, but he sent a boy with
a letter to our home specially inviting us, so we decided we better go, even
thought we were busy trying to finish the presentation for Saturday.  When we
arrived, the mayor again saw us.  We were planning to sit close to the back and
side so we could leave if it wasn’t appropriate or was too long, but the mayor
motioned for us to come up.  When we did, he seated us on the front row and
introduced us to his family.  His sister sat by Mae and was very sweet and Mae
enjoyed visiting with her prior to the show starting.  She was a beautiful
woman.  They had lived in New York for 3 years while her husband got his
doctorate degree from Cornell University.  She spoke very good English and
would keep us informed on what was going on when they were speaking or singing
in Tagalog during the show.  Mae enjoyed the show, but I tolerated it.  It was
different.  It was 2 ½ hours on hard chairs so we were glad when it was over. 
When we got home, Mae worked on the computer and I finished assembling an
extension cord for the fridge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                 We attended
Paniqui District Development Meeting yesterday morning and enjoyed being with
those Elders.  Mae got up early and made brownies for them and they are always
excited when she does that.  The Samoan Elder got away with four.  We gave the
others all two.  Most of the Samoan Elders are pretty mischievous and he is one
of them. They have that cute, but mischievous smile and their eyes twinkle.  We
stopped at the Guimba Hospital to see Rose and tell her the bad news about not
getting the paint paid for from the Swenson’s and to see if she knows of any
organization who can pay for the paint and then we, the Elders and youth from
Guimba will still paint the beds.  Rose wasn’t there, but met her mother who
was there visiting her husband.  He had a stroke and has been in the hospital
for 3 months.  They will be taking him home this week.  He can’t talk, but
holds out his hand to shake hands with us.  They are sweet people – no wonder
Rose is so wonderful.  We also stopped at the Doria family to take the boys a
scrabble game, which they mentioned they would like and the parents don’t have
the money to buy one.  When we got there and were walking back to their home,
the next to the youngest son saw us and got a big smile on his face and ran to
tell the others that we were coming. He was so cute.  He is about 5 years old. 
We always enjoy seeing this family.  The mother hugged Mae, and it was great to
see her happy.  This is the first time she has done that.  She usually has a
sweet smile, but stands back and is shy and seems sort of sad.  We were glad we
could bring some happiness into her life and that of her family.  She walked
back out to the road with us.  Marlyn had lunch ready for us when we got home. 
I went to pick up the copies we left yesterday, which we need for tomorrow in
Paniqui.  When I returned, Mae was checking the e-mail messages we received. 
We didn’t get any from our children, but we got one from Pat &amp; Ron
Bradfield, Maryon Frazier, Adele Clay, Maggie Klass, Sandy Petersen, Kim and
Elder &amp; Sister Staples.  In the e-mail from Elder &amp; Sister Staples,
they were offering condolences on the death of our son-in-law, Terry Thomas.  They
said they also had sad news.  They received a phone call on the 27<sup>th</sup>
of October that their 37-year-old son had been killed in a car accident.  They
didn’t go home for the funeral either and their other children took care of
everything in their absence.  Wow!  We think that would even be harder not to
go home when one of your own children is killed.  We worked on our presentation
for tomorrow at Paniqui as we need to do the presentation on our overhead
projector and so we made several new overheads and changed our narrative quite
a bit.  We were in the middle of it when it was time to leave for the
Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra Concert.  It was to start at 7:00
 p.m. so we got there about 6:55 p.m., but there was hardly anyone there.  Our
neighbor, Ed, saw us and came over as he is in the Munoz choir and they were
practicing to sing with the orchestra.  The orchestra wasn’t even in their
seats on the stage.  The mayor had a special letter delivered to us and it said
“7:00 p.m.”  Of course, we should have realized that they don’t start on time;
they have Philippine time which is ½ hour to 2 hours late.  Well, this was 2
hours late.  It didn’t start until 9:00 p.m.  The orchestra did rehearse so we
enjoyed that, but we had so much to do at home that we wished we would have
known.  The mayor didn’t get there until about 8:00
 p.m.  He saw us sitting further down in the audience and Mae was talking with
two ladies.  He came to us and had us go up to the front with him and he seated
us on the front row again, right in front of the stage.  He introduced us to
two other ladies to us – one was about Mae’s age and the other was older.  Mae
enjoyed visiting with them.  From all we’ve heard, the people seem to really
like the mayor as he really gets things done.  He used to be the Dean of CLSU,
the college here in Munoz.  When the concert finally started, the mayor
introduced all the city council and other dignitaries and he also introduced
Mae and I again.  Oh boy, if President Oaks &amp; President Brimhall didn’t see
us yesterday morning, or last night, they were sure to see us tonight on TV as
the camera was on us several times.  We joked that President Oaks might tell
President Brimhall that he must not be keeping us busy enough if we had time to
go to all these cultural events here in Munoz.  We were glad we had stayed as
it was excellent.  The conductor was Ruggero Barbieri and he was excellent. 
They had a soprano, who sang with them, Rachelle Gerodias, and she was
fantastic.  She was beautiful and her voice was incredible.  They also had a
young woman, Aimee Mina, who played the xylophone and she played “Flight of the
Bumble Bee” and she was incredible.  The entire performance was so good; we
were excited to be there.  The last number they played and the choir sang was
the Hallelujah Chorus from “The Messiah”.  Wow! It was electrifying and
everyone jumped up and gave them a standing ovation.   One of the city council
members was telling us that if you went to see this Philharmonic Orchestra in Manila,
it would cost $1000 pesos for each person ($20.00), which isn’t that much in America, but it is here.  When it was over, a lady handed Mae &amp; I each a flower lea and
asked us to go up on the stage and put them around the necks of the “Choir
Master and other dignitaries.  We were surprised to be asked to do this, but we
did it.  The one lady next to Mae was given a bouquet of flowers to give to the
Soprano and the lady who handed us the lea’s took a flower lea and put it
around the neck of the conductor.   I remarked to Mae that if President Oaks
and President Brimhall didn’t see us before, they surely did now or someone
would tell them.   The mayor talked with us after and asked if we enjoyed it. 
He also invited us to a special choir performance at the Catholic Church on
Sunday.  We told him we had other obligations so wouldn’t be able to attend. 
The two ladies were also inviting us to it.  We think this mayor likes having
two Americans in his city as he sure showers us with attention.  President
&amp; Sister Nieto and their daughter came up to us afterwards and asked us to
walk through the Municipal Park with them.  It was decorated so beautifully
with the Christmas decorations and lights.  They also had many displays of
flowers, woodcarvings, vegetables, other souvenirs, etc.  We got home about 11:30
 p.m. and still had to finish our presentation.  It was after 1:00
 a.m. when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                We slept in as long as we could but then
had to get going as we had scheduled a meeting, for 7:30
 AM, with President Neito and Sister Carolyn Rubio, to discuss the Health Fair
before going over to the collage.  President Neito was late because he had a
relative come to try to sell they some life insurance.  He apologized, but it
still put us behind an already busy schedule.  We were to meet at the C.L.S.U.
R.O.T.C. center at 8 AM, but were late getting there.  We got there at 8:30
 AM, but then they weren’t ready for us until almost 9
 AM.  We missed part of the Welfare meeting at San Jose, but what we got was
good.  Elder and Sister Hyer were speakers at the meeting.  There was a nice
lunching for us after the meeting and we enjoyed visiting with Elder &amp;
Sister Hyer.  From there we drove to Paniqui where we were to meet Elder
Summerhaze and his companion at their house.  We followed their instructions to
get to their house, but we questioned if we were right, so ask a young girl
where the Mormon Missionaries lived.  She acted puzzled, but when Mae tried to
ask her in Tagalog, she said they didn’t live here.  We left and looked further,
but when we got to the outside of town, know we had missed it.  We called the
ZL’s and picked them up at the Stake Center.  They took us back to where we had
been and had asked the girl for information; there the Elders were waiting for
us on the road.  When we told Elder Summerhaze what the girl had said, he told
us that they had told everyone not to tell where they lived because of all the
robberies.  We had to laugh at that.  Our presentation went well and we had a
good group in attendance.  We got home after 7PM,
got something to eat.  Mae got on the Computer, but I fell asleep.  With eating
so late, I had to sleep the first part of the night setting in the recliner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as long as we could, but I got up and wrote President Brimhall a letter
concerning the C.S.P. we are trying to plan for the Guimba District
 Hospital.  We went to Gerona Branch in the Paniqui District to attend their
meetings.  I was really impressed with the Spirit that I felt as the members
were preparing for meeting to start.  Fast and Testimony meeting was very
spiritual and enjoyable.  I was going to bear my testimony, but there was never
a break to get up.  After Sacrament meeting we attended the Sunday school
class.  It was also very good.  In Priesthood meeting the Elders Quorum
President gave some thoughts on Home Teaching.  He asked President Nadado to
explain part of it.  President Nadado used part of the information that we had
presented yesterday, as he had been in attendance at that presentation. 
President Nadado then called on me.  I had little time left, so said that I
would like to train the Quorum President personally.  President Nadado then
said that they would be having a leadership training next Saturday, and asked
if I could do it then to all the Elder Quorum Presidencies?  After meeting I
visited a little longer with the Elders Quorum President and ask if he would
bring the CMIS report to that training?  He said he would.  When I met Mae and
asked her about our schedule for next Saturday, President Nadado asked her to
train the Relief Society Presidencies also.  We came home and took a nap, then
went to a meeting on the Health Fair.  We brought the ZL’s home wit us for
dinner.  They were hungry!  We were late getting to bed again tonight.</span></p>

 4:30 AM and had to hurry to leave by 6 AM.  We made it to Tarlac about 7:15
 AM, so had plenty of time to eat breakfast at McDonalds before meeting the
Hyers at 8 AM.  We rode with them to Clark Field.  We stopped at the bank and
cashed a check.  We went to Angeles and did some shopping.  Mae and I bought
the end tables we have been looking at for some time.  I think we were charged
more than what we were originally quoted, but being that we did not know what
we had been quoted before, we were stuck.  We also bought some wood carved
caribou for P200 each but when we read the sales slip they were charged at P250
each.  We have ordered three more, so will take the slip back and see if we can
get a credit.  The Hyers also bought some items while there.  We went to the
mission office and from there went out to eat, taking the Clarks with us.  We
ate at the La Crème restaurant.  It was very good.  It was good to visit with
the Hyers and the Clarks.  We are concerned about President Brimhall, as he
passed out this morning and has been taken to the hospital in Manila for the
Dr. to try to find out why.  Mae wanted to buy some brownie mixes and some
jello at the Duty Free Store before we left Clark Field.  We got back to Tarlac
about 5 PM.  It has sure been fun being with the Hyer’s today.  Shortly after
getting home, we heard the same boys that have been here every night since Mae
gave then a tip, so we shut off the lights before they got here and they went
away.  They are beginning to be a pest.  We got an e-mail from Lois Funk and
one from Shellie.  We sure enjoy those letters.  It’s after 9:30
 PM so we will get to bed.  Mae called the Clark’s and they told her that
President Brimhall will be staying over night at the hospital for more tests.</span></p>

up by 4:30 AM so we could get to Cabanatuan by 8
 AM.  We made it shortly after 7 AM, so had time to lay back and take a short
nap.  We practiced with our Zone the shits we are to put on during the
Christmas party.  President Brimhall wasn’t able to be with us, as he is still
in the hospital for more tests.  We missed him and his sweet wife.  President
Brimhall called us on our phone and ask Mae and I to bare our testimonies
during the program.  It was a very enjoyable program in the chapel, and then we
moved into the cultural hall and had the skits.  We went over to the mall and
purchased a few items before coming home.  It was 5
 PM before we got home.  We took a short nap and then went to the Central
school for training with the Health Fair staff.  We hope we have enough
volunteers tomorrow to have a successful fair.  It was after 9
 PM when we left to come home.  When we got home we realized that we had left
the note binder at the school, so had to go back to get it.  It is late and we
are tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at 4:30
 AM in order to get to the Health Fair by 6:30 AM.  The security staff had
stayed through the night and had caught one young man out of two that had tried
to steal items during the night.  It was quite a challenging and stressful day,
yet it was a great day.  First of all, the Elementary school sent over all of
their 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> graders, which were
1,200 students.  We had scheduled, with the principal, to send over 270 for
each session.  We took part of them through the Exhibits and then we had the
“Opening Ceremony” where the mayor and other government, school and church
officials were to speak.  Sister Umipig and her group had decorated so beautifully. 
They had beautiful flowers, balloons, banners, etc.  I was asked to give the
opening prayer and to sign the certificates so I sat on the stage with them.  
While Mae was sitting on the front row watching the Opening Ceremonies, Elder
Harris (who he and his wife are the couple missionaries over the Health Fairs)
came and sat by her and said “well, we finally get to meet.”  He asked how the
fair was going and she explained how the school administrators sent all the
upper grades instead of sticking with the schedule they were given.  He told
her of two options and one was to talk with the principal and ask if, after the
Opening Ceremonies was over, she would send the 5<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>th</sup>
grades back to class and stick by the schedule after that.  Mae liked that
option and took the zone leaders with her and went in to talk to the
principal.  She got it worked out and said how she felt the hand of the Lord in
bringing Elder Harris to her at that time so he could help her know what to
do.  The next thing which happened was that the National High School, who were
supposed to send 120 students at 8:00 a.m. and then 100 for the Opening
Ceremonies came very late, just before the ceremonies was to end, so Mae had to
send them back to their school.  Because they were so late and because the
Elementary School had sent all their students at once, there was no room for
the high school students.  Mae talked with President Neito and at lunch, he
accompanied us to the National High School to apologize to the principal and to
go over the schedule with her for tomorrow.  The next thing that happened was
that a huge gust of wind blew the lighted panels down.   The staff and other of
us leaders ran to grab them.  Thankfully, they didn’t break.  We really had to
watch them after that.  The wind was strong all day and they couldn’t set up
the Puppet Show area until they put a tent up to stop the wind.  The next thing
that happened was that after we ate lunch, Mae was looking for the Exhibit
Group Leader, Sister Carolyn Rubio, and couldn’t find her.  We had several new
CLSU students come who needed to be oriented.  Mae tried to call her on her
cell phone, but couldn’t get through.  One of the Single Adult girls told Mae
that she saw Carolyn leave.  Mae worried that she had offended Carolyn as these
people get offended so easily. Carolyn wanted to change things in the Exhibits
and Mae told her we couldn’t, etc., etc.  She finally txt us saying she had
severe stomach cramps, diarria and throwing up.   She had taken medicine, but
would be late getting back.  She felt it was the food we had all eaten at
lunch.  Mae and I organized the other tour guides and oriented the new ones to
their panels and were ready to start when Carolyn got back.  Carolyn said that
some of the tour guides left their stations to go visit with each other and
rest, and just left the students.  Carolyn had to gather up the students and
teach them herself until the others came back.  Oh boy.  I didn’t see that and
Mae was busy gathering up the reports and filling others out for the Health
Fair staff.  We were busy all day but things went quite well for the most
part.  There were a good number of volunteers and we had approximately 1,300
students go through the fair.  We got home shortly after 5
 PM and were beat.  I did some work on getting pictures, off the camera, and
into a folder.   I took lots of pictures and also had one of the Elders take
pictures of the Opening Ceremonies for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We
woke with the alarm at 4:30 a.m. so we could be at the Central Elementary venue
again this morning at 7:00 a.m.  It was hard getting up as we were still so
tired from yesterday.  When we got to the school, the Elders were already
there.  Junie, the supervisor for the CLSU students came soon after with her
student volunteers.  Carolyn Rubio, the Exhibit Group Leader, came soon after
and together we got the student volunteers registered and assigned to their
station.  I decided we needed to put papers stating the section # so it would
make it easier for the volunteers and the participants so I quickly typed them
up, cut them and took masking tape to tape them on.  Each volunteer (or tour
guide as they are called) explains 5 of the lighted panels to a group of about
20 students.  They have 3 minutes to explain the 5 panels and then the students
go to the next section and that tour guide explains their 5 panels and they
continue this going to the right until the students have gone to all 60 panels
and also to “Muscle Man” and “Smoking Sam”.  They are great-lighted panels
about drug abuse, the effects of alcohol and tobacco on the body, health and
hygiene, etc.  We have to have 14 tour guides at all times.  It was mainly
these college students from CLSU who helped us with the exhibits (which is the
lighted panels).  They did a great job.  There were about 5 yesterday afternoon
who left their stations to rest and visit and this caused us some anxiety, but
we told future tour guides to always stay at their station when we had students
going through.  It took 45 minutes for the students to go through all these
sections.   Junie was wonderful to work with.  She was so friendly, cooperative
and went the extra mile by bringing students and making sure they were doing
their job, then going back to the college to recruit more for the afternoon or
next day.  We had a student named “Mark” who had such a cute personality.  He
seemed to be the “leader” or really popular.  He was out going and kept asking
Mae &amp; I questions and teasing us, etc., as he would ask us to speak Tagalog. 
The others would laugh or clap depending on what we said.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>At 8:00
 a.m., National High School brought over their students.  They brought 270, but
the ROTC from the college came also and there was about 200 or 250 of them. 
They were all in their uniforms (hot uniforms, Mae &amp; I couldn’t see how
they can stand to wear them as it is too hot over here for those kind of
uniforms).  They had been standing at attention in the hot sun waiting to come
in while the students came in first.  They came to give blood for the “Blood
Letting”.  We didn’t have room for them, but we couldn’t make them stand in the
hot sun so we brought in more chairs and crowded the high school students
together.  We knew there was going to be a “blood letting” and that ROTC
students were coming, but we had no idea that all of them would be coming at
once.  The Red Cross was doing the “blood letting”, but they were not supposed
to be there until 9:00 a.m. (they didn’t arrive until after 9:30
 a.m.) but the ROTC students were there by 8:00 a.m.  We were also having a
“Medical Mission” in connection with the Health Fair and this took place this
morning from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (Although Sister Umipig’s 2 daughters who
are doctors and 1 daughter who is a nurse stayed until about 4:00p.m. to examine
people who came.)  Sister Umipig pointed out to Mae a mother with her two sick
children and said “How could we turn them away when her children are so sick”
?  She pointed to an elderly man who was sick and in pain and said “How could
we turn him away?”  She pointed to others and said “How could we turn them
away”?  Sister Umipig and her daughters are so Christ like.  Sister Rubio is
another person who is Christ like.  She saw how many people were waiting to go
to the medical mission and saw that there were only 3 doctors so she called her
friends in Cabanatuan who are doctors and asked if they would come to which
they responded, they would.  She also called a friend who is a dentist and she
also came.  We had one other dentist.  There were many people who came to the
medical mission.  In the afternoon Sister Rubio noticed an old lady who seemed
sick so she went to her and asked if she was ok.  The lady asked Carolyn if she
would get her a drink of water as she was about to pass out.  Carolyn quickly
did so and the lady told her how she and her grandson had gotten up really
early as they had to walk here and it is a long way as they are in another
providence.  The lady is 81 years old.  They went to the Science City Gym
(where we were first scheduled to have it) and waiting two hours until her
grandson, who was about 12, found out that it was at the Central Elementary
Gym.  They walked over here.  By that time she was about sick as they had had
no food or water since the day before.  She asked at the information table
where to go and they sat down in that area.  Many were in front of her, but
when Carolyn found all this out, she quickly went to buy food for this grandma
and her grandson.  She got them water and chocolate milk also.  She then talked
to Sister Umipig and Jean Gasmenia about getting her in to see the doctor right
away.  They did and also gave her free medicine.  This sweet little grandma was
so grateful.  Carolyn gave her money for trike fare for her and her grandson
and flagged down a trike for them.  Carolyn was telling Mae about her and
pointed her out, as she had not left at this time so Mae went over and met her
and expressed her love to her.  Mae was very grateful that Carolyn was
observant and also that she was in tune with the spirit to see this little lady
as none of the other Activities volunteers had noticed her, and there were
several over in that area.  Carolyn’s responsibility as being the Exhibit Group
Leader was on the other side of the venue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We
had several other challenges during the day such as the schools not following
their schedules, so they were either early or late bringing the students over
and sometimes they would have the correct amount of students, but many times
they brought less or else they brought way too many.  The Elders quickly called
me to take them to their apartment as it was being robbed.  Several crowded
into the car with me and the Elders as two women came in saying the Elder’s
gate was open and they saw people in their house.  The police was called and
appeared at the house shortly after we did.  It turned out that it was Bishop
Mensia who works for the mission.  He was bringing bunk beds for the Elders as
at the end of the month they will have two more Elders living with them.  The
President is giving us 2 more since we are a small zone and we need two elders
for each Branch.  The Bishop would have been in bad trouble had we not arrived
when we did.  Others had known to be shot on the spot by the police.  The
Bishop was nervous and really sorry that he had not called or txt the Elders to
let them know he was coming.  He had assumed that Elder Karin had let them
know.  Another challenge was that the Food Group Leader, Jean Gasmenia, didn’t
have some of her volunteers show up and was stressed, as she needed them, so
Mae quickly went to find some from the other groups, and some did come.  We
have been very impressed with our volunteers and group leaders.  They have been
wonderful – very cooperative, helpful, dependable, responsible, etc., etc.  
President Nieto approached Mae about stopping in the middle of the day to have
another program as he wanted the mayor to be able to come over and see the
Health Fair as he had not been able to the day before.  Mae showed him the
schedule and reminded him that it would throw off the schedule and the schools
wouldn’t get their time for the lecture/puppet show and the exhibits.  He asked
when they could have it and she suggested 4:00 p.m. as we should be finished by
 3:30 p.m.  President Nieto sent a text message to the mayor.   Alene (one of
the Health Fair Staff) took too long with the lecture (it is only supposed to
be 45 minutes and they had been really good about keeping it on time and wanted
everything to flow smoothly so asked us to have people at each school directing
the students over and keeping them on schedule) so that caused us to get behind
and half of the students came late so we were not finished at 3:30.  In fact,
we were just starting the exhibits (and it was tough because we didn’t have
enough CLSU volunteers so had to round up other volunteers to help us, and the
schools sent over too many students so we had 23 in a group instead of 15-18)
when President Nieto ran up to Mae and wanted her to go greet the mayor as he
had just arrived.  He asked if we could stop the exhibits and have the children
return to their seats so they could have the program.  It was only 3:45
so she asked him if the Mayor couldn’t just wait a few minutes as it had been
hard getting the students to each of their sections and now they had just
started.  He said he would, but after she greeted the mayor, the children
started going to their seats.  Not sure how that happened, but we lost our
students.  Carolyn Rubio was very upset.  Anyway, President Nieto had the
National Anthon played while we stood, he had a prayer, he introduced us and
the other group leaders.  He then had President Mercado speak, he spoke, he had
Elder Harris speak and he asked me to speak.  That caught me off guard, but I
proceeded to the microphone anyway.  He then had the mayor speak.  He had a
closing prayer and then took the mayor through the exhibits.  It was late by
this time and the CLUS students and other volunteers had already checked out
with Mae as they had to leave to go to class, so we just had the students walk through
the panels themselves and go home.   Elder and Sister Harris had come earlier
and it was good talking with them again today.  Mae was collecting all the
reports from the group leaders and making her final report using the
information from their reports as she needed to turn them in the Health Fair
Staff, so I helped her.  It wasn’t long until all the equipment was packed into
the truck as it was the Facilities Group’s responsibility to help the Health
Fair Staff, Alene, R1 and R2 (both their names are Robert so they go by R1
(Robert 1) and R2 (Robert 2)  The Security Group and men from other groups
helped.  We then took pictures of all of us together and then went to the
Church House to have a final celebration.  They gave us food, sandwiches and drinks. 
Some of the branch members prepared the food and put them into the containers
like you get when you go to “fast food” places.  They had their traditional
Filipino food, and we were a little nervous about getting sick – but couldn’t
refuse them.  They had lunch for us both days as well as food tonight.  This is
a hard mission rule and sometimes we’re not sure what to do.  President Clark
said that if they have purchased food from a restaurant, etc., we could eat it,
and at first we thought this is what they had done, but found out later that
members had made it.  The Elders ate also.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Elder
&amp; Sister Harris told us that ours was one of the best Health Fairs they had
put on and that they were very happy because this was the last one for the year
and the Health Fair Staff could end the year feeling this success.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>R2 was over the reports, the
technical equipment, the flow of the health fair, etc., so he told Mae that he
was so happy that we (a couple missionary) were the Staff Group Leaders as
everything went so smooth compared to the other health fairs.  He could tell we
had read and studied the material we had been given, that we had done much
planning and preparation and had the leadership skills necessary.  He said
other staff group leaders didn’t do these things and sometimes they had not
even read the materials so had done very little planning and preparation so
these were disasters.  We could see how this could be as we have been meeting
weekly (every Sunday at 4:30 or 5:00 p.m.) with the group leaders, President
Nieto, President Nuque (until he left for Panama), sometimes President Mercado
and sometimes part of the volunteers.  Mae has spent many hours studying and
preparing, calling or texting the group leaders, President Nieto and others,
etc., etc.  Alene and R1 said kind things to us also and Alene said that Elder
&amp; Sister Harris would be going home soon as their mission is almost over
and he knew who to recommend taking their place.  We hope not as we love our
mission here, and we are relieved that the Health Fair is over as it was a lot
of work.   We wouldn’t want their responsibilities, as that is their entire
mission - they are over the Health Fairs and go all over the Philippines training the leaders to put these on and then going to them for the Opening and
Closing ceremonies.  They put on two most weeks.  We know that the Lord puts
all his missionaries where they are supposed to be, so aren’t too worried.  We
have seen this from the other couples.  Mae and I have said “we couldn’t do
what the Hyers are doing”, and they said to us the other day “We couldn’t do
what you are doing.”  We have heard this from the Clarks too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>        We’re not sure if we
had these challenges to help us and the other leaders learn from them and
become better leaders or whether Satan was trying to stop us, but the Lord kept
blessing and helping us.   Anyway, despite all these challenges, we feel it was
very successful also.  We all had a good time – the students, the volunteers
and the leaders.  The students learned a lot and their principals and teachers
were very excited about the health fair and what it had done for their
students.  The volunteers were very cooperative and willing to help out
wherever needed.  The Health Fair Staff were terrific.  The Puppet Shows and lectures
(which they did) were so good.  They were so enthusiastic and did such a great
job.  We are glad it is over, but so happy that it was successful.</span></p>

and made brownies for the Elders, but we for got that both Guimba Zone and San
Jose Zone met together so that President Brimhall might conduct interviews.  We
therefore had to give them just to the Guimba Zone.  <br>
We enjoy being with the Elders in their District meetings.  President Brimhall
asked us to come in for a brief interview, mainly concerned as to how we are
doing and what Sandi’s plans are.  He suggested that we have Brother Clem, who
works for the Church, meet us at a convenient location outside of Manila, and drive our car to the airport to get Sandi.  He said that is what he did, when
his daughter came, and paid him P100 for his time.  That sounds good to us.  We
came home after meeting, ate dinner, and then I went shopping at San
  Jose for a few groceries.  Mae stayed home and prepared chicken casserole and
  Texas cake for dinner this evening with the Mercado’s.  We had dinner already
at 6 PM, but the Mercado’s didn’t show up.  We tried to reach them on the cell
phone, but couldn’t get through.  At 7 PM we ate then changed and went down to
the city gym to watch the Ballet.  We set back quite a ways, but as the Mayor
gave the opening address he welcomed us, so we stood and waved.  When he
concluded his open remarks, he came back and got us and brought us to the front
row with the rest of the dignitaries.  We enjoyed the Ballet, although that is
not my favorite thing to attend.  We were late getting home, and then Mae got
on the enter-net and sent a e-mail to little David (although he isn’t very
little any more), it’s his twelfth Birthday.  She also stayed up and e-mailed
others.  I fell asleep soon after she started.</span></p>

to wash the car, so I took it to a car wash and got it done.  We went out to
Paniqui District where Mae gave a workshop to the R. S. Sisters and I gave a
workshop to the Elders Quorum Presidents.  I think both went well.  We got home
about 6 PM and heated up dinner.  President and Sister Mercado and their two

and they took us to the Carina Branch, where we attended their meetings.  They
had both Mae and I speak.  After the meetings I visited with the Branch
President.  This was his 1<sup>st</sup> Sunday as Branch President.  He said he
didn’t have counselors yet and he doesn’t have much help.  The branch has a
membership of about 150 and the attendance was about 30 or 20 %, so that is
pretty good for here.  We hope we can help somehow.  Elder Eliason and Elder
Lopez (the zone leaders) invited us to have dinner with them.  They had a very
nice dinner of spaghetti and sauce, also rice and a chicken topping.  It was
very good.  It was nice to have Elders cook for us for a change.  They said
they were letting us use their “special” dishes – they were two matching red
plates.  The other 4 Elders all had different plates and one used a large
bowl.  We only had spoons for silver wear and no glasses, but it worked, and we
enjoyed being with them and appreciated it.  We then attended the Paniqui 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch meetings.  We were asked to speak in both Branches’.  We came home and
took a nap, and then went to the San Jose Stake center to hear the First
Presidencies Christmas message.  When we got there, it was about over.  It
started at 5 PM and we had it as starting at 6

messaging with Jeff, Scott and Sandy for an hour.  David then came on for a few
minutes.  I repaired the toilet and re-glued some of the flooring.  Mae wrote
the Family Letter and sent it off.  I visited with President Clark a couple of
times about the Guimba District and what President Mercado suggested.  Mae
called Sister Maharry and talked for quite a while.  We were told that the
Sisters apartment in Camiline was broke into and one of the robbers was
caught.  We later heard that the police couldn’t find a Judge to sign the
complaint, so they let him go.  Boy! I can’t believe this government. 
President Clark said that the Mission had to pay the expenses of the Police to
get them to come to the scene.  When the police got there, they wouldn’t go
inside, as the robbers might have a gun and shoot them.  One of the Branch
Presidents is the one that went inside and found the robber hiding under the
bed.  The mission had to agree to pay the expenses to get the police to
photograph the evidence.  The police took the man to jail, but had to let him
go because they didn’t have a judge to sign the warrant.  We think that the
robbers are part of the syndicate and the police and whoever else were paid to
let him go.  Not sure if that is true, but it probably is.  Mae went through
papers to get more organized while I wrote in my journal and did other church
work on the computer. </span></p>

missionaries on January 7<sup>th</sup>, at the Mission Office.  He said that
there would be some changes as to the direction the “couple missionaries” will
be taking.  We also talked about the Belar this weekend.  They are also
thinking about a New Year Eve party for the couple missionaries.  This evening
I gave President Neito and Brother Umipig our presentation for Branch
Presidents. Mae gave Sister Neito some training for Primary Presidents.  The
Elders were there and were excited with the training.  It went well.  We took the
Elders to their apartment, and then we went back to the city gym and heard the
last of the Jazz program.  We were asked to help put Lays on the Jazz Band

early and went walking.  As we pass people, we try to say “Good Morning” or
“Maganda Umaga” and it is interesting the reaction we get.  When we use Tagalog
it surprises them more times than not.  They are often surprised that we would
speak at all.  Some smiles and replies back, while others duck their heads and
rushes past.  There is a man that is almost always out sweeping up the area
from the leaves that fall all the time here.  He now always smiles and greets
us back and some mornings greets us first.  The Philippine people use a bamboo
straw broom to sweep with and it is almost always with a very short handle and
they have to bend over to use it.  This man is one of the few that has a handle
on it so he can stand up straight to work.  We sure enjoy walking together and
seeing the many interesting things.  I enjoy Mae when she sees some things;
such as we saw two turkeys this morning.  She got excited and we had to take
pictures of them.  She is cute, and I sure love her.  When we got back home we
had to hurry and shower and eat, as we had expected the Maharry’s to arrive at 9
 AM.  However they called and told us the Sister Maharry is sick and they
couldn’t make it today.  We were disappointed for we had looked forward to
visiting with them.  We spent the rest of the day on the computer, working on
presentations.  When I paid the power bill yesterday, there was a notice that
the power will be off tomorrow from 8 AM until 5
 PM.  Oh well, only in the Philippines.  I called Elder Karen to check on the
travel plans for Sandi.  He said the travel agent hadn’t got back to him yet,
so he would try to get through to him and would e-mail me with the information,
so as I started to write my journal entry for to day, I thought of checking the
e-mail.  As I did, I saw where Sandi had come on line.  I clicked open the
window and we visited for a few minutes.  This Tec knowledge is neat, fun and
amazing.  I fell asleep for a while Mae was on the computer, so I am trying to
get her to go to bed and let me stay up for a while and do more on the
computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                I stayed up until 2
 AM figuring the statement, plus I sent a short e-mail to Mike with a couple of
questions concerning the statement.  I also sent an e-mail to Danial Ouzounian,
asking about the power point projector. When I woke this morning I was
concerned about the District leadership and the number of inactive members. 
That put me in a negative mode and that upset Mae.  Although I didn’t get much
sleep, we still got up and went walking.  We came back and showered and then
went back to bed for a while.  Mae got up in a few minutes but I slept for a
couple of hours.  Mae did get some work done on the computer before the battery
went out on it.  This afternoon we went over to San Jose where we took the
Elders there some brownies, as Mae didn’t take enough for them last Friday.  We
got some money out of the bank and went grocery shopping.  Mae felt that the
things we bought shouldn’t have cost so much, but when we got home and checked
the bill, it was right.  Mae made a second batch of brownies so we could take
them around to some of the neighbors.  We went down to President Neito’s and
President Gajonera’s to take them some handouts.  We then went over to the
Silvia’s to visit them.  It doesn’t look like they will be having a Christmas. 
We wish there was something we could do.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                We were both late getting up as we went to
bed late.  Mae is so nice to snuggle up to that it is hard to get up some
mornings.  We ate and left for Paniqui District Development meeting, getting
there at 9 AM as they were starting.  They apologized for starting late but
they couldn’t find a key to get into the building.  They plan to start at 8:30
 AM.  We enjoy being with the Elders.  They are very inspirational as to their
ability to conduct and give training.  Mae gave a Christmas story that we had
received.  She really gave it well and had all of us feeling the Spirit of
Christmas with a few tears in the eyes.  We stayed after to get the Unit
Organization Report.  We still haven’t got the idea through yet, but are
working on it.  We went to Tarlac to see if we could find our surge protector
that we had left when we gave the presentation at the Tarlac 5<sup>th</sup>
Ward, but couldn’t find it.  We went back to the mall and we purchased a new
surge protector.  We stopped on the way back at the Guimba District
 Hospital to be sure our service project was still on schedule with them.  We
also stopped at a bicycle and motorcycle shop to get some new tires and tubes
for the wheelchair at the hospital.  It was 3
 PM before we got home.  Elder Karin called and said that he had sent us some
information on Sandi’s flight plans.  I also talked to President Clark and we
will leave from our place at 10 AM tomorrow.  I got on the computer and
e-mailed Sandi with the information.  Mike had sent us a couple of short
e-mails and Jeff sent us a nice e-mail letter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Saturday, December 20, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                I woke at 2:30
 AM thinking about the training we are to do in Balar and was up until after 4AM,
so Mae let me sleep in until I woke at 7 AM.  We gad to hurry to get everything
packed and ready to leave by 10 AM.  Marlin Dator came at 7:30
 AM to wash out car.  We were still in the shower.  President And Sister Clark
came shortly after 10 Am and we left with in a few minutes.  We went to Rizal
and then took the road that the sign said went to Balar.  It didn’t seem right
but every time we would ask someone, they would send us on.  We found a new way
that isn’t on the map, but we made it ok.  We found our motel and checked in. 
We then went down to the beach and took some pictures.  We had to call the
Elders to find the meeting house.  They were just starting their Christmas
Party.  We stayed for a while, and then took the four Elders out to eat.  The
food was really good and we enjoyed being with the Elders.  It has been a very
enjoyable day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                I am going to insert much of our letter to
our family for it covers the activities for December 20<sup>th</sup> &amp; 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>First, Balar is
the most remote part of our mission.  It is the only area, in our mission, that
is in contact with the ocean.   There is a high mountain range that separates
that area, and probably there are people there who have never been outside of
that valley.  You go through some really steep terrain on both sides of the
mountain, on a very narrow road that often has mud slides during the rain
storms, so they are always having to clean off roads and rebuild the areas.  We
bought a map that showed us a little different way to get there than what
President and Sister Clark had taken when they have gone there before with
President and Sister Brimhall, however, maps in the Philippines are not always
accurate.   President and Sister Clark picked us up and we went in the mission
van, because the roads are too rough for light passenger cars.  We went from
Munoz to San Jose and from San Jose to Rizal, an area which we have traveled
several times before.  From Rizal, we had planned on going to Bongabon, but
ended up going almost the opposite direction to Pantabangan.  In Rizal we had
seen a highway sign, which is rare to see, that pointed the direction to
Balar.  Then when we questioned the road, we stopped and asked a man for
directions, he pointed to the way we were going.   We asked directions in the
next village, when we didn’t see any signs showing the name of the village, the
way to Balar.  They pointed out the direction so we continued on.  The thing
that had us concerned was that we were never getting to Bongabon.  The road was
not too bad and we just kept on going hoping that we were going in the right
direction.  Had we had positive knowledge that we were going in the right direction,
we would have felt ok, but not knowing for sure, kept us in an uneasy feeling. 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We
finally stopped at a nice place in the road with shade trees, etc., to eat our
lunch.  Sister Clark had made hoagie sandwiches, potato salad, etc., so we were
enjoying lunch, when we noticed that across the road were some stairs leading
up the mountain.  We thought that we were in a desolate area, as far as people
are concerned, but we were in the jungle.  We soon began to recognize little
bamboo huts quite frequently among the foliage.  That was ok until Dad
recognized that one of the fellows, coming down the steps towards where Sister
Clark and I had gone, so Dad could take a picture of us partway up the steps,
was carrying a pretty large rifle.  Then came a second man and he too had a
pretty large rifle.  Sister Clark and I soon came back down to where Dad &amp;
President Clark were.  We were a little nervous, as you can imagine, but the
men waved and went on down the road.  We were relieved and finished our lunch
then headed back on our journey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>When
we got to the bottom of the mountain, we were in a beautiful valley with lots
of coconut groves which you could tell had been planted as groves because the
trees had a definite pattern in their locations.  Also, there were beautiful
green rice fields everywhere.  The village was much cleaner than what we have
here in our areas.  It was cool and so beautiful.  Our motel was new and very
beautiful.  We’ll send you pictures of it.  It was close to a nice restaurant,
which was owed by the same person, who used to be the governor and now the wife
is the governor.  The ocean was just behind it, so after we got settled in our
rooms, we walked over to the ocean.  It was windy and overcast, and so the
waves were high and rough, but it still looked neat.  We definitely decided
that this is one of the places we want to take you, Sandi, when you come over. 
We are not sure that we can afford it because the motel cost P1200 plus they
want another P20 or P50 for you to stay with us.  We’re just kidding, of
course, because that is only $22.00 plus another 50 cents to $1.00 for the
other bed.   The branch was having their Christmas party and we were to meet
the Elders at the Church.  We tried to find the Church as President and Sister
Clark had been there twice before, but it was dark and we came into town a
different direction and it confused President Clark and so we got lost.  We
finally called the ZL’s and they got a trike and came to where we were.  That,
too, was interesting because Elder Clark was not waiting where Sister Clark
thought he should be and when it took the Elders a long time to get to us, she
became concerned and we called them back and President Clark asked them how
come it was taking them so long, they explained that the trike driver had to
stop and get gas.  He knew he was out of gas, when they got the ride, but he
had to wait until he got the fare before he could afford to put gas in his
trike as he had no money.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We
were warmly greeted and welcomed to the Christmas party.  They meet in a
“meeting house”, not a church.  Hopefully, by March, construction will begin
for the first Church in that valley.  Right after we got to the party, the
power went off all though the community, but that seemed to be no concern as
that happens a lot and a man had a homemade battery which operated a small
light and they went on with the party.  They had a program and played games. 
An 11 year old girl recited the 13 Articles of Faith in English.  She also had
them memorized in Tagalog.  She had bet the one zone leader, a gallon of ice
cream, that she could recite them in English.  He now owes her the ice cream. 
We left about 8:00 p.m. and took the four Elders to the restaurant with us to
eat.  We knew they would be eating at the party, but we aren’t supposed to eat
the food, so we went to the restaurant.  We ordered sweet and sour chicken and
a beef dish (for dad) and ate in a kiwi hut.  (Not sure of the name).  It was
fun and we were right by the ocean.  It was cool, but not cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday
morning we got up early and took a walk down the beach.  It was beautiful as
the sun had not come up, but was just becoming dawn.  It was such a beautiful
place to be.  We had a hermit talk to us on the beach and said he had hot water
and coffee and wanted us to come over to his place to visit with him.  He
seemed very lonely and wanted company.  We didn’t have time, but it probably
would have been interesting to visit with him.  Dad and President Clark first
met with the Branch President with some instructions, then with the Priesthood
Leadership for instructions in Home Teaching and during the meantime, Sister
Clark and I met with the Auxiliary Leaders and trained them in their
responsibilities.  They asked many questions and made comments so we felt
really good about it.  Sister Clark and I train really well together, with the
help of the Lord.  We, of course, can’t teach or train without the spirit.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>When
we had prepared to come on this trip, dad brought the computer to use for his
training, but he also felt impressed to bring the printer with us.  While dad
and President Clark were visiting with the branch president, he was not sure
what he should do for branch conference as he had never participated in one
before.  They explained to him that according to the Handbook of Instructions,
the main purpose for ward or branch conference was to sustain the officers of
the Church.  The branch president said he didn’t know how to do that.  He also
did not have a form for this information.  So after the other training was completed,
dad had me type on the computer, while he and others gave me the information
and a complete list for sustaining the Church officers from the First
Presidency down and including the branch officers and teachers.  Another item
that the branch president needed was a new report that dad developed, which
President Brimhall liked and wants all the branches to complete.  The Balar
Branch had never seen this report, nor gotten a copy of it, so after the
training, dad made up a report for the Balar Branch and then, because we had
the printer with us, we were able to print off these two pieces of information
for the branch.  We often see the inspiration of the Lord in the things we do. 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Each
of the four of us was asked to speak in the Sacrament Meeting.  Dad and I knew
that President and Sister Clark would be asked to speak, but didn’t know we
would be, however, we are realizing that this is almost expected whenever we
visit a new branch or ward or stake or public affair.  We do this a lot, but
the Lord gives us inspiration and so we just continue to read study and pray to
be guided by the spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We
were planning to leave right after Sacrament Meeting, but President Clark was
asked to set apart some new callings so while he was doing this, Sister Clark
visited the Primary and Mae visited the YW.  In YW, the president turned the
time over to Mae after they had the song and prayer.  Mae hadn’t expected that
but saw that some of the girls had their Personal Progress books and so she
talked to them about that and asked them questions and told them that our
daughters and daughter-in-laws had been or are in YW.  Mae told the girls about
the feelings that our girls had e-mailed us about Personal Progress.  They were
cute girls and I think it went well.  They seemed to understand and some
participated, but others were shy.  Sister Clark said that in Primary, the
president, nor any of the other sisters helping with Primary, was prepared. 
They were stalling as they were embarrassed since Sister Clark was there.  They
asked for her help.   This cute branch has an average of 105 coming out to
meetings and they have a total membership of 300, so they are coming out, but
need help.  I would like to go up in January and stay there for 3 days to train
the Branch President and others.  I asked the Branch President if he could meet
with us if we came up.  He said he worked every day, but if we could come, he
would take off to meet with us as he said he really needs and wants the help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>We came home the way that
President and Sister Clark are used to.  It has lots of switchbacks and is more
dangerous, but is more beautiful.  The Elders go up and down in big buses. 
They say the buses honk as they go around a curve, as it is a one lane road,
and they are nervous that they might have an accident, but say it is worth it
because of the beauty.  It was really beautiful.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                We got up and went walking with the Clarks. 
It was a very enjoyable experience.  We came home and prepared breakfast of
French toast, scrambled eggs and lots of fruit.  President and Sister Clark
left for Angeles about 7:30 AM.  We soon got on instant messaging with our
family, all our children except Shellie, and spent an hour with them.  It was a
wonderful experience to visit with them; they are a delight in our lives.  Brother
Silvia came by to do some updating of our computer.  As he finished, Marlyn
prepared us a delicious lunch, so we invited him to eat with us.  After lunch
we prepared a letter for our family.  We then attended the Christmas Branch
Party for the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  We enjoyed participating with these
wonderful people.  We came home and ate some supper; we then called Sandi and
visited with her for a while.  We are excited to have her come over soon.  I
sent the Family e-mail letter and attached several pictures with it, while Mae
read from the “Faith Precedes the Miracle”.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Tuesday, December 23, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                We didn’t get up until 6
 AM but that didn’t give us enough time to go walking.  We had Guimba &amp; San
Jose Zone conference this morning.  It was very good and we enjoyed having
President and Sister Brimhall back with us.  It was 2
 PM before it got over, and then we ate lunch together.  After eating Mae and I
bought the paint supplies for the service project we are having tomorrow.  We
were going to buy them in Munoz, but the store was closed.  We checked with the
bicycle store in Munoz also but they didn’t have the parts that we needed.  We
purchased the supplies we needed in San Jose.  We returned home, and then went
to the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch Christmas party.  It was well organized and
was a lot of fun.  It has been a busy day, but very fun and enjoyable.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Wednesday, December 24, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                Mae didn’t feel well during the night and
was still sick this morning.  She didn’t feel very good this morning when we
woke, so I had her stay in bed today.  She didn’t put up any resistance and
stayed in bed most of the day, so you know she isn’t feeling well.  She thinks
she is feeling some better this evening.  Marlyn, our house helper came this
morning, so I carried on with our plans for today, leaving Mom to sleep.  I
picked up the four Elders in Munoz and we met the rest of the Elders in our
Zone at the Guimba District Hospital, where we did a service project of
painting bed.  We painted half of the beds today and will paint the rest of
them on New Years morning.  We also replaced both tires on the only wheelchair
the hospital has.  One tire was completely gone, and they were running on the
rim, and the other was flat.  It went very well.  Beside the Elders, there was
one Brother, a new baptized convert, of three weeks, and three Sisters from the
Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch that help us.  The materials for the project were
paid for because David and Shauna sent some money to be used as we could see
where it would help.  Although the hospital staff only knows it was from an
anonymous donor, they really appreciate it.  I repaired the wheelchair, and
then left it in the hallway.  A few minutes latter the head nurse came out
ridding in it and thanking me, she was so excited.  We worked until 1
 PM and then cleaned up.  We took some pictures as a group, but we had some
that had to leave before the pictures, for appointments.  I then brought out
two pans of brownies and shared with everyone.  Mae had made then last night
before she went to bed.  Mae was still in bed when I got home.  Usually Mae
can’t stay in bed when she is sick, but she said she sure enjoyed it this
time.  Marlyn had some lunch ready when I got home. I next spent a couple of
hours cleaning up all the paint brushes, so we can use them next time.  I was
tired so laid down for a nap for an hour and one half.  I got on the computer
transferring pictures and writing e-mails to our children until 12:30
 AM.  Time flies when you are having fun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Thursday, December 25, 2003 </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>Christmas Day, wow! It is sure a
different Christmas.  We didn’t get up until 6:30
 AM.  Mae felt quite a lot better, so we called the Elders and invited them for
breakfast.  We planned on eating at 8:30 AM, but Elder Smith, got a phone call
from his parents, just as they were leaving their apartment, so they were late
getting here.  The Elders brought us a very nice fruit basket for a Christmas
present.  We had a very enjoyable morning.  After breakfast we had a short
program, we sang some Christmas songs and read the Christmas story from Luke 2
while Mae used the flannel board.  Mae then read a story that had been sent to
us, “The Christmas Carol”, (yes that is spelt right).  We enjoyed visiting for
a little while, and then sent them off to work.  Mae and I took a nap, at least
I did, but Mae only rested for a little while.  I got on the computer for a
while.  I wrote e-mails to our children and did some with out pictures.  Mae
started Christmas Dinner, to which we had invited Roger &amp; Heidi Silvia and
their children Karen &amp; Darin.  They came at 5
 PM.  They also brought Heidi’s younger sister, Irene.  We had a very nice time
with a very nice dinner.  We again held a short program.  Mae read her
Christmas Carol story and we gave the flannel board reading of the Saviors
birth.  We then watched the DVD of “Joy to the World”.  Heidi’s sister is not a
member of the Church, but she seemed to enjoy the program.  We took some
pictures and Roger helped me figure out some problems with our camera and the
transfer program from the camera to the computer.  It was almost 9
 PM when they got ready to leave.  I realized that they didn’t have a way to
get home.  As it is Christmas Day, most of the transportation stopped at 5
 PM.  I guess they had just planned on walking home.  I was not going to let
them do that so I took them home in the car.  Roger commented that this was his
children’s first ride in an automobile.  He also asked me how old I was when I
learned to drive.  He was quite surprised when I told him that I was 10 or 11
years old.  He said he still didn’t know how to drive a car, only a bike.  Mae
and I finished sending e-mails to our children.  This time we sent each one a
personal e-mail.  We also sent an e-mail to both of our families.  We got an
e-mail from both Jeff and Mike.  They were just starting their Christmas Day. 
It’s been a good Day, but a different Christmas.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Friday, December 26, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                We didn’t get up quite as early as we
should have, so we had to hurry to be ready to pick up the Munoz Elders and go
to Guimba where the District Development meet is held.  We enjoy meeting with
the Elders and watching them in their leadership roles.  After meeting the
Elders invited us to have lunch with them.  We got home at 1PM
and Marlyn had lunch ready for us.  We had text her, but she hadn’t brought her
phone with her, so missed out message.  Mae took a nap, but I got on the
computer and figured on the budget.  We went over to San Jose to the bank to
deposit our check and draw out some money.  We looked for Mae a dress for her
Birthday, but couldn’t find anything.  We did some shopping at C. V. C. and
then came home.  I warmed up some food for super.  I took a nap, then got up
and completed our budget.  At 10 PM I went over to the Elders and borrowed
their telephone, so we could have two phones to talk on when our children calls
us at 11 PM.  Our family called at 11 PM our time and 8 AM Mountain Standard
Time.  We talked for a few minutes when the line disconnected.  Mike called
back on his cell phone to let us know that the weather had shut off all the
power in the area.  They will try to call back when the power comes back on. 
Sandi wasn’t going to be able to make it for the call because of the weather. 
They are getting heavy snow at the time they called.  We were very disappointed
to have the call cut short.  I guess we will go to bed and hope they call a
little later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                It was 12:30
 AM when we got to bed, hoping that our family could get back through the
phone, but it didn’t happen.  We got up a few minutes after 6
 AM and got ready to leave before 8 AM.  We went to Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup>
Branch and gave President ------- some training.  We really enjoyed his humble
spirit and the receptive attitude he showed.  We were over two hours in the
training.  As we gathered things up he took all items and carried them to our
car for us.  As we started towards the parking lot gate, he ran to open it for
us.  What a humble servant of the Lord.  We went to Camiline where we met Elder
and Sister Maharry at Cindy’s for lunch.  We went to the church house where we
participated with leadership training in connection with District Conference. 
Although the training went well and we really enjoyed the evening meeting with
President Brimhall’s talk, we were tired when we left for home.  It was 8:45
 PM when we got home, and I especially was exhausted.  I started my journal
entry, but gave up and went to bed.  We got a phone call from Elder Ragasa
about 10:15 PM and woke us up.  He wants to schedule a H.T. / V.T. Fireside,
but we got cut off before Mae found out when.  Mae had trouble getting back to
sleep, and then she said the phone rang again about 11
 PM but only one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sunday, December 28, 2003</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                We got up about 6AM
but that left us short on time as we wanted to attend the meetings in the
Moncada 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Branches.  We got to the Moncada 1<sup>st</sup>
at 8:50 AM, but meetings started at 8:30 AM.  We enjoyed the rest of the
meetings.  I visited with the Elders about some problems and questions they had
concerning Branch 2, during the Sunday School time, and then went in with the
Young Men during Priesthood.  Mae attended Primary and Y.W.  Elder Ellison
invited us for dinner again with them.  We sure enjoyed that.  They gave me a
bag of California Pecans that I sure enjoy.  We went back and attended the
Moncada 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch, this time getting there in time for the opening
of the meetings.  Again we enjoyed our time visiting the various groups. 
Traffic was slow getting from Moncada to the Guimba turn.  It was almost 6
 PM when we got home.  We just had leftovers for dinner.  I checked the e-mail
and we got a nice letter from Becky.  We are tired tonight so went to bed
shortly after 9 PM.  David called about 11 PM.  At first we couldn’t figure out
what it was.  We sure enjoyed visiting with him.  Both Tyler and Emily talked
with us for a few minutes.  They will be going home this morning.  It’s morning
there.  David said they are thinking of moving to Utah with his company.  It is
a reduction in pay plus an increase in cost of living.  Mike wants him to move
down by him.  That would be good in some ways, but again more expense.  It
seems incredible, but he will loss more in this move that Mae and I ever made
in a year.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                We slept in until 6
 AM, but still got up and went for a long walk at the collage.  School is out
for the Holidays so it was quite peaceful over there.  After getting home,
showering and eating breakfast it was time to get on the inter-net to visit
with our children by instant messaging.  We sure enjoyed that.  Mae then got on
the inter-net and e-mailed some letters.  I took a nap, until I work with acid
reflex.  After lunch we went to San Jose and got a few groceries and got some
glass cut to fit the end tables.  Mae was sure happy with that.  She had quite
a headache so I rubbed her back and neck and then had her relax and sleep a
while.  I later woke her and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                We got up at 5:30
 AM so we had more time to walk.  We went a new direction just to see some new
areas.  It is cool this time of the year and very peaceful with school being
out.  We really enjoy walking together.  We spent most of the day on the
computer planning on training for the new Branch Training program we are putting
together for the couple missionaries.  It is surprising how fast time goes by.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                We got up and went walking.  Mae made
chocolate chip cookies this morning so she would have some for today when Pres.
and Sis. Clark come and most of them for the Elders tomorrow when we will be
finishing the service project for the Guimba District Hospital – painting beds,
etc.  President and Sister Clark came shortly after noon. 
We played games, watch church videos, visited and ate.  We had a good time.  We
always enjoy being with these good friends.  We went to bed about 10:30. 
We didn’t know if we would be able to sleep or not because everyone sets off
lots of fireworks on New Year’s Eve and they had been doing it all day, plus
families get together and celebrate and sing on the karaoke machine.  We slept
pretty well, but I still heart a man behind our home singing and he sang like
he was sick.  We’re sure he was drunk – most are.  The fireworks were loud.</p>
