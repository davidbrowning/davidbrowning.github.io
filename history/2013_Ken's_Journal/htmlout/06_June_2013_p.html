<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up about 6:15AM.  After getting some breakfast I started on the lawns.  I
had to mow most of the back yard with the small mower as the rider mower
plugged up with grass.  I started washing it out but then the started quite working. 
Mae got home about noon.  After lunch I finished the lawns, then we worked in
the garden.  Mae and I went shopping for quite a verity of things.  My legs and
feet got to hurting so a couple of stores I stayed in the car and waited for
Mae to go in.  As I waited I watched the people going in and out and wondered
how many there were that I could recognize them as members of the Church.  From
their dress and standards visible, there were very few that I would recognize
by dress and actions that they would be members of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints.   It was 8PM when we finished up.  We ate some dinner and
then we took showers and watched a movie on DVD.  The Movie was “The Last Time
I Was in Paris” with Van Johnson and Elizabeth Taylor.  It was a good movie in
acting but very depressing as to the life style it portrayed.  I did really
enjoy having Mae back with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke just before 8AM and so had to hurry to get to H.P. Group Leadership.  I
stopped on my way at Sister Reid’s and gave the medication to Laurel’s cat.  I
came away from our meeting depressed with all those with problems.  Shortly
after getting home, Bob knocked and wanted me to find someone to help e give
him a blessing.  I called Grant and he and Stacy came over.  After the blessing
Stacy, Grant and I talked concerning Bob and his attitude.  I told them that if
they felt that Bob needed to go into a retirement center they did not need to
be concerned about Mae and I.  Grant talked quite straight with Bob about the
need to exercise.  I missed Priesthood and Sunday school time but made it to
church in time for Sacrament meeting.  Mae made dinner after we got home from
meeting.  I made some calls concerning Home teaching.  </p>

got my breakfast ready.  My runs went well.  In between runs I got the
lawnmower working and mowed the back part of the lot.  I also washed the car
and helped Mae wash the windows.  Roberta called me and asked if I would help
with taking schools to Lagoon on Thursday.  When I got home I worked on the
camper for a while but gave up and quite for the day.  We watched “America
Ride” on TV and then watched a cute war movie.  I showered and then filled out
my journal.  Shellie and Jase didn’t get here until almost 10PM.  It was sure
good to visit with them for a little while before I went to bed.  Jase had
designed a tee shirt at a shop and they printed it for him.  He was very proud
of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
and I slept upstairs in one of the extra bedrooms.  As Mae didn’t get to bed
until very late last night I let her sleep in.  Mae had got things ready for my
breakfast before she came to bed last night, so it didn’t take much for me to
get myself off to work.  When I got home from the morning run, Mae was
preparing breakfast of waffles.  They were sure good.  Sandi came out as she is
also going to meet with Nancy Litchford.  Sandi and Nike are also going to come
up to Hyrum with us so we got in line and reserved a camp site for them.  Mae
went over to have lunch with Ashley as it was a special Grandparent day at her
school.  Shellie and Sandy went over to Nancy’s and Mae met them there.  I took
my PM run and then when I got home I just relaxed.  Mae had a Lazonua ready to
go into the oven so I did that.  After dinner Mae, Shellie and I played a game
of Rummy until I had to go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was late when Mae got to bed so I got myself off to work.  I didn’t sleep very
well last night but seem to be ok this morning.  Shellie had told us of some
defense training she has taken and I thought about that quite a bit during the
night.  I think that because I didn’t sleep well, it kept Mae awake.  My runs
went well.  I took Bob up the Attorney that drew up his Living Will and she
will make the changes.  I took my PM run and yesterday another driver told me
how much faster it was to take the Free Way.  I decided to try it and right
after I got on the Free Way traffic came to a crawl.  It took me and extra 20
minutes to get to the school and I felt lucky at that.  I am not going to take
that short cut again.  Mae, Sandi and Shellie went shopping just as I got
home.  I worked on the camper furnace and got it working without the noise, at
least for now.  I then went in and turned a Western movie on and watched it. 
it just finished as Mae and the girls got home.  After dinner I filled out this
entry and then went to bed.  As I was writing this entry Bob knocked and Mae
answered.  Mae explained that she and my girls had tried to visit Sherrie but
each time they called they were told that she was sleeping.  Bob got upset and
said that wasn’t enough.  That upset me and I went up stairs and had a pretty
straight talk with him.  I hope I didn’t say too much but that didn’t set with
me!</p>

left me a note telling me that she and Shellie played Rook until after 11:30PM,
so I let them sleep and I got myself of to work.  My run went well.  Between
schools, I stopped and visited with Mishelle about their moving plans.  After finishing
the grade school run I went to Legacy Jr. High where I was scheduled to take 9<sup>th</sup>
Grade students to Lagoon.  However they had scheduled 6 buses to take them and
only needed 4, so I and 1 other bus went back to the compound.  We will get
paid for an hour’s time.  Mae, Shellie and Jase hadn’t eaten breakfast when I
got there so I ate with them.  They then went down to see Sherrie and then over
to help Scott and Mishelle with the moving.  I worked on the camper, got camp
gear ready, then took a 20 minute nap before my pm rum.  </p>

friend of hers that lives in Plane City.  Mae and I did some shopping and then
went over to Jeff’s.  Shellie also came over there and after visiting  we

three limits of nice Rainbow Trout by 8AM.  When we got back to camp, Nick and
I cleaned and filleted the fish.  We then cooked a nice breakfast of fish, eggs
and toast.  Nick and I took a nap and then we took everyone out for a boat
ride.  We anchored the boat and ate our lunch on the boat.  We were all tired
when we got home and unpacked.  We got Shellie packed so she can get away in
the morning.  We will miss them but time travels on.</p>

her packed the noise lights woke Mae.  It was 5:15AM when Shellie and Jase got
away.  Mae and I went back to bed and I slept for about another hour but Mae
slept quite a while.  I tilled the garden this morning.  I got Bob off on his
appointment with the Lawyer that made up his living will and now updated it.  I
went to Sister Reid’s and gave the medication to Laurel’s cat.  I made
arrangement with Scott to come to his house and install a breaker for the
electric dryer.  Mae and I watched the movie “Saint and Soldier Airborne Creed”
on DVD that Shellie and Sandi gave me for Father’s Day.  I was over to Scott
and Mishelle’s for about an hour installing the breaker switch.  That is all it
took to get their dryer working.  This evening Mae and I watched a show on TV
Staring Jimmy Stewart and June Allison.  That was sure a good movie.  It is
nice to be off work for a while.  We are trying to plan some trips this
summer.  Before going to sleep we watched another movie on DVD.  I sure love
being with my sweetheart!</p>

breakfast I worked in the garden.  This afternoon I was going over to Irven and
Sandy’s but Bryce stopped in and then we needed to be at Scott and Mishelle’s
for Ashley’s birthday.  Mae made us our own cake so we could have cake while
the rest ate Birthday Cake and ice cream.  Scott and I set on their front porch
and just had a minute to visit.  We stopped at Irven and Sandy’s for a minute
but it turned out almost an hour.  After getting home we moved the truck and
boat around.  Time went by fast and before we know it we were going to bed
after 10:30PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                As
I read my scriptures in Alma 33 this morning and thought about what Zenos and
Zenock taught, I couldn’t help reflecting as to what am I doing.  I also
thought about what Scott and I talked about.  Scott told me that, Yes we have
stopped the Strategic Air Command and we have reduced our missile cycles’ but
because of his work, he knows that we still have over 500 missiles that can
reach anywhere in the World.  So why do we need the aircrafts to carry the
atomic weapons when a missile can deliver it or why do we need more than 500
missiles when 2 or 3 can destroy a hole country?  As I have thought about what
he said then I asked myself what am I doing to be worthwhile here on earth.  I
text Scott and thanked him for the few minutes we had to visit and the lift he
gave me.  He replied, “I love you Dad.  I hope I didn’t sound rude or
condescending.  I never mean to come across that way. I can’t tell you how much
I appreciate all you’ve done for me and my family.  The future looks a little
bleak, but life’s still pretty good.”  That is a special message for me to read! 
I worked in the garden all morning getting it raked and got some of it furred
for watering.  I am thinking about putting a 1 inch pipe down the rows with
smaller tubs running to each plant, depending on the cost.  This afternoon I
also did some research as to the cost of putting a slider window in the back of
the pickup, this way we could communicate with those riding in the camper.  The
cannel company is restricting us to only two days a week and only 30 minutes
per setting.  Starting time will be at 6PM to 10AM ending time.  I spent some
time trying to get that programmed.  Bob and I even went up to the Davis Weber
Water Cannel Co. and they told me that East Canon Reservoir had not been
drained.  We got no satisfaction out of talking to them.  Mae had a Relief
Society meeting this evening to attend.  </p>

and I attended the Bountiful and went on a Sealing Session.   We were able to
get the Sealing of many of the people that Sister Heydorn had given us.  It was
a very enjoyable experience to do this work.  We have 14 more male names that
we still have Endowments yet to complete before we can do the Sealing’s for
them.  After leaving the Temple we went shopping at Costco where we bought some
fish for Bob that he wants for Sherrie plus a few items for our self.  We then
stopped at Home Depot and checked the price of building a gate for our big shed
or purchasing a prebuilt chain link gate.  The prebuilt gate will be the
cheapest but they do not have one at the Layton store but they told us the
Riverdale Store has three.  We then went to Durk’s Plumbing where I purchased
the material to put a drip irrigation system on part of our garden.  I worked
for a while on the garden but had to quite as we have invited Carolyn and
Charles Saunders over this evening and we played table games.</p>

we enjoyed a wonderful Session at the Temple.  We went out to eat at the
Chuck-A-Rama before coming home.  I worked in the garden most of the afternoon. 
We did go looking for the gate material and after about an hour of looking at
the Riverdale store we found it.   Jeff came over and borrowed our projector
and invited us to go there to watch a movie but I was too tired so we stayed
home.  Jeff gave me a card and a gift certificate from my four sons for Father’s

meeting.  Mick also texted me a nice Father’s Day greeting.  Shellie and Sandi
had given me three DVD’s for Father’s Day while Shellie was here.  We attended
the regular block meetings.  Jamie and her husband came to see Bob.  We were
glad that they did for Bob has been watching for them for a couple of weeks. 
We went over to Scott and Mishelle’s for dinner in honor of Kylan’s 13<sup>th</sup>

for a Ward Relief Society social to be held in our back yard.  I went over to
Fallis’s and helped Mark feed his horses.  They are leaving for a few days and
I will feed the horses for them.  Mark also came over and helped us set up our awning
and helped me carry the folding tables out.  That was a great help.  I used the
canvases that Bob had put together to add to the awning and over the fence so
that it made a wind break and also added to the shade.  While the Relief
Society Sisters enjoyed the activity Bob and I went Home Teaching to Casey’s
and to the Johnston’s.  We had a wonderful visit there and a pretty good visit
with Brother Casey.  I got home at 9PM and changed clothes, then started
disassembling the awning.  Mae was talking to Ben about his Birthday.  She then
came out and helped me finish getting put away.  It’s been a good day but very

the scriptures and especially the Book of Mormon.  Besides my testimony of the
truthfulness of the Book of Mormon it also bears testimony to me that Joseph
Smith was God’s chosen prophet to restore the Church of Christ and to translate
the Book of Mormon from the ancient plates on which they we recorded.  I know
that threw him the Priesthood of God was restored and that that Priesthood is
still on earth today, with President Thomas S. Monson now presiding with all
those keys.  I have enjoyed serving as a missionary several times but hope that
somehow, some day I can yet bear that testimony to my sons!  We relaxed today
without doing a lot of work.  This evening we tried to find something on TV but

over.  We showed them how we take care of the garden as they are going to watch

lines.  We had a couple of chickens get under the west fence and had to get
them back into the yard.  This evening we went to Good Earth for a few items. 
This time it was under $50 and normal it is lucky if we stay under $100.  We
went out to eat at the Chuck-A-Rama in Ogden and enjoyed the dinner but most of
all we just enjoy being together.  We started to drive up to East Canon
Reservoir but because a Tri-Aphelion race the canon road was closed to most
traffic.  We came home and set out on our swing and watched the chickens for a
while and then came in and watched a story on DVD, “Resistance Movement”, which
was a true story of three young men during the Hitler régime.  I haven’t felt
quite right for some reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in again this morning. While Mae did her regular exercises, I prepared
breakfast.  I then caught my journal up to date.   We kept going most of the
day although I didn’t do anything that was really hard.  Mae helped me do some
repairs to the fence where the chickens were getting under the fence.  We
prepared for Bryce, Deanna, Georgia and Rick to come over this evening.  We had
a very enjoyable evening.  I haven’t felt the very best today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 7:45AM and had to hurry to get to High Priest Group Leadership
meeting.  I am hurting quite a bit today, which continued throughout the day. 
I did get a nap in between my 9AM meeting and our block meeting.  We attended
the special World Wide meeting in relation to the great increase efforts for
missionary service.  Bob and I went home teaching to the Thurmon’s and Mae and
I visited with Sister Fallis.  We went up to Jeff and Gail’s to take Ben’s
Birthday gift.  Jeff and Gail told us that Ben was so concerned as they had
been over to Gail’s Mother’s home and Ben was afraid that they were not going
to get home in time to see Grandma Browning.  They said that he was almost in
tears as his Uncle had tried to get them to stay to play games with Gail’s
family.  It would have been a tragedy, had we not gone over.  Ben was so
excited to show his Grandma Browning all his Birthday Gifts.  After the
children went to bed we played a couple of games with Jeff and Gail.  I have
really been uncomfortable moat of the day with pain thru out most of my body; I
am not sure just what is going on.  I made Mae feel bad because of some
comments I made and I guess I have also made Bob feel bad because of my
opinions.  I seem to have a bad tendency of expressing my opinion wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Neither
Mae nor I slept the best last night plus we didn’t get to bed until late.  I
was up at 3:30 am, so I read a couple of chapters in the Book of Mormon and
then went back to sleep in the recliner.  We got up after 8am and ate breakfast
and got things packed.  It was about 2pm when we got away.  When we got up to
the camp, checked in and pulled up to our camp site we realized that our site
did not have power or water hook-ups.  We can get along without the water as we
filled our storage tank, but we need power for my c-pap, besides the
conveniences.  The ranger let us pull an extension cord from across the
street.  When the Camp Host came by he said that regulations would not let us
have the cord across the street.  He made arrangements for us to move to the
site next to his RV and pull power from his box.  It wasn’t bad to make the
change especially with the fitting for my cordless drill to crank the legs in
and out.  Mae prepared us a nice dinner and then we played a game of Racko,
which Mae won.  We went to bed before 10pm so we could get up early to go
fishing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
didn’t sleep very well so we were late getting out on the lake.  Mae caught the
first fish but we let it go because it was quite small.  She then caught the 2<sup>nd</sup>
fish.  I caught 2 fish that we kept and Mae caught the largest with both of us
letting some small ones go.  Mae called Bryce and Deanna and invited them to
come up for breakfast.  I filet the fish and three of them along with fried
eggs and hot cakes fed the four of us.  We enjoyed spending time with Bryce and
Deanna, mainly just visiting.  They left about 5pm for home as they had
appointments to see to this evening.  I set the tent up this afternoon as
David, Shauna, Emily and Connor came up this evening.  They didn’t get here
until almost 10PM.  We stayed up visiting for a while.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up about 5 and went up to the rest room.  I read from the Book of Mormon
before waking the rest.  We all went out fishing so that kept me busy baiting
hooks and taking fish off.  Conner caught the most fish but we all had fun. 
When we came back we prepared a big brunch of fish, eggs and hot cakes.  We
relaxed, visit and played games, mainly just visited and enjoyed being
together.  David and his family left about 6:30 for home.  Mae and I relaxed
and tried to watch a movie but it didn’t get dark enough to really see the
screen until almost 10PM and then just before the movie ended the CD was
damaged and we couldn’t see the ending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up early and went out fishing so that Mae could sleep in.  It<i> </i>was
slow but I did limit out and came back in about 9am.  After I ate some
breakfast, Mae and I played a game of Rummy witch Mae won by 5 points.  I then
took a nap.  When I got up Mae made me some lunch while I caught my journal up
to date.  We then played another game of rummy and this time I won.  We went
boating for a while and when it got later we started fishing.  Mae caught fish
about as fast as I could get the fish off and her line baited.  She caught five
and I caught two but then we ran out of bait.  The last three fish that Mae
caught was on the same worm.  We had 3 or 4 ski boats around us causing serious
waves and so I started to return to shore but I forgot to bring in the fish and
we lost 2 before I remembered.  The water in the reservoir is dropping quite
fast and where we parked the boat last night it is now to shallow, so we parked
on the west side of the boat ramp.  We were tired when we got back to camp.  We
both felt like we needed a shower so we used the shower in the camper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
didn’t wake until 7am so we quickly made us a egg sandwich and ate it on the
way fishing.  When we started trolling, I caught a fish within the first
minutes.  We had a great time with Mae catching 3 fish and I caught 4 fish.  We
then anchored the boat, put on life jackets and jumped into the lake.  It was
cold at first but felt so good after we got in and used to the temperature.  We
then came back and I cleaned the fish while Mae got us some lunch.  We then
packed up and came on home.  We came straight to Jeff’s home.  I used Jeff’s
car and went home so I could feed Sister Fallis’s horses.  I checked on the
chickens &amp; garden, talked to Bob and rubbed his shoulder before going back
to Jeff’s.  I setup the camper so the children can sleep out there.  Mae had
quite a bit of trouble getting them to settle down for the night.  Well, that
was a mistake as Rachel and Mat would not settle down so Mae tried to get the
two of them in and Rachel refused to come.  When Mae tried to get Rachel out of
the camper to bring her inside, Mae fell out.  Rachel and Matt  then came into
the house and told me that Grandma fell and was hurt.  I went out and found Mae
lying on the cement driveway.  Mae hurt her knees, plus we don’t know what else,
but was able to get up and come inside the house.  Jeff and Gail got home about
five minutes later.  Mae didn’t want me to take her to the hospital but felt
that she would be ok.  We stayed the night with Jeff and Gail letting us sleep
in their bed, as Mae didn’t feel she could use the stairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
helped Mae shower and get dressed.  I took her to the Tanner Clinic where a
Doctor checked her over.  She has strained a muscle, did some minor damage to
the cartilage in her knee and bruised her leg.  Other than that she seems to be
ok.  The Dr. gave her some mussel relaxer and some pain medication that we
picked up on the way home.  I brought her into the house and she got in the
recliner and went to sleep.  She hadn’t slept much last night.  I went to
Fallis’s where I took care of their horses.  I then unpacked the boat and
camper and got most of everything brought in and put away.  I got the water on
the garden and took care of the chickens.  It seemed to me that some of the
chickens are missing, but I didn’t take time to count them until later this
evening when they came into to roost.  There are six of them missing.  I can’t
find any indication that they got out on their own but it looks like someone
has stolen six of them while we were gone.  </p>

didn’t sleep very well last night so I let her sleep in this morning.  I went
out and checked the chickens again.  I don’t know where they roosted last night
but they are all there now.  I took care of Sister Fallis’s horses again this
morning.  Morgan called and said that because it is the fifth Sunday we will
not be having our 9am meeting today.  I worked on my Diary but it is slow.  I
attended Priesthood meeting but came home when all the adults assembled.  Patsy
and Veldon Seymore stopped in and visited with us until we left for Sacrament
meeting.  Bob had dinner ready when we got home from church.  Mae is feeling
quite a bit better.  I just hope that she doesn’t over do it.  After eating I
went over and fed the horses.  Mae wanted to attend a Youth Fireside on Family
History and though it started at 5 pm we got there about 5:20 pm.  I worked on
this entry until almost 7 pm when we turned on BYU channel and watched the
“Work and Glory III’.  We then went out and rounded up all the chickens and got
them in the coop.  The garden looks like it is doing ok.  We went to bed before
10 pm as Irven and Sandy wants me to get the sprinkler system started.</p>
