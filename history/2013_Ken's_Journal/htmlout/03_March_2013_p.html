<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 5:30AM and soon had the car packed and off for Soda Springs and the
Trail Canon Ranch.  We stopped at a Sub-Way to get us a sandwich for
breakfast.  It was almost 9:30AM when we got there.  Roy and Shellie had got
there last night.  After getting settled in I started working on the
snowmobiles to get them running.  That was somewhat of a challenge, but after
thawing out the ice in a couple of them we got the three of them running. 
Nick, Roy and I drove them down to the warming house and left them there.  Nike
walked back to the lodge and brought his car down for us to ride back to the
lodge.  We ate lunch and then the six of us went riding for a while.  We are
short of fuel in the snowmobiles so Roy, Nick and I went into town and bought
10 gal of gas.  We ate dinner when we got back to the Lodge.  Nick and I played
two games of Sequence and I won both of them.  All of us watched “Chisum”
starring John Wayne before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
and I got up and took showers.  Sherrie had a wonderful breakfast for us this
morning.  Roy, Sandi and I went snowmobiling and then came back about 12:30PM. 
We had an enjoyable time.  The one snowmobile did start heating up before we
came back to the lodge.  Mae, Shellie and Nick stayed at the lodge and played
games.  Again Sherrie had a very good lunch for us.  We all stayed at the lodge
and played games and just enjoyed relaxing.  Sandi and Shellie designed a tree
with a bear cub climbing it, out of snow.  It was really a work of art.  Those
two girls have such talent and artistic abilities.  Roy, Nick and I took
Sherrie’s Ford truck and pulled the trailer down to where the snowmobile’s were
parked and loaded them onto the trailer and brought them up to the Lodge.  The
snow is melting so fast that the road is completely melted of snow.  When we
got back Sherrie had a very excellent dinner.  She seems to almost outdo
herself with each meal.  Dinner was almost like a thanksgiving meal.   Just
before we ate dinner Sandy was informed that JaNae and Brad are about to have
their power turned off on Monday.  This was really upsetting to all of us.  We
all offered suggestions how the situation might be handled but when it comes
down to it Sandi has some serious problems to try to handle.  We again played
games and watched a movie before going to bed.</p>

woke about 7:30AM and could soon smell breakfast.  Sandi hadn’t slept very well
trying to figure out how to help Brad and JaNae.  After breakfast we got things
packed to leave.  We left about 11AM but stopped for gas and drinks, for Roy
and Nick, in Soda Springs.  We ran into bad weather as we approached Tremonton
through to Willard.  After getting home we unpacked things from Nick’s car and
got them on their way home.  Roy, Shellie, Mae and I took a nap before going over
to Jeff and Gail’s.  We had all our children there again except Sandi.  Sandi
called me and told me that for now things were settled with JaNae and Brad.  I
hope it will really help them.  As a family we played and enjoyed being
together for a wonderful evening.  It is now after 10PM and though I would like
to stay up with Roy and Shellie, I had better get to sleep as I have to drive
in the morning.  The week end has gone too fast.  We sure have a good family. 
they have their challenges and problems but I don’t know of many with as good
of family.</p>

didn’t get to bed until well after mid-night so she slept in, but she had my
breakfast ready for me.  My AM run went well.  I got home before Roy and
Shellie got up.  Mae prepared breakfast but it was after 11AM before we
finished.  We played game until it was time for me to take my PM run.  Mae
prepared Corn Beef Patties for lunch and then took Roy and Shellie to the
airport.  Mae went shopping after letting them off.  When I came home I warmed
up some dinner and then started cleaning up the dishes.  It was almost 6PM when
Mae got home.  I helped carry in the groceries while Mae put them away.  I then
worked on my journals.  </p>

didn’t sleep very well last night.  I was going to let Mae sleep in but she
insisted that she got up and got our breakfast.  When I got home from my bus
run I called and got an appointment with Dr. Toone.  When I told Bob that I was
going he also called and got an appointment, so we rode down together.  Shortly
after Bob and I returned home, Mae took Vendla Reid to a Doctor’s appointment
that she needed to go to.  I left for my afternoon run before Mae returned.  Bob
had a stir fry cooked up and shared with us when I got home.  Mae and I watched
the last of a TV show while we ate.  We then watched a second movie.  Mae
worked on her Family History while I worked on my journal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning the alarm did not go off.  I do not know why, but I woke at 5:30AM
thinking that it was 3:30AM and would have turned over and slept longer but
nature called so I got up.  When I got a clear look at the clock it almost
shocked me.  We had to hurry but we made it ok.  After my morning run I went to
an appointment with Monarch Dental to have my teeth cleaned and a general
check-up.  All went well and I was impressed with the services until they said
that I had one area where the depth of measurement went to 5 &amp; 6 mm.  They
then gave me a dollar quote to clean this area for $276.00.  I told them I
would have to reschedule.  That amount almost floored me!  What they had done
up to this point was covered by the $29.00 offer, but they didn’t clean my
teeth’ which is what I went in for in the first place.  As I drove home, the
more I thought about the situation the more concerned I became about the way
this turned out.  This evening after getting home from work, I called and
visited with Chelci about it.  She said that that price was more in line with
the deep cleaning and treating of the complete mouth, not just one tooth area. 
After dinner this evening I was able to find the U-tub sight that David wanted
me to watch, and I watched the total segment.  Many of the items brought up I
have been acquainted and resolved for myself, over the years.  I don’t know how
one would attempt to digest and resolve “all at one time” for someone else but
nothing that I heard from the U-tub presentation disturbed me.  Mae went to a Ward
Food Storage meeting this evening.  I visited with Bob about working on his
Family History and getting he and Margaret Sealed to Lester.  When I came
downstairs I turned on the TV and watched the last of a movie.  Mae got home
just at the end of the show.  We took our pills and went to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep very well again last night.  Mae got me to come back to bed for a
little while but then I didn’t want to get up at all.  I did and Mae got
breakfast for me and got me off.  My runs went well today.  We had Whipple come
and service our furnace.  There is a bearing going out on the furnace that
needs to be replaced before next fall.  It will cost $600.00 so we are going to
hold up until next fall.  Like Bob said, he might not be here by next fall. 
Mae also got on the computer and got things ready for Bob to be sealed to his
father, thus allowing his children access to the Family History.  When I got
home this afternoon I helped Mae prepare grilled chicken for dinner.  We watched
a TV show while eating.  At 7PM we went to Thomas’s and Mae helped Morgan with
some problems with his Family History.  After getting home we soon prepared and
went to bed.</p>

my AM run I went into the Work Care Center and got my physical examination for
my Medical Examiner’s Certificate that is required each year for Bus Drivers
privileges.  That went well.  It was almost noon when I got home.  I took a
short nap and then went in for my PM run.  I realized that I had gone in almost
an hour early, so I parked the bus and read for a while.  I helped Mae prepare
some dinner this evening.  We tended Scott and Mishelle’s children while they
went out for the evening.  We enjoyed playing games for a while and then Kylan,
Ashley and I watched the movie “Trial of Old Drum”.  The twins started to watch
it but lost interest quickly so Mae took them into the other room and played games
with them.  After Scott and Mishelle returned for the children Mae and I
watched another DVD “The Express”, a true story of Ernie Davis.  It was very
good except almost at the end the language got a little out of line.</p>

we were late getting to bed, I woke quite early.  I went back to sleep in the
recliner.  Mae came in about 8AM so we went back to bed for a while and then
took showers.  I sure love and enjoy that special sweetheart of me.  We were
late getting some brunch.  I did some work on my Journals.  This afternoon we
went to the church house and helped decorate the tables for the Stake High
Priest Social to be held this evening.  Mae and I picked up Sister Johnston and
took her with us to the social.  I had to help serve the meal but it went were
well.  we did enjoy being with many that we know, but there was also many that
we know that weren’t there.  I dare say that there should have been at least
50% more in attendance.  Mae and I stayed after to help clean up.  I hadn’t
thought about that part until I suddenly realized that Sister Johnston would
not feel up to staying while we cleaned up.  I asked Bob to drive her home,
which he did.  After Mae and I got home we both started working on our personal
histories.  I did turn on the TV to TCM channel and a fair show came on that we
watched before going to bed.</p>

an hour late.  I had not heard that Day Light Saving Time was going into affect
a month early this year.   Bob prepared dinner for us at noon.  Mae and I read
the Priesthood / Relief Society lesson before going to meeting.  It is a
wonderful message that made me wonder just how would someone cover in a lesson
the great information taught by President Lorenzo Snow.  We did have 4 that
came into the Family History room for help today.  I haven’t felt totally well
today.  After meetings we came home and got some dinner.  I then took a short
nap.  We went over to Jeff and Gail’s and played games this evening.  When we

at the junior high school goes that well on Wednesday.  After getting home I
took about an hour nap.  I then went out and cleaned the chicken coop getting
it ready for the new chicks.  The ground is about ready to plant peas.  I tried
to set up the Maverik Black Debit card and finally got one set up for me but
now I will have to set one up for Mae.  My PM run went well.  This evening Mae
made pizzas for dinner.  We ate them up stairs while we watched a movie that
Bob had recorded.  It was “Heaven Knows Mr. Allison” with Roger Mitchem and
Debra Karr.  Bob had to leave as Sherrie is going into the hospital for a
test.  We had seen it but we enjoyed it again.  We came downstairs after it
finished and started working on journals.  I had a question so went up to ask
Bob and got interested in another show.  I suddenly looked at the clock and
realized that I had been looking at a clock that Bob had not reset.  I quickly

garden spot for them.  I was glad when I found out the families situation.  The
mother is dying of cancer; they have 2 or 3 small children.  The mother is an
inactive member and the father is not a member.  I just wish there was
something else I could do for them.  Mae talked me into taking a nap so I did
without much resistance.  My PM runs went well except I stopped into the office
to find out the rules concerning skate boards.  I was going to work out in the
yard after getting home but Mae convinced me to relax.  I tried to get our
Garmin GPS programmed to download new maps but ran out of memory.  I will have
to call for help tomorrow.  I watched a little TV but really didn’t find a show
to watch.  This evening Mae and I went to the church and filled the supplies in
all the restrooms.  One of the youth knocked the cover to a fire alarm off and
it set all the alarms in the building off.  I made a call and got the Stake
building person over and he got the unit reset.  We also turned off all the
lights and looked the doors before we left.  I filled out this journal entry

are always very good.  My runs went well, we held a evacuation drill with the
Jr. High youth and our drill went quite well.  as I watched other buses do
their drill I felt our youth did a much better performance.  After getting home
I did some work on the back yard but it isn’t leveling as well as I had hoped
it would.  Using my tow chain I was able to get most of the stump pulled out of
the ground.  (Using the tow chain reminded me of a incidence that took place in
1970, so I will add it to that journal.)  I was starting to fill the hole back
in, when I realized that time was quickly passing.  I went into the house and
hurried to shower and change.  Mae and I then went to the Kaysville Tanner
clinic office where she and I had an appointment with Dr. Lee.  We then came
home and I had to hurry to get to work.  Mae took Sister Olsen to visit Dolly
Southern.  The three of them then went for a ride, just to get out.  They went
up to Morgan and visited the Morgan Cemetery.  Mae got home about the same time
that I came home from work.  During my PM runs I told the youth that they could
no longer bring their skate boards on the bus.  They seem to accept the change
ok.  When I got home I wanted to do more work outside but I just didn’t feel
very good.  I took a nap and then Mae read some from a book that Sister Mc
Entire let us borrow.  Both Mae and I worked on our journals before we went to

Scott’s twins as Mishelle had a migraine head ach.  I just got undressed and
went to bed feeling quite sick.  I slept until 1PM and felt much better when I
woke.  I got me some lunch and was just finishing when Mae came home.  I told
Mae that I wasn’t quite sure just how to handle the problem with the Jr. High
students getting along with each other.  I think that the main issue is coming
form the one African American girl but I can’t accuse as that would bring up
racial problems.  Mae suggested that I pass out the one quote that she keeps on
her wall, “I am determined to be happy in whatever situation I may be – for I
have learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery
depends upon our dispositions and not our circumstances.”  We made copies of that
statement and I placed them on the seats before the students got on the bus. 
Mae asked me what the students thought about it.  I told her I wasn’t sure as
there was one paper made into an airplane, some copies thrown on the floor and
at least one copy torn up into pieces and thrown onto the floor.  There must
have been a few that were taken at least off the bus.  Whether or not good will
come of it, may never be known.  Anyway the youth were quieter this afternoon. 
With Mae’s help, I got the peas planted this evening.  Bob and I went Home
Teaching this evening and visited the Thurman’s, the Casey’s and the
Johnston’s.  When I got home I filled out this journal entry and went to bed. 
After I left to go Home Teaching, Mae stayed and finished weeding the strawberries. 
She was working on her history when I got home.  I am concerned that she is
going to hard but when I tried to tell her that it came out wrong and I hurt
her feelings.  </p>

aware of all things.  Mae was busy taking care of me, the new chicks, attending
meetings and choir practice for Stake Conference.  Bob prepared Swiss steak for
the three of us and that was sure good.  I could only eat ½ of mine so we saved
it for later.  Then this evening Bob also made up a shrimp salad that we
enjoyed with our warmed up steak.  When Mae got home, she sat down to relax and
just got into a show when Sister Mac Entire came over and spent some time with
her.  Mae got in to the last of the show.  I was still feeling under the
weather when we went to bed so I call in sick for tomorrow, before I went to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3:30 this morning feeling pretty good so I call back in and told them I
would take my run this morning.  I let Mae sleep in and I got myself off to
work.  My run went well and I feel quite well.  Mae soon left to meet with
Georgia and they went to Cosco where Mae picked up a roll of ground cover.  We
have been told that it helps control the weeds and so we decided to give it a
try.  She also went to see Mishelle to give her a Birthday gift.  Following
that she took a gift to Bonnie Benedick, for her daughter’s wedding.  Of course
all of these visits between women take some visiting.  Mean while I went to Peterson
Medical and got some new Sleep Apnea supplies.  I went to Peterson Marine for
some parts but they are closed on Mondays.  I also tried to find parts to build
an idea that I have to keep the chicks warm.  The one price outweighed the
worth of the chicks so I abandoned that plan.  I then refilled our water
supply.  By that time I needed to get some lunch before my PM run.  Mae came
just in time for me to take the car and go to work.  Coming home from the PM
run I stopped at a Mexican Restraint and bought California Bean Burrito for our
dinner.  It was very good and we both enjoyed it.  Bob recommended a show on TV
and so we watched it.  It was good acting but kind of a depressing story.  We
read the Priesthood/Relief Society lesson for Sunday.  I entered this entry
before we went to bed.</p>

very well when I woke up but went to work anyway.  Mae got my breakfast for me
even though she didn’t sleep very well.  My run went well and when I got home I
went to bed and slept about 1 ½ hours.  Mae was working on our banking
account.  Every since we had to change out Visa Card information she has not
been able to get Quicken to work on our account.  She got Technical help over
the internet and was on line with them when I got up.  I gave her some help by
getting our external hard drive and got it hooked up to our computer.  I then
started preparing lunch as I needed to eat and go.  She was able to with the
help of the technician and by me calling our credit union on another phone,
finally get the problems resolved.  After eating I took another 15 minute nap
before taking the PM run.  When I returned home Mae had just finished getting
out bank statements corrected.  Mae also had dinner ready and after dinner I
watched a movie titled “McArthur” and it was very good (some bad language).  It
seems to have special meaning since we have been to the Philippines.  </p>

really don’t feel well today but again I well enough to drive the bus.  My bus
run went well.  I stopped and got gas on the way home.  My new Maverick card
worked ok this time.  When I got home I checked on the chicks before coming
in.  They seem to be doing well.  I took a nap for about an hour.  I called
Shellie to see how they are doing.  She has been quite depressed over Quint
returning home and Roy has now changed his mind and is not going to build. 
Shellie said that after fasting mainly for herself she is now feeling much better. 
I wish I had some answers for her. But I feel quite lost myself.  I called and
visited with Roy for a few minutes.  I also tried to call Lois again but she
doesn’t answer.  Lois returned my call later and I had a nice visit with her. 
Mae did some shopping and got home shortly before I left for my PM run.  Mae
had some homemade soup for dinner but just as we were about finished she
remembered that she hadn’t put the chicken in the soup.  It was good anyway. 
Mae had a Relief Society meeting to attend at 6PM and didn’t get home until
after 8PM.  While she was gone I watched some TV and also made up some
capsules.  </p>

went to bed.  Mae had the house all cleaned up and was ready to go to the
Temple.  She took Sisters names, for Sister Heydorn, that needing Initiatory
Ordinances done.  I slept well until after 11AM but didn’t get up until after
noon.  I worked on my journal for a while.  I then warmed up some chicken stew
that Mae made yesterday and started to eat when Mae got home.  she said that
the Temple was very busy today and she was only able to do the work for five sisters
today.  I still don’t feel the best but took my rout anyway.  After getting
home I watched some TV and ate some dinner.  Mae worked on Family History and I
worked on my journals.  Mae finished what she was working on and so turned on a
TV show.  When I finished I set down with her and we enjoyed the show.  It
didn’t get over until 10PM but we really didn’t want to go to bed but did any
way.  I seem to have the ability that when I lay down and close my eyes, I got
to sleep.  Mae didn’t get to sleep until after mid-night.</p>

my alarm went off Mae wasn’t in bed.  She had made my protein drink and went to
sleep in the 2<sup>nd</sup> bedroom.  I let her sleep and got myself off.  I
feel some better this morning and my run went well.  When I got home at 9:30M
the blinds were still pulled so I knew that Mae was not up yet.  She was asleep
in our room and she spoke to me so I stepped in.  She still hadn’t slept much
so I had her try to go back to sleep.  When I left this morning it was heavy overcast
but no storm.  It’s now almost 10AM and it is snowing.  This morning I was
reading in 2<sup>nd</sup> Nephi, the words of Lehi to his son shortly before
his death.  He explains the purpose of life so beautifully and I can’t help but
wonder how anyone can not understand it.  Oh!  How I wish my three sons would
read and pray more.  In-between the Jr. High and the Elementary run, I have
about 20 minutes layover.  I am reading “The Kolob Theorem” again for the
fourth time and enjoying just as much as before.  It gives so much logic as to
the reason and purpose of the creation of earth as well as the theory of God
the Creator.  When I got home PM run, I went out to the coop to check the chicks. 
I found the heat light had burned out and the chicks were cold.  I replaced the
bulb and they seem to still be ok.  Mae and I played a game of Rummy and I won
her for a change.  I took Mae out to dinner at Sizzler’s.  We used one of my
Birthday gift cards.   When we came home we watched a Walton movie before going
to bed.</p>

while.  We were going to go over to Jeff and Gail’s for a little while but Jeff
called and said that Ben isn’t feeling well.  Both Mae and I worked on our
journals.  We thought that Charles and Carolyn Saunders were coming over this
evening to play games.  Marylyn and Kelley Bodily were coming but their
daughter is expecting anytime and their Son-in-law had to be gone so they
stayed with her.  We therefore called Irven and Sandy and they came over.  We
enjoyed visiting and playing games.  It was after mid-night when we went to

her sheep while I got ready for a 10 o’clock Ward Council meeting.  I attended
in place of Brother Thomas as they are on a cruise.  Mae woke before I left.  I
got home before 11AM and then our Home Teachers came.  Bob had dinner ready
about noon and then we had to hurry to get to our Ward’s block meetings.  After
Sacrament meeting we attended Ward Choir practice.  We then had a few minutes
before we attended Stake Choir practice.  After that Mae and I visited with
Sister Fallis in place of visiting her in her home, this month.  I took the
garbage out to the curb and then went out and checked the chicks.  We are
missing one chick.  There is a hole in the back of the pen that maybe a rat or
snake might have got in.  I don’t know?  I shoved a 2 X 4 block into the hole
but don’t know what else to do at this point.  We were late getting to bed this

and going when I got there.  She had an appointment to help Gretchen Travis
with Family History at 10AM.  I worked on the chicken coop, putting heavy wire
mesh over areas where I thought anything could get in.  Bob went to Lowe’s and
bought me some mouse &amp; rat poison that I put out for them.  I texted
Charles Hyer concerning the mechanic that repaired our Buick that we traded in
for the Buick we have now.  Bryce has a Buick that is giving him the same
problem that ours was.  After we traded it in the mechanic was able to find the
problem.  May if we can find the same mechanic, he can repair Bryce’s car.   I
did get a nap in before I took the PM route.  Mae had dinner about ready when I
got home.  Steve Miller from Scotts Lawn Service came about 5:30PM and we
signed up for their services for this year.  We will see how this works this
year.  Mae and Gail took the children to Surf N Swim this evening.  I watched a
movie on TV with Bob.  It is one that I have seen the end of twice but Bob
recorded the movie so I got to see all of it this time.  I filled out this
entry while I was waiting for Mae to return.  Mae came home about 9PM.  She
said that the children all ask where Grampa was.  Mae took a shower and we soon

Scott came over for dinner with Mae and I.  We enjoyed our time with him.  They
are looking for a home but the prices are so high.  Most homes are over
$200,000 and well over.  It is hard to imagine the great inflation and this is
only the beginning.  After dinner I went over to Home Depot and bought a new
thermostat for the fireplace and I went to Wal-Mart and exchanged my glass
case.  I started to exchange the thermostat but found it faulty.  It was then
time for the PM run.  On the run I had a woman drive through the reds and
between unloading students.  She ignored my honking of the horn.  I think I was
able to get her license and so tomorrow I will fill out Violation Notice.  I
have also volunteered to help with a Field Trip that Roberta ask for help
with.  This evening Mae and I watched two stories from the Old Testament,
Jeremiah and then Ester.  It was late when we got to bed.</p>

When I got back to the shop I turned a complaint in on the lady that ran my Red

the field and track youth from Woods Cross High school and took them to
Syracuse High.  I then took my PM runs and when I finished I took the bus home

children while they went out.  We took the children for a walk around the
block.  Mae took the children downstairs where they watched a movie on the TV. 
I fell asleep on the couch in the front room.  When I woke up I went downstairs
and watched the end of their movie.  By then Jeff and Gail were home so after
they put the children down for the night we played a game before going home. 
We soon got ready and went to bed.  Mae read a couple of articles out of the
Ensign as we drove home.  I am having problems with becoming discouraged with
some of the articles as I hear the writers tell how to raise families.  I

we let all the children hunt for Easter Eggs.  When Tyler, Emily and Connor had
stayed over the other night Mae had them color Easter Eggs.  She also had made
up plastic eggs in which she had candy and money.  I hid most of the eggs
throughout the yards and Mae came out and helped me with the last of the eggs. 
While the children we hunting Easter Eggs, they found a large rat that was
dead.  We suspect that he was the one that killed one of our chicks, but he
must have also eaten the Rat and Mouse poison I put out.   After the children
found the eggs, most of the adults and older children played volleyball, and
visited, While Mae &amp; Mishelle took the younger children over to the park to
play.  About 5PM we barbecued chicken, hamburger and hot dogs for dinner along
with all the other trimmings that was brought by each family.  We had all our
sons and their Families with us except for David, our grandson.  Page came and
brought her boy friend Garrett.  It looks like they are getting quite serious. 
It was a wonderful day but by the time they all left Mae and I were very
tired.  I went with Brother Thomas home teaching to Sister Olsen’s.  </p>
