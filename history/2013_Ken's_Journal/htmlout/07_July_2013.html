<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got over to Irven’s about 10 am we mainly just talk about what they wanted to
do with their yard.  I tried to explain that until we know what they wanted to
end up with I really couldn’t place the order for parts with Durk’s.  I came
home about 1PM and ate my lunch with Mae.  I sure love my wife!  After lunch I
did take a 15 minute nap.  I tried to find a nozzle to my Wet Vac but could not
find it.  As I was about ready to go for parts for Irven and Sandy’s, Bob
returned from taking Sherry into the hospital.  I still spent a lot of time
trying to find out what Irven and Sandy wants to do.  I finally went over to
Durk’s and got the material to I need to run the water supply to the sprinkler
systems valve box.  It was after 5 pm so I quit and came home.  Sandi had gone
to see Nancy and so she stopped at our place and had dinner with us.  We sure
enjoyed that opportunity to be with her.  Mae walked up to Falli’s to return
the key for the horse gate.  They got back in time to take care of the horses
themselves.  Bobo asked me to go with him to give Sherrie a Priesthood
Blessing.  I really didn’t want to but we did anyway.  I really feel that the
Faith in giving Sherrie a Priesthood Blessing comes from Bob, but I need to
leave that up to the Lord.  It was interesting that prior to starting the
blessing the monitor indicated that Sherrie’s blood pressure was down to the
low 70’s and when we finished the Blessing we looked at the monitor and it us
up to 90.  Sherrie asked the attendant who had just returned to the rook, “How
can that happen?” and he just answered, “You just received a Blessing didn’t
you!”  After returning home, Mae and I soon got ready and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke about 6 am and got up.  Mae hadn’t slept very well so I let her sleep in. 
I read my scriptures and had morning prayers.  I then worked on my journals,
printing the last three months for a hard copy.  At 10 am I had an appointment
with Dr. Larson just for a checkup on my hernia operation.  Mae needed to get a
treatment from Dr. Bennett so I had her drop me at the Tanner Clinic and then
she went on.  Dr. Bennett said that it was amazing that she took such a fall an
had such few injuries, especially at her age.  He gave the credit to our diet
and her exercising.  I worked about 5 hours at Irven’s getting a water supply
line ran out from their wash room to the outside for the sprinkler system they
will put in.  We didn’t do much this evening except watch a show on TV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
breakfast I weeded and watered the garden.  This afternoon I did some work on
our boat and found that the bracket the holds the Fish Finder is broken again. 
We went into Ogden and got the decals for my boat registration.  A called the
Utah State Vehicle and reported that the one we ordered on line still had not
arrived.  They said I should check with our Post Office, but that they would
resend my registration.  I ask if I could go to an office to pick them up as I
didn’t want to wait another 7 to 10 days.  We went into the Ogden office and
that was an hour wait.  I had been planning on going to the Peterson Medical
Supply but the wait made us too late to get in there.  When I got home and it
cooled down, I built a bracket for the fish finder out of some aluminum.  It
turned out pretty good.  We watched a movie on TV this evening before going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t get up until 7 am.  While Mae prepared breakfast I took care of the
chickens and washed the windows.  It did rain last night but our lawns are sure
burning up.  By the time this summer ends I am not sure they will be able to
grow back.  I roasted almonds and made more almond butter.  After lunch I laid
down for a nap.  I had planned on sleeping 15 minutes but when I sent to set
the timer the power had gone, for the second time this morning, so I reset the
clock and forgot to set the timer.  Anyway, I got a good nap.  Mae has been on
the phone quite a bit today with Shellie, I guess Mae is going to fly down to
Phoenix for two weeks.  This afternoon we went up to David and Shauna’s where
we spent the evening just relaxing.  Scott, Mishelle and their family also came
up.  We cooked dinner on the grill and just enjoyed relaxing and visiting. 
Scott and his family left so they could enjoy Layton’s Fireworks.  The rest of
us just enjoyed relaxing and especially when the sun set and we enjoyed setting
out side.  We played some games but just mainly relaxed.  Mae and I came home,
getting down the canon just in time to see the finale of the Layton Fire Works
display.  We then came home and watched a movie on DVD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in although Mae was up with leg cramps and slept from 4am on in the
recliner.  We got up about 9 am with the phone ringing but it was a wrong number. 
I tried to get my boat in to have it checked but every place seems to still be
closed for the 4<sup>th </sup>and through the weekend.  I worked some on my
Diary then Mae and I went to the show “Ephraim’s Rescue”.  We really enjoyed
the movie and I felt very humbled to think of what some has paid that we might
enjoy all that we have today.  This evening I got a call from Kathy telling me
that she couldn’t reach Bob, but that Sherrie had been taken back into the
hospital in an ambulance.  I got Bob on the phone and a little later I took him
up to the hospital.  By the time we got there she had been taken out of E.R.
and into a room.  Sherrie is a very sick person.  The Dr. came about an hour
later and I really felt discussed.  Bob said it best when he said that he looked
like he had been out doing chorus in the barn.  I also felt that he did very
little except to ask Sherries friend, which had been with her when they
transported Sherrie, what had been done in E.R.  He then left with very little
explanation, I really felt that he was coming back, but he didn’t.  When Bob
and I came home I was in a very disappointed spirit as to what had transpired
at the hospital. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
Mae and I slept well last night.  I took care of the chickens while Mae prepared
breakfast.  I started working on my Diary when Bob invited us to go with him
for lunch at Sizzlers.  We stopped by the hospital to see how Sherrie was doing
and found out that things weren’t going very well.  Bob offered to bring dinner
back for Sherrie and Eric, although Eric wasn’t there then but was expected to
be there shortly.  Bob, Mae and I then went for dinner and had a very nice
meal.  When Bob came back to the hospital he found problems as Eric never did
come.  After returning home I decided that Sherrie needed someone to be with
her so I got ready and went back to the hospital.  When I got there Kellie,
Sherrie’s friend was there and would stay for a while.  I left with telling
Kelley that I would come back and relieve her at 7PM.  I stopped by Irven and
Sandy’s and visited with their family that had come to help them with their
yard.  I am not sure that I shouldn’t help them but Mae doesn’t want me to.  At
7PM I visited with Kelley and she said that Grant and Stacy were there.  Then
Bob told us that he was going over.  I stayed home until they let me know what
they want me to do.  I studied for a Priesthood lesson tomorrow and Mae read
part of Sanford Porter’s life history.  That is a powerful story.  We started
to bed at 9:15 pm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept well last night, I got us before 8 <b>am but then went back to be and
snuggled with my sweet wife.  I </b>really did want to get up but I had my 9AM
High Priest leadership meeting.  When I got home I checked on the chickens and
the garden.  We attended our regular block meeting and following that we went
over to Jeff and Gail’s for dinner.  Bob did get home so between meetings and
dinner we visited with him for a minute.  He is now fully aware that Serrie’s
health problem stems from her and Eric’s life style.  We enjoyed dinner with
Jeff’s family and then Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played a game of “Trans America”
which I won and then a game of “Rummy Cube” which I really lost.  It was a nice
evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3AM and slept the rest of the night in the recliner.  Bob had me pick
him up at Dee’s, as he is getting a fan switch repaired.  I took care of the
chickens and worked in the garden, this morning.  I then hooked up the boat and
went over to Dick’s Boat’s and had him look at the damage.  He felt that it
will be ok with a new prop so I had him order it for me.  I then went over to
Peterson Medical and ordered a power cord that connects to a 12 V DC power
supply and to my C-PAP.  That will give us use with the camper when we don’t
have power hook-up.  I watched a couple of shows on TV.  Mae took Shirley Olsen
and Leslie Fallas  out to lunch as Shirley really wanted to go to Chuck a Rama,
when Mae told her we were going there for our anniversary, so Mae told her that
they would do that as Shirley is Mae’s visiting teaching companion and that
they would take Dolly Southarn and Leslie Fallas, who they visit teach, with
them.  It turned out that Dolly had gone camping with her daughter &amp;
family, so wasn’t home to go with them.  Afterwards, Shirley wanted Mae to take
her to the doctor and then to the store, so she didn’t get home until about 3
pm and she had left at 11 am.  Bob got a call from Dee’s to let him know that
his car was ready.  He wanted me to take him over but Mae has the car and I
told him that she should be home about 3pm.  When Mae got home I went upstairs
to tell him I could take him over but he was in the bathroom with the door
locked.  I waited for a while but he still didn’t come so I went back.  The
door is still locked and he doesn’t answer.  I went out to get a tool to unlock
the door when Bob finally got the door unlocked.  He had got down and couldn’t
get up.  I got him up and after a few minutes he felt some better so we went
for his car.  I really don’t know what to do.  In my opinion he really should
be in an assisted living facility.  I don’t know how things will work out for
us and I don’t know how Bob would adjust to that.  I don’t know what to do.  To
add to my dilemma I felt impressed to check the chickens as it got dark and the
brown chickens and one white chicken were missing.  I found then roosting on
the log pile.  I was some time getting them into the coop.  The white chickens
don’t seem to except the brown chickens.  I did get some repairs planned out
for the camper along with everything else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
breakfast I went to for some materials and came back home and installed a 12
volt outlet for my c-pap to connect to.  I then reinforced the frame of the
camper.  While I was doing that Mae got a phone message from Martina with
Peterson Medical Supplies telling me that my c-pap would not convert to a 12
volt adapter.  That’s great!  I got it all wired now.  I called back and they
are going to see if I can get a new c-pap.  I spent two hours on the computer
getting a step latter ordered from Staples.  After dinner this evening Bob
invited us to come up and watch a recorded movie, “Imitation General” staring
Glen Ford.  It was quite enjoyable.  We set in the swing outside and enjoyed
the evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 6 am and at 7 am started out side with the lawns.  Mae soon had
breakfast and then I mowed the front lawn.  It was more the weeds that needed
it rather than the grass as the grass isn’t growing much without water.  I came
in and showered but was not quite ready when the Clark’s came for us.  We went
to Madox’s in Brigham City, where we met the Hire’s and the Maharry’s.  We had
a very enjoyable dinner and visit.  I asked Charles if there might be a time
when I could visit with him and get some advice.  I told him that it needed to
be another time and not today, but he kept questioning me and I told him that I
was concerned with Bob’s health and what it would do to us if he passed away. 
Well we discussed much more that I had wanted to at this time but he kept
asking me more details.   When we finished he suggested that we start looking
for a solution now.  After leaving Madox’s, Grenn, Kathleen, Mae and I went to
the Brigham City Temple and enjoyed going through a session there.  It was
almost 7pm when we got home.  I quickly changed clothes and went to the Stake
onion patch and help weed our Ward’s assigned area.  The weeds were bad but we
had a good turn out and accomplished the job by 9pm.  I worked on my journal
and talked with Mae before we went to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep much as I kept thinking at the situation we are in with this
house.  Mae thinks we shouldn’t worry about it, that things will work out.  I
guess I don’t have much faith.  I have felt depressed all day.  I worked on the
boat for a while today.  I had a Asphalt co. stop by.  They are doing some work
just up the street and have too much asphalt ordered.  He offered to put an
asphalt drive for us and included a asphalt connection to the driveway for
$3,500 total.  I think that Karen Von Neiderhauser had his drive asphalted for
over $5,000 plus tax.  It was a good offer but I just can’t see putting more
money into this place that we won’t get out.  It looks like we might get some
storm but as I did some errons I saw several fields of new cut hay.  We watched
a movie on TV of the life of Wyatt Earp but it got on the R-Side occasionally.</p>

slept in this morning and after a nice breakfast I went out and did some
gardening, plus I took care of the chickens.  We still are not getting any eggs
but keep hoping.  Our Zucchini plants are starting to produce and the rest of
the garden is looking good, but our strawberries are not producing very well this
year.  I went into Peterson Medical supply and got a new C-Pap machine that
will work on a 12 volt battery.  Scott came over and brought our life jackets
back.  I loaned him our roto-tiller and he also helped me bring our generator
up to the house.  Mae and I went shopping for a few groceries and I tried to
find a cabinet latch for the camper but couldn’t.  we watched a western movie
but it wasn’t the one we wanted to see.  After that show it said that the one
we wanted would be playing after 11pm.  We turned the TV off and then went out
to check on the chickens and found that six of them were roosting on the wood
pile.  We think that it is the rooster that is keeping them out of the coop.  I
think I will butcher him tomorrow.</p>

slept in until after 8 this morning.  After breakfast I butchered the rooster. 
I watered the garden and then Mae and I took the quilts up to the Laundromat
and washed them.  Mae had forgotten to bring Soap and Pre-Spray so I went over
to the grocery store and bought them.  When I returned I tripped going into the
Laundromat and fell.  I think I am ok.  Mae attended a Baby Shower this
afternoon so she dropped me of at Scott and Mishelle’s so I could help Scott
decide some changes to his lawn sprinkler system.  Mae and I tended the
children while Scott and Mishelle went out for the evening.  We came home about
9:45pm and watched a movie on Netflex.  We had seen an earlier version of the
story so I wasn’t really excited with this one as it was staring Rock Hudson. 
It just hard for me not to remember what kind of an individual he turned out to
be when I see him in a love story and that is the kind of shows he always plays
in.  it was a long movie so it was 1am when we got to bed.</p>

enough and froze them so that we can take them with us on our trip.    I took a
nap before we went to Church.  We attended our meetings.  Mae cooked the
rooster for dinner this afternoon.  Bob and I went Home teaching to Fallis’s
this afternoon.  We had Home Teachers come this afternoon to visit with us. 
Mae put a lazona together and we took it down to Sherrie’s.  I am sure tired

went to Home Depot and exchanged the surface bolts for a different style.  I
spent quite a while designing and building brackets for the surface bolts to
lock into.  I got two of the cabinet doors, in the camper, so that they would
lock securely.  Three other doors I just fastened closed with a bungee cord. 
It was 2pm before we finished packing and left for Fish Lake.  It was almost
9pm when we got to our camp site at Fish Lake.  We then ate some dinner and
then we played some games.  Mae really beat me at Racko, she won 8 out of 9
games.  I did win at Rummikub.  We went to bed about mid-night.</p>

the night.  I got up at 7am and stayed up.  We used the pickup and camper to
take the boat to Bowery’s and used their ramp.  I was going to rent a slit from
them but they are all full.  I had Mae drive the pickup back to camp.  She was
to wait there for me while I found some where to beach the boat.  It took a
while but we finally took the boat to Fish Lake Lodge and rented a slit there
for the rest of the week.  Our neighbors across the street help us.  We did go
out fishing about 11am.  I used a new set of pop-gear that was larger with more
spinners.  I bought them some time ago but had never tried them.  They seemed
to work better than the small ones.  We would trade outfits after each catch
and the large gear way out did the small set.  We each caught our limits.  Mae
helped me clean and filet the fish.  We took a nap after getting back to the
camp.  I was glad that Mae was able to sleep as she didn’t sleep much last
night.  We went out fishing again this afternoon and again did well catching
seven nice fish.  We cooked hot dogs over the camp fire this evening and ate
dinner outside.  Mae and I played another game of Racko and this time I won.</p>

After dinner I filet the fish from yesterday.  We played a game of Rummikub and
a game of Racko and Mae won both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                When
I woke at 5:30am I realized that we were low on power.  I tried to start the
truck but the battery was too low to start.  I had to start the generator and
let it charge for a while.  By the time I got that setup Mae had breakfast
ready.  We got down to the boat just before 9am.  The boat battery was dead
when we tried to start it.  I had to get the Marina operator to jump the boat
for us.  It was shortly after 9 when we got out fishing.  I fished with the
small gear and Mae used the large gear.  By 11am we both had caught our 4 fish
and came back in.  We cleaned the fish at the cleaning station.  Mae is getting
very good at cutting the fish and I clean them out.  We were back to camp before
noon but our neighbors across the street had already left.  We wanted to tell
them thanks for being such good people.  I noticed a little later that they had
left us the remainder of their fire wood.  Mae prepared a nice lunch for us. 
While we were eating a buck and a doe came through our camp.  After eating I
filet the fish while Mae tried to take a nap.  We had quite some hard lighting
and thunder storms come through, with very hard rain.  We went to the grocery
store and got the girl there to call Sandi for us to find out if they are
coming to join us tonight, they are not, but at least we know and will not
expect them.  We went out fishing this evening for a while.  I tried using my
downrigger weight but didn’t have any luck.  Mae did catch two nice fish.  Most
of our fish are running 14 to 17 inches in length.  We built a camp fire and
set out by it until going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning and just relaxed and played games, after we got up.  I
got things out side put away so that they would not get wet again.  I then took
a nap while Mae did some typing on the computer.  We had planned that I would
go out fishing while Mae typed but I really didn’t want to go out without her. 
We cooked up the two fish, Mae caught yesterday, along with zucchini, for
lunch.  We played a couple of rounds of Rummikub and then we went out fishing
again.  I again tried fishing deep trying to catch a lake trout but again I had
no luck.  Mae caught 4 fish and when I changed to pop-gear and worms I caught 1
fish before we quit and came back to our camp.  We played 7 sets of Rummikub
and I beat Mae 7 of those sets.  I had to put that in as most of the times we
play games Mae wins me.  We do enjoy being together.  Just before we went to
bed we ran out of propane in both tanks, so we won’t have heat tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were going to fish this morning but decided that we would just eat and get
things packed up and leave for home.  We did sleep well although Mae looked
like a bear with all her layers of warm clothing.  It is a beautiful warm
morning.  We decided that we would just get packed up and go home.  That way we
would be home for meeting tomorrow.  It was after 12PM when we stopped at the
Dump Station and then we got on our way.  About 8 miles down the road we picked
up phone service for a little while.  There were several missed calls on our
phone.  Mae was able to get the messages off but then we again went out of
phone service.  We had to wait until we got to Scipio before we received fairly
good phone service.  It was after 5PM when we arrived home.  We were tired and
by the time we got unpacked, ate dinner and took showers it was after 8PM.  We
just stayed home, watched a movie on DVD (I’m not sure about the story) but
when it finished we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up before 7AM and after reading my scriptures went to my 9AM High Priest
Leadership meeting.  Mae woke up shortly before I got home as Jeff called her. 
She was still visiting with Jeff so I prepared breakfast.  Just as we were
setting down to eat Bob call for me to come up.  Mae put breakfast in the oven
and we ate later.  Vie Gram gave the lesson during our High Priest meeting and
had planned on showing the video on Tithing with Lorenzo Snow.  There were
several that tried to get the machine to work and finally I took the machine
back to the library and got the small unit.  At least we got through the movie
but then there was no time for any discussion.  After our meetings and we came
home, I called President Steadman and asked if I could get the High Priests that
meet in our building to make some small donations and we could purchase a new
TV with players to replace the old one.  He said that we couldn’t but he would
follow through with getting some new equipment and would keep me informed.  Bob
hadn’t decided anything about dinner so I visit with him and he decided to buy
some chicken and all his family would go to see Sherrie.  Mae warmed us up some
left over’s we worked on our computers.  I got another 8 days retyped from my
Diary.  What is in my Diary helps me remember incidents and then I can expand
and correct the few lines that I actually wrote.  I visited with Irven and he
said that they are ready to trench their yard for the sprinkler system.  I will
go over early and help them in the morning.  We did get some very sad news
while talking to Sandi by phone this afternoon.  Brad is in a rehabilitation
center from taking too many drugs for pain, and JaNae has gone to drinking.
JaNae’s drinking has been going on for some time now.  We are very concerned
about their situation but really don’t know just what to do about it.  Sandi
has talked very straight forward to JaNae about her situation.  Evidently her
drinking has been going on for some time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 4:30 this morning so that I could be at Irven’s at 6AM.  Mae had set
me out some cold cereal and had fruit ready in the refrigerator.  I got water
started on the garden and left Mae a note to check it.  Bryce also came over to
help at Irven’s.  Dug and Mark also came to help.  We worked all day getting
all the trenching done and the sprinkler system over half way done.  I quit and
came home by 6:30PM so I could shower and change before going Home teaching to
Thurman’s.  Mae went with me as I wasn’t sure if we were going to teach them
how to do Indexing or just visit as Home Teacher’s.  I ate some dinner after
getting home from there and then watched a Western movie on TV before going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
we had breakfast I went made an appointment with Dr. Lee.  I mowed most of the
lawn but they are so patchy do to the shortage of water.  Dr. Lee feels that I
should check with a sergeant and so made an appointment for me at 3:15PM with
Dr. Larsen.  I came home and ate some lunch and took a nap.  Mae went with me
to see Dr. Larsen.  He said that I have stage two Hemorrhoids out of four, so
it is not to serious at this time.  He wants me to take Metamucil.  He gave me
a prescription for some depositories and wants me to check back with him in two
weeks.  He is encouraging me to have a colonoscopy as I haven’t had one in the
last 10 years.  Mae and I then went shopping for a egg shell mattress and found
one at Bed Bath and Beyond.  We also bought a few other items and got the car
washed before returning home.  I filet some fish for Mae to take to some of the
older Sisters in our Ward.  While she was gone I watched a couple of TV shows
and made up 200 Phyt-Aloe capsules.  I entered this into my journal before going
to bed at 11pm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 4:30 this morning and had a bowl of cereal and then went to the
Welfare farm and weeded our Wards assigned area.  It took me 1 hour and 15
minutes to go through our Wards assigned 10 rows.  When we weeded our rows two
weeks ago we did a good job so there wasn’t much to do this time.  When I got
home I got the lawn mower out and put the lawn sweeper on so that I could pick
up the grass from mowing yesterday.  Mae was up by then so we had breakfast. 
Bob started sweeping the lawn but had a low front tire.  He got some Flat Tire
repair in a Can and I put it in for him.  He swept the lawn after that.  Mae
took Ashley out to lunch today, just to spend some time with her.  Bob took me
into Ogden to get the gas tanks filled for the camper.  When we got back I
installed the tanks and then came in the house and took a ½ hour nap.  Mae was
home when I woke.  I have several items that I need to do in the next few days
so that kept me busy this evening.  I slipped while cutting some metal and cut
my right index finger.  When I came in to get some Band-Aids I found Mae
talking to Jared Fairbanks with Premier Funeral Services, Inc. as Sherrie’s
vital signs are fading and Hospice feels that we will go with in the next 24
hours.  This is a hard time for Bob and his family.  I did call Roy and let
them know what is happening.  I am not sure just what to think of Roy &amp;
Linda.  Mae and I cooked chicken and zucchini squash on the grill.  We then
watched a couple of shows on TV.  I typed this entrance and we went to bed. </p>

notified us first thing that Sherrie past away about 1:30 this morning.  We
worked on the camper today getting the bed made up and I got the door locks on
some of the cabinets.  I had to go to town for some items and I stopped at
Irven and Sandy’s.  I got there just as the phone service came.  He will
install a new line if I will run the wire for it.  He will provide the line. 
That sounds like a good deal as it will save them $150.00 normal repair for a
new line.  I finished the day by working on the power supply for the boat. 
After dinner I went next door and visited with Mike, to let him know about
Sherrie’s passing.  Mae went to Sister Heydorn’s to help her with Family History. 
We watched a movie on DVD before going to bed.  Today we received the first two
eggs from our new chickens.  They were very small eggs but never the less they
were eggs.  I was beginning to wonder!</p>

woke at 7 this morning but Mae hadn’t got to sleep until after 2AM and so she
went back to bed to try to sleep more.  I started work on the camper, the boat
and the lighting for the driveway.  Mae had a hair appointment that took over
three hours.  She then did some shopping.  It was 6pm when we ate dinner so I
quite for the day.  We watched I story that is a series that we ordered form
Net-Flex, before going to bed.</p>

got up at 7 but Mae slept a little longer.  I prepared an egg omelet for
breakfast while Mae was making a cake to take to the Bridal Shower.  I went
over to Irven and Sandy’s to lay the phone cable and that was a lot longer than
I had thought.  They also had some leaks in the valve boxes so I repaired
those.  I had told them how to measure the distance to order burial wire for
the valve control, but when I started running it, it was way too short.   I had
to order the material for the drip system, so I picked it up when I got the
other materials I needed to have to finish the system.  Any way I was all day
there.  I came home and with Scott’s help we removed the tree root that crossed
the driveway to the back yard.  We were then able to get Scott’s trailer out
and park it under the awning on the West side of the house.  Mae prepared
dinner for Scott’s family and we enjoyed having them here.  Scott did some
updates to our computer and tried to update our I-pod, but it is too old.  It
was after 10:30 when we took showers and went to bed.  I am sure tired tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early this morning with my back and legs hurting.  I got up and went into
the front room and slept the rest of the night in the recliner.  I was up
before Mae woke.  I felt like I needed to check on the chickens and found that
the children had locked them in without water, plus they wanted to get out running
in the yard.  They were sure excited to see me.  Mae made me a wonderful hot
breakfast before I left to attend High Priest Group Leadership meeting.  When I
returned home I took a nap.  I had started on this journal entry when Sister
Fallis called and asked if I could come up and look at a water problem.  It
looks like she has a water main that is leaking.  I had her call the city and
they said that they would have someone come by and check on it.  We attended
our block meetings and when I got home I called Leslie and told her that I and
one other Brother would be there in the morning early to help dig the line up,
but she said that Mark didn’t want to start early and he would dig it himself
later tomorrow.  I called Brother Campel and let him know not to come in the
morning.   David, our Grandson, came up just to spend some time with us.  We
cooked a nice dinner for him and then we played Rummikub at which Mae won.  It
was 9:30PM when he left for home.  It was a very enjoyable evening being with
David and thought it so special for him to come clear up here just to visit
with us.  Kathy came and asked me if I would dedicate Sherries grave and of
course I said that I would.  It was after 10PM when we headed for bed.</p>

woke early but after using the bathroom and reading my scriptures I went back
to bed and snuggled with Mae.  We had just gone back to sleep when Bob came and
told me that Glen Higley was there to help with Leslie ’s.  They have a leaking
water main.  I had ask for help in Priesthood meeting but Glenn hadn’t said
anything to me.  Therefore I hadn’t called Glenn to tell him that Mark, her son
didn’t want to start work that early, so he would do it himself.  By then I was
up and awake so took care of the chickens and started watering the garden.  We
then had breakfast and started packing the camper.  When we started to put
things in the refrigerator we found that a piece of chicken had been left in
the freezer and it was very spoiled.  I took the all shelving and drawers out
and washed the entire fridge down.  Leslie then called and asked for some
advice.  I went down and Mark had uncovered the main line next to the
sidewalk.  A plumbing company had been there and said that they needed to
uncover at least another 10 feet of line towards the house.  Mark was going to
rent a Backhoe to do the digging.  I suggested they have the city come with a
pump and pump the water out of the hole and at the same time turn the water
back on so they could tell which way the water was coming.  That way they would
know which direction to dig.  It was 3PM when we got to Scott’s to get Kylan. 
We made good time until 7 miles before the exit to Payson when the traffic came
to almost a complete stop.  It took us 1 ½ hours to get to the Payson Exit.  We
stopped at a Taco Time in Pason to get directions to the lake and while there bought
some dinner.  We were all hungry and didn’t want to wait until we got to the
campground.  We got to camp about 7PM.  After setting up the camper, we played
a game of Raco before going to bed.</p>

with us but then she walked back to get a chair.  She did not come back down as
her leg was hurting when she walked up the hill.  The rest of the day we
relaxed and played games.  It was about 4:30pm when Becky, Mattie, Jessie and a
friend of Jessie’s came up for the evening.  I cooked a chicken Dutch oven
dinner for all of us.  It was about 8pm when becky and the girls left for
home.  Kylan wanted to build a fire and set around it this evening.  Mae wasn’t

night and was feeling ok this morning.  She and Kylan went for a walk to the
