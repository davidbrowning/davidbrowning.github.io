<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were tired from last night so we didn’t get up until 8:45 AM.  I had to hurry
to get to my meeting at 9 AM.  After my meeting I had to prepare a lesson for
Priesthood meeting today.  The lesson went fairly well.  We had a great lesson
on the Prophet Joseph Smith during our Sunday School class.  It was also
interesting that they had a new TV and DVD Player to show a movie about the
Prophet Joseph Smith on.  My talk with President Steadman concerning the old TV
and DVD player did get some results.   Being that today is Fast Sunday, Mae
took the opportunity to bear her testimony.  We thought that we would have time
to relax this afternoon but time went fast and we went up to Jeff and Gail’s at
6:30PM.  It was late when we got home and to bed.</p>

were tired but got up anyway as we have a lot to do before our family come this
afternoon.  Jeff and his family, Scott and his family, David and his family,
Sandi, JaNae and her family, Chelci and her family all came.  David came by on
his way home and we enjoyed visiting with him.  He stayed until most of our
family got here and then he went on home.  It has been a very special day and
everyone seems to have a good time.  We were all sorry that Mike and his family
did not come.  When it came time for everyone to leave, everyone pitched in and
help clean up and put things away.  By the time they all left, we were very
tired.  </p>

morning run went well.  After getting home I typed a letter to Brian Larsen,
the head of Transportation, and expressed my concerns with the crossing of Hwy.
89.  When I left for my pm runs I took a statement from Durk’s to Irven and
asked them to just take the money directly to Durk’s and pay the bill off.  My
pm runs went well and after returning to the compound I took the letters to
Brian and also a copy to Rosa.  Mae had dinner about ready when I got home and
then I went down to the onion patch but the ground was still very muddy from
irrigating.  I came back home just as Mae was leaving for a R.S. committee
meeting.  I went upstairs and was with Bob when Grant came over to visit with
his Dad.  We watched the DVD about the hearing aid that Bob is going to have
implanted.  I came back downstairs just as Mae return from her meeting.  I
entered this entry and as soon as Mae returned we went to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night so I got myself of to work.  My runs went
well.  After getting home I called Dr. David Browning’s office and made an
appointment for Bob and I to see David concerning some skin problems.  I met
with Rosa for a few minutes with some ideas on my bus route.  She had me meet
with Ron Mulligan and then I went back to Rosa.  She was busy plus I had to take
the pm runs.  Rosa asked me to meet with her again tomorrow.  During the pm run
I had trouble with the loading door jamming and so called into the shop to see
about repairing it.  I left the bus up top to be repaired tomorrow.  After
dinner this evening I went down to the onion patch and did some weeding.  The
patch is in real need of weeding.  After 1 ½ hours of hard work I only got 1/3
of a double row weeded.  </p>

went in early to get a spare bus for this morning.  One hadn’t been assigned to
me so one of the mechanics took the loose parts off so the door wouldn’t jam
and had me drive my bus on the route.   My am run went well and when I got back
to the shop they took my bus into the shop to repair it.  I went in and spent
some time with Rosa reworking my route and came up with a possible solution. 
Mae has been very busy getting food ready for me to eat while she is gone.  I
also worked on the changes to my bus route.  I had new schedules ready plus a
note to parents and students outlining the new pickup times.  I went in early
and got Rosa’s approval and made enough copies to pass out to the students on
my pm run.  The pm runs went well but I am about 5 minutes late getting to
Whitesides Elementary.  I don’t know any other way to do it.  This evening
while doing other things, Mae and I watched a show on Hall Mark.</p>

didn’t sleep very well again tonight.  She sure tries to be perfect but doesn’t
feel that she does enough.  I feel that I am sometimes a mill stone around her
neck.  I got myself off to work so that she could sleep as long as possible.  I
got home before 10 am and at 11 I took Mae over to the Ogden airport where she flew
to Arizona to spend two weeks with Shellie’s family.  I took my pm routes
before coming home to an empty home.  Home is sure lonely without Mae.  I
watched a couple of shows on TV this evening.</p>

woke this morning at 6:30 am after getting some breakfast I went down to the
Stake onion patch and resumed the row that I started to weed the other day.  It
took me until 11am to finish that row and carry the weeds to the end of the
patch.  I came home and relaxed and watched a show on TV.  I also took a nap. 
I did get out in the garden and picked some cucumbers and cantaloupe.  I took
the Bodily’s some eggs and cucumbers.  Bob had me come up and watch the BYU vs
Texas Long Horns with him.  I stayed until half time and then came downstairs

woke early to us the bath room and read my scriptures but then went back to bed
for a little while.  I showered and heated up some waffles for breakfast.  I
worked on my journal for a few minutes before going to High Priest Group
leadership meeting.  After getting home, Brother Probert called and asked if I
could meet with a member of the Bishopric for a minute.  He wanted to have Mae
there also but that wasn’t possible.  Bob prepared a nice dinner for the two of
us.  I went over at 12:30PM and visited with Brother Saunders.  They asked if
they could release Mae and I from our Family History calling, as they needed a
calling for someone else.  I said that it would be ok.  Meetings were very good
today.  Several asked about Mae.  After meetings, Bob and I went visiting to
Casey’s and Johnston’s.  I also took some cucumbers to Sister Fallis.  I fixed
me some super and watched part of a show on TV.  After taking the garbage out,
I called and talked to Mae.  I then finished today’s journal entry and soon
went to bed.</p>

woke shortly after 2am and didn’t sleep very well the rest of the night.  I
sure didn’t feel like getting up when the alarm went off, but I did.  While
checking out my bus I found fluid dripping from under the motor.  I took the
bus up top and had a mechanic come out and check it.  it is dripping diesel
fuel but Curt said it would be ok to make my run, but to bring it in when I
finished.  My run went well and I took the bus in for repair on my return to
the compound.  After getting home I visited with Bob and he is still trying to
get things cleaned up.  I suggested that he should again put anything that he
did not use on a table and have his children pick out anything they would like
and give the rest to the D.I.  I came downstairs and put some laundry into wash
and then took a nap.  When I woke up I started working on my 1970 – 74 Diary. 
My bus was repaired when I got back for the pm runs.  They went well.  When I
got home, I called Sandi as she had text me while I was driving bus.  She is
trying to decide if she should come here for some items Mae had bought her plus
get some vegetables from our garden, or have me meet her in Bountiful.  I told
her I was ok with whatever would work best for her.  I called Mae and talked to
her for a few minutes.  Bob then called me for dinner as he had prepared liver
and onions for us.  After dinner he and I watched a show, “Born to be Bad” with
Loretta Young and Gary Cooper staring.  It was an old movie, I believe it was
made in 1939.  David and his family stopped in and got a few vegetables from
the garden.  After they left, I watched part of a “Ponderosa” show on TV while
I folded the clothes I washed.  I finished the entries I made from my Diary and
my entry for today.</p>

to Northern Utah Dermatology, where David now works, and had Dr. David Browning
check several spots on both Bob and I.  Bob then bought me lunch at the
Chuck-A-Rama.  I took a nap after getting home and before I took my afternoon
run.  I had some bus trouble on my route this afternoon and so left it for the
shop to check out.  When I got home Dee’s had my car repaired.  Bob took me
back to get it.  I didn’t do much this evening.</p>

bus was not repaired when I got there this morning.  It took me 20 minutes or
more to find a spare bus to take.  That really put me behind and I think I
broke every speed limit getting my Jr. High to school on time.  On the way home
I stopped and bought some chicken feed.  I got me a little breakfast and fed
the chickens.  Bob and I then went to Centerville to the D.I. store looking for
suits.  We also took my boots to the repair shop in Kaysville on the way.  Bob
found him 1 suit but I didn’t find anything that fit me.  I took a nap after
getting home.  Sandi came out this evening and got some vegetables from the
garden.  It was sure good to help her and visit even for a few minutes.  Bob
had mowed part of the lawn before it rained on him.  It had left a lot of grass
bunched up on the front lawn, so I cleaned it up and fed it to the chickens.  I
watched the show “Splendor in the Grass” on TV before going to bed.  I had
never watched the ending of it before.  It seem to have made more since to see
it all the way through.</p>

got back to the compound, the Utah High Way Patrol was there to inspect the
buses.  That took another 45 minutes.  I fried some zucchini and eggs for Bob
and I, which we ate while watching a Hal Mark show on TV.  I called Mae this
morning but she didn’t answer, so I just left a message.  She called back this
afternoon and we visited for a while.  I sure miss her but is will be another
week before she comes home.  When I went to run my PM run I found that someone
had taken the spare bus that I was using.  I had to take another bus, #355.  It
was in worse shape that the one I was using and it was also very dirty.  When I
parked the bus at Central David Jr. High, I swept all the seats off and swept
the floors.  I made my run ok but was not happy that the bus I had by my name
was taken by someone else.  When I got home, Bob and I finished mowing the lawn
and picked up all the grass.  Bob prepared dinner for us after we finished that
job.  I have worked on my journal in between other things.  I watched some TV
shows also.</p>

I got home from the afternoon run I got my boat ready to go in the morning.  I
got me some dinner and watched some TV.  There wasn’t much to see so I worked
on my journal again.  I finished entering through July into my 1970 – 1974
Diary entrances.  This is certainly taking longer than I had expected to
transcribe the Diary over in my lap top computer.  It takes a lot of
corrections and enhancing to many of those short entrances.  I thought that I
would have time to watch a show on DVD before going to bed, but I am getting up
and going fishing with Randy in the morning so I had better get to bed.  I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
picked up Randy shortly after 6am.  We went up to East Canyon reservoir and got
started fishing at 8am.  As we traveled Randy told me of an accident he had. 
He was riding a horse when the horse stepped off into a canal.  Luckily that
the canal was almost empty and had several inches of mud in the bottom.  The
horse fell on him and in trying to get up the horse stepped on Randy’s chest.  It
was quite difficult launching the boat with the water so low.   The water is
the lowest that I have ever seen but we soon caught the first two fish.  The
next thing was that Randy had a strike.  I then realized that he was a sleep
and by the time I got him awake the fish was off.  Randy decided that he was too
tired and needed to take a nap.  I kept both poles going and caught 6 more fish
that I kept and one that I released.  I had several that I lost especially with
handling two poles at the same time and controlling the boat.  Randy woke
shortly after 11 and we soon each caught another, which filled our limit.  With
the water so low it was a challenge to get the boated loaded almost by
myself.   I then cleaned and filet the fish before we came home.  Although it
was quite a bit of work, I am still glad that I asked Randy to go with me. 
Just lessoning to his challenges gave me more determination to accept my
challenges.  I got home at 3:15pm and put the boat away.  I watched a cute show
on the Hall Mark channel and then followed another after that.  I am able to
get some things done, such as entering my journal, during the commercials.  Mae
and I called each other a couple of times this evening.  Hall Mark has plenty
of those.  At 10 PM I turned the TV off and went to bed.</p>

downstairs and finished a “Gun Smoke” show.  I worked on my journals again for
a while and then got ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
am run went well.  I didn’t figure out the bus heaters until between the two
runs.  After getting home I called and visited with Mae for a while.  I am sure
getting angus for her to come home tomorrow.  I wrote a letter to Blue Mountain
Arts, Inc. asking them I I could use the verse on their card to put into the
Ward News Letter.   Bob and I went down to West Point City offices and were
able to talk to Misty about the head stone for Sherrie’s grave.  I will have to
set the stone in a base and take the complete unit down, to set in the ground. 
That will be a little different than I had anticipated.  Bob and I stopped at
Pace drive-in and got fish sandwiches for lunch.  Although it tasted good it
sure bothered me the rest of the afternoon.  My pm runs went well although a
driver blocked me from leaving Central Jr. High for over 5 minutes, so that
make it hard to pickup that time.  I fueled my bus after returning to the
compound.  I took my car over to Dee’s shop and got there just as they were
closing.  I told him that I had three diagnostic lights that came on, all
relating to the brake system.  I was told that if I could bring it in tomorrow
morning and leave it, they would find and correct the problem.  I talked to Mae
a couple of times and found out that her plane would be getting in closer to
11:45am, so I will have to have Bob meet her at the airport tomorrow.  When I
got home and talked to Bob, he said that Eric and Cole will come tomorrow to
see the head stone for Sherrie.  Scott came about 6pm and worked on my
computer.  I had to leave before he got it finished as Bob and I had an
appointment with the Thurman’s for Home Teaching.  We also stopped at
Johnston’s just to check on them.  They are doing about as good as is
expected.  I think it will be a close raise to the grave yard.  I wanted to get
more done with house work this evening.  It is getting bed time so I will have
to try tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
had to have Bob follow me over to Dee’s where we left our car to have it
checked.  Bob then took me on to work.  My run went well and on my lay over,
between schools, I purchased a bouquet of fall flowers for Mae.  bob picked me
up at the shop and brought me home.  I got water into the house and
straightened up.  I also made up some posters and stuck up throughout the house
that reads, “Just to let you know that I Love and Missed you!!!!”.  I had Bob
go to the airport to pick Mae up as I was concerned with the timing of my
afternoon run.  I called Peterson Medical about my bill.  It looks like they
are billing me twice.  However, I didn’t realize that my insurance requires me
to rent the equipment for 3 months and then they will pay for it less a
co-pay.  Mae called me from the airport and asked if someone was going to pick
her up.  I told her that Bob was on his way.  Somehow they missed each other
and Bob finally found her and got home just as I was ready to leave for work. 
I did get to kiss her before going.  My run went well.  When I got home, Mae
and I got ready to attend the McFee’s son’s wedding reception.  After the
reception we went out to eat.  We stopped at Macy’s in Ogden to get a couple of
items and found that Brother Scott Mitchell is now a Pharmacist working there. 
We sure enjoyed the evening together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in until almost 9am so I had to hurry to make it to my meeting.  We
attended meetings as normal and then after we went up to Jeff and Gail’s.  We
enjoyed the evening with them.  While we were there, Gail commented that Mae
had sent all the children an e-mail about me giving her flowers when she came
home.  She then said that she sure appreciated that all my boys had sure taken
after my example.  It was a good feeling, I wish they would also take  after my
example in regards to the Gospel of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.   After
butting the children to bed we played a game of Rummy Cub and this time Gail
won and I lost.  I didn’t feel very well when we went to bed.</p>

didn’t feel the best but went to work anyway.  Mae had started tomatoes when I
got home.  I picked Mae another bucket full of tomatoes and then I went to
bed.  I slept for over three hours and then got up and took my pm route.  Mae
was through cooking the spaghetti sauce when I got home and was ready to bottle
it.  I helped her with the bottling and we got them ready to seal them.  We ate
dinner and while eating we watched a TV show.  Mae got 18 quarts of spaghetti sauce
preserved.  I used some of it on my dinner and it is very good.  </p>

didn’t sleep the best and so Mae went into the other bedroom to sleep.  I let
her sleep when I got up but she woke before I left.  I feel some better today
but was still very tired when I got home.  Dr. Bruce Porter, representing our
health insurance came on appointment at 9am and gave Mae a physical examination
and then when I got home he gave me a physical also.  He said and put it in his
report that we were both in very good health.  I took a nap again today.  Mae
went over to the Neiderhauser’s where she help Joanne can tomatoes.  They used
our pressure cooker and it went well although the pressure gage stuck of the
second batch and worried them.  After I finished my pm runs, I went to the
Rental company and checked on a lift to use to move Sherrie’s head stone in
place.  I was tired so we just watched two shows on BYUTV.  We called and sang
a Happy Birthday to Maddi and wished her a happy day.  </p>

day went about normal.  My runs went well, however the Principle at Whitesides
Elementary asked to talk to the children after they loaded the bus this
afternoon.  She said that a parent had called quite upset with some of the
children on the bus last night had shouted obsentitives and flipped her and her
daughter off as the hung their heads and arms out of the windows of the bus,
yesterday afternoon.  I have had a lot of trouble with some of the children and
have talked to them several times.  Mae has been busy all day getting ready for
the Sister Missionaries to come for dinner this evening.  She also went
shopping and visited with Dolley this afternoon.  After dinner Mae took the
Sisters back to their next appointment.  While she was gone I started cleaning
up.  We relax and watched a show on TV, before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke a little before the alarm went off so I got up.  Mae was not in bed and I
found that she had gone into the front room and was a sleep in the recliner.  I
did as much as I could to get ready without waking Mae.  When I went into the
front room Mae woke and I had her go into bed.  I got myself off and let her
sleep.  My am runs went well.  Mae made us some breakfast and then I took a
nap.  Scott came for lunch at 11am and we sure enjoyed having him.  I took Bob
with me and we purchased the materials to set Sherrie’s head stone.  The pm
runs went well and before coming home I went to Irven and Sandy’s.  They had
called me and are having some problems with their water softener is using too
much salt.  I have the take off for the lawn sprinkler on the wrong pipe and it
is coming after the softener.  I will have to reroute it on Saturday.  Mae had
dinner ready shortly after I got home.  We watched a movie on TV that I had
seen the last half of it while Mae was gone.  I didn’t care for it and wasn’t
going to watch it again, but I started almost at the first and it gave meaning
to the plot of the show.  I also watched a show of Bonanza that was good.  Mae
studied her lesson for Sunday while I watched the last show and wrote this
entry to my journal.  We soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was quite depressed this morning.  Work went about the same.  I am upset with
some of the children on the bus.  They are pulling the padding out of a couple
of the back seats.  I do not understand, what some children are thinks.  In
Between bus runs, I put the storm windows in the door today as it is turning
quite cold.  Mae and I also sliced pears and put them on the dryers.  This
evening Mae went to Jeff and Gail’s to tend their children while they went out
to dinner.  I stayed home and watched a show “Force 10 from Navarone” on TV. 
It was a war show similar to “Guns of Navarone” and I had never seen it
before.  I next watched the “Battle of Britton”, another World War II show. 
Mae didn’t get home until 9:45pm.  I finished writing a story for my personal
history before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                When
we got up I had more on my schedule than I can possibly complete.  That seems
to be common occurrence with me.  I decided that I would have to miss Mat’s
soccer game and let Mae attend it.  I started on the setting of Sherrie’s head
stone.  Jennifer,     , Irven and Sandy came over and removed their Raspberry
bushes.  Even with them doing it still took time.  Mae attended Relief Society
General Conference with some of the Sisters from our Ward.  Sandi came out to
get vegetables from the garden.  By that time I had the stone set in concrete
and so I was able to help her pick tomatoes.  We got her well over a bushel of
tomatoes plus some squash and peppers.  She and I then went out to eat at
Golden Corral.  I finished at concrete with a flash light, but it looks good. 
I had hurt my back when I first started this morning so I took a pain pill and
a mussel relaxer to keep going.  After coming in the house for the night I
tried to concentrate on my journal but couldn’t so I set down to watch a TV
show.  I couldn’t find anything that I was interested in.  Mae came home and I
was really out of it so she put me to bed.</p>

woke at 5am and was afraid that if I went back to bed I would wake Mae so I
slept in the recliner until almost 8am.  As today is the fifth Sunday of the
month, we didn’t have High Priest leadership today.  Mae is fasting before
giving her Sunday school lesson so I got me a couple of eggs on some toast.  I
worked on my journal for a little while before eating lunch with Bob.  Today
Elder Roger’s was able to speak in Sacrament meeting, as this is his last
Sunday here at home before he leaves for his Mission calling in Africa.  He
will be serving in the mission that David, our Grandson, was to serve in except
he was transferred due to civil unrest.  After meeting Mae went Visiting
Teaching to Sister Fallis.  Bob and I then went over to visit.  This evening
Mae and I went over to visit Scott and his family.  We were late getting back
and so late getting to bed.</p>

In between runs I went over to Irven and Sandy’s and rerouted the water for the
lawn sprinkler system.  They realized that I had put my take off from the wrong
line as their water softener is using a lot of salt.  I had some problems
finding where I could take the line off from as there is very little room to
get into.  On my bus runs I Have talked to both the Jr. High and the grade
school students about not pulling the padding from tear holes in the seat
covering.  I have been checking and feel pretty sure that the main damage is
coming from the Jr. High students.  This evening we watched some TV and enjoyed
being together.</p>
