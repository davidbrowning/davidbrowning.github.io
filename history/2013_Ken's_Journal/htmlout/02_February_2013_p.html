<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                 Being
that it is Friday, I didn’t have to go into work as early.  My AM run went
well.  After returning to the compound I went in and got Jana to help me with
printing my payroll W-2 form.  I was going to make a run in the car of new bus
route but I called Mae and she needs to be at Dr. Bennett’s by 10:30am.  I went
home and got her and then we drove the route.  We had trouble finding the first
stop at Ronald Ave. in Layton we then went to the @nd stop and questioned
that.  I went into a business on Cross Street and found that the bus did pickup
children just up the street from them.  We then went back West on Gentile and
finally found the Ronald Street.  We then went on to Mae’s appointment and
after that we finished the route.  We came back home and got a little to eat
before I went back to work and took the PM route.  It seemed different to know
that this would be my last day with these children and my assistant Kate.  I
cleaned out my bus after returning to the compound.  I then checked out my new
bus and found a few items that I wanted in my bus.  I got those from the supply
office.  I also found that the previous driver had made some changes to the
route time.  I went in and talked to Rosa about them and she said that they were
correct so use those times.   After dinner this evening I went to Randy’s for a
treatment.  He worked on me for almost three hours.  When he finished I felt
like I was laying there in pieces waiting for me to pull back together.  We
tried to find something on TV to watch but there isn’t much there.</p>

slept in until about 8AM and then took showers.  After breakfast we went to the
Bountiful Temple.  Ae called Georgia and they are going to the temple also. 
Rick is going for training as he has been called to serve as a Veil Worker. 
Georgia went through an endowment session with Mae and I.  After leaving the
Temple the four of us went to Chuck-A-Rama to eat.  We were there quite a while
and then Mae and I went over to Georgia and Rick’s home to see the new upgrades
to their kitchen and dining area.  They have replaced the floor covering in the
dining, kitchen, laundry and small bathroom areas.  They changed the island
cabinet top and replaced the stove and dishwasher.  It really looks nice.  We
had fun visiting with them.  We then came home and changed clothes before going
to Tyler’s basketball game.  Tonight the Morgan team lost the game.  When we
got home we watched the show on DVD “radio”.  It was taken from a true story and
was very good.  It has been a great day being with Mae, although we were tired.</p>

woke up at 4:30AM and was afraid that I would wake Mae if I went back to bed,
so I came into the front room and went to sleep in the recliner.  I woke a few
minutes after 8AM and found that Mae had also just got up.  I had to hurry to
be at my 9AM meeting.  We were busy getting ready for our Family History class
and I also prepared a lesson for the High Priest class.  I had forgotten that I
was to conduct and give the lesson today.  Our classes went very well today.  I
was able to finish my lesson in the High Priest and get over to help Mae and
Sister Mc Entire set up for the Family History class.  When the class finished
we just put our equipment in the Family History room and lock the door.  This
saved us time to get to Sacrament meeting on time.  During the testimony
section of Sacrament meeting I bore my testimony.  All the others that bore
testimony did a very good job.  After meeting we packed up our equipment and
came home.  When we got home I realized that we had left our speakers and
amplifier at the church, so I went back and got those.  Bob had prepared liver
and onions for dinner and fried chicken for Mae.  After dinner Mae and I
cleaned up and then came downstairs and took a short nap.  She and I played
three games of “Knock” with Mae winning two out to the three games.  We both
worked on our journals before going to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep well last night so I let her sleep in.  My run went fairly well
this morning.  After getting home I got on the computer to get information for
my driver license renewal.  By paying then, I could preregister plus get some
other help.  I entered the information but then got to a point where I couldn’t
go any farther.  About that time Bob came down with a letter about his
Time-Share program.  We made some calls about it and got an appointment to talk
to a representative that would help him get out of the contract.  We connected
by phone and the internet and I finally turned it over to Mae as I cannot write
at the same time I am being given additional information.  Mae has that ability
so I let her take over.  Before the whole thing was over I had to leave for the
PM run.  That run went well but I did miss turning on Angel Street and so I was
late getting to Snow Horse elementary.  Mae told me when I got home that Bob
paid the company to get him out of the contract.  I hope it is the right
choice.  We were both tired this evening so we tried to find a show to watch on
TV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
run went well all though a girl reported that another girl had been restricted
from the bus because she had harassed her.  After the run I talked to Rosa
about the situation and she told me to speak to her and see if the principle
had restricted her?  If so, the principle is the only one that can reinstate
her.  After getting home I started checking on the internet registering for my
driver’s license and found out that the online sight that I had gone to was not
in any connected with the Utah State Driver’s License Division.  I called my
bank and they suggested that we cancel our Debit/Credit card and they would
send us a new card and pen number.  He also said that with the information I
had given they now had access to our account.  He stopped all future activities
on that card and after a couple of days go into our branch and ask them to
start collection on fraudulent charges to get reimbursement on what was
charged.  The one good thing is, it was for only $14.00 and not a large amount.
 I decided to go to Brigham City to renew my driver’s license.  Mae said that
this time of day I should be able to get right in the Farmington office.  That
way I could take her to tend Mishelle’s children while she rested.  We went
that way and when I got to the Farmington office there was barley standing room
and it would take at least two hours.  I got Sub-Way sandwich’s for us and we ate
those on the way home.  I took a nap before going back.  May PM run went well. 
I stopped after the run and got on the computers there and put in a request for
the 1<sup>st</sup> of March off.  There were a couple of others there that were
having trouble getting their W-2 forms off.  I told them what I could but then
just had to wish them luck with the password.  Mae had a very good homemade
chicken and vegetable soup about ready for dinner. We had her homemade bread
with it and it made a great dinner.  I had a headache so took some pain pills
and took a nap.   I worked on my journals for a couple of hours before we went
to bed.  Mae has worked several hours on her life history today.</p>

both slept fairly well last night and were able to get up and get busy.  Mae
cooked waffles for breakfast and those are always delicious and welcomed.  My
run went well although Rosa called me to come into her office concerning some
problems with the Jr. High run.  The problem has escalated until one of the
students went into the Principle and told him that as the driver, I know of the
problems but wouldn’t do anything about it.  I went to Brigham City to renew my
CDL Drivers License.  That went well and I passed the written test.   After
loading the students on the bus this afternoon I pulled the bus to the side of
the parking lot and had a talk with them.  I told that that I had been
instructed to write up a report on any problems and take it into him
personally.  I also told them that not only would I write up any incidences but
those that were involved would also go into the office with me along with the
recorded disk from the bus monitor system.  I also told them that if they had
feeling towards any one then they needed to move to another seat.  I hope this
will put an end to this problem.  Other than that my runs went very well
today.  I turned in my receipt for reimbursement on the expense of the driver’s
license to the office before coming home.   After dinner I tried to find
something worth watching on the TV but watched the end of Gun Smoke and then
turned it off.  I printed some time schedules for my bus runs.  Bryan Louw came
by and replaced some parts on the T-Zone vibration machine.  He was here about
½ hour to 45 minutes and it cost us $150.00.  He suggested that I could use it
by laying on my back on the floor with my legs on the rocker and running it at
10 to 15 speed.  He also suggested that I should lift my but off the floor. 
Also put a pillow under my head.  Doing it this way would help relax my legs
and relieves the sciatic nerves.  I am going to try it.</p>

didn’t sleep well last night so I let her sleep in and I got myself off to
work.  My bus runs went very well this morning although the fog was very
heavy.  I stopped at the railroad crossing on Gentile, opened the door and
window, hit the noise suppression and looked both ways.  I sis not see or hear
anything and so proceeded to cross when almost the same time I put the bus in
motion, the red lights began to flash but I continued across.  Mae was up
getting ready to go up to Kim and Jeanenne’s home to get all their things out
of the upstairs rooms and stored in the basement.  I guess Sharlene, Jeanenne’s
sister, is planning on locking the basement so that no one can go down there. 
My only concern is not having anyone able to check on items in the basement
such as the furnace and water heater.  My PM run went well except when I pulled
into the bus loop at Snowhorse I could smell something burning.  I checked the
bus and we put all the windows.  It didn’t take very long to get the worst of
it out of the bus.  We finished loading and took the children home.  After all
the children were unloaded I again checked the bus but still found nothing.  I
hurried home as Mae had dinner waiting.   At 5PM we picked up Brother Francom and
went to the Bountiful Temple.  We had 7 from our ward that attended the temple
tonight, maybe there was some during the day.  We went right to bed when we got
home.</p>

woke early thinking about my bus and the smoke that filled the insides
yesterday.  I decided to go in early to check it out further.  Mae hadn’t slept
the best last night so I let her sleep in and I got myself off to work.  I
checked everything out on the bus, drove it around for a little while and then
went in and visited with a mechanic.  He had me bring the bus up and he checked
it but could not find anything wrong.  We assume that one of the heater fans
became jammed and heated up, although they are all working now.  After
finishing the AM run and getting home, Mae and I went over to the Aquatic
Center and exercised for a couple of hours.  After my PM run I turned my weekly
trip record into the office, I met the original driver of the route.  She asked
me about the problems I had at the first of the week with the two girls. 
Before I left I told her of the problem of the fan heating up.  She said that
she had problems with the heater just behind the emergency exit door but they
thought they had fixed it.  I will have to remember that in the future.  I had
no problems on either AM or PM runs.  When I got home Mae had taken Venla Reed
to an appointment with her Doctor.  I called her as it was snowing quite hard. 
They we just finishing and ready to come home.  The traffic was getting bad but
the roads weren’t yet bad.  She was soon home.  We had dinner and then I took a
nap.  Mae got working on her histories and let me sleep for at least 45
minutes.  We watched the DVD segments that we will use in our lesson Sunday.  We
then watched a show on DVD “Member the Titans” and really enjoyed it although
we have seen it before.  It is a show worth seeing over.  I sure enjoy being
with my sweet wife.</p>

When we got up Mae started preparing food to go to Mike and Becky’s for David’s
Home Coming.  I prepared breakfast of egg omelets.  We seem to have kept busy
until it was time to go to the Salt Lake airport to greet David as he returned
home from his mission in Africa.  There was quite a few of us there.  After the
Airport we all went up the Chuck-A-Rama on 4<sup>th</sup> South and 7<sup>th</sup>
East.  Mae and I drove from there to Georgia and Rick’s.  They had two other
couples that were coming over for dinner and then going to the Dance.  While
they ate we changed clothes.  We enjoyed visiting and getting acquainted.  The
music was played by a disk jockey but he had good music and the decorations
were very good.  We enjoyed it but got tired and went home about 9:30PM.  At
the tables there was placed little Valentine cards you could fill out and give
to your Sweetheart.  Both Mae and I filled one out.  It was interesting that
after filling it out, we both; without seeing the others card; wrote the
addressing the same “My Eternal Sweethart”.   We were tired and went right to
bed.</p>

Centerville and road the rest of the way with them.  The roads we wet but not
slippery so we made good time and got there in plenty of time.  David did a
very good job with his report.  After church we went to Mike and Becky’s to
visit and for lunch.  Becky had everything ready and served a very nice lunch. 
We left Mike’s about noon and got home in time to pick up our equipment and get
to the church before our class was to start.  The class went well and as we
ended it we just moved our equipment into the Family History room.  We made it
on time for Sacrament meeting.  I was asked to give the opening prayer.  After
Sacrament meeting we attended choir practice, then picked up our equipment and
went home.  Bob had dinner about ready so we help with the finishing and ate.

again this morning.  I wasn’t able to get back to sleep.  Mae also woke early
but tried to get up without waking me.  She didn’t come back to bed so that
kept me awake.  I finally set up two minutes before the alarm was to go off.  I
waited and it worked ok.  Mae got breakfast and started the washing while I
took my shower.  My AM run went very well.  After getting home I got on our
external hard drive and found Mae’s PAF file that she thought she had lost.  I
spent a lot of time getting the PAF program downloaded but we now have that
information for her.  We had lunch and then we took a short nap.  We got our
new DEBIT cards today, we are still thankful that we didn’t lose a lot more
than we die on the identity scam.  I went in a little early this afternoon and
checked on the computer to be sure that I got the day off on March 1.  I also
got a light replaced on my bus.  My PM run went very well.  We got a copy of an
E-Mail from Shellie to Quint.  Some news that was especially exciting is that
Nora is expecting a baby about August 19 to 28<sup>th</sup> .  Mae told me that
we had been charged $50.00 extra for the work we had done on our equipment.  I
called Billing and told them that I didn’t feel that the charge was right as
they had given us equipment that was incompatible and a service man had to come
to find that out.  They removed $35.00 from our bill, so I accepted that.  Mae
has been working on her history and asked for my help.  We got involved in that
and forgot the time.  We wanted to watch a show on KBYU, “American Ride” that
started at 7PM but we didn’t turn it on until 7:15PM.  It is a very interesting
show about American History.  After the show, we went back to Mae’s history and
worked on it until almost 9:30PM.  I finished this entry and we went to bed.</p>

I was showering Mae came in.  I told her that I could get myself off but she
said that she slept long enough.  She took long enough to wash my back and then
went in and started breakfast.  Because of that I had Hot Cakes instead of cold
cereal.  Mae is such a special wife and sweetheart.  My AM run went well
although when I did my pre-check the coolant was low so I stopped at the shop
and had a mechanic fill the reservoir.  It was 9:30AM when I got home.  I laid
down and took a nap.  Mae wrapped the electric blanket around my feet so they
got warm.  I slept for almost an hour.  Mae has been very wrapped up with
getting her personal histories written.  Sometimes she is almost obsessed with
it.  I have got most of my important information backed up on our external hard
drive now.  I now need to backup Mae pictures on the external hard drive and
then if anything should happen to our lap top, we would have a backup.  We
tried to find something on TV but the shows are so full of advertisements that
it spoils the show.  I worked on journal entries and found some of Mae’s write
ups of friends in the Philippines and so transferred them to the other
computer.  It is now late so we will go to bed. </p>

Bountiful.  She had to drive him back because the Dr. dilated his eyes.  I took
a short nap and then made my PM run.  It went well with many students being
taken home by their parents who are starting an early long weekend.  Before
coming home I stopped and got the car washed and vacuumed.  We needed it clean
for the trip Saturday to Fillmore for Aunt Joy’s 90<sup>th</sup> Birthday
party.  After dinner Mae went to bed while I went Home Teaching with Bob.  We
visited with Isaac Casey our normal very short visit from the door step, I
wonder if we will ever get any further with them.  We then visited with
Patriarch and Sister Johnston.  We were there almost 1 ½ hours but we have a

straight over to Dee’s Auto Repair where Mae was waiting for me.  Dee is going
to service, inspect and register the Buick for us.  After getting home I worked
on some thoughts concerning Rich.  That took most of my time between AM and PM
bus runs.  Fridays are an early out day for grade schools so the elementary
schools have to be taken home before the Jr. High students.  I did go into work
½ hour early by accident so I used the extra time to wash my bus.  The PM runs
went well.  When I got home I had Bob take me to get my car.  I then went to
the D.I. to drop off a few items Mae wanted to get rid of.  I then went to J.

very nice dinner prepared.  After eating we visited and played “Trans America”,
which they enjoyed.  It has been a wonderful evening being together with them. 
We have had some memorable experiences together with them.  The Shaw’s left a
little after 9PM as Vivian has 200 cupcakes to make for a Grand Daughter’s
Birthday Party tomorrow.  We watched a J.A.G. serious before going to sleep.</p>

both slept ok last night.  I got up before 7AM as I need to go to the church
house to set up our equipment before 9AM.  I got there at 8:40AM and was able
to get the equipment ready .  I went to the High Priest Leadership meeting at
9AM.  I for home before 10AM and we left for Bountiful by 10:15AM.  We had time
to visit with Grenn and Kathleen and then we visited with Karen and Charles
Hire.  Both Kathleen and Grenn gave wonderful talks.  We stopped at Grenn and
Kathleen’s home for a few minutes but had to hurry to get back to our Ward in
time to give our Lesson.  Time worked out just right and we accomplished all we
needed to.  We had some dinner and I took a short nap.  We went over to Jeff
and Gail’s where we played one game of Harts.  Gail’s mother was also there. 
The game was very close but after playing until almost 10PM Gail had the
highest score by only a very small spread.  When we got home I entered this
journal entry before we went to bed.</p>

slept in as today is President’s day.  That is enough for that because I have
very strong feeling of admiration for President George Washington and President
Abraham Lincoln.  I think it’s a shame on our country that we combined the Day
of Celebration each of them.  Any way we have had a good morning.  Mae and I
worked together to prepare turkey bacon, scrambled eggs, served with waffles,
topped with frozen fruits, almond butter and yogurt.  What a breakfast we
enjoyed.  We received a couple of very thrilling e-mails from Kaleesee.  We
also received a dis-hearting e-mail from David.  Mae has been preparing things
to go to Mike and Becky’s to tend their girls.  She didn’t get away until
almost 2PM and she had wanted to leave by 1:15PM at the latest.  I worked on my
1970 – 1974 Diary entries.  Bob had me come up and we watched a couple of
movies that he had recorded.  It is now 9PM and this house seems very lonely
already with out Mae.</p>

came home and took a half hour nap and then wrote a letter to Utah Senator
Scott K Jenkins and State Representative Paul Ray about my feelings on HB 255
that is being voted on February 22<sup>nd</sup>.  I don’t know if it will do
any good or not but I encouraged both to vote against it.  My PM run went well
and when I got home I fixed some dinner and ate while watching a show on TV.  I
worked on my 1971 – 1974 journals getting only two days interred.  I then
watched another series of the Ponderosa and entered this entry before going to
bed.  I was debating on staying up late to watch another western show but when
it came on it was rated R, so I just turned it off.</p>

me to do my annual driving review, and that went well also.  Shellie called me
and they still want to use our car and drive up to the Trail Canyon Lodge on
Thursday, which should work out ok.  I talked to Mae a couple of times this
morning and she is doing fine.  I visited with Bob and I also called the
Brigham City Temple about doing Initiator’s tomorrow.  They said that we could
come whenever we would like.  Bob is going to go with me so that we can
complete the names in about an hour.  I called and left a message for Rick
asking if he had received my e-mail.  After eating lunch, I took a short nap
and when I woke I felt that I was had to hurry to get to work.  It wasn’t until;
when I arrived at the school and there was no other busses in the bus loop that
I suddenly realized that I was one hour early.  Not wanting everyone else to
realize my mistake I drove the bus back to Inter Mountain Farmers and parked
there until time to pick up the students.  The afternoon run went well.  When I
got home Bob invited me to eat with him.  Later; I worked on my 1970 – 1974
Diary as well as watched a movie on TV.  Mae called me before she went to bed. 
I sure miss her and will be glad when she comes home.  Good night!</p>

10 minutes late but it came out ok.  When I got home I quickly showered and
changed clothes.  Bob was ready to go as soon as I was ready.  We went to the
Brigham City Temple and performed the Initiatory Ordinances for 16 male
ancestors of Linda Heydorn.  It was a very special time.  We stopped at a
Sub-Way on the way home for a sandwich.  I got a short nap before taking my PM
run.  When I got home Bob had dinner ready.  After eating I came down stairs
and watched a TV show and wrote this Journal entry.  I also called and visited
with Mae.  She will be home tomorrow and I’m sure am excited about that. 
Before going to bed I played a game of Spider Solitary and won the game in 100
moves.  That is the leased moves that either Mae nor I have ever done.</p>

decided to go to Costco in Ogden.  I reset the timer and went back to sleep. 
Again my phone buzzed and went to the answering message.  I let that call go

didn’t get there until after 1PM.  I had told Jeff that he and Ben should go
on, as they wanted to go skiing.  I told Jeff that I would tend the children
until Gail and Mae got home.  Just as they were ready to load things into the
car, Gail and Mae came home.  We got Jeff and Ben off and then Mae and I came

spoke on preparedness.  Both gave excellent talks and very sound advice.  Mae
