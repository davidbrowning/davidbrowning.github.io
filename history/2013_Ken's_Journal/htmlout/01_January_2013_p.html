and I slept in Jeff and Gail’s bed last night.  We didn’t get up until 8:40am. 
By the time we were ready to go out with the rest of the family David and his
and Mike and his family were already here.  Jeff, David and Mike were starting
breakfast, so I started helping them.  Scott’s family soon arrived and by the
time everyone was ready we men had biscuits, gravy and scrambled eggs ready. 
It really worked very smoothly and everyone had all they could eat.  It was
really a fun morning.  Games were played and a lot of visiting and
storytelling.  Some of the Browning Story’s keep growing the more times they
are told.  Most of the family stayed until afternoon and then we helped clean
things up and started leaving.  Garrett and I had a game of chess this
afternoon.  It was a very close and enjoyable game and I finally was able to
check mate him but the game went for 1 hr 45 minutes before I won.  Mae and I
stayed until evening before coming home.  I finished 2012 journal and interred
this entry.  Bob came down and he and I visited for a while.  Mae was tired and
so we went to bed about 10PM.</p>

got up about 8AM and had to hurry to get breakfast and over to the Tanner
Clinic before 9:45AM.  We had an appointment with Dr. Larsen who after checking
the incisions gave me a letter of clearance to go back to work on Jan 7<sup>th</sup>. 
We then went over to the Clearfield Aquatic Center and signed up to start
exercising there, using out insurance program.  We then went to Kent’s grocery
shopping.  As we were checking out, the clerk noticed Mae’s ear rings, except
she was missing one.  We checked around the store but didn’t find.  We checked
around the car but still didn’t find it.  I had Mae call the Aquatic Center and
they found it where we checked in.  We went back and got it from them.  We
stopped for a Sub-Way sandwich for lunch and took it home to eat.  After lunch
we took a nap, except Mae let me sleep for quite a while.  I went upstairs and
put some medication in Bob’s eye for him.  I then help him change the mattress
on his bed.  Mae and I also changed the sheets on the bed in the guest room. 
They are now ready for Shellie, Jace, Garrett and Nora to come tomorrow.   I
spent some time filling capsules with Ambortose and Phyt-Aloe dietary
supplement.  We save quite a bit by buying the powder in bottles and then
filling capsules with it.  </p>

woke up at 6AM and read my scriptures.  As I read the teachings of Paul I can’t
help feeling very inadequate as to the blessings the Lord has given me. 
Sometimes I sure feel like I am tired.  Mae got up at 7 and did her exercises. 
We are expecting Shellie and her family this morning so I will work on my
journals for a while.  I had to take the letter from Dr. Larson into Sherie at
the bus compound.  It wasn’t until afternoon that they came.  Shellie, Nora,
Mae and I played “Trans America” and then Garrett and Nora went out for the
evening.  We got Jase to play “Farkel” with Mae, Shellie and I.  Jase won the
game.  Mae prepared a very nice dinner.  We again played games and when Garrett
and Nora returned they joined us.  We ended up with Mae, Shellie and I playing
a game of rook, I won.  Garrett worked on solving the puzzle that he made me
for Christmas and he did it once and then showed us a second time.  It can be
done!  It’s after mid-night before we got to bed.</p>

early and had breakfast well under way.  Bob served us Breakfast at 8AM,
biscuits, gravy and fried potatoes.  It was really good.  Mae and I went over
to the spa and was shown most of the equipment.  When we got home Garrett had
gone snowboarding at Briton.   Mae, Shellie, Nora and I went to Salt Lake and
went to the Temple.  We all enjoyed the session.  This was Nora’s first time to
the Salt Lake Temple and a live session.  After the session we went out to eat
at Chuck-A-Rama in Bountiful.  We stopped on the way home and bought a pizza for
Jase.  Garrett got home a little before we did.  He had a good time on the ski
run.  There was plenty of food for him to warm up in the fridge.  After getting
home Nora, Shellie, Mae and I played a game of Rook.  Mae and Shellie won but
Nora and I put up a good fight.  Mae got things ready for breakfast in the

back to bed and slept another hour.  Mae started putting Christmas away, so I
brought the storage bens in and then I started butchering chickens.  I butchered
all 13 chickens, cleaned up my mess and but the tools away.  Mae had all the
Christmas decorations packed, so we hauled all that out to the storage shed. 
We were finished before 5PM.  It was cold but I was able to dress warm.  Mae
got some hot soup ready for us for dinner.  We then got things ready for Irven,
Sandy, Bryce and Deanna to come this over evening .  We played games and
visited until 11PM.  After they left we cleaned us.  Mae then gave me a haircut
and we showered and went to bed.  It was after mid-night before we turned the
light off, both being very tired.</p>

noon but no one was there.  I called and found out that we were going to meet
at 11AM so I missed it.  I came back and took Mae to church at 1PM.  Meeting
went well and Mae and I stayed for choir practice.  Bob had a nice dinner ready
when we got home.  When I came downstairs, I was cold so I cuddled up with a
blanket on the recliner and went to sleep.  Mae let me sleep for about 30
minutes.  We did watch most of a cute show on TV.  Grant came over and the two
of us administered to Bob as he will have cataract surgery on the left eye, in
the morning.  It is 9:30PM so we had better get to bed as Mae will take Bob to
the hospital and I will return to bus driving tomorrow.</p>

got up at 5AM as Mae will drive Bob to the hospital this morning, getting there
at 6:30AM.  I don’t have to leave until after 7AM so I will work on my journals
for a few minutes.  Well I goofed as I was to left at 6:45AM, so I was late
getting to my bus and then the bus wouldn’t start as it was so cold.  We were
behind but before I ended at the schools we came close to catching up.  I guess
I broke a few speed limits.  Other than that my routes went ok.  One pre-school
boy changed from Morgan Elementary to Kaysville Elementary so that caused some
problems that I will try to make some changes on that.  After my morning route
I went up to Dee’s Auto Service and checked on the cost to install a new trunk
lid latch.  They figured it would be about $45.00 Mae had taken Bob to the
hospital in Bountiful for eye surgery, removing a cataract from the left eye. 
She was home before I got here. .  When I got home we ate lunch and then we
took a nap.    I ordered the latch for the Buick from Young’s Chevrolet in
Layton.  At first they quoted $379.00 but they changed the price when I told
them that I could get it through Murdock Chevrolet for $303.00, they said that
they would match that price.  I went with them as they are closer.  Their
installation price was also over double the price that Dee’s gave me, so I will
have Dee install it.  I also got Bob’s Caption phone corrected so that it now
works.  It was interesting that when I called the service company they had to
get my permission to get on my computer by remote and correct the problem with
Bob’s phone.  Of course Bob’s caption is hooked through our internet service. 
On the way home this afternoon I fueled the car.  When I got home this evening,
Mae had dinner ready.  After dinner I took another nap.  We then worked on our
lesson for Sunday.  Mae and I then read for a little while in the book “The
American Covenant” by Timothy Ballard.  I added this journal entry and worked
on my 1970-74 journals also.  We started preparing for bed shortly after 9PM,
trying to get to bed so we get enough sleep before I go to work.</p>

AM route went well.  When I got home I started thawing the chickens.  I am sure
it will take at least a day.  Mae took Bob back into his Dr. just for him to
check his eye.  It is keeping Mae rather busy with the Dr. and Hospital Trips
and putting drops in his eyes.  I cleaned up the dishes and then roasted some
almonds and made some almond butter.  I had just finished when Mae came home. 
She had me take a nap.  I told her to let me sleep for 15 to 20 minutes, but
she let me sleep over 30 minutes.  My PM run also went well.  This evening we
started to watch a movie we got from NETFLEX but it was so dumb that we
switched to one of ours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
finishing my AM run, I went over to Young Chevrolet and picked up the trunk
lock for the Buick.  I thought about the price for that lock and the cost that
it will be to have it installed and we are paying more for it than what I paid
for my first car.  In 1956, I purchased a 1952 Chevrolet 4 door, for $375. 
That is quite a difference because of inflation, in 57 years.  When I got home
I got the chickens ready and put them in roaster ovens.  I then took a nap. 
When I woke up, I worked on my journals.  Mae had gone to visit Dolly for a few
minutes.  The chicken’s were cooked before I left for my PM run, so we just
turned them off and let them cool.  I went to the Work Care Clinic before going
to the bus shop.  I got a form for Dr. Lee to fill out about my Sleep Apnea
test study done a couple of weeks ago.  The PM run went well and when I got
home, Mae and I stripped the chicken meat from the carcasses.  We then ground
the meat and packaged it for freezing.  We did eat dinner and watched two shows
of “Touched by An Angle”.  Mae has been taking care of Bob’s medical needs
along with all else she does.  She is sure a busy gal and I sure love her.  I
remembered that I hadn’t helped Bob put his Christmas Decorations away so I
quickly did that.</p>

morning but I hated to get up, although I woke without the alarm, because I
forgot to set it.  After my AM run I took our car to Dee’s Auto Shop for him to
install the new trunk latch.  Mae met me there with the pickup and we went to
Dr. Lee where he froze 4 spots on my left ear and filled out a form on my sleep
apnea for UDOT.  While there Mae got a flu and pneumonia shots.  We stopped and
got a Sub-Way for lunch on the way home.  After getting home we took a nap and
then I worked on 2013 Christmas card list.  Dee hadn’t called me before it was
time to leave for the PM run.  Just as we left the bus shop it started to
snow.  The snow really came down and it soon had traffic really moving slowly. 
We made fairly good time until the last three children and then the roads
really got bad.  It took us an extra 1 ½ hours to finish our run.  I hope that
Kate was able to get home ok as she has to go clear up to hwy 89.  After
getting home I cleared our walks and driveway, doing most of it with the snow
blower.  I finished and came in.  I got warn and then ate some dinner.  We
turned the TV o and I watched BYU play LA.  The first half LA lead by 5 points
but BYU came back in the 2 half and won over 20 points.  I visited with Bob for
a few minutes and then came downstairs and entered my journal.  We then went to
bed.</p>

woke at 5:15AM with the alarm and got up.  I turned on the radio to KSL, trying
to get a report as to school closer or not.  I finally called dispatch and they
told me that they had just received a call confirming that all Davis County
schools would be closed due to weather conditions.  We then went back to bed
and had just about got back to sleep when at 6AM the phone rang.  A recorded
message stated that “Do to weather conditions; all schools in Davis County
would be closed.”  I found out later that that message went to everyone house
hold of anyone that was affiliated with Davis County Schools.  We slept in and
then got up and had a very nice breakfast.  I hadn’t worried about cleaning the
driveway and sidewalks, figuring that I had most of the day.  Then about 9AM I
heard shovels on the sidewalk.  I looked out and there was Brother Taylor
cleaning off the back walk.  I went out and told him he didn’t need to do
that.  He said “Well, you just got over an operation.”  I told him that the
Doctor told me that I was totally ok and I could do anything that I could do
before.  I then used the snow blower to just finish up.  I noticed a bolt
missing on the snow blower.  Mae and I then went over to the Clearfield Aquatic
Center and worked out for a couple of hours.  We picked up our car from Dee’s. 
He had it repaired and ready to go and he really did a good job.  He only
charged us $33.00 compared to other quote of over $90.00.  I bought the parts
for the snow blower.  After repairing it I then went over and help Mike, or
neighbors to the west, do his driveway.  He had shoveled almost half of the
drive but hadn’t got the entrance to the drive.  I finished the snow removal
for him.  He expressed his appreciation, as his four wheeler isn’t working for
him to use.  This afternoon Mae and I went to the movie “Lincoln”.  It was
really very good but they did put in some of the vulgar language.  The war
seines were also very graphic but realistic.  It sure left us with a great
appreciation for what that great man did.  After the movie we went to eat at
the Golden Corral and sure enjoyed that.  After getting home we watched another
short movie on TV.</p>

to clean the walks and driveway.  Just as I started Brother Rogers and his
children were just unloading their snow blower to do my snow removal for me.  I
told them that I was ok to do it.  He again referred to my operation and I
assured him that I was ok.  After doing my walks and driveway, I went over to
Mike’s and cleaned his.  He again came out and expressed his appreciation.  We
visit for a while.  When I came in I worked on my journals.  I am not very fast
at rewriting from my original diary but there is enough in those few lines that
jogs my memory and then I can add some detail.  I spent most of the afternoon
putting in 8 pages which represent 24 days.  Mae also found a history written
by Bertha Crandal, my Grandmothers sister.  There were some pages that were
missing from that history and they might have been the part which my mother
told me about.  Bertha had kept a daily journal of my Great-Grandfather’s
flight from the charges of living in co-habitation.  He was trying to get his families
to Mexico for safety.  After getting the families to safety, he sent his first
wife back to Utah while he stayed and built a home and made provisions for the
second wife and family, and then he returned to Utah, never returning to the
second wife and family.  After the first family returned to Utah, some members
of the family became concerned that the law might get hold of the journal that
Bertha had kept and it was decided that that history should be burned.  This
information was told to be my mother.  To back-up these things we did some
research into the genealogy of my Great-Grandfather Hyrum Oscar Crandal.  We
also watched two shows of Madlock on TV and read the last half of “The Life and
Ministry of Lorenzo Snow”, having already read the first half.  We then read
the Chapter 1, Learning by Faith, of the Priesthood and Relief Society study
manual for this years.  It was late when we got to bed.</p>

trouble getting the DVD to work, plus we went overtime as I didn’t hear the
bells.  Mae and I stayed after Sacrament meeting for choir practice.  Bob had a
nice dinner about ready when we got home.  Mae and I worked on our journals
this evening.  The weather is very cold today with a high of 13 deg. and a low

the hospital at 6:30AM for the operation to remove cataract on the right eye. 
I went into work about 6:35AM as I was concerned that my bus wouldn’t start.  I
was right.  Someone had tried to start my bus, but I don’t know who.  They were
not successful and neither was I.  I called in for a mechanic to help and
dispatch said to just take another bus.  Well there wasn’t a spare around that
someone hadn’t tried to start and had failed.  I just waited until a mechanic
was free to jump my bus.  When Kate came I had her start calling students to
let them know that we would be late.  I helped where I could to get buss out from
being stuck from the snowplow plowing a bank of snow behind the busses.  One
bus driver had been able to get her bus to start but when she tried to get out
the bus slid sideward and almost hit the bus in the next stall.  One of the
mechanics hooked on with a tow truck and pulled the back of the bus sideward’s
and then he was able to pull forward and get it backed out.  I had Kate go into
the lunch room and wait until I called her.  I couldn’t see any reason for her
to wait out in the cold.  I just waited for my turn to be jumped and then the
mechanic had to use starter fluid before it would finally start up.  We were 1
hour late getting to our first stop.  Kate told me that we only had 3 children
to pick up as the rest were taken to school by their parents.  We had to run
most of the rout because of the locations of the 3 we had to pickup.  When we
returned to the compound I went in and rescheduled the bus for service.  I
talked to a mechanics about the need for a new block heater but there isn’t
much that can be done as there are many buses that need new block heaters.  I
then met with Sherrie about some rout changes, but as we made the corrections,
one of my children came up missing.  We didn’t solve that but Sherrie will work
on that.  I went to put my extra time into the computer but my pass word had
expired, so I tried to change that ane I guess I hit the wrong key and the
program froze up(maybe it got to cold like the busses!) any way it took me
several minutes to get that done.  It was 11:30AM before I got home.  What a
morning!  Mae beat me home with Bob.  After I told her of this morning, she
said, “I have another one for you.”  Irven had called with a problem of their
water distiller freezing.  I called him and found that they had left the door
open and that is what let his unit freeze.  I told him how to set a light up to
thaw the distiller.  Mae and I ate lunch and then took a nap.  I then help Mae
and we rotated our mattress and made the bed.  It was time to go back to the
bus compound.  Time sure went fast.  The PM run went well but I am concerned
about the bus in the morning.  I plugged a light into the cord and made sure
that I had power there, before I plugged the bus block heater in.  We will
see!  Bob is concerned that they may have given him a flu shot because he isn’t
feeling well.  I called and visited with David about it and he feels sure that
they wouldn’t when he told them that he didn’t take flu shots as he takes a
reaction to them.  David said that we could ask the Doctor and he could check
the record in the computer.  Gail called Mae and said that their cold water is
frozen between the furnace room and the kitchen.  I gave them some suggestions
but by 7:30PM they hadn’t worked.  I visited with Jeff and gave him some more
suggestions, so he will try that.  He later called back and we talked again. 
We came up with a couple more ideas and we will see what happens by morning. 
Mae and I did some reading for our F.H.E. although we had several
interruptions.  We started to bed shortly after 9PM.</p>

didn’t sleep much last night.  She woke at mid-night and hadn’t gone back to
sleep when my alarm went off at 5AM.  She got breakfast and then went back to
bed.  I left for work at 6:30AM so that I would have more time to get my bus
started.  When I got there the maintenance department already had my bus
running and the heaters were already putting out warm air.  That was sure
nice.  My AM run went well with all the children going today.  When I got home,
Mae had just got up.  We had a snack and then I laid down for a nap.  Mae had
just received a phone call from her cousin Joy, so I forgot to tell Mae how
long to let me sleep.  Therefore I slept quite a while.  After I woke I made
some calls to find out information for help for Pat Bradfield.  Mae then called
and visited with Pat.  I did some work on my journals.  Time went so quickly
and I had to take the PM run.  When I got home, mae had dinner ready.  We ate
and then I took a shower and Bob and I went Home Teaching.  We had a good visit
with Therman’s and then took their daughter, Annie over to the church house for
Young Women’s.  We went back and stopped at Casey’s  and then we visited with
Patriarch and Sister Johnstun’s.  They sure are great people.  Patriarch Johnstun
is now on oxygen most of the time.  We love that visit but it does get a little
long.  We were there two hours tonight.  When we got home , Mae and I soon got
to bed.</p>

was still very tired this morning so I got myself off to work.  Although it was
13 degrees my bus still started up on the 2<sup>nd</sup> try.  The run went
well.  My back is quite sore this morning so I took a muscle relaxant and a
inflammatory pill before leaving.  When I got home I still hurt so I tried
stretching exorcizes, then Mae used the vibrato on my back.  I took an hour nap
and then Mae and I went to the spa.  We didn’t do much with exercising but the
hot tub really helped.  Kate, my assistant called in sick and I had a male
assistant by the name of Carl ride with me this afternoon.  The run went well. 
Mae had dinner ready when I got home.  I did some Family History and think that
I will get some help with the Temple Sealing’s of Bob and Margaret.  That has
been a concern for several years.  We started preparing for Sunday’s Family
History class but Irven and Sandy came over with a question about precious
metal investing.  I told them my thought for what they are worth.  We were late

sub-assistant and found out that they hadn’t found anyone.  I had to drive
without help which work out, but I am concerned about this afternoon.  Mae
wasn’t home when I got home.  She had gone shopping.  I had just started eating
lunch when she came home.  I helped her carry the groceries in.  I took a nap
and then entered this portion of my journal.  When I went into work I found
that they still hadn’t found a substitute to take Kate’s place this afternoon. 
I told Sherrie that I was concerned about not having someone to watch Scarleth
and Lynsie.  Sherrie then came up with an idea of using an assistant from
another bus, but she was already on a bus at Syracuse Jr. High school.  I drove
down there and picked her up.  We still made it in time to start the PM run on
time.  It went very well as we had three children that didn’t ride home with us
and Scarleth and Lynsie both fell asleep.  We made the trip by over ½ hr.
shorter than most days.  Mae got her hair done this afternoon and didn’t get
home just before we joined with other and took our youth over to the Family
History Center in Ogden.  It was a good training for the youth.  We are quite
excited for this program. Tonight we started training of two youth, a Young
Woman and a Young Man, from each Ward.  They in turn will train the other Young
Woman and Young Men.  And then they will help with the training of adults. 
After the training session the Stake YW &amp; YM leaders took everyone out to

Moon Health store for a few items and then to Costco for some groceries.  We
bought some salad’s for dinner and then went to a basket ball game at Central
Davis Junior High where Tyler played a basket game and his team also won.  When
we got home we watched a couple of shows on TV.  I was going to enter my

in the printer and then I had problems getting that to work.  I didn’t feel

to visit with Leslie Fales, but she had family with her so that didn’t work
out. We attended choir practice and then stopped at home for a few minutes

trying to work with him.  Shellie asked us to Fast and Pray for Quint, and also
said that a letter from us might help.  Each of us wrote a letter.  We have
spent most of the day composing those letters.  We are sure praying for him.  I
worked on my 1970 – 1974 Diary and again found that I had not entered enough
data and so added to the Dairy.  We did call Becky and wished her a happy
Birthday.  I again I tried to run the printer alignment, but the printer is not
working correctly.  I am not sure just what to do.  We help Bob with his
medication again today.   He also is having trouble with his hearing aid not
working.  I tried to use his Caption phone and it is not working.  We tried to

At 7:45 Mae got up and prepared breakfast of waffles.  I called Hewlett Packard
about our printer and was on the phone and computer for over 2 hours, with most
of the time having a supervisor trying to sell us a service plan.  We took the
modem and router over to Comcast and they gave us an all in one set.  One of
the technetium worker’s told me that that might help our situation with our
internet going down so much.  I asked if it was hard to install and they said
that it was easy.  All we had to do was follow the simple directions.  Mae took
a memory stick to the print shop to have the letters we wrote to Quint, printed
as our printer still isn’t working.  She got back just as I was finishing up at
Comcast.  It really didn’t save us any time as she forgot the memory stick, so
we went back.  They didn’t have it so we are out.  We mailed the letters and
then went to the Aquatic Center.  We started on the tread mill and had walked
about ¾ a mile when a fire alarm went off and everyone had to evacuate the
building.  The ones in the swimming pool are the ones that we felt sorry for as
they went outside in the snow with bare feet, wet swimming suits and wet hair. 
We took our coats with us and went right to the car and went home.  Mae cooked
dinner while I called one of the new students that will ride my bus.  I will
not be able to pick her up in the morning because that will change ½ the other
student’s pickup time and I couldn’t tell them of the change.  I called Scott
to get some help from him with the computer set up.  He came over with the
family about 7:30 and he worked about 1 ½ hours getting the computers connected
to the internet.  Mae went over to Bishop Knutson’s and helped him get
registered on the Church Wed site.  She was there for over 2 hours and got home
just before Scott and his family left.  It’s now going on 10PM and I have to
work tomorrow.</p>

went in again 15 minutes early and it was again a good thing as the bus
wouldn’t start.  I had to have the mechanics come down and jump the batteries. 
The one mechanic commented that if the block heater had been working it would
have started.  I took it that he was questioning my care of the bus, so his
comment hit me a little wrong, so I came back that the block heater hadn’t
worked from the day I got the bus and I had told them that several times, but
it still hadn’t been replaced.  No more was said.  They got the bus running and
I finished the pre-check.  I went up to the office for two reasons, 1<sup>st</sup>
I was cold and 2<sup>nd</sup> I needed to check on my route with the addition of
another stop.  Sherrie still isn’t at work so I just did the best we could.  We
made the route on time.  At my extra stop there were two children, a boy and a
girl that got on.  When I got home I was cold so after eating a little I
wrapped up with an electric blanket and slept for an hour.  Our printer still
isn’t working so we went to Staples and bought a new one.  Now we just have to
install it.  The PM run went fairly well except Morgan went to the full 10
minutes after 3M before they brought the children out.  When we got to Burton
Elementary the children were ready to come out but they still waited.   Finally
they let the children come out but they were waiting for the new girl.  I guess
the boy is special education but the sister is regular education so she doesn’t
get out until 3:30PM.  That is not going to work because now I am late getting
to Kaysville Elementary.  I will have to work that out tomorrow morning.  This
evening I went down to Randy for a treatment.  He really worked me over.  I
don’t know how we are going to afford the treatments but I don’t know what to
do without them.  Randy told me the same thing that Dr. Lee told me about not
sitting so long on the bus.  I have a lot of “I don’t know how” right now.

woke shortly before the alarm went off so I got up without waking Mae.  Neither
of us slept very well last night.  As I drove to work it sounded like sand was
hitting the windshield but it was Ice Rain and it just coated the car.  In the
car, the defrosters soon cleared the front and rear windows.  That changed when
we started driving the bus.  I had to stop twice to use the scraper to clear
the windshield but I know that I could never keep the schedule if I stopped
every 100 feet, so I tried using the window washer and it cleared the window
for a few minutes before it ice over again.  I kept using the washer every two
or three passes of the wipers, until I got to my first stop.  By then the
heaters had started to warm the windows and the wipers could clear the ice
rain.  The roads were very slippery and several buses got stuck trying to go up
hills.  I drove carful and a used the tire chains in steep areas.  We were able
to keep our schedules pretty close.  After finishing my AM run I met with
Sherrie and we adjusted 411 schedules to include two new students.  I also put
in a bid for a different route that will let me get out of the driver’s seat
and stretch my back.  I hope this will relieve some of the back pain I am
having.  When I got home Mae prepared lunch for me and then I laid down and
slept for a couple of hours.  Shortly after getting home this evening I had to
take Mae over to the Stake Center for a Family History for the Youth.  I
relaxed and watched part of a show that Bob had recorded.  It was fair but not
exceptional.  I got Mae and brought her home.  The roads were too bad for her

two hours.  I was very surprised so I went to the office and they told me that
the district had called everyone.  In as much as I was there I went into
Sherrie and told her that there was still an error in my route sheets.  Plus I
didn’t think the routes were quite right.  She said that we should fix them
right now.  It took us a while but I think they are right now. We also got
clarified about the Bell children.  The Principle and Rosa made an exemption as
Mr. Bell’s wife has just died and they wanted the Daughter, who is in regular
education to be able to ride with the younger brother who is in special
education.  The computer would not allow that action so we had to enter the
daughter also as special education.    I also talked to her about my back
problems and she suggested that I bid for a change in route.   We checked the
new listing for bids and there was only one route that would meet my needs, so
I applied for it.  When I got home Mae was very surprised to see me.  I
explained to her about the district’s decision the time change.  We then worked
on the computer getting a letter to each parent about the change in the route
schedule, but we could not print it off.  We put it on a stick.  I just had
time to get back to take the route.  When I finished the AM route, I went back
in to the office and Sherrie printed the letters off for me.  This afternoons
run went well but we only had 5 children ride home with us.  I had Kaye check
the letters and give them to the children as they got off the bus.  The rest I
brought home and put them in envelopes and mailed them to the parents.  Kate
had corrected an error that we had made on the letter.  She has sure been a
good assistant and I am very sorry that I need to make this change in Routes. 
Mae had gone out to lunch with Marna and they just enjoyed visiting.  I went
down to Randy’s for a treatment before Mae got home.  By the time I got home
from Randy’s, Mae had gone to Jeff’s to tend their children.  She got home
late.</p>

between 8AM and 9AM.  I took a note upstairs and put on Bob’s door as I was
afraid that when Comcast came, Bob would not hear them.  The note directed them
to come to the back door.  Shortly after, the repairman came.  He soon realized
that the new equipment was not compatible and he had to go back to get
something different.  We thought that we had nothing pressing today.  Comcast
took up almost three hours.  Jeff was going to come over and connect our
printer for us.  He called and said that Mae had left her car behind his and
the Gail had taken her car so he couldn’t get his car out to come over.  We
drove over to get out car.  In visiting with Jeff he suggested that we were getting
the wrong type of printer for our needs.  We decided to take the one back and
get a different type.  When we got home we got a call from David asking if they
could come over and spend a little while between Tyler’s basketball game and
Emily’s violin recital.  We of course said yes, so we quickly packed up the
first printer, then Mae gave me a haircut.  I quickly jumped in and took a
shower.  We really enjoyed the short visit with David and his family. 
Somewhere between everything else I gave Shellie a quick phone call and found
out that Quint hadn’t came home yet but was still waiting to make that
decision.  Boy! That was exciting news.  We then took the printer back to
Staple’s and they exchanged it for a Brother Laser Printer, plus we bought some
other items.  We then stopped at Maddox’s and got some chicken for dinner.  We
tried to find some Ice Melt but everyone has sold out.  We went to Scott and
Mishelle’s where we tended their children while Scott and Mishelle went out for
the evening.  We took a DVD movie over with us to watch but the children didn’t
like it but wanted to play.  Mae was ok with not watching it because there was
some bad language use in it.  I watched the show and it got over just after
Scott and Mishelle got home.  Well!  For what started out to be a very relaxing
day, it ended up being very full day!  It is now 10 minutes to 12 and I think

go my projector and computer.  When I got back to the chapel I got an extra
small table and started setting up the equipment on it.  When the primary class
left the room we quickly set up for our class.  That went quite well.  Sacrament

his invitation for lunch tomorrow.  In as much as it will be his Birthday, he
decided to go skiing.  Of course Mae told him that it was ok and to have fun.   It
is now after 9PM so we got ready to go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 5AM and I left at 6:30AM for work.  I had the bus ready to go 10
minutes but Kate didn’t show up.  She had trouble with the snow and traffic. 
She got here 5 minutes late.  We were 20 minutes late getting to the first
stop.  The main roads were ok but some of the side streets hadn’t been plowed. 
I used the chains about 5 or 6 times.  All in all we did ok. I stopped at the
store for Mae on the way home and got a few groceries.  When I got home I put
on my snow suite and cleaned walks and driveways.  When I finished Mae had
lunch ready and I took a 20 minute nap before going back to work.  The roads we
in good shape for the PM run.  After work I went into Janet’s office and asked
her how she wanted the extra time recorded for the early out of the grade
schools and then returning to take the pre-school children.  She not only
showed me but she entered the time for the week.  This evening both Mae and I
worked on our personal histories.  Shellie called to tell us that she and Roy
are coming up to go skiing and then up to Soda Springs to the Trail Creek Lodge
with Sandy, Nick, Mae and I the end of February.  That sounds good to us. 
Scott had gone skiing and snowboarding today for his Birthday.  We wished him a
Happy Birthday.  It is now after 9PM so we had better get to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
went into work early so that we could leave the compound 9 minutes sooner to
adjust for the bad weather.  However Kate must not have understood me when we
finished yesterday as she came actually 2 minutes late for normal time.  We
were 20 minutes late getting to the first stop due to bad weather and heavy
traffic on Antelope Drive.  It pushed me the rest of the trip.  When I got home
I cleaned the walks and driveway.  I went to the auto parts and bought a new
set of windshield wipers for the pickup.  Mae was going to go up to Kim and
Jeanenne’s to help pack some of their things but due to the bad roads Dezeree
called her and told her not to come.  My PM runs went well and when returning
to the compound, I fueled my bus and tried to get into the computer to print my
W-2 form.  I couldn’t remember my pass word so he to send a message to the
District office to get a new one.  It will come by E-Mail but I gave them an
old E-Mail address, so that won’t work.  When I got home I resent the message
but this time with a correct address.  Bob bought Whooper’s for us for dinner. 
We watched the show, “The Farmers Daugther” on TV this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
AM run went well.  As I got off the bus a man from the district office
interviewed me saying that I had been chosen as the employee of the month. 
Just as I finished talking to him, Mae called and asked about getting a cord to
connect the printer to the desk top computer.  I went down to Wall-Mart but
didn’t find what we needed.  When I got home Mae had partially down loaded a
new version of Quicken but had not completed it.  I tried to finish it but
couldn’t find figure out how to complete it.  I also tried to get the School
District Internet system to get my W-2 printed off, but couldn’t figure that
out either.  I really got upset over the computers.  I finally just quit and
lay down on the bed.  I don’t think I went to sleep but I heard Scott come
over.  Mae had invited him for lunch.  After eating lunch, which was very good,
he got on the computers and was able to get the Quicken down loaded.  He then had
to go back to work.  I was about to leave for work when the phone rang.  It was
Janna from the office.  She told me that I had been awarded route 73 and they
wanted me to start driving it on Monday.  The PM run went well.  I did tell
Kate that I had been given a new route.  Between taking the grade school
children and returning for the pre-school children I stopped at Staples and
bought the cord that we needed to connect the printer to the desk top
computer.  I stopped in the office before coming home and got the Route 73
Driver Direction’s printed off.  Mae had made homemade bread this afternoon. 
We had that and fruit and almond butter for super.  Mae had a special Stake
Relief Society program that she attended this evening.  I watched a movie that
Bob had recorded from the TV.  We then watched the last third of the movie we
had watched a week ago and hadn’t finished.  I felt that if I was going to
watch a movie on TV, I should watch it with Bob.  I entered this entry into my
journal.  I had just started this entry when Mae came home.  She said the it
was a very good program but that she, Sister Linda Heydorn and Sister Carolyn
Saunders were the only ones from our Ward that attended.  </p>
