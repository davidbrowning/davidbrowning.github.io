<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Bob
followed me to Dee’s and we left the car there, then Bob took me to work. 
After my run Bob returned to pick me up.  We called Dee’s and they didn’t have
my car repaired.  I started packing food items for this weekend.  Lee Brown
from South Valley Farm’s called me as I had a letter that was sent to me.  I
told him to just through it in the trash.  We visited for a few minutes.  It
was good to visit with him.  They have sold their home in Shafter and are
living in the new home that they built beside the home that we lived in.  He
plans to retire in two more years.  Bob was going to take me to get my car but
it still isn’t repaired yet, so he took me to work.  He returned after my PM
run and took me to get my car.  The cost of installing a new alternator was
$409.00.  That really hurts.  I met Jeff at his office in Salt Lake and we road
together to Mikes.  The sprinkler system that I was going to help Mike repair
is working ok now, so we really couldn’t do anything.  Becky had dinner about
ready when we got there.  Mike cooked steak on the grill.  It was a great
dinner.  We enjoyed visiting with them and returned home about 10PM.  I entered
this entry and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
went into the office when I finished my AM route and made some minor changes to
my route.  I think it will be much better and safer for the children.  I got a
minute to talk to Brian, the Director of the bus department.  I suggested a
camera on the Stop Arm so that when someone runs our Reds, we could review the
tape and have them identified and ticketed.  He said that they have such a
device but they are very pricy.  He said that his budget is already being cut
until he doesn’t know how he can order the buses we need now.  I came home and
worked on the camper and boat, getting them ready for Jeff and I to use them
this weekend.   I didn’t have time to take a nap again today.  After my PM run
I got the garden watered and worked getting things ready for our trip.  Bob
isn’t feeling well as he had a tooth worked on and it is really hurting him. 
Brother Knudson came over and we Anointed and gave him a Priesthood Blessing. 
I watched a couple of Gun Smoke series while I ate dinner.  I then checked on
my group to see how Home Teaching came out this last month.  It wasn’t the
best.  Im not sure where the time went but I was sure tired and went to bed
about 10PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early so got up and got ready.  By the time I had finished with breakfast
I was way early for work so I set the timer and slept for another 15 minutes. 
When I finished my run and got back home I started right into packing and
getting the camper and boat ready to go.  Bob still isn’t feeling the best. 
After my PM route I went up to Jeff’s and we went to get his car from the
garage.  I left my car at Jeff’s so Mae would have a way home from there.  We
stopped and got Sub-Way’s for our dinner tonight.  It was about 6PM when we got
up the camp ground in Heber.  We launched the boat and then set up the camper. 
We fished for a while until dark.  I did catch two fish so we will have fish
for breakfast.  I did talk to Mae on the phone this evening.  It was late when
we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke early and went over to the rest rooms.  The camp grounds are very nice
with very nice restrooms.  Jeff didn’t sleep very well as the furnace must have
a fan that is rubbing somewhere on the frame, so it is quite noisy when it
comes on.  He slept there to the side of it.  I suggested that we share the
queen bed but he said that he tosses too much, that is why they have a king
size bed, so that Gail can sleep with him.  When I came back I found my I-pod
and read my scriptures.  We cooked hot cakes and fish for breakfast.  We had a
very good morning of fishing and caught our limits of 12 to 14 inch Rainbow
Trout.  When we came in and went to the fish cleaning station a family
consisting of the Grand Father, his son, his Grandson and his Great Grandson
had just came in from fishing this morning.  They had one large Brown trout
that was 21 inches long and so fat that I don’t think I could have but my hands
around it and touched my fingers together.  It was a real trophy and very
quickly collected a crowd, including the rangers, to see it.  The grandson told
me that they have fished this reservoir for years but have never caught
anything like this fish.  They caught it trolling with pop gear and worms. 
Jeff and I played a game of Risk which Jeff won.  Jeff suggested that we fish
for a while this afternoon and then pack up and go home.  I was also in favor
of that and I think we are both home sick for our wives and children.  We
cooked a couple of fish for lunch so that we could catch a couple more fish
this afternoon without exceeding the limits.  We were only out for a couple of
hours and again had good fishing but the fish were a little smaller than the
ones we caught this morning.  We came home beating our family home.  Jeff
helped me unpack the camper and put the boat away before he left for home.  Mae
arrived shortly after Jeff left.  I helped carry her things in and she put
things way.  We were both very tired so we took our showers and watch a John
Wayne movie on DVD before going to sleep.  It is sure great to have Mae back
home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in until after 9 this morning.  It is <span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:115%'>so good</span> to have Mae home.  We relaxed and worked on
journals and Family History.  Just before leaving for meetings Linda called and
is at her mothers.  Mae invited her to come over this evening.  Meetings went
well.  Mae prepared dinner for Linda and Bob while I went over and got Linda.  We
had a nice visit with Linda.  It looks like both Roy and Linda are doing some
better health wise.  It was late when we took Linda back to her mothers, so we
were quite late for me to get to bed.  Mae didn’t sleep very well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got myself off to work and let Mae sleep in.  After work I picked up Bob.  We
went down to Sherrie’s and helped Eric take her to the Doctors.  She sure
doesn’t have very good color and she acts as though she feels horrible.  Mae
has been on the telephone most of the morning with Shellie and Sandy (Irven’s
wife) , but she made up for it the rest of the day as in four hours she had
done all the laundry, unpacked from her and my trips and cleaned the house.  I
had a snack after getting home.  I washed the outside windows and took our
bedroom window completely apart and cleaned it.  This is the first time that we
have cleaned that window.  I also installed a light by our outside door.  After
finishing my PM run I went into the office to turn in last week’s report.  Rosa
asked if I would help return a bus to the compound of which the driver got too
sick to drive it back.  That took me about an extra hour getting home.  While
we ate dinner we watched a cute show on TV that stared Jimmy Stewart.  We then
read the R. S. / Priesthood lesson for next Sunday.  I then called and visited
with Irven and Sandy about going up to Dalene’s funeral.  Mae got an e-mail off
to our family inviting them to a fish, biscuits and gravy brunch this next
Saturday.  It’s now bed time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
Mae and I slept well last night.  Mae made me a wonderful breakfast of waffles
and eggs.  It is so nice to have her back home to be with me.  After parking my
bus I went into the shop and scheduled tomorrow off.  I stopped at the auto
parts store and bought some oil and a new filter.  Mea and I took a nap and
then I changed the oil and filter in the Buick.  I also took care of the
chickens so that they will have feed and water while we are away tomorrow.  After
my PM run, Mae had dinner ready for Brother and Sister Taylor’s family so we
took it over to them.  We then came home and ate our dinner and we watched some
TV before going to bed.  Mae was also working on our preparedness book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was still awake by 5:15AM even though I set the alarm for 5:45AM.  By 7:30AM we
were ready to leave for Idaho.  Irven and Sandy got here at 7:45AM and we soon
left to the Wilford 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward LDS Chapel which is south west of Rigby
Idaho.  It was a very nice funeral service in honor of Dalene Browning Parker. 
Dalene had written her own Life Sketch which ViEtta read and added some smale
insights.  Craig Bean gave a very appropriate talk.  I asked if he would send
me a copy of his talk.  Bishop Travis Walker also gave very appropriate
message.  With the exception of the long Life Sketch that funeral is what I
would like given for me.  We went to the cemetery and then returned to the
chapel for a very nice lunch.  It was good to visit with many of our family
that we don’t get to see very often, mainly at weddings and funerals.  It was
after 7PM when we returned home.  Mae and I met with Paul Campbell of our Stake
High Council who extended a call for Mae and I to be on a planning committee
for a luncheon to be held for the Young Women who attend Girls Camp.  We will
also help prepare and serve the Luncheon on August 8, 2013.  After meeting with
Brother Campbell we went shopping for a few items before coming home and going to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke before the alarm and took a shower.  Although Mae can’t eat any solids
today because of the colonoscopy tomorrow, she still got my breakfast for me. 
I was very tired when returned home after my bus run, so I took a nap.  Mae and
I then went over to J &amp; J Nursery and bought some tomato and pepper
plants.  After my PM run I worked in the garden, plus I built a stand for a
large pot.  I am going to try raising grape tomatoes on a pedestal this year. 
Mae started taking the medication that will clean her out prior to going to the
hospital in the morning.  I think she will be up most of the night.  The memory
area in our camera is full and will not let us take more pictures until it is
cleaned out.  I have been working on that for quite a while this evening but
the battery in the camera ran out before I could get it done.  It’s now time to
go to bed.</p>

couldn’t eat but prepared breakfast for me anyway.  Bob took Mae to the
hospital and I met her there when I finished my morning run.  All went with her
test.  On the way home I stopped and bought her a frozen yogurt.  Then when we
got home I cooked scrambled eggs and toast, plus a chocolate protein drink.  We
watched part of a show on TV while we ate.  I had to leave before it ended but
Mae did watch it.  When I finished my PM run I stopped at Green’s Feed and
picked up our chicks and more feed.  Mae had gone with Bob to copy papers.  I
got the chicks put in the pen and then Mae and I left for Mike’s.  Becky had a
very nice dinner ready when we got there.  Becky’s parents were also there. 
After eating we all went to the choral concert that Mattie participated in.  It
was very enjoyable.  Mike and Becky gave Mae a very nice Mother’s Day card that
when it is opened it plays “You are my Sun Shine”.  Mike said that when he saw
it he just had to buy it for Mae because it brought back so many memories.  We
stopped at a grocery store for a few items we need for tomorrow’s brunch with
several of our children and their families.  It’s now time for bed.  Good
Night.</p>

too busy.  It was good to have them all here.  Mae tended Scott’s children
while Scott and Mishelle mainly went shopping.  I just gave up and watched a
couple of shows on TV.  Mae was especially tired when everyone left.  She has
sure gone hard all day.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night but we got up by 7:30.  We showered and then
I prepared breakfast.  Shellie called to wish Mae a happy Mother’s day and they
visited quite a while.  I cleaned up the kitchen before taking care of the
chickens.   We attended Church services and after we left we visited the
Casey’s, Sister Southard and Sister Fallis, before coming home.  After super we
watched the Movie “Jubal”, the Garrett called Mae to wish her a Happy Mother’s
Day.  Chelci also texted Mae to wish her a Happy Mother’s Day.  It was such a
beautiful evening that we went for a walk in the park.  When we got back we
played a game of Rummy and tonight I won Mae.  I finished this entry and we
went to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep well so she went into the other bedroom.  I set the alarm wrong
and when I woke it was 605AM, so I really had to hurry.  Mae had breakfast
ready for me so I was ok on time.  After finishing the AM run Mae helped me
plant the rose bushes Bob had bought.  They are sure small so I hope they grow
into match.  We then started planting the garden.  Bob prepared lunch for us
and I did get a short nap before the PM run.  I just got home from the run when
Bob called and wanted me to come to Sherrie’s and give her a blessing.  I think
that it was completely Bob’s desire but I just don’t know if I have a right to
judge.  Dad Jensen asked me about that with Margaret.  I didn’t have an answer
then and I still don’t know.  After getting home we ate dinner and then went to
West Jordon to watch Tyler play basketball.  The first half the Morgan team
were outscored but they came back in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half and won 52 to 40. 
It was a good game.  After getting home I checked on the chickens.  I then
tried to find the Inspection Form that I used when I inspected Jeff and Gail’s
house before they purchased it.  Scott wants me to inspect a home they are
looking at.  It’s after 10PM so I’m going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up at 5AM and then laid down with Mae for a few minutes.  Mae is going to
tend Gail’s children as she has a class to attend today.  When I got home this
morning I worked in the garden getting some strawberry’s planted and tiled the
weeds out around the edge of the garden.  I ate lunch and took a nap before my
afternoon runs.  When I got to the bus, Irven called and wanted my advice on
some changes they want to make to their front yard.  I had left for my bus run
a little early and stopped at C.A.L. Ranch and bought a garden cultivator. 
When I finished the run I went over to Irven’s and we talked about different
options.  I also lessoned to the noise that the toilet is making and I think it
is just the flush valve wearing out.  I was two hours over there.  When I got
home the garden was flooded by the water being on about 1 ½ hours to long.  I
came in and got some dinner as Mae is still with Gail and the children.  When I
went up to use Bob’s micro wave oven I also set and watch a show on TV.  It was
the tail end of “Magnificent Obsession” with Rock Hudson.  It is pretty hard
for me to over look what he turned out to be.  Mae came home shortly after that
and I spent the evening with her.</p>

returning for my bus run I typed up the Home Inspection Report for Scoot and
E-mailed it to him.  Irven called and in visiting with him, Mae was afraid that
I am going to help them and that up set her.  It upsets me because they ask for
advice and now don’t want to lesson.  When I got home from my PM run Bob was
mowing the lawn and Mae was trimming.  I got the small lawn mower out and cut
the edges.  When we finished Mae and I went to Ogden.  I let Mae off at Costco
to gather some items while I went to 12<sup>th</sup> Street Pharmacy where I bought
some shaving lubricant.  I got back to Costco just as Mae was going to the
checkout stand.  We then went out to eat at Chuck-A-Rama for dinner.  It is
sure fun being with Mae!  When we got home we took our showers and watched the
movie “An Affair to Remember” on DVD before going to sleep.</p>

got up planning on the Ward Clean Up Day but it has rained all night and is
still lightly raining this morning.  Mae was going to Rachael’s and Ben’s ball
games but they are also canceled due to the weather.  Bob had a dizzy spell and
fell in the bathroom hurting his left arm.  I took him to Dr. Toone who gave
him a treatment and said that he may have torn a ligament and it would be quite
painful for a while.  Irven and Sandy came over and visited about their yard
plans.  I gave them some ideas and I will draw their plot layout that they can
take into Durk’s Plumbing for a sprinkler layout.  Mae and I attended a Porter
Cuisines party held at Neil and Lael Wall’s.  We ate and then visited about
what each one is doing now.  Mae and I then left to attend a wedding
reception.  Georgia and Rick also attended the reception Sydnee and Chris
Pearson, Mary (Bushnel) Pearson’s son.  Uncle Van and Aunt Allison were not
there as due to Uncle Van having a stroke last week.  As we were visiting with Mary
about Uncle Van and how he is doing, Jacky and Dennis Dillingham came throw the
line.  The bride’s parents live in the same ward and Sydnee’s father is their
Home Teacher.  After leaving the reception, Mae and I then went over to Jeff
and Gail’s.  Mae called Jeff to let him know we were coming but they had
already left.  We took some things to their place and left them in their garage. 
We came home and tried to find something on TV but there wasn’t anything worth
watching.  I went upstairs and help Bob get to bed.  He is in quite a bit of
pain.  I don’t know how good he will sleep.</p>

went up to see what Dr. Bob wants to see.  She tried to reach Bob’s Dr. but she
couldn’t get a hold of him.  I gave myself a haircut and took a shower.  Mae
had called Kathy and she will take him to see a Doctor.  I attended my High
Priest leadership meeting.  When I returned home, Mae said that Kathy was
taking Bob to the emergency entrance as that is where Bob wanted to go.  We had
some breakfast and Mae went to a special Relief Society planning meeting.  I
cleaned up the dishes and started this entry.  We attended the block program. 
At the end of the Sacrament meeting we visited with Leslie Fallis as she did
not want us to come to her home.  I then drove Mae to a home’s so she could
give the Sister’s an invitation to the R.S. program.   After getting home I
checked on Bob.  Grant and Stacy had brought Bob some dinner so he wasn’t
hungry.  Mae prepared us a nice dinner and after eating I went out and checked
on our chickens.  Mae and I watched a cute show on BYUTV.  Although we had seen
it once before, it was still worth watching again.  During commercials we read
President Iring conference talk out of the Ensign.  That is a great message
with great hope.  I again checked on Bob and he was sleeping soundly in his

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Bob
woke Mae about mid-night and had her up really for nothing.  She didn’t get
back downstairs until after 2AM.  I am not sure just how this is going to turn
out.  As soon as I got home this morning Bob wanted me to come up.  He wanted
us to get him a shower mat.  I asked Mae if she could get it when she came back
from Rachel’s Pre-School graduation.  I then went to Sister Olson’s and tilled
a front curb area about 30 feet long.  After tilling it I hauled the excess
dirt out and raked it level.  I took 10 wheel barrels full and put it under the
pine trees in the back yard.  I finished at 11AM and had t get ready to take a
field trip.  As soon as I came back into the house, Bob wanted to know where I
had been and where Mae was as she hadn’t brought the mat back yet.  I got upset
with him and went back downstairs.  My field trip went well and between it and
my PM run I had time to take a nap in the bus.  I had taken the Sunset Junior
High track teams to Davis High school for their track and field tournaments. 
After my PM run I had some time, so I went to Sub-Way and bought a sandwich to
eat before going back to pick up the Sunset youth.  They were late getting
finished with the tournament games so I didn’t get home until 6:45PM.  Brother
Thomas and Brother Saunder’s were waiting for me.  We visited with LaRae
Karboski and her sister.  That took longer than we had planned.  Charles had
other things to do so Morgan and I went Home Teaching to Thurman’s.  We then
visited with Sister Tate.  Mike was here when I got home.  He had been up to
Woods Cross for soccer game so came on up to see us.  I was glad that Mae was
at least home.  I got home in time to visit for just a few minutes before he
had to leave.  It’s now after 10 PM so we will go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep much last night so I let her sleep in.  When I got home for my
run, Bob wanted me to take him to the Chiropractor.  That fairly well took care
of my morning.  I did check on some apartments on Parrish Lane that looks
pretty good.  Mae went to Connor’s ball game just as I got home from my PM
run.  She had dinner ready before she left.  I joined with other Priesthood
Brothers and we did some cleanup that didn’t get done last Saturday due to
rain.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
bus runs went well.  Between runs, I helped Irven and Sandy do a yard layout
for a Sprinkler System estimate.  They then helped Mae weed the garden.  I
sprayed for weeds and took care of the chickens.  I get a little upset with
Irven and Sandy when they ask for my help and suggestions and then they
question my reasoning.  I told them to do what they want.  I am afraid that I
get to demanding.  I also drove bus for a Field Trip afternoon.  Mae had a
Relief Society program this evening that she helped with.  I help her some. 
While she was gone I watched the movie “The High and The Mighty” starring John
Wayne.  Although I have seen it many times there wasn’t anything else playing
that was worth watching, plus I enjoy John Wayne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
my AM run I took Bob to see Dr. Porter.  He said that his arm is healing and he
was also happy that his blood pressure and oxygen levels are much better.  He
told me that some of Bob’s mental problems may be due to the medication but
told me to watch carefully as he goes off the medication.  That took care of
most of my time between bus runs.  I was able to get the lawns mowed during a
little spare time.  This evening we tended Jeff and Gail’s children.  We needed
to take a picnic table to David as a graduation gift, so we took the pickup and
camper, letting Mae and the children ride in the camper.  We had a nice visit
with David’s family and the children played outside.  We arrived back at Jeff’s
before Jeff and Gail got home.  After Jeff and Gail got home and the children
went to bed Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played a short game of Rook.  We were late
getting home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up early in order to get to the University of Utah where we attended the
Graduation Exercises for the Medical divisions.  We are quite proud of David’s
accomplishments.  As I told him, not many have been able to care for a Family,
pay the complete cost of three years of collage without borrowing a cent, and
being in the top 1% of his class, and receiving no financial help from his
parents.  It has taken a lot of support from his sweet wife and special
children.  Following the graduation program, Mae and I stopped and got a salad
at Sub Way.  We then stopped home to change close and get the flowers.  We then
went to the Cemetery at Morgan.  We decorated the graves and visited with
Family.  We felt a little bad as none of our children attended.  Georgia was
the only one from her family, Bryce, Deanna and Noland’s family were there from
that side and Summer from Kim’s family.  From the cemetery we went out to
Tooele to attend a Surprise Birthday Party for Chelci.  Sandi sure went all out
for that.  We were sure tired when we got home late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning and I got up just in time to get dressed and go to my
High Priest Group Leadership meeting.  After I got home we had breakfast before
going to the regular bloke meetings.  After returning home we prepared dinner
of and took it up stairs and ate with Bob.  We watched a movie on TV while
there.  This evening I worked on Indexing and Mae worked on Family History.  Before
going to bed we watched a movie on TV.  It was ok but after that the next one
started out stupid so we turned it off and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Today
being Memorial Day, I didn’t have to go to work.  We slept in until almost
9AM.  We did a few things around the house, including watering the garden.  We then
went out looking to see what is on the market as far as apartments, condo’s and
trailer homes.  We did see one used double wide trailer for $23,000.  When we
came back home and looked at out yard and our apartment, we really don’t want
to leave this home.  We just don’t know how things are going to work out.  We
went out to eat at the Golden Corral for lunch.  I mowed the back yard after we
got home and we watered the garden.  Tonight we watched a movie on DVD before
going to sleep.  It has really been a fun day spending it with Mae.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
really did not want to go back to work today, but I guess I can make another 9
days.  My AM run went well.  Shortly after I got home the carpet cleaner came
and I helped him put up all the small furniture up off the carpet.  I also made
some blocks and covered them with aluminum foil for the rocker/recliner and the
love seat.  After the cleaner left, we needed to stay off the carpet as much as
possible until it dry’s, that includes the furniture, so there isn’t much room
left to be on.  We therefore set down and turned on a show on TV.  It was quite
a good movie but I had to leave just before it ended.  Mae told me the ending
when I got back home.  This evening Mae went with me to visit Patriarch and
Sister Johnston.  Their daughter is there with them.  It sounds like their
children are taking good care of them.  That is the way it should be.  We tried
to keep our visit short so as not to tire Sister Johnston too much.  After
leaving there we went to Venla and Laurel Reed and found out how to give
Laurel’s cat it’s medication.  I will play a quick game of Solitary and then
got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 5AM and after reading my scriptures I put most of the furniture back in
place.  I know that if I didn’t Mae would try to, after I went to work.  I had
most of it put back when Mae woke at 6AM.  The Jr. High students got very
vulgar and profane this morning with Elaina and Mike being the loudest.  It
really upset me by the time I got them to school.  At my third pickup with my
grade school I had a lady run my reds.  I was able to get the color and license
number, so when I got back to the shop I wrote up a complaint and turned it
in.  Mae had taken Bob in to therapy when I got home.  I worked on the camper
trying to get the heater out.  It was quite a job.  I also put the canopy
away.  It was still in the trunk of the car from bringing it back form
Sandi’s.  This afternoon, after loading the students, I pulled the bus over to
the side of the parking lot and told the students that I was tired of the
vulgarity, the profanity and the immorality in conversation and that I wanted
it stopped as of now.  At least it was much different going home but we shall
see.  After getting home I really didn’t feel too well so I quite for the day. 
We watched the movie “Titanic” on TV.  I then took Mae down to Sister Reed’s
where she help Sister Reed give Laurel’s cat its medication.  I finished this
entry and then played a game of Solitary before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
woke during the night with leg cramps and she didn’t sleep much after that.  I
got myself of to work and let her try to get more sleep.  When I got home, Mae
and I went to Sister Olson’s to take care of giving Laurel’s cat its medication
but the brother had been there and done it.  Mae went over to Scott’s to tend
their children while Scott and Mishelle spend two nights in Park City.  After
my PM run I worked on the camper furnace getting it apart, finding a large
mud-dobber’s nest inside the furnace fan.  I figured that is what is causing
the furnace to squeak.  I cleaned out the nest and re-installed the furnace. 
When I tested it, the furnace still squeaked.  At that time I realized that it
was time for me to go to Sister Olson’s to give the cat its medication.  As I
walked down to Sister Olsen’s I passed the Niederhauser’s home.  Karen called
to me and came out and visited with me.  We were several minutes visiting and I
finial asked Karen to go with me.  When we got there Sister Olsen said that her
son had came and gave the medication to the cat.  After going home I visited
with Irven and Sandy and I told them that if they needed me to I would operate
the back-hoe to install a new water line.  It was 10:30PM when I went to bed.</p>

appointment.  After letting Bob off, I went over to Irven and Sandy’s.  They
weren’t home so to wait I set in the car and took a nap.  When they got home we
did some looking over the problems and trying to figure out just how to
proceed.  I was ½ hour late getting back to pick up Bob and he was quite upset
over it.  Mae and the children met me at the Jr. High and I let Kylan and Ashley
ride with me as I took the students home.  When we took the bus back I took
Kylan and Ashley back to their house.  Mae and the children then went to Dinosaur
Park.  I stopped on the way home to get Bob a sandwich and chips for his
dinner.  I fixed myself some dinner and watched a show on TV.  At 8PM I went
down and gave Laurel’s cat some more medication.  I then watched the Ponderosa
and a western TV show before going to bed.</p>
