<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Because
of a Teachers Preparation Day, there was no school today.  We slept in until
8AM when Mae got up and I didn’t get up until 8:30AM.  Boy was it nice!  Mae
made Pan Cake Puffs for breakfast.  They were good but it took quite a bit of
time to prepare them.  After eating breakfast Mae and I put together “Luggable
Loos” (other wise, portable toilets and supplies) for each of our children for
their emergency supplies.  They will be given them as a Christmas gift.  I also
cut 1.25 inch PVC pipe into 1 inch lengths for Mae to make emergency candle
holders.   This afternoon we attended the Bountiful Temple and after we went
out to eat at Sizzler’s in Layton.  When we got home we watched a TV show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
woke at 8AM and just after getting up Morgan Thomas called to remind me that
the High Priest had been given the assignment of setting up chairs for the
Stake Conference meetings.  I called all my High Priest that report to me on
their Home Teaching visiting.  I also ask them to help with the chair
assignment.  We had a few meet at the chapel and it didn’t take long to get the
job done.  When I got home I started working on installing a back door light. 
I worked on that project until time to get ready for the Priesthood Leadership
meeting at 4PM.  After that meeting Bob had prepared dinner for us.  We then
attended the 7PM Adult Session of our Stake conference.  Both meetings we very
good and I was able to stay awake in both of them.  Mae and I went to the grocery
store for a couple of items after the evening meeting was over.  It took me a
while this evening retyping three days journal entry that I had typed onto the
desktop computer while we had the laptop computer in being repaired.  I also
set our clocks back as tomorrow we go off Daylight Saving time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
enjoyed the extra hour to sleep in this morning.  When we got up I prepared
breakfast as Mae had to do her hair and be at choir practice by 9AM.  I walked
over to the church and was able to get I seat in the overflow area.  That way I
was able to get a cushioned chair.  Mae, of course, was in the choir seats. 
There was still a single seat next to me when Bob got there so he sat there. 
The meeting was very special with all the speakers giving very inspirational
talks.  The reverence was also very good, so all in all the meeting was very
enjoyable.  After returning home we had a little lunch and took a nap.  Mae
started dinner as Jeff and his family were coming over for dinner.  I turned
the TV on to channel 21 and got a BYU Idaho devotional by Brother Featherstone,
which was very good.  Jeff and his family got here at 5PM although Mae had
planned on 4PM.  It worked out ok and Mae had a very nice dinner ready.  It
does seem strange that it is dark so early now.  After dinner, Ben help me get
the chickens into the coop and I think I will keep them locked in for a while
and see if it helps the egg production.  The children watched a “Snow White” on
DVD while Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played a card game ‘Bohnanza”.  It was after
8PM when Jeff and his family got away.  I tried to call Roy and Linda to see
how they are doing but didn’t get an answer.  I tried to call Barbara and Russ,
but again didn’t get an answer.  Mae had also tried yesterday but didn’t get
any answer.  We hope everything is ok.  I finished this entrance and we soon
went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
guess I forgot to turn the alarm on last night.  Mae woke at 3AM and went into
the front room.  She came in at 6:30 AM and woke me.  I really had to hurry but
made my run on time.  When I got home I got something to eat and then I work on
the porch light.  Mae helped me put the swing away for the winter.  We also put
water in the chicken run and hooked up the heater for it.  We have locked the
chickens into the run and coop to see if that will increase the number of eggs
we are getting.  I finished the installation of the light and had to hurry for
my PM runs.  I stopped on the way home and filled the car with gas.  As soon as
I got home I started on installing a new light on Bob’s driveway.  I had Bob
come outside to help me but he was so upset at me climbing the ladder that I
finally had him go back inside.  It was dark and late when I came inside. 
After eating dinner I entered this journal entry.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t get up with me as she didn’t sleep well.  My runs went well and as I
finished up I stopped at Durk’s and bought a small pump.  After getting home
and eating, Mae came out and helped me pump anti-freeze into the boat motor. 
We also started winterizing the camper but we didn’t have enough anti-freeze to
do the camper.  After my PM runs I stopped and bought 2 more gallons of
anti-freeze.  I was too tired and it was dark by the time we ate dinner so we
just watched a couple of TV shows.  There isn’t much on TV but the Hall Mark
show wasn’t too bad.  I laid on the floor with my feet on the Chi Machine. 
Added this entry and we went to bed.  Bob talked to us and he wants to put my
name on the $15,000 insurance policy he bought from me when I was working for
Beneficial Insurance.  He wants us to use part of this money to pay for the
vehicle &amp; boat canapé tops and our white shed as they have been appraised
as part of Bob’s property and when he dies, the bank takes them along with the
house and land as he and Carroll had put them on a “Reverse Mortgage” when we
were on our mission.  They didn’t need the money so didn’t need to do this, but
they were talked into it by dishonest agents.  He said for us to give Grant
whatever is left to divide among his siblings.  Anyway, this way we will get
something when he dies.  It doesn’t look like we will get anything out of the
house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke up with a dream at 3am so I went into the front room to go back to sleep. 
I took the alarm clock with me but it didn’t go off.  Lucky for me I woke at
5:30am.  Mae got up and got my breakfast.  My runs went well and I got home
about 9:30am.  Mae had me help her with Portrait Pedigree charts but it took me
some time to remember how I did it.  Scott came over for lunch with us and we
enjoyed that time with him.  My pm runs went well and when I got home Scott and
his family were there.  Scott and Mishelle were winterizing their camper.  I
helped Scott drain his water heater.  He then helped me finish winterizing our
camper and then Scott and Kylan helped me put the cover over the camper.  Mae
had a nice dinner for us and we enjoyed having Scott, Mishelle and their family
here.  I helped Mae finish cleaning up and then we set down to watch a TV show
but Mae got a phone call and she spent the rest of the evening with that.  Mae
finished and then came in and watched the last of a show with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Work
went well today.  Between the AM and the PM runs Mae and I went into Ogden to
meet with Lori Nixon to go over changes in the Altius Health plan for the New
Year.  She is the one that is replacing Larry Saiz, who has helped us for
several years but passed away with cancer.  After visiting with her we did some
shopping.  When I got home this afternoon Mae had gone out doing more
shopping.  This evening I started working on a Portrait Pedigree Chart, for my
family.  It took me most of the evening but I feel good at what I have
accomplished.  It is now time for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well so I got myself off to work.  After returning home, Mae
made waffles for breakfast.  I took a short nap and then Mae and I ground and
packaged 40lb of boneless, skinless chicken breast and put it in the freezer. 
The chicken cost $49 plus the baggies, but that still makes pretty cheap
chicken especially when you buy ground turkey out of the store.  The other neat
thing about it is I got to work with my sweetheart!  My PM run went well.  One
of the grade school boys came up to me while we were loading and asked me some
questions about the bus.  After answering the questions he said to me, “When I
grow up I want to be a bus driver”.  After delivering the children to their
homes, I stopped at Tom’s in Clearfield and bought Sandi and Nix a box of
chicken.  They will come out tomorrow and we will grind the chicken for them. 
We were going to have the Bodley’s and the Saunder’s over this evening to play
games but Sister Bodley isn’t feel very well and we really don’t want to take a
chance of catching something.  We reset the date until next week end.  I called
and visited with Betsie Browning and with Barbara Call about family pictures.  Betsie
told me that she had just had her foot operated on and that their two girls are
getting married next month and their dates are set just one week apart. 
Barbara and Dean are working in the St. George Temple and sure enjoy that.  It
was good to talk to both of them.  Mae and I watched a movie on DVD this
evening, “The Miracle of the White Stallion”.   We really enjoyed it.  We then
turned on a movie on TV but after watching it for a while turned it off and
went to bed.</p>

woke at 5AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  Later I went in the bedroom to find
my glasses and that woke Mae.  I made egg omelets for breakfast.  I helped Mae
with some house work and then we attended Connors Basketball game.  Mae got
lunch for us when we got home.  I took a short nap and then Mae took Sister
Olsen grocery shopping.  I started tilling the garden and got ½ of it done
before Mae got home.  I quit tilling the garden and came in and relaxed.  I
started watching a nature show for a few minutes and then turned it to the BYU
football game.  Nick and Sandi came and we ground their chicken.  Mae prepared
dinner and after eating the four of us played games.  I filled out this entry
before we took showers and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
attended High Priest Quorum Leadership meeting.  After returning home I tried
to call Irven and Sandy’s home but I am still not getting any answer. 
Concerned, I tried to call Doug, as he is the only other member of Irven’s
family that I have a phone number for.  There was still no answer.  Maybe Doug
and his family have gone to meetings by now, so I just left a message.  Meetings
went well.  We were going to go Home Teaching to Sister Fallis, but she sent me
a text message during Sacrament meeting that she was too tired for this
Sunday.  Irven called me to let me know that he was home.  He stayed to nights
in the VA hospital.  This evening I called and visited with Elise to see how
Lois is doing.  She said that she was tired so went to bed early this evening. 
Otherwise she is doing fine.  I worked on my 1970-1974 journal for a while
before we went to bed.</p>

woke early this morning and laid in the recliner for a while.  My runs went
well and when I got home I tilled more of the garden.  I did come in and take a
nap before dinner.  This week is early out for the grade school but not for the
Jr. High and therefore it takes me about another hour extra of driving time. 
Mae found some pictures on my line but they are poor quality.  I don’t know
what to do because Mae wants me to use them rather than get pictures from
Betsy.  When I got home this afternoon Bob took Mae and I out to eat at the
Chuck-A-Rama.  It was 7PM when we got home.  Mae and I read the Priesthood /
Relief Society lesson for Sunday.  We then played a game of Rook and Mae really
whipped me.  It wasn’t even fun.</p>

woke an hour earlier than I needed but couldn’t go back to sleep so I got up. 
I let Mae sleep and went into work early as I am concerned about the problem
yesterday on the bus when I took the grade school children home.  I was able to
get pictures, along with names, of some of my students.  I think I have also
got my bus scheduled to repair the camera on the bus.  I did talk to the
students involved in the problem yesterday and I let them know that it was to
stop now and the next time something like that happens they would be taken to
the principle.  On my time between runs today I adjusted the door operator so
that it works better.  I also got the windows of the bus washed.  My runs went
well.  In between my AM and PM runs I finished tilling the garden and started
to rake fall leaves, so I can pick them up with the sweeper.  After dinner this
evening Mae went over to Scott and Mishelle’s to tend the children while they
went to a meeting in Salt Lake.  I went out this evening and picked up the
leaves and dumped them on the garden area.  This evening I went visiting as
High Priest Group leadership and Bishopric.  Brother Thomas Saunders of the
Bishopric wasn’t feeling the best so he didn’t go with us and Brother Charles
Saunders had a school program to attend with a grandchild, so he wasn’t there. 
I went with Bishop Hatch and we visited the Niederhauser’s and the Martin’s.  Brother
Thomas and Brother Taylor visited a couple of families.  I got home about
9:15PM.  It was 10:45PM from tending the children.  I was just about ready to
go to sleep when she got home.</p>

well.  I did get out and put the leaves over the strawberry plants.  This
evening Bob and I went Home Teaching to the Thurman’s.  We also stopped at the
Casey’s and I gave him a squash for Thanksgiving.  Mae typed a life history of
mine that I had written while we lived in Grantsville.  At that time Mae was
trying to get a Porter Family History book prepared, that a book might be
published.  I was busy with the farm but because Mae needed the information
immediately I put a quick summery together.  She is now trying to get some
Histories ready to give our children for Christmas, so she has asked me to
update that history.  There is a lot missing and a lot to add to it.  Wow!!! 
It’s now bed time so I had better quite for now.</p>

went well.  I drove the pickup to work so that Mae could have the car.  After
returning to the shop I took my bus in to get the camera repaired.  I also
filled out the pay adjustment for the extra hour of work but I doubt if it
makes any different because they already give us hours for extra bus
maintenance.  When I got home I fixed me a snack and then I took a nap, but I
hadn’t but got to sleep when a salesman called.  I then watched a show on TV. 
It was then time to eat and go on my PM run.  Mae didn’t get home until after I
had left.  She has been most of the day buying food for the Relief Society
Super Saterday.  This evening I put the cab on my pickup.  Mae prepared a nice

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
run went well although the loading door jammed and wouldn’t close.  I worked
for some time on the door without any tools.  Lucky for me it was between my
Jr. High and my grade school runs.  When I looked at my watch and realized I
should be on my way for the grade school run I just grabbed the door and jerked
it closed.  It worked alright during the run.  When I got back to the shop, the
door again jammed.  I left it for the shop to repair.  I decided that I need a
screw rive on my bus so brought my new 6-in-1 screwdriver to have on the bus. 
I helped Mae with some of her work as she prepares for Saturday.  My PM runs
went well and I got home shortly after 3PM.  Mae gave me a haircut; we took
showers and went to the Temple.  We met Maggie and Billie Class at the Temple. 
It was a very nice session but by the time it finished I was in quite a bit of
pain.  We then met Maggie and Billie at Golden Corral where we ate and
visited.  When we got home I went up stairs to check on Bob and he was having
some problems but didn’t think he wanted to go to the hospital.  We went to bed
but Bob woke me at 11PM but still didn’t feel that he should go to the
hospital.  I was fairly sure that he would wake me again but he didn’t and he
slept part of the night.</p>

I did get the bed made. Checked on Bob and called David to get his advice about
Bob.  Fed and watered the chickens and cleaned the water out of the refrigerator. 
At 2:30pm Mae called to have me come over and bring her and the left over’s
back home.  We did take a short nap and then went with the Saunder’s to a

his children on the phone.  I then worked on my Life History for a while.  We

used the blower and blow the leaves off the driveway.  We then had some lunch
and I took a 15 minute nap before going on the PM runs.  I talked to Curt about
the DVD recorder for my bus and he asked me to remind him tomorrow.  I hate to
push the maintenance department as they have so many busses that need work
done, but I would like to have the camera and recorder working.  When I got

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
morning runs went well.  After getting back to the shop I talked to Curt about
getting my recorder repaired.  They didn’t get to it today.  Mae and I went to
Impact Gun’s where we tried a Beretta 92FS 9MM semi-automatic pistol.  We each
shot 5 rounds and I hit the target with 4 shots and Mae hit the target with 2
shots.  That was the first time Mae has ever fired a pistol.  We really liked
the way it handles so bought it, plus a holster and gun vault.  We got back in
time for me to eat a quick lunch and then go on my PM runs.  This evening Mae
went to the Relief Society meeting planning meeting.  I stayed home and watched
a couple of TV shows and made capsules.  It seems that we got through those
often.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep well so I got myself off to work this morning.  My am runs went
well.  I took my bus in again to see if they can fix the camera / recorder,
which they did.  I helped Mae with Christmas projects when I got home.  Mae and
I went to the Senior Citizen lunching.  It was ok but really didn’t fit out
diet.  We worked on the Christmas projects again until I left for the PM runs. 
I had one of the 1<sup>st</sup> graders forgot to get off the bus when I got to
her stop.  I called in to the dispatch and told them that Area Campson had
forgot to get off so I would take her home after taking all the rest to their
stop.  She is such a small child that I wouldn’t have seen her if it hadn’t
been for two of the boys asking if she had missing her stop.  It went ok and I
got her home.  After dinner, Mae and I again worked on Christmas projects until
I had to go over to the Church House where Brother Morgan and I held Home
Teacher oral evaluations.  Mae and I also had Tithing Settlement with Bishop
Hatch this evening.  It was after 9PM when I got home so I filled out the
journal entrance and we will go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 4AM and thought it was close to the time the alarm would be going off,
so I got up.  I realized that Mae wasn’t in bed.  When I went to the front
room, Mae had been up almost all night.  We went back to bed for a little
while, then I got up and got myself off to work.  Mae was able to sleep until
almost 9AM.  Mae had just got up when I got home.  I prepared us some
breakfast.  We called Sandi and wished her a Happy Birthday.  We then called
the Co. in California that is trying to get Bob out of his contract on the Time
Share Condominium.  This has sure been an expensive (for Bob) and time
consuming (for Mae) situation.  After that call I went into bed and took a
nap.  I called Murdock Chevrolet and scheduled and appointment to have the
Buick checked out.  This evening Mae went with me and we visited Patriarch and
Sister Johnston.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                The
winds had calmed down and my bus run went well.  This morning we lessoned to
the news, trying to find out if there was any school closers.  We were reminded
that today was the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy.   I still remember the news announcement of the
terrible event.  I am still no more convinced that he was killed by a lone
assassin as we are told, than I am convinced that the destruction of the New
York Trade Towers was not deliberately destroyed by the U.S. Government. 
Between runs I help Mae with the Christmas card mailing lists.  After my runs I
took Mae to S.L. where we met Sandi, JaNae and Chelci and the four of them went
to “Time out for Women”.  Mae will stay with Sandi tonight and then the four of
them will again return to the “Time out for Women”.  I am to go back down and
get Mae at 3:15PM tomorrow.  I tried to find something to watch on TV this
evening but there wasn’t anything.  I have not felt the best this evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
didn’t sleep very well last night.  I tried to find something that I might
watch during those long wakeful hours of nights but as before there wasn’t
anything that was worth wasting time on.  When morning came I thought of things
that I might accomplish.  Our bedroom closet door needs some repair but it is
so cold that I didn’t feel that it would be wise to work outside.  My eyes burn,
so working on the computer isn’t very comfortable.  I did find a show on TV and
watched most of it when I realized that I had to leave in order to drive to
Salt Lake to pick up Mae when the program that she is attending.  Later this
evening as I relaxed the show was replayed and I got to see the ending with my
sweetheart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept the night in the recliner, still feel very uncomfortable with this cold. 
I didn’t attend any of my meetings but did enjoy the Tabernacle Choir
broadcast.  Mae has been so gentle and caring with me.  I really haven’t done
much today except rest and stay in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                The
alarm didn’t work this morning.  I am not sure but I woke early and so set the
timer on the stove.  I woke again before the timer went off so I got up.  My
morning run went well although I took an alternate route to my first stop
because of an accident that held up traffic up.  When I got back to the
compound I filled the bus and before I was finished filling it, Mae arrived.  I
parked the bus and then Mae and I took our car to Murdock’s Chevrolet to have
them repair it.  We stopped at Maverik’s and filled the pickup with gas.  Mae
went in and bought us a medium Frozen Yogurt.  Although we should not eat it we
sure enjoyed it.  The PM run went well.  Mae had Bob bring he over to the bus
compound and then she and I drove to Murdock’s to get the car.  We found out
that we are looking from $3,000 to $5,000 to repair the Buick.  It just isn’t
worth it.  We went into the sales office and visited with Brandon Lomax, KO’s
Sun-in-law.  We also got to visit with KO for a little while.  Brandon showed
us a 2007 Buick Lomax for $10,868 + tax &amp; license.  We drove it home and
are quite pleased with it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
AM run went well.  When I got home Mae and I talked about the car.  I am quite
depressed about the whole car situation.  Bob came down and ask us about the
car.  He wants to have us look at a Buick up at Beutler’s Auto that he had
seen.  We went up because Bob has been telling me about this car for some time
and I know that the only way to stop him was to go see it.  It didn’t impress
me but while there Mr. Beutler showed us a 2013 Chev Impala that really looks
nice and the price seem to be good.  We were quite excited about that car even
though it was almost new.  I still felt that we should wait on it.  When we
came home I was going to call Brandon at Murdock’s and tell him that we were
looking at another car.  He asked if he could do some more checking and call me
back.  I left for work and while I was waiting at the school KO called me and
told me that Brandon had talked to me.  He could get me the same care except it
would be a clean report where the one at Beutler’s showed as reported to have
had repairs.  He also explained other benefits of dealing with a Dealer and he
would also beat the price from Beutlers by $200.  Mae had dinner ready when I
got home.  She also baked bread this afternoon so that she could give them to
Ashley Bennion’s parents.  Ashley’s father had given Mae some copies of a
painting he did, so Mae cooked this bread for them.  This evening after dinner
Mae and I drove back down to Murdock’s and talked to KO.  We decided that we
will have them get us a car.  When we got home we took the bread over to
Ashley’s parents and we got talking for some time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
sure do love my sweet wife!  It was good not to worry about work today.  I
prepared egg omelets for breakfast.  Bob took me to Murdock’s where I got our
pickup.  Mae and I went to Impact Guns where we bought a Britta 9mm pistol,
along with a holster and gun safe.  I cut parts to repair our closet doors.  We
also started getting things put together for tomorrow.  I sure enjoy being with
Mae.  The day sure went by fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
started by getting up at 5:15AM.  Mae prepared breakfast.  I started preparing
the dressing to stuff the turkey.  We soon had the turkey on to cook.  We were
at the church by 11AM and got things ready for dinner.  We were soon under way
so that we could have dinner ready by noon.  We had almost all our family,
except Shellie’s family and Nick, that attended, also Bob and Cole joined us. 
After dinner many played volleyball.  We finished up at 4pm at the church house
and then went to Jeff and Gail’s where we played games and visited.  It was late
when we got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in this morning.  I did go to Bountiful and got a treatment from Dr.
Tune.  That really helped me.  Mae had me take a map after I got home.  The day
sure went fast and then this evening we got together with many of the Porter
Family at Bryce and Deanna’s church building where we visited and played games,
including some basketball and volleyball.  There were many treats there, and I
had to resist many of them.  It was again late when we got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
slept in and then got ready to attend the Temple.  We went first to Murdock’s where
they had our car ready for us.  Just before we got to Murdock’s, Bryce called
and wants to buy our Buick.  We had planned on having Murdock’s get two dealers
to look at it and give us the check for the best offer.  I tried to tell Bryce
of the problems it has and that I didn’t think it was worth it, but he
insisted, so we will take it back home.  The car we had originally talked about
had 23,000 miles but the one we got had 26,000 miles so they gave us $100.00
back rather than redo all the paper work.  We then added a few items, such as
having the upholstery sprayed so that if anything gets spilled on that we
cannot wash out with soap and water, we can take the car back and they will
have it professionally cleaned and if that does not take it out, they will
replace the material.  We also got free oil change and serviced twice a year
for the life of the car.  Mae also wanted the loan for 5 years instead of 3
years so the interest rate went from 2.9% to 3.25%.  We also have the option to
pay it off or pay extra.  We got to the Temple in time for the 1:30PM session. 
After the session as Mae and I met in the Celestial Room, we greeted each other
with a kiss.  A young couple came over and asked if they might ask us a
question.  They had greeted each other with a kiss a previous time at like that
and had a person criticize them.  We told them that whoever said that was
totally wrong to do so.  Elder LaGrand Richards told us that when we are
married, that gives us a perfect right to kiss anywhere and anytime.  Following
the session we went to the cafeteria and bought lunch.  We then had to hurry to
return to Murdock’s for our Buick.  Mae drove the Chevy and I drove the Buick. 
We went to Jeff and Gail’s to tend the children while Jeff and Gail went out to
a movie.  We took the children with us to our place where we stayed for a while
before taking them back home.  When Jeff and Gail got home and the children
were to bed, Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played some games.  It was after 11PM when
we got to bed.</p>
