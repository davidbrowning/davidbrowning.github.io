was after mid-night before we got to bed.  I added to my journal, finishing up
the month of March before we retired.  I woke about 7:30 this morning but Mae
was still sleeping soundly so I let her sleep.  I got us some breakfast ready. 
After breakfast I went out and worked in the rose beds.  Mae came out and
helped me get the weed guard in the one bed.  I started in the front beds and
worked until a rain storm came in.  After lunch I took a nap.  This afternoon
and evening Mae and I worked on our personal histories.  Bob cooked us pork
steaks for dinner this evening.  Mae beat me in a game of Rummy.  She then gave
me a haircut.  I finished this entry and we went to bed.</p>

woke again at 7AM and helped Mae with breakfast.  I then started working on the
rose beds.  Mae came out and help me.  After lunch I took a nap.  Mae when over
to Bodily’s to see Jill’s new baby.  Bob went with me to Peterson Marines where
I got a transducer for my boat.  We then went to J &amp; J Nursery and bought a
yard of bark chips that I put in the Rose Beds.  Bob used the lawnmower to pull
our home made cultivator over the garden to level and compact the soil.  After
dinner I went over to Dee Francom’s where I helped him solve a problem on a
batch that he is indexing.  Scott called me just as I was leaving to see if he
could put his camper in our back yard for a while.  I told him that we could
work something out.  I entered this journal entry and then took a bath before
going to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep well last night and so I tried to let her sleep in.  At 8:15AM the
phone rang.  I tried to get it before it woke Mae but it did before I could get
to it and then it was a sales lady.  I was glad that I got up as I didn’t want
to sleep in.  By the time we ate breakfast it was 9AM before I got started on
my boat.  It was 1PM before we were able to leave for the reservoir.  Bryce and
Deanna met us at the south ramp.  We had lunch and then took the boat out.  We
just enjoyed boating and visiting.  I got the Transducer mounted a little too
low so will have to make some changes.  We came home after 6PM.  It was after
7PM when Scott brought their camp trailer to keep in our back yard for a
while.  It took some maneuvering to get it down the hill.  Kylan and Ashley
stayed overnight as Mae is taking them bowling tomorrow.  We played Sneaks
before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept in the recliner so that Ashley could sleep with Mae.  Kylan wanted to
sleep in the spare bedroom and Ashley was nervous to sleep by herself.   I
helped Mae prepare Skillets for breakfast.  I took Kylan and Ashley with me to
feed the chicks.  Mae then took them to the Syracuse Fun Center where they went
bowling.  I made some changes to the transducer on my boat.  After getting that
done, asked Bob if he wanted to go fishing with me.  We went to the Hyrum State
Park and fished on the Hyrum Reservoir.  Bob caught a fair fish within a few
minutes of being on the lake but it was slow after that.  Bob caught 3 fish and
I caught 2 fish.  We got home about 7:30PM and then put the boat away.  After
Mae and the children finished bowling then she picked up Kaden and Kaitlyn and
took the four of them to Dinosaur Park.  Sandi met Mae at the park and also
brought JaNae, Dawson, Kennedy, Emma plus Chelci’s children Nathan and
Addison.  She said that they all had a good time.  Mae soon had dinner ready
for me when I got home.  She then put our pills together for another week while
I cleaned the fish.  We watched a show on TV while we worked.  I entered this
journal entry and while I did that Mae wrapped a wedding gift for Nikalee
Browning and Nicholes Allen Lawsen who were married April 3 in the Oquirrh
Mountain Temple.  We are going to attend their Wedding Reception tomorrow
evening in Evanston, Wyoming.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night so she slept in.  We got a good rain last
night and it looks like it will continue most of the day.  After eating
breakfast the rain subsided.  Mae and I went to the Bountiful Temple where we
took some of the names from Sister Heydorn provided.  Mae was going to do
Initiatory Ordnances for three Sisters but that area was very busy so she will
try another day.  After returning from the Temple we went out to eat at the
Golden Corral and enjoyed that.  This evening Bob, Mae and I drove up to
Evanston Wyoming to attend the Weding Reception for Nikalee and Nicholes
Lawsen.  Lois and most of her family were there.  It was good to visit with them. 
Bob is sure having a difficult time with his hearing.  When we got home Mae and
I watched a movie on DVD.  Mae is sure a wonderful wife and sweetheart.  She
has a lot of patient and love for me.  Bryce and Deanna loaned us a book to
read, “Odds Are, You’re Going to Be Exalted” by Alonzo L. Gaskill.  It’s very
good and up lifting.</p>

slept in this morning and when we got up we had to hurry to cut Mae’s hair and
then to take showers.  We ate breakfast while we watched the Opening Session of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
haven’t entered anything for a couple of days because it was a busy weekend and
then Mae got after me for not doing more training on the Family History
program.  I have really wondered if the time I spend on this journal and the
information I write is really of any worth.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning as I read my scriptures, 2 Nephi 25, I felt the joy of the Holy Ghost
and an incredible feeling of gratitude for the Book of Mormon.  The previous
chapters of 2 Nephi are the words of Isaiah.  I struggle understanding them but
each time I read thru them I get a better feeling about them.  When I read
chapter 25 this morning it was just like walking through a dark cloud into a
beautiful bright sunrise.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was very tired when I got home this morning so I took a nap.  Mae was informed
about a Genealogy Conference and would like to attend.  I have very mixed
feelings as I feel that the information is way above me.  This evening as we
were eating dinner Mae told me of talking with Gail this afternoon.  Gail said
that she doesn’t understand why when someone leaves the Church, such as Jeff
and David, why they become so upset when someone else wants to believe.  Just
talking about it really depresses me for I just don’t understand how Satan has
got a hold on my boys.  I am sure glad that Mike holds strong.  My girls seem
to have strength in their testimonies but both are having great challenges in
life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
and I both worked on Family History this evening.  I called and had a good

get them ready to print for pedigree charts.  At 6PM Scott and Mishelle brought
their children for us to tend while they went out.  I am still having some
problems printing the pictures.  We tried to get onto the internet to make
reservations at Zion Camp grounds.  We spent quite a bit of time but didn’t get
any done.</p>

woke early concerned about the reservations.  Mae and I got on again at 8AM and
was able to get some spots reserved.  I cooked egg omelets’ for breakfast.  We
showered and then watched a ocean life documentary.  It was good as I was with
my sweet wife.  I attended the Priesthood Leadership meeting of our Stake
Conference.  Mae had dinner ready when I got home and then we attended the
Adult Session of Stake Conference.  Mae and I stayed after conference meeting
for choir practice.  We then went shopping for a few groceries for tomorrow.</p>

slept in until 7:15 before starting to get ready for meetings.  Mae prepared
some breakfast and we left for the church just before 9AM.  All in the Stake
Choir met to warm up at 9AM.  At least that was the plan but many didn’t show
until almost 9:45AM.  Stake Conference was very good and the choir numbers went
well.  I stayed after conference and helped put the chairs away and then I
swept the culture hall and cleaned up some.  Bob prepared lunch for us.  I
helped Mae prepare food for this evening when Scott and his family came over
and Jeff and his family came over.  Scott helped me with Adobe Photoshop and we
started an Ancestral Photo page.  We didn’t have time for me to work on it very
long but maybe I will be able to do it.  It was interesting to have both
families here together but it was a good evening.  We were tired when we went
to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night, mainly worrying about Jeff.  I just wish
that I could shake him but instead, if I say anything that might be religious
at all, he get on the defensive.  My runs went well.  When I got home I made up
four pints of almond butter.  I also took a nap and worked on a picture
Genealogy for Mae.  Mae had to go into the Dr. to get a pre-examination before
for a colonoscopy test.  She got home just before I left for the afternoon run. 
This evening, after dinner, we went upstairs and watched a movie that Bob had
recorded.  Bob popped some corn for us and did everything he could to please
us.  He is so lonely and I am sorry to say that his children doesn’t think to
contact or see him very often.  It is now bed time and I still have to take a
shower.</p>

filled our water jugs and then watched a movie that Bob had recorded.  I had

minute nap while Mae took some bread around to some of the widows in the Ward. 
This evening Bob and I went Home Teaching and saw brother Casey and gave him a
loaf of homemade bread , took a loaf of homemade bread to the Thurman’s

laid down and took another short nap.  We went for a walk before I left for the
PM run.  My run went well and when I returned home I took Mae out to dinner at
the Golden Corral.  We then went to the Home Depot where we bought some
plumbers tape, plastic sheeting and some duct tape.  We then went to Emergency
Supply and purchased a gas valve wrench.  These are all for emergency
preparedness.  We went up to David and Shauna’s for the evening.  We sure
enjoyed the evening with them.</p>

had breakfast with David’s family before coming home.  Tyler left for work
before breakfast this morning.  He is sure excited at the money he is making. 
We talked with David about the safety of the work Tyler is doing.  He is
splitting wood for one of the neighbors here in their area.  The fellow has a
tree trimming and removal service.  Before adding the split fire place wood to
is business he would chip the logs and take it to the dumps.  Now he is
splitting the logs, with a power splitter and bundling them for sale.  He has Tyler
and two other boys doing the splitting and bundling.  The concern is that the
three boys are working as a team, one boy operating the machine and the other
two positing the logs on the machine.  This becomes a timing coordination for
speed and if one person gets out of synchronization for even a second, someone
is going to get hurt.  We stopped at Costco and Good Earth before coming home. 
This afternoon we attended a Musical Drama at the Valley Play House in
Bountiful with Jeff and Gail.  The Title was “Savior of the World, His Birth
and Resurrection” presented by the Layton Utah East Stake.   Jeff was willing
to attend because Trent and his family are in the cast and Trent invited Jeff. 
As the Drama unfolded I just kept praying that maybe Jeff could fill the Spirit
that accompanied the program.  After the program ended Mae and I went back to
Jeff and Gail’s home.  We then tended the children while Jeff and Gail went out
to dinner.  When they returned and the children went to bed, the four of us
played games.  It was almost mid-night when we got home and to bed.</p>

Mae then went Visiting Teaching and I went with Bob to give Sherrie a blessing. 
She really doesn’t look well.  Bob and I then stopped at Sister Fallis’s to
visit with her but she isn’t feeling well so we didn’t go in but just visited
for a minute on the door step.  Cheryl was at our place when we got there so we
visited with her for a little while.  It was good to see her.  Mae and I ate

of May and was told that too many were already taking that day off.  I called
Jeff and we have decided to go somewhere closer and leave Friday as soon as I
finish the bus run.  Mae went with me and we drove over to Sportsman’s
Warehouse to see what lakes they indicate are open.  They have East Canyon on
the board so Mae and I drove up to look at it.  It is very low but you could
launch a boat.  When I got home this afternoon I decided to go to Hyrum State

I have been unable to remember where or who has my cordless drill.  Roy called

8:30PM I went to Brother Morgan’s where we discussed the Ward Cleanup Day.  Mae
was home when I got home so I finished this entry and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
my AM run Mae &amp; I took a walk.  I then took care of the chickens, turned
the secondary water on, worked in the garden and then started setting and
checking out the sprinkler for the lawn.  Mae had lunch ready so we ate and
then took a nap.  Mae had a R.S. Committee meeting to plan the May Activity
meeting.  I went up stairs and watched a show that Bob had recorded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t feel very well this morning so I had her go back to bed and I fixed my
own breakfast.  The runs went well but before I picked up the Jr. High students
this afternoon, I took a field trip.  I took North Layton Jr. High’s track team
to Layton High for a field meet.  There were two buses needed to take them over
but only one to bring them back after the meet.  The other driver said that she
couldn’t do the return so that left me.  I figured the materials needed to put
a chicken wire cover over the chicken run.  This would do two things, 1<sup>st</sup>
it would protect the chickens from hawks and 2<sup>nd</sup> it would keep birds
from eating the chickens feed.  I figured the cost and it would be about $150. 
I am not sure that we can afford that.  It would be nice if we weren’t quite so
tight.  Mae has been busy getting things ready to leave tomorrow.  She did go
with me on the return trip.  Mae was getting our pills together so I played a
game of Harts on the computer and lost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Work
went as normal but when I started for home a battery light appeared on the
dash.  I wasn’t too worried about it so went home anyway.  I filled the car
with gas before going home.  We never had much time so we ate lunch and then I
took Mae to Jeff’s house where she was to meet and she, Gail, and Marci and the
children all met to leave.  They will go as far as St. George and stay over
tonight.  I went on down to work with the battery light coming on when the car
would slow to an idle.  When I finished my run and went to go home, the light
came on again.  I stopped long enough to turn my report in but when I tried to
start the car the battery was dead.  Kirk the head of the shop gave me a jump
and got me going.  I drove straight up to Dee’s and had then replace the
battery.  After getting home I bought some materials to put a cover over the chicken
run.  Jeff was going to help me load the camper onto the pickup but didn’t get
over early enough for us to do it before work so we will try tomorrow.  I
watched two movies on TV before entering this journal entry and going to bed. 
Mae has quite a lot of food prepared for me so that isn’t any problem but I
sure miss her.  She called me when they got to St. George.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
reading my scriptures and having breakfast I went out and started building a
cover on the chicken run.  Scott came over to use the computer and scanner.  He
brought the children over with him.  Jeff came over and brought my tools and
helped me put the camper on the truck.  It really helped having someone that
can move around.  I worked until 5PM but quite because I was getting tired.  I
got some dinner and set up to fill capsules.  I watched “Giant” although I have
a hard time watching Rock Hudson, knowing that he turned out to be gay.  I then
watched “Rio Lobo” with John Wayne.  It was late when I went to bed.  Mae
called me this evening and she is feeling pretty good and is enjoying the trip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke just before 8am and had to hurry to shower and get ready for my High
Priest Group leadership meeting.  After returning home I took care of the
chickens.  Bob prepared lunch by buying a roasted chicken and preparing green
beans, salad and gravy to go with it.  I got a short nap before going to
church.  Meetings were very good.  After getting home I got something to eat. 
Irven called me to let me know that Dalene (Browning) Parker died today at
1PM.  She has fought cansor for two or three years.  I called and wished Corner
a happy birthday.  I also called Mike and wished him a happy birthday.   Jeff
came over and we played some games.  Mae called this evening and we visited for
a while.  I sure miss her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                After
my AM run I went over to Jeff’s and found the problem with his vacuum sweeper. 
I then followed him to Wood’s Auto Repair on Fairfield so he can get his car fixed. 
I took him back home and then I came home and got me some lunch.  I worked on
the chicken run until 1PM and then came in and took a nap.   When I got home
this afternoon bob was mowing the lawn.  I took the lawnmower and did the
trimming plus I gathered up the grape vines that Bob had trimmed off some time
ago.  I then had to repair a sprinkler head.  I got the framing for the chicken
run about finished and quite for the night at 7:30PM.  Mike called and asked if
I could come down and help him with his sprinkler system so I will do that
Wednesday after work.  I texted Mike, before I went to bed, asking him to
getting me (2 cans of Sterling Pre-shave) in Orem.  He said that he would get
it tomorrow.  I tried to find something to watch on TV but there wasn’t
anything.  I will take a pain pill and a mussel relaxer before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke and took a shower before fixing breakfast and going to work.  The Battery
warning light keeps coming on so that worries me.  My run went well but just
before I finished the run the office announced that Utah Highway Patrol are
inspecting buses again and they need 20 bus drover’s at each compound to take
their bus through the inspection.  That set me back an hour to have my bus
inspected.  Although the Check Batter Light is on I went home and worked on the
chicken run.  I didn’t get quite done but went in and got some lunch and took a
15 minute nap before taking the PM run.  After work I stopped at and got the
only receipt that I had and then went to Auto Zone in Roy to see if they had
had another record of us buying an alternator, but they didn’t.  I called Dee’s
and asked if Dee could take another look at the car.  I will take it in to them
tomorrow morning.  Mae called this afternoon but we didn’t have much time to
talk so she called again this evening.  She said that she slept well last night
and today was pretty much a relaxing day.  They will go back to Disney Land
tomorrow and Thursday.  I sure miss her.  With Bob’s help we did get the chicken
run finished.  Bob and I then went Home Teaching to the Thurman’s this evening
and had a nice visit.  I am quite tired and so am going to go to bed just as
soon as I finish this entry.  Good night.</p>
