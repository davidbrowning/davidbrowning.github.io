<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday, October 01, 2013</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mae still slept most of the night in the
recliner.  She did get my breakfast for me and then I had her lay back down for
a little while.  When I got home from my bus run she was preserving pears and
had already preserved a lot of peppers.  I rented a motor lift to set Sherrie’s
head stone.  Bob went with me to the West Point cemetery to set the stone. 
When we got there the one over the grounds came and helped me.  After getting
the grass removed for the location where the stone was to go, the fellow guided
me in with my pickup.  We started to set up the lift and the fellow asked if we
could move it.  I told him that I was concerned with just the two and that Bob
was too old to help.  He called for a couple more men and we just set it from
the truck into the spot.  He then guided me out with my pickup.  We thanked him
for his help and we were finished.  I was home in time to give Mae a kiss
before she took Scott’s twins to Dinosaur Park.  On my PM run a boy tour the
seat cover open.  Another student told me about it and gave me the person’s
first name.  I figured that with the description of the boy’s shirt that I
could easily fine him on the camera recording and could also look at the records
to find the students name.  When I got back to the shop I ask to have the tape
pulled.  We found out that the camera was not working.  By the time we found
out, that the camera was not working, the office was closed, so I could not
talk to Rosa.  I am not sure just what to do now, I will see tomorrow.  Mae had
not returned from Dinosaur Park, when I got home from work, so I worked on my
history.  After dinner we watched a show on BYUTV, before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night but got up and got me off to work.  I did
find out the student’s name the ripped the seat cover.  I wrote him up and will
turn it into the principle tomorrow.  The shop replaced the torn seat, between
the am and pm runs.  I helped Mae prepare pears for drying.  She also cleaned
the camper and I cleaned the chicken coop.  I found where the chickens have
been laying eggs but when we tested the eggs most of them were spoiled.  We are
trying to decide what we are going to do for our vacation.  With the Federal
Government shutting down, it looks like our Zion’s trip is off.  We are also
looking at our furnace.  Whipples are telling us that we need $700 worth of
work done on a 6 year old furnace.  Something is wrong there.  It’s now 8pm and
I think I will go to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
got me off to work this morning.  I was only able to drink chicken broth for
breakfast.  I had a sub-driver ride with me this morning so he could become a
little familiar with the route as he will drive for me tomorrow.  He is also
scheduled to drive for me when we take off on the 10<sup>th</sup> thru the 19<sup>th</sup>. 
Due to the Government shut down we are not sure if we will be able to go or
not.  I talked to Brody about a backup plan.  He said that he was sure that the
parks would be open by then as if not the Government would have to go back on
their payments and we would be bankrupted.  That would send our country into
total caus.  In that case we wouldn’t be able to buy gas to go down anyway.  I
stopped on the way home to buy more chicken broth.  It was on sale so I bought
a case of it.  After getting home Mae and I sliced another batch of pears and
got them in the dryer.  We then harvested our garden as it looks like possible
frost.  We stored about 18 large banana squash, 7 spaghetti squash, 3 honey
due’s, several more peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes.  My pm runs went well.  This
evening Mae and I put up 13 quarts of Italian Stewed Tomatoes.  I also started
the cleanse, before a colonoscopy tomorrow morning.  It was late when we went
to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning at 8:45am Mae went with me and I reported into the Out Patiant of the
Davis Medical Center Hospital, for a colonoscopy examination.  Dr. Wadd Larsen
performed the examination.  The examination was completed and Mae took me home about
11:30am.  Everything seems to be ok.  I slept for a while after getting home. 
This evening Mae, went over to Scott’s and tended their children while Scott
and Mishelle went out for the evening.  I got myself some left over’s and went
upstairs to warm it.  Bob invited me to watch a football game between Utah
State University and BYU.  It was a good game with BYU winning.  Mae came home
at that time and we soon went downstairs and went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up this morning, had breakfast and went up to the Morgan area, where we
watched Connor play in a Soccer game.  Coming home we went grocery shopping
before going home.  We had to lesson to the morning session of general
conference on the radio.  We were able to watch and enjoy the afternoon
session.  I took a nap before I went over to Scott’s.  He and I went over to
his Stake Center, where we watched the Priesthood Session.  Following the
session we went out to eat at Golden Corral.  We enjoyed just being together
and visiting.  When I got home Mae and I watched a show on DVD, “Seven Days in
Utopia”.  It was good but a little out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep well last night.  I tried to let her sleep in but she was in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
bedroom and in there you get the water supply line that makes noise every time
any water is turned on in the house.  We enjoyed watching General Conference,
both morning and afternoon session.  This afternoon we had David’s family come
for dinner.  Mae prepared a wonderful meal and a large meal.  We had a lot of
leftovers.  We all played a card game for a little while before they went
home.  It was sure good to have them come to visit.  I worked on jy journals
for a little while before we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
went into work early so that I could put in for Tuesday afternoon off, but when
I finally got on to the computer the request has to be at least 5 days prior to
the time you want off.  That didn’t do me any good.  My am runs went well and
after I went in to the office to talk to Rosa.  Rosa is off today, so I went to
Roberta.  She told me that she couldn’t do anything until a supervisor approved
it.  Brian is also gone for the day, so I went to Lynn, the supervisor over
Special ED.  She approved it if “”Roberta could find someone for my run.  I
went back to Roberta and she thinks she can cover it.  Mae went to lunch with
Georgia today.  I loaded the camper and then used Bondo to repair an area that
is water damaged under neigh the frame of the camper.  My pm runs went well.  I
stopped on the way home and washed and vacuumed  the car.  I also stopped at
the store and bought some Lamisil cream that David suggested I try using for
jock itch.  Mae soon had dinner ready and then I finished the repairs on the
camper.  We watched a show on DVD before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
didn’t sleep very well last night so she prepared me some breakfast during the
night and I got myself off to work.  I sometimes wonder if our minds don’t
control more of our actions and abilities than we give credit to.  I am sure
that is some of my problems and I wonder if it isn’t part of Mae’s inabilities
to sleep at night.  I am so grateful that I have the Gospel as a light to guide
me.  I just hope I can always hold tight to that Iron Rod.  I had a sub-driver
ride with me this morning to learn the route and she will drive this afternoon
when I am off.  The run went well.  On the way home, I stopped and filled the
car with gas and I also stopped at the store and bought a bottle of Dill Pickles. 
Mae read a report that said that dill pickles stopped acid reflux.  I will try
it.  As soon as I got home, Bob asked me to come upstairs and lesson to his
refrigerator / freezer.  It is making a bad noise.  We pulled the unit out
where I could check it.  I then took the back off but didn’t find the problem,
although it needed cleaning.  I then took the inside to the freezer apart and
found that ice had formed in the blower and was rubbing on the fan blade.  I
was able to get it cleaned up and defrosted and that seems to have taken care
of the problem.  We then had to hurry, as I had Mae give me a haircut, then I
took a shower and got ready.  We left at 12:30 pm to met Dennis and Eleanor in
Clearfield and then go on to Provo where we met Joanne and Ralph, Gary and Ruth
and Pat at Sizzlers for dinner.  We had a good time visiting and eating.  We
got back home about 5pm, after having a wonderful time with special friends.  I
then suggested that we drive up to Hyrum Reservoir to see about going camping up
there.  We found that it looks ok but colder weather is expected.  We also have
to get on-line to make reservations.  That creates a problem because we won’t
know until Thursday morning if Zion’s will be open or not.  If it opens
Thursday, we have to be there for those reservations or lose our money.  If it
doesn’t open Thursday, then they will refund our money and we would have to
then try to get new reservations when it does open.  So we are still at a “WAIT
AND SEE” situation.  What a mess this is!  We drove to Honeyville to check on
Cristal Springs, before coming home.  After shower this afternoon, I put on
cotton one piece Temple Garments.  That was a mistake as by the time we got
home, with the hair on my chess, my skin felt like it was on fire.  We its now
bed time and we are tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
morning runs went well.  Scott called Mae to ask her if she could come and tend
the twins, as Mishelle has another one of her headaches.  I didn’t do much when
I got home.  I got me something to eat, took a nap, watched a movie on TV and
worked on the computer.  We are still up in the air about our Zion Canon trip. 
I don’t think it will be open for us.  Mae came home at 1pm and got her something
to eat and then took Laurel to the Dr. in Bountiful.  I used Bob’s car to get
to work for this afternoon bus run.  When Mae returned she went into Ogden to
see Dolly and then stopped at the Natural Foods for some items.  When I got
home from work I went upstairs and gave Bob his keys.  He turned on a TV show
so I set and watched it with him.  Mae got home just as it finished.  We then
went downstairs and prepared dinner.  We feel sure that the Government shutdown
will not end tomorrow so we made plans to attend the Temple and stay in a motel
in Salt Lake for Thursday &amp; Friday night.  Mae called Grinn and Kathleen
Clark and decided that we would meet them at the Bountiful Temple at 10AM so
that we could attend the 10:30AM session.  She also tried to call Ken and
Vivian Shaw but there was no answer, so she left them a message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up and had to hurry in order to get packed and ready to meet the Clark’s at
the Temple.  Vivian called, before we left, and said that because Ken had an
operation a short time earlier, he couldn’t sit through a session at the
Temple.  But they could meet us after the session at a restraint for lunch. 
Mae and I got to the Temple just before 10AM.   Grinn and Kathleen were waiting
for us.  I really felt the Spirit of the Temple today and was so impressed with
the Session.  We enjoyed visiting with the Clark’s in the Celestial room
following the session.  We followed the Clark’s from the Temple to the
restraint.  Anyway I was almost sure it was their Buick that I was following,
but they went a different way than I have ever gone before.  We made it and
shortly after getting to the Chuck-A-Rama Vivian and Ken came.  Kathleen and
Vivian know each as Vivian is taking swimming lessons from Kathleen.  Grinn had
also met the Shaw’s in the grocery store.  We had also talked about our
missionary experiences with each of them, so they had common knowledge through
us that they both lived in Bountiful.  Any way, we had a wonderful dinner and
visit, talking about missionary experiences.  After leaving the restraint, Mae
and I came to the Hotel 8 at the Salt Lake Airport.  We enjoyed being together
and able to just relax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                David
called us, as well as Jeff texted us, telling us that it was announced that the
Parks will be open tomorrow.  Mae called the Governor’s office and talked to
secretary, transferred her to Doug.  He told us that he felt sure that our
reservations would be honored, but that he would check further and call us
back.  He called us back five times during the day; the last time was 8:30 PM,
still trying to be sure about our reservations.  He felt very sure but; had not
received definite confirmation.   This evening I cut Mae’s hair for her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up at 4:30AM and got packed up.  We left Salt Lake at 6AM, stopping for gas
before we left the city.  We drove as far as Fillmore when we stopped again for
gas.  From there we drove on to Zion’s National Park.  Mae was able to call
Reserve America just before we got to Cove Fort and they confirmed that our
reservations were still waiting for us.  We found that was the case when we
arrived.  The Ranger that checked us in said that we were the 8<sup>th</sup>
one’s to check in.  It really felt neat and yet very strange to see the camp so
empty.  We set up camp and went into town, mainly to see what time Church
started.  After returning from town, I set up our tent to put some items in. 
This evening Mae and I played Rummy Cube and Mae won 3 out 9f 4 games.</p>

slept well last night and got up about 7:30 this morning.  Mae prepared a nice
breakfast and then we got ready to attend Church.  As we walked thru the
entrance gate to catch a shuttle into town, the Ranger said that he had seen a
lot of people, in all kinds of dress go thru the gate but never anyone dressed
like us.  We were in suit and Sunday dress.  We enjoyed the Sacrament meeting
and it was good to partake of the Sacrament.  We enjoyed the testimonies shared
in Fast meeting.  After returning home Mae prepared some lunch while I set up
our large tent.  I got the top frame put together and the tarp fastened on it
when it started to rain, just a little.  I worked on my history for some time. 
Jeff, Gail and their family came about 8PM and we helped them get their camp
set up.  After getting the children into bed Jeff, Mae and I played Rummy Cube
for a while, with Jeff winning.</p>

slept in until after 7AM.  After breakfast we did a little more with getting
our camps settled.  The children enjoyed playing.  We left for the shuttle bus
about 11:45AM.  We went up to the lodge where we got off and then hiked up to
the “Three Emerald Pool’s”.  We were tired when we got back to camp.  Jeff
cooked hamburgers for dinner.  The children enjoyed riding their bikes with their
Dad.  Before the children went to bed, they had to play a game of “Old Pig”
with Grandma.  Then Jeff, Gail, Mae and I played a game of Rummy Cube, which I
won this time.  Mae isn’t feeling very well this evening when we went to bed.</p>

ran a fever most of the night and didn’t sleep very well.  I got up with her
and made the bed on the table area so that she could sit up with pillows to
support her.  She rested better that way, plus it is much more convenient to
get to the rest room.  Mae has been down most of the day so we just relaxed
today.  Jeff and I went into town for a few groceries and to fill one of the
propane tanks.  I visited with the lady at the gas station about the tourist
situation and she said that it hasn’t picked up to much because people are
still concerned about coming and then have the Park’s close again.  Governor
Hubert has only funded the parks for 10 days and then what will happen, no one
knows.  We just hung out most of the afternoon and evening.</p>

got up late and so by the time we were thru with breakfast we just hung out. 
Jeff, Gail and the kids went on a hike on the east side of the tunnel.  I
dumped the sewer storage tank and filled the water tank.  Mae and I then took
showers, which sure felt good to be clean.  We also took naps while it was
quiet.  This afternoon; shortly after 5 PM, Sandi, Chelci, Steve and their
children arrived at camp.  We helped them get the tent trailer set up.  Gail
and Jeff prepared spaghetti for dinner this evening.  After getting dinner
cleaned up and the children down to bed.  Sandi, Chelci, Jeff, Mae and I then
played table games.  Jeff finally gave up and went to bed.  The rest of us
stayed up until almost mid-night playing.</p>

slept in until 8:30AM before I woke.  I have a hard time keeping my patient as
no one seems to be getting things going.  Some of them were planning on hiking
“Angle’s Landing” and I just felt that they should be getting ready to go. 
Sandi is also having trouble with her tent trailer so I went to work with
that.  I first thought it was coming from the front drain that I had forgotten
to close, but then I found that water was leaking from the shower area.  I
disassembled the shower and found a hose that had separated.  By then it was
after noon.  Jeff, Steve and Sandi went on the hike.  I therefore took Gail,
Ben, Rachael, Mat, Chelci, Nathan, Addison and Mae and we went on the “River
Walk”.  Just before reaching “Big Ben” Chelci looked at us and said “there goes
that shoe!”,  Addison stuck her foot out the window and when she pulled her
foot back in the shoe caught on the window seal and pulled it off.  When we got
to “Big Bend” stop, I got off and walked back down the road to find the shoe. 
Just before getting to the previous stop I found Addie’s shoe lying just on the
road.  I then continued on to the previous bus stop and caught the next shuttle
back to “Big Bend”.  Just before starting the walk, we saw Windy, Nathen and
part of their family.  They had just returned from the “River Walk”, along with
walking up through part of the “Narrow’s”.  We visited with them for just a few
minutes before they got on the Shuttle to go back down the cannon.  Just before
we got the beginning of “River Walk”, two Ranger and an ambulances   passed
us.   Part way up the “River Walk”, I carried Addison on my shoulders for a while. 
The children had fun and it was a good walk.  However, it was quite cold.   Jeff
took Sandi and Steve up Angels Landing.  They were later getting back to camp
this evening.  Also, this evening Stewart and Nisha, friends of Jeff and Gail’s
came and also Noland Porter.   Sandi made Tortes for dinner and then most of
the adults came to our camper to play games.  I was tired so I soon went to bed
and just slept through the laughing and games.</p>

went with Mae to help her with the children.  I stayed at camp to work on my

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
got up earlier this morning and after eating breakfast we started packing up to
go home.  Stewart and Nisha left for home, before most of us were up.  It was
11:30AM before we got Jeff’s, Sandi’s and our camps packed up to leave.  Mae
and I Stopped at Me Me’s Café and bought a Crape before going home.  we had
seen the café when we first came and Mae, thinking of Paris and the Crapes we
had there, wanted one.  They were fair but sure didn’t match the ones in
Paris.  We stopped in Cedar City for gas and I took a nap.  We stopped  just
south of Provo again for gas and a Sub-Way before going on.  We stopped at
Jeff’s to unload their camping gear before coming on home.  We unload most of
our things from the camper.  It was mid-night before we finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were late getting up this morning so I didn’t attend High Priest Group
Leadership meeting.  We attended our regular meeting and did enjoy the
Sacrament meeting.  Mae did teach her Primary class.  We had Bob come down for
dinner and had reheated Dutch Oven Chicken.  It was still very good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
morning runs went well.  Gail called me just as I was parking my bus.  I
stopped home and changed clothes and spent the next 2 hours repairing Jeff and
Gail’s sink tapes.  I did get a nap before lunch and taking my pm runs.  Mae
has been very busy getting the washing all caught up.  I kid hr about the magic
draws I have as they just about get empty and then on Mondays they usually open
up full again.  Mae is sure a special wife and I am very blessed to have her. 
After getting home Bob, Mae and I went out to eat at Sizzlers.  I caught my
journal up to date and we went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
runs went well and we had the Bus Evacuation practice for the grade school and
that went very well.  I tried to call Utah Department of Drivers License for
Bob but that just became very frustrating.  I finally convinced him to request
a copy of his Birth Certificate from the State of Idaho.   I did get the camper
unloaded from the truck before I took the PM runs.  I bought chicken feed on my
way home this afternoon.  Mae has sure been busy cleaning house.  We turned the
TV on while eating dinner and watched “The Walton’s”.  I then started filling
capsules and watched TV while doing that.  We enjoy the Walton’s as they almost
always have a good moral to their story.  We then watched a “Bonanza” and
although it was kind of dumb at the close the thought was left, “Why is it
wrong to look to look at a picture of a nude lady, unless it a painting by a
highly esteemed and recognized artist?”   We went to bed about 9:30PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Both
Mae and I slept well last night.  I have been contemplating President Monson’s
article in this month’s Ensign, as I am to use that message for my message as I
go Home Teaching this evening.  It has given me much to think about.  Mae and I
went to the Davis Eye Center and had our annual eye examination.  We stopped at
the Gun Range on Main and Antelope Dr. to see about using their shooting
range.  We found out that on Tuesdays that women could shoot free.  I think we
will do that so that Mae can learn how to fire our shotgun.  We then took some
toys to the D.I. and while there we looked at Men’s suits and found on that
looks quite nice.  It is a new suit and not a second hand one.  We will have to
alter the pant legs.  After getting home from my bus runs, we quickly ate
dinner and then went into Ogden to Sister Neiderhauser’s Mother’s viewing.  We
were there just as it started, so we very able to get back home.  Bob and I
then went Home Teaching to the Thurman’s, the Casey’s and the Johnston’s this
evening.  When I got home Mae told me to call David.  I called him and we
visited for quite a while about going to the Palisade Dam in Idaho fishing.  It
was late when we got to bed.  Mae remembered that she hadn’t taken one of her
pills and she needed to do it a hour before going to sleep, so she stayed up
but I went to sleep.</p>

let Mae sleep in because of her going to bed late.  Mae had my breakfast ready
for when I got up.  My run went well.  When I got home I took a nap and then
went out back and did some remodeling to the chicken nests.  I had to hurry to
get to my PM run but it went well.  After getting home I finished up the work
in the chicken coop and cleaned up my tools and materials.  This evening I
tried to do some research on the fishing trip to Palisade Dam.  I did talk to
Nick, Steve and Brad to see if they are interested.  Nick will be working, so
he can’t go.  Brad and Steve will let me know.  Mae has been working on Bob’s
Trust so that Bruce and Grant will have a copy.  We don’t see any where that we
are listed at all in the trust.  Well it is now time for bed so we will close
this entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept well last night.  Mae had my breakfast ready for me.  I forgot that
Mae wanted the car this morning.  Mae called me just after I left the
compound.  I pulled over and answered the call.  I had her drive the pickup
over and trade for the car.  She took Sister Olson to a Doctor’s appointment in
Ogden.  After getting home I got something to eat and then took a nap.  I went
over to the bank and talked to one of the officers about the concerns we have
about the 2<sup>nd</sup> mortgage take over and she suggested that we get thing
clarified through a lawyer but she couldn’t recommend one.  Mae got home just
before I had to leave for the PM run.  When I got home I tried to get help
through Comcast in repairing our internet connection.  After 1 ½ hours and
three times failing to get the help I needed I gave up, being very frustrated with
Comcast.  Mae and I worked in the garden trying to get it cleaned up for the
winter.  Mae went over to Jeff and Gail’s to tend their children while they
went out for the evening.  I worked until almost dark and quite for the day.  I
got something for dinner and watched the BYU vs Boise State football game.  Mae
got home shortly after the game was over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up about 5AM.  We had breakfast and I went out and started cleaning up the
garden.  Mae got the dishes done up and then came out and helped me.  It didn’t
take us very long until I was ready to go to the dump.  After getting the
pickup loaded, we looked for my glasses, and I also got Mae to help me look. 
Jeff called to tell me that he would come down and help me load the trash but I
told him that it was done.  Then, Jeff ask me if I could help him remove a tree
at Gail’s mothers.  I said that I would meet him at his Mother-In-Law’s.  Before
going there, I went over to Casey’s to see if I had dropped the booklet “Three
Degrees of Glory”, by Melvin J. Ballard.  As soon as I walked up to the door I
saw it lying on the steps.  Jeff and I were able to pull the tee out, for
Gail’s mother, with my pickup.  Jeff went with me to the dumps.  After we paid
the dumping fee and pulled in, we realized that the lady had given us too much
change back.  We went on to the dump site and as we went too pulled the second
bunch of tomato vines off, I saw my glass case and glasses laying there.  What
a coincident that was.  When we finished unloading the pickup we realized that
we were missing a tie down strap.  After pulling out of the dump, I stopped the
truck and Jeff went back to see if he could find the strap.  I went back to the
pay station and told the lady that she had given us too much change back and
paid her the other $5.  She thanked me for catching her error.   We went back
to Gail’s mothers.  Jeff checked my lap top out and can’t find the problem.  It
looks like I will have to take it in for repairs.  I took a short nap after
going home.  Roy called to tell us that Linda is in the hospital.  He had to
have them take her in an ambulance.  At this time they still have very little
diagnostics, except that one Dr. said that she was drinking to much.  I told
him that I would call back to see how she is doing.  This evening we met with
all our children, grand children and great grand children except for Shellie’s
family, at the Bowling alley at Tooele Army Depot.  There we enjoyed a Family
Halloween Party that Sandi had planned.  Almost everyone had on costumes’ and I
had no trouble identifying each, except for one.  Ashley came in as a geek. 
She had her hair in pig tails and wore slightly large glasses, but she also
walked in with Mattie and Jessie and when they came in I wondered why they
brought a friend with them.  It wasn’t until the party was half over before I
ask Sandi, “Who is the girl with Mattie and Jessie?”  As soon as she said
Ashlie, it hit me like a light bulb.   The night was a lot of fun.  On the way
home we finished reading the talk given in 1922, at the Ogden Tabernacle, by
Melvin J. Ballard.  It is a great talk giving the reader a lot to think about,
but it did depress me as I thought about some of my children.  We got home
about 9:30PM.  Mae gave both Bob and I a haircut.  We then showered and went to
bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
enjoyed relaxing in bed this morning but I hated getting up.  Mae cooked us
waffles for breakfast.  I attended the High Priest Group Leadership meeting. 
When I got home Mae was about ready to go to Rick and Georgia’s Ward, so that
we could hear them give their talks before they leave to serve a mission in the
Alpine Swiss mission in Austria.  They both gave very good talks and both have
very good ability speaking the German language.  We enjoyed going to their home
after the meeting to eat and visit.  We came home in time for Mae to attend the
choral practice for our coming Stake Conference.  I called Roy to find out how
Linda is doing.  She is home from the hospital but Roy didn’t feel the hospital
staff did or know much.  Mae got home a little after 6:30PM.  We watched a show
on DVD before going to bed.</p>

I had lost several months of my 1970 – 1975 journal entries.  Boy was I about
sick.  We have decided that we will have to take my laptop into the shop for
repairs.  </p>

didn’t sleep the best last night so after returning from my bus run, I took a
nap.  Mae and I ran several errands after I woke up.  We took my laptop
computer to Staple’s to have it repaired.  We picked up some capsules at Mary’s
Health store.  We then bought some emergency preparedness items at Cal Ranch. 
We then stopped at Maddox’s and bought some chicken for our lunch before I took
my PM runs.  When I got back from the PM runs we worked on our 72 hour
emergency preparedness kits.  After dinner Mae had a R.S. Committee meeting and
it sounds like she accepted a lot more responsibility.  I got a little upset as
Mae just keeps taking on more things to be over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                In
between my Jr. High run and my grade school run I texted all our children,
asking them to help to help their Mother with some of the Family planning.  I
let them know that I am concerned that she was doing too many projects and
asked and asked them to help.  I included Shellie in the text distribution, of
the request, so that she wouldn’t come back saying that I hadn’t included her
in.  as it turned out, I guess I just stuck my foot in things.  Oh well, I will
just try to do the best that I can to help Mae with all she does.  After
finishing my morning runs, I stayed and took my annual driving evaluation.  It
went well and I passed ok.  When I got home I got myself something to eat.  I
then helped by putting the dishes in the dishwasher.  Mae and I then picked the
concord grapes.  We then had some lunch and I took a short nap.  My PM runs
went well.  when I got home I cleaned the chicken coop, mowed the lawn and
swept up the leaves, dumping them on the garden area.  We called Steve Smith
and he came over and got the grapes.  I gave them to them as our children don’t
want them and it is worrying Mae to have them just go to waste.  Bob had
recorded the movie “Quigley Down Under” so I went upstairs and watched it with
him.  Although I have seen it several times, I still enjoy the movie.  After I
wrote this entry, we went to bed.</p>

runs went well today and as I took the children home this afternoon I gave each
one a Trickier Treat candy as they got off the bus.  One of the students in the
back of the bus spilled a drink and so I had to clean my bus when I got back to
the compound.  In between my runs, Mae and I did some more shopping and then
again after dinner we still went looking for more things.  We sure have fun
spending money although most of it went for emergency preparedness supplies and
Christmas gifts.  I got pulled over by a police officer because I didn’t move
into the left lane when I passed an officer that had pulled someone else over. 
He didn’t give me a ticket but just warned me.  It is sure fun being with Mae.</p>
