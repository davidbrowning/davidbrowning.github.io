didn’t sleep very well so we didn’t get going very early.  When Mae got up we
had breakfast and then Kylan and I were going to go fishing.  Mae decided to
come down with us but she went back to camp early, not feeling the best.  Kylan
caught two fish with one of them quite nice size.  We played games again when
we came back to camp.  This evening we again went fishing and Mae came down
with us.  We brought a folding camp chair with us so Mae could sit and read. 
She also went for a walk and on the walk she had a little 3 or 4 year old boy that
started talking to her.  He said to her, “You are a little lady, aren’t you.” 
Mae got quite a kick out of that.  Kylan and I caught two fish each before we
went back to camp.  Mae came back to camp before Kylan and I did, so she could
start dinner.  After dinner I believe we did play another game before going to
bed.  Kylan sure enjoyed all the meals Mae prepared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
weren’t sure when Scott and his family were coming so we stayed around the camp
site most of the time.  We did take a walk around the pond.  It was after 3PM
when they came.  We changed spots with them and then roasted hot dogs for
dinner.  It was after 6pm when we left.  We stopped in Payson and filled up
with gas.  We had to go to another station to use a Dump Station.  There was an
older man there that kept the hoses rolled up and picked up things.  For his
pay they let him sleep in the shop.  He had no home or family.  Mae visited with
him while I was busy and found out that for money he held a sign up asking for
hand outs.  When it gets cold he travels south to warmer places.  I wondered
since as to what purpose a person like that has in life.  It was late when we
got home and then had to unpack.  We took showers before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
attended the viewing and funeral of Sherrie Young this morning.  I was
surprised at the number that supported the funeral.  The ward sure helped with
everything and the funeral was very good.  I had been asked to dedicate the
grave.  The Ward had a lunching for all family and friends that wanted to
return after the funeral ended.  My boys didn’t want to attend but Mae and went
back.  Just as we were setting down the boys returned.  That sure pleased me. 
It was very enjoyable to visit with all the family, friends and Ward members
that provided the services.  After the lunching Mae and I went shopping for
groceries for a Dutch oven cook out at Jeff and Gail’s.  We had a nice time and
everyone seemed to enjoy the food.  It was 11PM before we got home.  Mae told
be, before we went to bed, that Irven and Sandy had picked several of our
squash.  They didn’t realize that they were not ripe yet.</p>

woke about 2:30am and was up for some time.  I stand all amazed at the love
Jesus has for me.  I can’t help asking why me?  Why have I received so much? 
We have had a lot of setbacks and have lost a lot money in job losses, moves,
investments and in bad dealings with dishonest people we thought we could
trust, yet we are blessed in so many ways.  I did fall asleep for a little
while before Mae woke me to hurry to attend the High Priest’s leadership
meeting.  I got a short nap before we attended our Ward’s Block program.  Mae cooked
dinner this afternoon but Roy and Linda did not come.  Roy had taken David’s
advice and saw a Dr. concerning the sour on his toe.  The Dr. told him that he
had to change his eating habits or he wouldn’t live another 5 years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up and went into the Church cannery in Ogden.  We worked from 6AM to 9AM
canning beans.  My assignment was pretty easy as two of us just kept a couple
of machines clean out from the trimmings.  it was a very enjoyable experience. 
I was especially impressed with the modern processing equipment they have
compared to what we had when we lived in Ogden 54 years ago.  I stayed after
our shift was over and purchased some canned beans, dark turkey chunks and some
beef chunks.  I stopped on the way home and bought a watermelon for the Porter
Family Annual Reunion.  Mae was ready to leave when I got home.  She is tending
Jeff and Gail’s children this week while Gail goes to Girls Camp.  I worked in
the garden and yard until 5PM and then spent the r evening at the reunion.  I
stayed with Mae at Jeff’s.</p>

came home and worked in the garden and yard.  At 11:15am I went over to the bus
shop and bid on a route for this year.  Of course my bus and route were already
taken by the time it was my turn to bid.  I then went up to Irven and Sandy’s
and worked until 6PM on their sprinkler system.  Roy came there just as we were
quitting.  He came home with me for the evening and stayed the night.  I
believe that at 6:36PM Maggie Lorraine Seymore came into this world as the
first child and daughter of Garrett and Nora Seymore.  She will be our 6<sup>th</sup>
Great-Grandchild for Mae and I.  Both mother and child are doing very well. 
Shellie is sure happy to be a Grandmother!</p>

slept until 7am and then got me some breakfast and put some water on the lawn. 
Yesterday, I visited with a fellow from Scott’s Lawn Service and he said that
out lawn would go into dormancy but if we continued to put water on when we
could the lawn would go into dormancy but it would come out of it next spring.  Roy
slept quite late so I couldn’t get in to get a work suit.  Bob and Kathy
visited with me about a grave stone for Sherrie.  We also searched for a car
rental for Roy.  I took Roy over to the Ogden Airport but Budget Car Rental is
only there on Friday and Saturday’s but their main office is on 36<sup>th</sup>
and Washington Blvd.  It was after noon so I bought me some lunch before going
to Irven’s.  I worked there until after 5PM and then a widow that lived up the
street needed someone to check out her sprinkler system so I spent a half hour
or so there.  Sandy paid me another $300.00 for the work I have done for them. 
When I came home I went up stairs to use Bob’s micro-wave to heat my dinner. 
We ended up watching two shows Bob had recorded.  It’s almost 11pm so I had
better get to bed.</p>

worked over at Irven’s again this morning.  This afternoon Mae and I went up to
the Stake girls camp where we worked with two other couples and we prepared the

to Jeff’s.  The children had already gone to bed so Mae, Jeff and I played
fames before going to bed.</p>

took a shower this morning.  Mae made breakfast for us and then I went back to
Irven’s and adjusted three sprinkler heads for them.  I then met Roy over in
Riverdale where he returned the car that he had rented.  I then stopped and
bought me a new fishing real.  I invited Roy to go fishing with me in the
morning but he didn’t feel that he could.  At 5:30PM Mae and I had planned on
leaving for Tooele.  Scott and his family came to borrow a drill bit, so that
took a few minutes before we got away.  We got out to Tooele just as the concert
was starting.  This is the group that Chelci sings with.  They are called “Exit
99” and they played and sang for an hour.  It was very good and we were so
proud of Chelci’s performances.  It was late when we got home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
got up early and picked Kylan up at 5am.  From there we went up to David’s and
got Connor and then we went up to East Canon Reservoir fishing.  Within a
couple of minutes after starting to troll Kylan caught a nice fish.  He had
trouble getting it to real in and called for my help.  We couldn’t get the real
to work so I just pulled the line in by hand.  The fish was hooked well enough
that we got it in.  I traded poles and I worked on the one he was using.  Kylan
soon had another fish.  I realized that it was the large set of pop gear that
was attracting the fish so I had Kylan trade poles with Connor and then Connor
caught the next fish.  Fishing was good and we soon caught our limit of eight
fish.  We all traded back and forth, not only fishing poles but also driving
the boat.  When Connor was driving the boat he had more fun watching the fish
finder than the driving.  After getting out limits I let Kylan drive the boat
around at the lake at higher speeds, which he really enjoyed.  We then took the
boat in where we wiped the boat down and then we cleaned the fish.  I taught
Connor how to clean fish so he and Kylan cleaned the fish while I filet them. 
When we started home there was a bike race going through Morgan and police
officers had blocked of some of the main road and detoured us a different route
plus we had to wait at one area for several minutes before we could go on.  We
took Conner home and then I didn’t have time to take Kylan home so I took him
with me and we met Bob, Kathy, Lisa, Eric, Cole, Robert, Roy and Linda at
Chuck-A-Rama in Ogden for dinner.  Irven and Sandy didn’t make it.  It was good
to be with those that did make it and we missed those that were not able to
come.  We had dinner together today as some are leaving to return home after
coming up for Cherri’s funeral.  After getting home Mae and I took a nap.  We
then mainly relaxed the evening.  Mae did cut my hair and after showering we
watched two more serious of the “Downton Abey”.  It is quite an interesting
story.  I sure love being with Mae!</p>

I had a hard time getting up I attended Stake General Priesthood meeting at
7am.  After the opening of the meeting the Aaronic Priesthood and all leaders
in the Aaronic Priest separated and the rest of us under the direction of
President Puffer continued a discussion about Priesthood Keys, Priesthood Power
and Priesthood Authority.  I was very impressed with the teachings we
received.  After the meeting we met as a High Priest Group leadership to
discuss our upcoming social.  When I returned home, Mae and I had a nice egg
omelet for breakfast.  I then took a nap.   We attended the block meetings. 
They were very good.  In Sacrament meeting Brother Hammand of our High Counsel
spoke and did an excellent job.  Bob invited us up for dinner and that was sure
good.  </p>

and started fishing just about sun up.  We fished all day catching 4 fish that
we could keep and let a couple go.  We came in to dock after 4PM and soon
started for home.  It was late when I got home, having departed with Nick where
we had met this morning.  After getting home and having dinner, I then cleaned

Wedding and Sealing of our Granddaughter Tayler Paige Browning to Garrett
Kirschbaum.  The Sealer gave some very special instructions to Paige and
Garrett prior to Sealing them together as husband and wife for Time and all
Eternity.  Following the ceremony pictures were taken outside the Temple.  Following
that, family and friends were invited to a lunching.  It was a very nice
dinner, however there was very little except a green salad that Mae, Sandi and
I could eat.  Mae, Gail and Sandi did a little shopping after the dinner.  Mae
and I then went to Costco for a couple of items and then we found a quite park
where we took a nap in our recliners.  We then went to a reception held at the
home that Paige did the interior design for.  It was a very modern design but
not what I would have wanted.  It was late when we returned home and soon went
to bed.</p>

Georgia left and went up to Camper World at Coleville for a couple of days. 
After returning home I watered part of the garden.  Bob and I then went looking
for new mower blades for the lawn mower.  We had to order some in.  We found
another set that we had bought when we bought the lawn mower and installed
them.  Bob and I then mowed the lawns.  I had just finished and about talked
myself into going fishing in the morning, when Jeff called and said that he had
my furnace for the camper and he would bring it over and help me install it. 
It was about 9PM when I came in.  I watched two western shows on TV and caught

with a few other errors.  This evening I watched a couple of shows while making

through an Endowment session.  We enjoyed the new film, although I have enjoyed
the first film just as well.  It is sad that the 2<sup>nd</sup> film had to be

got up just before 7AM and found that Mae hadn’t sleep very well again last
night.  I am concerned as to know what to do for her.  We quickly got some
breakfast and I went to the vegetable stand on 800 N 2000 W where I bought 5
dozen ears of sweet corn for the High Priest social this evening.  I bought a
bag of ice on the way home.  I shucked 1 dozen ears and then Mae had me help
her pick the strawberries.  Before we finished Morgan and Glenn walked out to
the garden and spoke to us.  They along with Charles and Karen had come over
and completed the chucking.  We hadn’t even heard them.  I picked a Honey Dew
but it wasn’t ripe yet, so I fed it to the chickens.  I also picked a Banana
Squash that weigh 32 lb.  We cut it up and gave most of it away to neighbors. 
After lunch we took a nap.  I slept about 20 minutes but Mae was able to sleep
for a couple of hours.  She needed the rest.  I did some gardening and put the
ladders away.  I also got the lights in the chicken coop working on a timer. 
This afternoon I visited the Casey’s and the Johnston’s giving them some squash
and inviting them to the High Priest social.  I also stopped at Sister Fallis
and left her some squash but no one answered the door so I just left the squash
in a bag on the door.  We went down to the 800 N. Street Chapel’s bowery to set
up for the High Priest Social but the winds were so strong that we moved it to
our Chapel in the recreation hall.  The social went very well but several
families were missing.  When we got home this evening Mae and I watched a show
on DVD before going to sleep.</p>

down to the BYU stadium at 7:45AM and then road a shuttle bus to the campus. 
We attended various classes, which were very interesting except for the final
class which I really didn’t understand it at all.  We went to Costco where we
got a salad for dinner and met Mike there so he could show us some Electronic
Notebooks.  We also looked at the ones at Best Buy.  We finally decided to wait
over night and think about that kind of purchase.  We stayed at Mike and
Becky’s this evening.  Mike showed us some things about our computer and Ipod.

the lap top for notes today to see how that works.  The battery was well gone
when we used it for an hour.  Mae kept the rest of her notes on paper.  We
enjoyed the classes today, but I wonder how long I remember the things we were
taught.  After the last class we went to the BYU Book Store to look at the
Tablet Computer’s.  They have the I Pod 3 on sale for $479.00 so we bought it. 
On the way home we stopped at Sizzler and had dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>After
getting home to Mike and Becky’s, we showed the computer to Mike and then he
helped us set the computer up.  We were late getting to bed do to working on
our new computer. </p>

didn’t sleep the best last night and so I didn’t feel very good today.  We
enjoyed the class today although I didn’t like the one media class.  We met and
visited for a few minutes with Marna and Mark McPhee in between one of our
classes.  We got back to Mike’s about 6PM.  I laid down while Mae got us some
dinner ready and fell asleep as soon as I did.  Mae had to wake me for dinner. 
Mae and I played games with Mattie and Jessie before they went to bed.  We took
showers and soon went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
were later leaving for BYU this morning.  As we drove we each expressed
questions as to whether or not to attend today.  Both of us were tired and
suggested that maybe we should just turn around and go directly home.  By then
we were getting close to the campus so I continued to drive on.  We decided to
maybe attend just 1 or to sessions and then we would go home.  Today was
probably the best day of the week.  We stayed until 4:05PM and then left for
home.  We stopped at Lowe’s to use their rest rooms, then at Kmart for a couple
of items and then we got us a salad at Sub-Ways that we ate on the way home.  We
were tired so soon went to bed.</p>

got up and went to a meeting at 845AM but when I got there I found out that it
was for Bishops Only.  I enjoyed going back home.  we got the garden weeded and
harvested 3 cantaloupes, a bucket of tomatoes, a bucket of cucumbers, a small
dish of strawberries, several zucchinis, of which several went to the
chickens.  I got water on the garden and it did rain a little.  We also went
shopping for a few items.  While we ate dinner we watched a show on TV.  We
went to bed early.</p>

of BYU Education Week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
has been a great experience and in some ways almost over whelming.  We have
felt hourly the Spirit of the Lord.  As I related to one Brother, that the
closes synario that I could relate this experience to, was a story that I
remember from when we lived in Ogden, Mount Fort Ward.  It was told of a dear
Sister that came home from attending Church and as usual, there was the young
man that, he and his new family lived in this Sister’s basement apartment.  He
was out washing and polishing his car.  It seemed that he always had thing that
took president over attending church meetings.  She walked over to the young
man and tool him the she missed having he and his family attend Church.  He
asked her why?  Then to make his point he continued.  I see you attend every
week.  And she agreed, that she did.  Then he continued by asking, “What do you
gain for your weekly attending meetings.  Do you remember what the
announcements that was given?  To this she thought and said that the Bishop had
given several but she just couldn’t recall what they were.  He then asked, “Who
gave the opening prayer?  Again she remembered that the prayer was very sincere
but she couldn’t remember who gave it.  He then ask what was the sermon was
about, and who gave it?  To this she thought and reluctantly said that it was a
very good sermon but she couldn’t recall the speakers name or the title of his
talk.  See said the young man, you can’t recall any of the meeting, so what
good does it do you to attend each week.  The Sister thought for a minute and
then asked the young man if he would use the hose in his hand and fill the
wicker basket there with water.  The young man laughed and replied that you
couldn’t fill a wicker basket with water as it would run right out as fast as
you put it in.  To this the Sister replied, I know, but the basket would be a
lot cleaner.  This is the way I felt at the end of this week.  One speaker told
us that if we would do the weekly and daily spiritual items that our leaders
are asking us to do that we would be a closer to the Lord and would never fall
away.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke with the alarm so hurried and shut it off.  I let Mae sleep in.  When I
started getting my breakfast I found that the refrigerator was leaking water. 
I am not sure just why it does that but I cleaned it up before getting my
breakfast.  Mae woke just before I left for meeting.  Meeting went well and
Morgan apologized for our attending the meeting Saturday morning but he said
that he never remembered hearing that the meeting was for the Stake President
and Bishop only.  Glen and Morgan also went over and then came back home.  In
our meeting this morning I bore my Testimony of the importance of our daily and
weekly religious practices.  Glenn said that we could quote him as he said that
within the next three years, prices of a cam of vegetables would cost $5.00 or
more.  I do feel that we are in for some very hard times.  We attended our R.S.
and Priesthood meeting and then Mae and I came home and took a nap.  We were
both very tired.  We did enjoy our sacrament meeting and I stayed awake the
total time.  After Sacrament meeting ended, Mae and I went Visiting Teaching
and Home Teaching to Sister Lesley Fallis.  We stopped home and Scott and his
family were here to put their trailer in the back yard.  Even though I didn’t
help him it took a few minutes.  It was almost 5:50PM when we got to David and
Shauna’s home.  Shauna had a nice dinner ready.  We enjoyed visiting and then
we played games with all the family.  It was late when we got home but I still
got to bed at a fair time.  </p>

didn’t sleep the best as I was concerned with my bus run this morning.  My run
went well.  When I got home I worked on my bus route binder.  The grade schools
got out early today so I had to go in shortly after noon for that schedule.  We
had a wait for the Jr. High’s to get out so it gave me time to do some cleaning
of my bus.  This bus isn’t the bus I had last year but I guess that is the way
things go.  I may have a couple of changes that will need to be made in my
route.  I went over to Irven’s after work and helped him set the timer on their
sprinkler system.  Mae has sure been busy, with house cleaning, watering the
garden, picking more tomatoes, doing washing and making tomato sauce.  I helped
her with I could but I finally went to bed as I will get up early to drive bus.</p>

let Mae sleep in as she didn’t get to bed until almost 2AM.  My bus route went
very well this morning and as I told Mae when I got home, I didn’t even hear as
much as a “Dam” from the Jr. High students.  The grade school children were a
little noisy but not bad.  I stayed after I finished my route to talk to Rosa
but there was too many waiting to see her, so I got some supplies, washed my
bus and came home.  I had a little to eat, put the tomato paste away and took a
nap.  David brought his trailer over to store in our back yard.  Mae went into
Nancy for a checkup and to get some items for Sandi.  She then met Sandi in
Bountiful and they went out for lunch.  My afternoon runs went well and I
stayed after for an extra 1 ½ hours in order to talk to Rosa.  I think she will
get my route sheets straightened out.  Mae got home just before I went with
Morgan to visit Sister Olsen and Brother Sears.  That was an experience.  Mae
and I visited for a few minutes and I entered this entrance before we went to
bed.</p>

out and helped him.  We spent the rest of the evening working in the yard.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                My
runs went quite well this morning, although I feel that they really didn’t
think about the route and the bus route together.  It is really a dangerous
situation trying to get across Hwy 89 without enough power.  Mae has been
cleaning house and putting up peppers in the freezer.  She had quite a few
things for me to take to the D.I. this afternoon.  On my PM run, I was just
ready to leave the Jr. High when dispatch asked if I could take some extra
children home.  I told them I could if they covered my Elementary Run.  They
said that they would.  By the time I found the students they were already on
another bus.  I didn’t take them but it put me 10 minutes behind on my time. 
When I finished my run, I tried to check to see if my Elementary Run had been
covered but I couldn’t get an answer out of Dispatch so I went to the school
and the children were still waiting.  I took them home but I had some concerned
parents because we were so late.  I guess it turned out ok in the end but it
was a little nerve racking.  I took the items to the D.I. and looked at their
suites.  Traffic was bad getting home.  Mae cooked a nice dinner of fish this
evening.  She was quite busy this evening with other people.  I watched a cute
show on the Hall Mark channel, while I filled capsules.  It’s late and I am
tired so good night.</p>

didn’t sleep very well last night but got up shortly after I did.  She made
breakfast of hot cakes and eggs.   I often wonder how I was ever blessed with
such a wonderful wife!!!  My morning runs went well although I am still very
concerned with the safety of the crossing Hwy. 89 with the school bus.  After I
got home Mae soon left to spend the rest of the day, 1<sup>st</sup> taking
Scott’s twins out to McDonald’s, then to get her hair done and then to tend
Jeff’s children.  It was very late when she got home.  My afternoon runs went
well.  I gave the students treats just to express thanks for what good youth
they are.  My Jr. High youth are so different from last year’s Jr. High youth
were.  My only concern with this route is the danger of crossing Hwy. 89.  Bob
prepared dinner for he and I.  I watched some TV but the only thing that was
worth watching was the show “Facing the Giants” which we have seen before but
it is a very good story.  There wasn’t much else on TV but I stayed up until
Mae came home at 11:50PM.</p>

made extra so that I would have some in the freezer while she is gone.  We
worked around the house, with Mae doing quite a bit of house work.  I watched a
Western show on TV.  I felt a little guilty but Mae insisted that she wasn’t
doing much and that I should relax.  We left for Salt Lake about 5PM, stopping
at Rick and Georgia’s to return a DVD that they had loaned to us.  We met
Sandi, Nick, Dawson and a friend of Dawson’s at the Salt Lake Bees ball park. 
Nick gave us tickets for the ball game.  The game was between the Bee’s and
Reno Nevada team.  He Bee’s were ahead the first 4 innings but then the Reno
team caught up and before the end of the game Reno won12 to 8.  Following the
game they had a Fire Works display that was very impressive.  It was late when
we got home and went to bed.</p>
