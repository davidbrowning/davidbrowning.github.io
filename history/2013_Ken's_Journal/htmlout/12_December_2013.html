<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
got up about 7AM but I had woke early and went back to sleep in the recliner in
the front room.  I woke shortly after 8AM.  I attended my High Priest
leadership meeting at 9am and then after that Brother Saunders and I held a
Priesthood Interview with Brother Mark McPhie.  That went very well.  After
getting home I studied to give a lesson in High Priest Group meeting.  Mae
worked most of the morning preparing for her Sunday school lesson.  We drove
the new car to church this afternoon.  My lesson went fairly well.  Mae said
that her lesson went well.  I bore my Testimony during Fast and Testimony
meeting this afternoon.  After meetings we stayed for choir practice.  Sister
Saunders needed a ride home so we took her home and then stopped at Isaac &amp;
Becky Casey’s and gave them an invitation to attend the Ward Christmas Party. 
After getting home we got some dinner and ate upstairs with Bob.  We took the
food up there so he didn’t have to come down the stairs.  This evening I spent
the time catching up my journal.  It seems that the past few days have been so
busy that I have got behind on my daily entrance.  I have got to go back to
driving school bus in the morning so I had better get to bed.</p>

didn’t sleep well last night so I got myself off to work.  My AM runs went
well.  I stopped at the store to get a few items for Mae before going home. 
Mae and Bob helped me and we got the leaves picked up as it looks like we are
in for some snow.  I also got the garden tilled again and tilled all the leaves
into the soil.  That is now ready for snow.  Mae got some lunch and then she
and I took a nap before I went for my PM runs.  It still hadn’t snow by the
time I returned home so I went out and made some parts for our closet door.  We
have a hen that wants to set again, so maybe I will put 6 eggs under her and
see what happens.  We brought in the Christmas decorations this afternoon so
Mae is now putting them up, as I type this entry.  We watched a Hallmark show
while eating diner.  I am tired so am ready to call it a day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was a little late on my routes due to bad weather.  After finishing my morning
routes I drove the Chevy to Murdock’s to have them treat the upholstery and paint
with stain guard.  They let me take a Chevy truck back home.  On the way home,
as I went under the Hwy 89 exchange, a rock hit the windshield and chipped it. 
I talked to the insurance Co. and they said it was covered on our insurance.  I
told the service manager about it when I went back to get my car.  I worked on
our closet door for a while before going back for the car.  This evening I
again worked on the door and finished the repairs to it.  I talked to JaNae to
see if Brad would be interested in the Buick.  I have mixed feelings about just
giving it to them but maybe that would be best.  Both Mae and I are tired
tonight and ready for bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
had just got to sleep when Dolly called.  She just wanted to visit with Mae.  Mae
had called her just a little while before we had gone to bed and she had got
thinking of something that they had talked about.  Well, Mae wasn’t able to go
back to sleep until after 1AM.  I got myself off to work and let her sleep in. 
It was 11 degrees when I got to the bus compound.  My bus started ok but my
flash light broke so I had to stop in at the shop and get a new one.  Mae was
just getting up when I got home.  We had some breakfast together and then I
took a nap.  I worked on securing my pistol safe.  I have been thinking of
selling my tools and tool trailer but then when I have a handyman job to do I
don’t know what I would do without them.  After dinner this evening I finished
installing my pistol safe.  I then cleaned up some pictures for Mae, so she can
put them on a picture pedigree chart.  We were later getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
woke at 3:15AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I did lay down in the recliner
and then got me some breakfast, when Mae got up.  She had me lay back in the
recliner for a little while.  I believe that I did go to sleep for a few
minutes.  It was 14 degrees when I started the car and 9 by the time I got to
the compound.  I had to add antifreeze to the bus radiator again.  My runs went
well.  Roberta asked for help with Jr. High basketball transportation this
afternoon.  I called her and told her that I would if I could get a schedule
that would coin side with my regular routes.  We worked that out and so I took
the Sunset Jr. High to Kaysville Jr. High at 2PM, and then picked them up at
4:30PM to return them to Sunset.  Scott came to our place to have lunch with
Mae and I.  About 12:30PM Mishelle called and is suffering with a Migraine and
so I took Mae over to the West Gate of Hill Field and Mae drove her to our
place for her to rest.  I went on from there to the bus runs.  Everything
worked fine with the field trip and I got home about 6PM.  Mae had dinner ready
and then we watched the show “The Bishop’s Wife”.  It is a good movie.  I
entered this entry and we went to bed.</p>

left a little early because of the cold night (7 degrees) again.  My bus
started ok and I was at my first stop 10 minutes early so as I waited the
dispatch called me.  They asked if I could pick up route 29’s students along
with mine.  I am not sure what happened to bus 29 but I told them I would have
a hard time, unless they could get someone to pickup my last stop.  I had some
trouble finding the first stop, but got the rest.  It put me about 5 minutes
late getting to the school.  My bus was really full with both routs.  The rest
of my runs went well today.  When I got home, Mae and I took the Chevy into
Murdock’s where they repaired the windshield washer.  We then went out to eat
before coming home.  We watched a movie on DVD before going to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Mae
started early this morning and the grand children arrived at 9am.  Gail stayed
after bringing the children and that really helped Mae.  I went over and took
the gun safe back and exchanged it for a new one.  It started snowing this
morning and continued most of the day.  At noon the younger grandchildren went
home with their parents and the older grandchildren came for their turn with
Grandma.  I helped with the cooking of pizza for both groups.  Mae was kept
very busy but seems to enjoy it.  I got the snow blower out and cleaned the
walks and driveway.  We got a good start of cleaning up after the children all
left, but then went to the Ward Christmas party.  It was very nice and the
program was very good.  It was good to enjoy a Ward Social.  We were tired when
we got home but Mae cut my hair and we showered.  Mae stayed up for a little
while but I went to bed and was soon to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
prepared us some breakfast while Mae continued studding for her lesson.  I
attended High Priest Group Leadership meeting this morning.  JaNae and Sandi
came and got the Buick.  JaNae and Brad will take it for a little while, until
Brad finds out if he can fix their car or we may give the Buick to them if they
feel they want it.   Brother Taylor and Corbin Rogers came Home Teaching at
11AM.  We then attended the Block Meetings.  Mae and I stayed for choir
practice and then were going to go to Salt Lake to attend the First Presidency’s
Christmas program but we realized that we could not park at the Conference
Center parking so we stayed home and watched the program with Bob on his large
TV.  It was very good and we did not have to walk in the cold.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                It
was 1 degree this morning when I went to work.  I left a little early in case
of problems with the cold.  I got stopped by a police officer as he felt that I
cut an oncoming car off.  I did not get ticketed but it use some of my time.  I
still left in time but then traffic was bad on Antelope Drive and that really
put me behind.  Trying to make up time and then I got behind a very cautious
drive that was doing 25 mph in a 40 mph zone.  Even then I made it to my first
stop about 2 minutes late.  When I got the bus loaded the defroster wouldn’t
work so I had to open windows to see out.  It was an interesting morning.  When
I got home I took care of the chickens.  The cold is affecting them.  I took a
nap before my PM runs.  They went well.  This evening I got a new credit card
set up with Maverick but I couldn’t set one up for Mae without opening a
separate Email address.  We didn’t like that so we let it go.  I worked on my
life histories for quite a while this evening.  Jeff called for some advice on
changing his plumbing.  I hope it works ok for him.  It’s now late and Mae
wanted me to lesson to a Christmas story but I guess that will have to wait
until tomorrow.  Good night!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
was up and took my shower.  Mae was tired so I told her that I would get myself
off, but when I finished getting ready she had got up and prepared me some
breakfast.  My runs went well except the defroster only worked part of the
time.  When you have a load of over 50 children and the defroster stops, it
only takes seconds for windows to fog up.  I had to open windows and I was glad
my fans were working well.  Before getting back to the compound I called Curt,
head of maintenance, and asked him if I could get the parts and repair the
defroster myself.  He assured me that if I brought the bus up top he would get
it repaired.  When I got home I went down to the store and bought some lights
and some electrical parts.  After returning home I took care of the chickens,
including putting two heat lamps in the coop.  I put a decorative light in the
porch lamp to decorate a little for Christmas and added a three was outlet so
Mae could hook up the inside decorations.  I replaced our front room ceiling
light bulbs with “led” bulbs for more light, longer life and better economy. 
Mae made us some lunch and then I took a short nap.  After getting up I started
this entry.  Time went fast and I soon had to go in for my PM runs.  My bus was
still in the shop so I had to take a spare.  When I got home from work I took care
of the chickens again and they seem to be enjoying the heat lamp.  We had a
nice dinner and then Mae had a Relief Society meeting to attend.  I watched a
show on TV and worked on my Life History.  I quite at 9:30PM and finished this
entry before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                They
had my bus parked in it parking place.  Last night, when I checked with the
mechanics to see if my bus would be ready for morning, they told me “if the bus
was in its parking place in the morning, then they got it finished.”  I was
glad to have it back this morning.  My runs went well.  After getting home, I
got the mail in and took care of the chickens.  Mae separated Bob’s mail from
ours and I took Bob’s up to him.  He was watching a BYU Volleyball game.  I watched
for a few minutes so he turned the sound on for me.  The game was being
broadcasted in Spanish.  He checked and then realized that it was the
BYU-Spanish station and a replay of a game.  With his hearing he hadn’t
realized that.  I took a nap but woke when Bob was knocking on something.  Mae
checked and he was just after the cat.  My PM route went well, although I had
to have a girl move to another seat in the bus.  She refused so I just let the
bus sit and told her that until she moved, the bus wasn’t moving.  She laid
down on the floor for a couple of minutes until she decided that I was
serious.  She then jumped up and went to the back of the bus.  She wouldn’t
speak to me when I got to her stop, but just left in a hurry.  The rest of the
run went well.  After dinner this evening Mae and I went over to the church and
cleaned the chaplet.  We were 3 hours doing it.  Just before we finished I was
closing the folding doors between the overflow and the gym, when the door
caught my foot.  I didn’t think anything of it until later when I saw that it
had torn the side of my boot.  When we got home we were sure tired and went
right to bed.</p>

morning run went well.  It is sure nice to have the heater and defroster
working right.  On the way home I stopped at Tom’s Market and bought a ham. 
When I got home Mae said that I had bought the wrong one.  This one wasn’t the
one on sale.  After eating I went back to bed for almost an hour.  I called the
shoe shop and he thinks he can repair it but it will show the scar.  I worked
on my life history for a while.  When I went back into work my bus was
missing.  I called dispatch and they are moving buses around.  My bus now will
be parked in E13 stall.  On the way home I exchanged the ham.  This evening Mae
and I went shopping for all our girls Birthday gifts.  Mae had already found
them but just wanted me approval.  I bought Mae a Poinsettia for Christmas
while we were shopping.  We also bought some light bulbs for the fixtures above
the TV.  We got 5 eggs today so I think the heat lamp out there is helping the
chickens.  The white hen is still setting on the nest.  We watched a cute
Christmas show on TV this evening.</p>

day went pretty normal.  I did take my bus in to have a couple of things done
to it but they only got the windshield washers working.  The others will get
done later.  We tried to get our ham packaged but the sealer quite on us.  We
have sure had a lot of things quite on us this past month.  After getting home
from my runs, Bob invited us up for dinner.  He had cooked pork steaks and
gravy that we pored over our rice.  Mae and I then went into Ogden High School
where we watched the Freshman teams from Morgan vs Ogden.  It was a close game
and Morgan won 53 to 50.  Tyler played a very good game.</p>

and left from there to go to Orem.  We stopped and returned the Seal A Meal to
Wall Mart’s and then got our car washed.  We bought us a Sub-Way for lunch and
got gas.  We got to Orem High school at 3PM and the game was started.  We
enjoyed watching Jessie play but their team did about as well as Connor’s team
did earlier.  Both teams lost but it is good activities for the youth.  We then
went with Mike and Becky to Costco for a couple of items.  We attended a Piano
Recital in which Jessie played a very nice Christmas number.  The recital was
very well performed by all the students.  The recital was held at Summerhaze
Piano store.  Went we entered in to the store it reminded me of Todd Tayler’s
store in Ogden.  It brought back some good memories.  The traffic was bad going
home due to some ball games in Provo.  We went to Jeff and Gail’s where we played
games and visited.  It was 11:30PM when we got home so after mid-night getting

and after Sacrament meeting Mae and I attended choir practice.  I didn’t feel
it went very well and especially when we are performing next week.  Mae and I

the front room and slept in the recliner.  I guess it also woke Mae and she didn’t
sleep the rest of the night.  When I got up Mae also got up and go me breakfast
and off to work.  She went back to sleep then.  My runs went well.  One of my
students, Gad brought me a sack of homemade candy when he got on the bus.  He
asked me if I was allergic to peanuts or sugar and when I said I was he kept
it.  He ached a little disappointed.  My diet is often a problem.  When I got
home, Mae was still sleeping so I got some toast and then went to Farmington
and ordered new license plates for the car.  I stopped at Kent’s and got my
Gelusil that I ordered the other day.  When I got home this time Mae was up and
going.  I took a nap and then took care of the chickens.  I worked on my
Personal History and ate lunch before going back to work.  When I finished my
PM runs I went into the office and had them Fax copies of my DOT card into the
State Motor Drivers License Department.  This evening we tended Scott and
Mishelle’s children while they went Christmas shopping.  At 9PM I got ready for

last night.  When I got home, I took care of the chickens.  Mae soon had a nice
breakfast of fish and eggs ready.  I took a nap but when I didn’t wake with the
alarm, Mae reset it for another 10 minutes.  Mae had to go into Ogden shopping
so she took the car and I took the pickup this afternoon.  I worked on my life
history for a while before going to work.  I also talked to JaNae about the
car.  They are pretty sure that they want to buy the Buick from us.  My PM runs
went well except Reanna and Kalani got fighting again.  This has been a problem
since the start of school.  I have decided that I am going to assign those two
seat so that they are separated.  After finishing my runs and returning to the
compound I attended an association meeting for a little while.  Mae had dinner
ready when I got home.  After eating we attended a band concert at Legacy Jr.
High at which Kylan participated.  Kylan plays in the percussion section. 
After returning home I worked on my journal and we also watched the show “Christmas

busy all day getting things ready for the R.S social this evening.  She sliced
the end of her finger open and we had problems getting it to quite bleeding. 
My PM runs went well.  Mae was already gone when I got home.  I started right
in getting the corn on blue baked and taken over to the church house.  I went
up stairs and I ate some dinner, while we watched a show Bob had recorded.  Mae
got home just before 9PM.  We got most things cleaned up before going to bed. 
I get very concerned at the speed Mae goes but she won’t slow down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Although
I got up on time the morning went very fast.  I left a few minutes early and
was very glad I did.  The snow was quite heavy but I didn’t have very much
trouble.  I tried to use the chains 3 or 4 times but they aren’t working.  The
biggest trouble was when I tried to go west on Oak Hills Drive and it was
blocked off.  I tried to call into the office and when I did get through and
informed Rosa that I couldn’t get to my last pickup, she said I could find a
way.  With traffic and weather I didn’t follow her directions but went
backwards on Mutton and came north on the Special Ed rout from last year.  It
worked out great although I was 15 minutes late getting to the grade school. 
There were many others that were much later than that.  I was tired when I got
home so took a nap before my Field trip and PM runs.  My Field trip consisted
of taking Millcreek Jr. High’s Girls basketball team to Central Davis Jr.
High.  Although the roads were bad today, all the runs went well.  Because of
the weather Bob and I did not go visiting to our assigned Home Teaching
families this evening.  It was a relief for me to just relax and watch a good
TV movie with Mae.  Mae has edited my Life History today.  I will still have a
lot to add to it but we will give this much to the children for now and add to
it later.  It’s late so good night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
took my AM bus routes this morning and then while I was entering last nights
field trip into the computer, Rosa asked me if I could take a mid-day for her. 
While I was thinking about my schedule she added, “It is almost Christmas!”  I
called Mae and told her that I was going to take the run.  On the way home I
got gas.  Mae had a sandwich ready when I got there.  I ate it while driving
back to the bus compound.  The run went well although the assistant didn’t know
the route very well but we had two older children that helped me a lot.    I
didn’t have enough time to go home, so I just read some from my book.  I
thought of driving over to the grade school early and I did leave 10 minutes
early but traffic was horrible.  I got hung up before getting to Hill Air Force
road.  I finally pulled out of the right turn lane and drove on down to Gentile
road and went around that way to the Whiteside’s Elementary school.  I was
about 5 minutes late getting there.  Before leaving the school I got on the
intercom and asked that all those that would like permanent assigned seating to
raise their hands.  To my surprise every hand went up.  I guess we will figure
that out and make the assignments after the first of the year.  I gave out oranges
and candy canes to each of my students, at both schools, as they got off the
bus.  They all seemed to enjoy that.  Sandi texted Mae today that she is in the
hospital with Chelci, that Chelci is having contractions.  She isn’t due with
the twins until March so Sandi asked if we would pray for Chelci &amp; the
twins.  Mae asked if she should notify the rest of the family, to which Sandi
said: “Yes, Please!”  Mae also called the Utah temples and put Chelci’s name on
the prayer rolls and also the Mesa Arizona temple.  This evening we picked up
Jeff children and took them with us to a concert in Farmington, where Emily
participated.  About half way through the concert I fell asleep and woke up at
the end.  I missed seeing Emily’s performance.  We then took the children home
and stayed there the night.  When Jeff and Gail got home, we played games.  A
neighbor, Tim from the Ward stopped by and Jeff invited him in and introduced
us to him.  With Jeff’s invitation, Tim then went home and brought back his
wife, Cindy.  We played games quite late.  I guess with all the activities of
the day, my back went in to muscle spasms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                This
morning when I woke up I could hardly get out of bed.  With Mae’s help, I got
up and dressed.  Moving around the muscles relaxed and I felt some better.  I
helped Jeff disassemble the bathroom shower and valve.  He had ordered one from
Home Depot, but the parts would not interchange.  He will have to get different
parts.  We ate pancakes and eggs breakfast that Mae prepared and then came
home.  I took care of the chickens, including taking out 150 lb of feed for
them.  I also brought up our small folding picnic tables.  Sandi let us know
that the doctors were able to give Chelci medicine which stopped the
contractions, but she has to be on total bed support.  Her mother-in-law wants
Chelci, Steve and the family to move in with them after the holidays so she can
take care of the family.  I was glad to hear that since Sandi works, she can’t
do it.  Time seems to go fast and we soon had to hurry to go up to David and
Shauna’s for our family Christmas party.  Every couple had an assignment this
time.  David &amp; Shauna hosted the gathering at their home.  Becky planned
the dinner menu and assigned it out.  Mishelle &amp; Scott were over the
program and since Chelci is on total bed rest, she couldn’t sing for us and our
grandson, David, couldn’t get off work, so he couldn’t play for us, but Kylan
brought his electric piano and played a fantastic piece for us, he doesn’t read
music, but listens to it and learns it.  He is very talented, it was a hard piece,
but he didn’t make any mistakes.  Kylan had taught Kaden a small piece and it
was cute to watch him play it.  Emily played a couple of pieces for us on her
violin and it was beautiful.  She is talented also.  Sandi was over the games
and we had a “game” exchange activity and we also played the “Right &amp; Left”
game with candy bars.  Jeff was over getting &amp; wrapping the Santa gifts for
the children.   We put them in our Santa bag and pretended that Santa left it
on the doorstep.  Mae gave the gifts out.  It was a very enjoyable evening and
all seemed to have a good time.  it was late when we got home and I was tired. 
I just went to bed but Mae stayed up and showered before she came to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                I
slept in until almost  8AM before getting up.  I really don’t feel very well. 
Mae told me that there was a message from Morgan, telling me that he was going
to a family program and that we wouldn’t be having our meeting this morning. 
That sounded so good that I cried.  I cooked us an egg omelet for breakfast.  
Scott and Kylan came by to borrow our projector.  I caught up my journal then
set back and relaxed.  Bob invited us up to eat.  Mae got ready and attended
church but I stayed home.  I went back to sleep with the electric blanket to keep
me warm.  After waking up I worked on my journal and personal history.  Mae has
printed off some of my history to give to our children but there is yet much to
be added and corrected.  Mae took a Christmas gift &amp; card to the neighbors
on both sides of us.  Mike, on the west, is divorced so lives alone, but is a
neat guy.  He is a member of the church, but less active.  We have invited him
to church socials, but he hasn’t come yet.  We enjoy visiting with him over the
fence a lot in the summer when we are both out working in our yards.  The
neighbors on the east are Korean, or one of those countries.  They have a large
family; several are married, so they have lots of grandchildren.  They are nice
people too.  This is the first time that we have been able to go into their
home, as we usually just talk over the fence.  Mae wanted to give “Kay” a hug
so her family invited her in.  Mae and Kay have become friends.  This evening
Irven and Sandy came over to visit and play games.  We enjoyed being with them.
 We played table games until almost 11PM.  We soon went to bed after they went
home.</p>

woke about 3am and couldn’t go back to sleep, so I took the trash out, read
section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants.  I then got on the computer and
worked on my journal and history again.  Mae woke at that time too.  She went
back to bed, but couldn’t go back to sleep, so at 5 am, she came out and
started doing the laundry, vacuuming and cleaning house.  After breakfast, we
turned on the TV and watched several Christmas shows.  The problem is that ½ of
the time you are watching commercials.  We use the MUTE on those but it keeps
your attention distracted.  I did get some of our capsules made up.  I also got
more of my history edited.  This evening we Campbell’s and another family came
Christmas Caroling to our home.   This evening we watched the Netflix movie
“Christmas Lodge”.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                We
both slept better last night and woke a little before eight.  Mae made waffles
for breakfast and I scrambled some eggs.  Afterwards, we worked on getting
things ready to travel to each of our son’s home.   Our plans are to go Scott
&amp; Mishelle tonight for dinner at 6 pm and to spend the night and Christmas
morning.  Then we will head to Mike &amp; Becky’s to be there for Christmas
dinner with them at 2 or 3 pm.  Christmas night we will spend with David,
Shauna and their family and spend the night.  Sometime the next morning we will
go to Jeff &amp; Gail’s home and we will probably spend that night with them.  When
I went out to take care of the chickens, I found a new chick on the floor.  I
put him under the hen, but then became concerned as to whether or not the other
chickens would trample it.  I got a box and prepared it with straw, water, feed
and a heat lamp.  I then put the chick in it and put the box in the pen where I
have raised the chicks.  I then checked under the hen and found a 2<sup>nd</sup>
chick so put it in the box also.  My main concern is the cold weather.  I hope
I am making the right decision.  I asked Mark Stringer if he would care for the
chickens while we are away for the next couple of days.  We came over to Scott
and Mishelle’s this evening.  Mishelle had a nice dinner ready and then Mae and
I played “Old Pig” with the children.  Kaden has referred to Grandma Browning
as the Game Grandma; we get a chuckle out of that.  After the game Kylan and I
helped Scott wrap his Christmas gifts.  Scott set up the projector and they put
on a movie for the family to watch.  Scott and Mishelle let Mae and I have
their bed for tonight.  They slept downstairs with the children.  When we went
to bed, Mae isn’t feeling the best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>                Christmas
Morning:   I slept well last night but by 6AM I couldn’t sleep any longer, so
got up and worked on my journal.  Mae didn’t sleep as well.  I am afraid that
she might be running a fever.  Scott came up about 7:30 and we visited for a
while.  It was about 8:30 AM before the family got up and started opening
presents.  It was an enjoyable morning but a different Christmas than I
remember.  The tech-knowledge of the day is way beyond me.  After breakfast,
Mae and I gathered up our things and drove to Mike and Becky’s.  Becky had
dinner about ready.  They had all of their family so it was good to see David,
Page and Garrett.  After a very nice dinner of prime beef roast, Page and
Garrett had to get ready to leave.  They were supposed to leave in the morning
for the Philippines, but then they found out that Page’s passport only has less
than 3 months before it would expire.  That should have been ok except the
Philippine Government requires over 3 months.  They therefore are going to try
to be at the main office for passport renewal in Colorado and get it renewed,
tomorrow.  If so they will fly out of Salt Lake on Saturday.  We sure hope they
can make it ok.  This evening we drove up to David and Shauna’s and spent the
night with them.  Again we had a wonderful time.  David had a couple here in
the area call and asked him if he could check their daughter.  He went over and
the 3 year old daughter has a boil that is very painful.  David told them that
it needed to be drained as soon as they can see their Dr.  When he came home he
got worried about it and called them back to tell them that he could take them
to his clinic and drain it for them but when he called they had already gone to
“Wee Care”.  It was neat to see is care for them.  Mae hasn’t been feeling very
well all day.  She seems to be running a fever, especially during the nights. 
I feel well except we are eating too many things off my diet.</p>

couldn’t stay in bed longer, so got up shortly after 7AM and showered and
shaved.  When I came downstairs, Connor was up playing video games.  I worked
on my journal for a few minutes and then played a game of hearts, which I won
for a change.  Soon the family was up and we had breakfast.  David and I
visited for a while about the situation that the country is in.  I hope I
didn’t upset him with my feelings.  I really drought if there is any that will
change the trend that the country is headed for except for the coming of the
Savior.  We played a couple of games after having breakfast.  Mae and I left
about noon to go to Jeff and Gail’s.  We stopped on the way and got a Sub-Way
for our lunch.  We enjoyed being with Jeff’s family this afternoon and
evening.  We did a lot of visiting and playing games.  We spent the night here
although Mae isn’t feeling the best again.</p>

breakfast Jeff had some reports to run and he had extra time while the program
ran the various sections of the reports.  To spend the extra time he and I
played checkers on the computer.  Jeff won the game.  Jeff, Gail, Mae and I
played a game of ‘Hand and Foot” and though it was close, Jeff and Gail won. 
It was 3PM when we left for home.  After bringing things in from the car, I
checked the chickens.  The two baby chicks seem to be doing fine.  I am afraid
that the other eggs were not fertile.  I will give them a couple more days.  I
did get 16 eggs so the chickens are doing better about laying eggs.  Mae is
running a fever again this afternoon and evening.  This evening Mae and I
watched a couple of shows on TV.  Bob assisted me in giving Mae a Priesthood
Blessing this evening.</p>

and Shellie really came out very disappointed with her results.  Probably a lot
of the problem was the long drive up and the tension that causes.  They stopped
in for a few minutes after they went shopping for Mae’s Birthday.  We sure

ready so that on Thursday I can make seating assignments for the grade school
students on my bus.   I watched a show on TV with Mae.  Just after 5PM Shellie
came over and got me to go to Sandi’s.  it was so good to have a chance to
visit with Shellie as we drove.  All of my family was there except for Jeff and
his Family.  And of course Mae wasn’t there so that left a large vacancy in the
Party.   Sandi and Nick had gone all out to make the gathering a great
