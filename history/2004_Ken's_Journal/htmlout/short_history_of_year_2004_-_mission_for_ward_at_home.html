<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>            <b>SHORT
HISTORY OF THE YEAR 2004 – ELDER &amp; SISTER BROWNING</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As we have been asked to give a short history of
this past year, 2004, we have been reflecting on the many experiences we have
had, great people we have met, and wonderful friends we have made.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            When we first came on our mission, President
Brimhall, our mission president, asked us to go to our area, see what needed to
be fixed and fix it.  We could see that Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching were
not being done, and so we focused on that.  We spend much of our time, that
first year – 2003, on preparing and giving workshops and firesides on these
important assignments, which are given to each of us by the Lord, in our
branches and districts and throughout the mission.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This past year 2004, we have still been doing
some of that, but our main focus, given to us this year by our area president,
President Dallin H. Oaks and our mission president, has been Leadership
Training.  We were to go to each branch in our two districts, for one month
each, attend all their meetings, and train the Priesthood Executive Committee
and all the Auxiliary Organization leaders.  Actually, we started doing this
the latter part of 2003.  President &amp; Sister Brimhall asked us to focus on
the Primary and get the primary organization, in each branch, functioning like
it does according to the “General Handbook of Instructions” and how they are in
Utah, and need to be throughout the world.  When we first went to each branch
primary, they were more like a nursery.  It has been challenging, yet
rewarding, as we have shown, taught and trained these primary leaders.  Many
are humble and after they are trained, they are excited and magnify their
callings.  Many have the handbooks, but they don’t understand them.  Some do
not have them so we ask them to get them ordered immediately and read and study
them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            These people are a beautiful people, very
friendly, hospitable and loving, but they are also very child-like.  We have to
keep evaluating our training methods and presentations to make them simpler and
easier to be understood.  We used the Handbook of Instructions, along with
power point presentation with lots of pictures, overhead projector
presentations, books we had put together with pictures showing how to
accomplish their responsibilities and what they are to do.  We gave out lots of
handouts and we did role plays, as well as we ourselves doing “Sharing Time”,
“Singing Time”, and giving the lessons at times.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Our second area of focus was the Young Men and
Young Women.  Elder Browning mainly attended the youth Sunday school classes
and Aaronic Priesthood, because the primary rooms were so small, there usually
wasn’t enough room for both of us to attend Primary.  At least once during the
month I would visit the Young Women’s class and we tried to attend Mutual
(mid-week activity) as often as possible to help them and teach them what they
could and should do at mutual activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I also trained the Relief Society Presidencies,
but didn’t attend their Sunday meetings.   I did try to attend their Home,
Family, and Personal Enrichment Meetings.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Both Elder Browning and I went visiting with the
branch leaders.  Elder Browning went visiting with the Branch Presidencies and
other Priesthood leaders and I went visiting with the Women’s Auxiliary leaders
to help do activation work.  We both enjoyed this very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            For four months – June, July, August and
September, Elder Browning served as the only counselor in one of our small
branches.  There were so few priesthood holders, who were active, that the
branch was just not progressing.  Our assignment from President Brimhall was to
stimulate activity until they could again be able to carry their own load.  We
found that the main success came through personal visits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We also trained the District Leaders and had
them go with us, as often as possible, to train the branch leadership, as after
we leave, they will have to take over doing this training.  We found most of
the Leaders to be very wonderful, capable, and willing to fulfill their responsibilities,
but a few were challenging to work with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            As we have been training Priesthood and
Auxiliary leaders, we have tried to focus on getting them to read and follow
the Church Handbook of Instructions, and hold weekly presidency meetings. 
Although progress has been slow, we have seen progress, and so we are
encouraged.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We enjoyed helping with medical missions.  We
helped with humanitarian work by working with our “batch mates” who are the
Humanitarian Couple Missionaries, here in the Philippines.  We were able to
help bring equipment and supplies to a hospital in our district, and also help
with getting a well of clear, pure water to many families in one of our
districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We have also had the opportunity of helping to
bring a wonderful and “Golden” family into the gospel by introducing them to
the Young Elders, who taught them, and we were able to fellowship and help
teach them.  They are now some of our dear friends.  We have also met several
special people and families while walking at the college near us, in the
mornings.  We are currently helping the Lord to prepare them to be taught the
gospel.  We have given other referrals to the Young Elders, as that is the
Young Elders responsibility to teach, but we, as couple missionaries, are to help
with activation, retention and mainly Leadership Training.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We have helped to prepare couples and families
to go to the temple.  We were privileged to go to the Manila temple and witness
the temple marriages of one family and four young couples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We were called upon to speak at many branch and
district meetings and activities, sometimes at the last minute, so we are very
thankful to the Lord for his help and inspiration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>             We have gone through several typhoons during
this year, three of which caused quite extensive damage with considerable loss
to property, farm crops &amp; lives.  We had the opportunity to help render
relief to many victims of these storms.  In November, there were two typhoons
that caused quite extensive damage and then followed reports of a “super”
typhoon that was coming in.  There were massive preparations for this storm.  
However, when the storm hit the winds stayed high, basically not touching the
ground and was only 24 hours of a high wind noise, almost like the noise of jet
airplanes over head.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            We had the opportunity of having our two
daughters come to the Philippines and spend 10 days with us in February.  This
opportunity came as a result of our eldest daughter’s husband being killed in a
car accident in November of 2003.  After counseling with our mission president,
he asked that we consider remaining on our mission, rather than returning home
for the funeral.  His suggestion was that we have our daughter come over and
spend time with us after the funeral.  As we were concerned with our daughter
traveling alone, we also invited her sister, who was excited to join her.  We
had a wonderful experience with them and were able to take them to see some of
the beautiful sights here in the Philippines, as well as have them with us as we
went to meetings and did some training and teaching.  They were so graciously
accepted by the wonderful members here in the Philippines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Unlike the young Elders, who often count their
success by the number of baptisms they have had, our success is in seeing the
wards and branches progressing and members excited as they fulfill and magnify
their callings.  It is also in watching member’s testimonies grow of the Lord,
Jesus Christ as they pray, study the scriptures and keep his commandments, and
to see families become active in the Church and be sealed together in the Holy
Temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            2004 has been an exciting year, filled with many
wonderful, as well as challenging experiences and meeting many wonderful
friends, who are our brothers and sisters in this part of the world.</p>
