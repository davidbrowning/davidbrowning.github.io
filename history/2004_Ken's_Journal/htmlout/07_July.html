<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We still did
not have power when we got up this morning so we had to heat water and take our
showers by pouring water over us with a pan.  We left at 6:30 AM for Tarlac,
getting there by 7:30 AM.  Elder and Sister Hyer met us at McDonald’s where we
ate breakfast.  It is enjoyable to have breakfast with the Hyers and just
visit.  We then went on to the Mission Home in Angeles for the couple’s
meeting.  The meeting was very enjoyable also President and Sister Brimhall had
a wonderful lunch for us.  We went over on Friendship road to a Frame store and
ordered 6 frames.  We stopped by our wood carver but they still do not have our
caribous for us.  We went to Brettos and got some cheese and meat, and then
went to Pure Gold and bought a few items.  We had missed a phone call from
Pres. Mercado so we called him.  He informed us that President Cabuyaban is in
the hospital.  We stopped in Guimba at the hospital and visited him.  The Dr.
thinks he has T. B. and will keep him in the hospital for a few days.  We
visited Annie on the way home.   It was 9:15 PM when we got home very tired.  I
took the time to call President Brimhall to ask about T. B. and he wants me to
call Sister Plott at the M. T. C.  We were tired and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                While we were
getting ready to leave for District Development meeting the Landlord’s daughter
came with a plumber to work on our water problems.  Mae checked the e-mail and
found that the sell of our house had gone through. We called the Elders and
they took a jeepnie to Guimba.  We waited until Marlyn came and then we went
out to the meeting.  The A. P.’s were at D. D. M. and as we were talking to
Elder Hilderbrand he told us of the accident that he had when a bus ran into
him.  He was given a ticket and fined P100 for being involved in an accident. 
After meeting we asked Sister Villanueva, the R. S. President to go with us to
visit Sister Amy Agustia and Sister Maricris Parinas, two sisters in the Guimba
1<sup>st</sup> branch that needs welfare help.  Sister Villanueva had contacted
Sister Myra who showed us where Sister Lus lived.  We were told that Sister Lus
had gone to the hospital to see President Cabuyaban.  We went there and visit
President Cabuyaban.  Any and Ivan were there also.  Sister Lus went with us
and we found that Parinas was gone, so Sister Lus will try to contact her to
find out when we can visit her.  We found where Sister Agustia lived but she
was working.  We went to where she works and visited with her there.  She works
from 7 AM to 6 PM six days a week and from 6 AM to noon on Sundays and gets
paid P2,200 a month.  Her husband died two weeks ago and left her with a son
15, a daughter 13 and 11.  She lives with his parents who makes P1,000 a month
working for the Bngy.   We then took Sister Lus and Sister Villanueva to their
homes.  Mae and I went to the Dr. and paid the bill for Noami, got us something
to eat at Cindys before going to the hospital.  We got Sister Cabuyaban to go
with us and we visited Sister Pascual and Sister Madrid and informed them that
they would be released from their callings in the Primary.  Sister Madrid
almost cried when I told her we would have to release her.  She said her boss
was a member of the Igestial Cristo church and would not let her have anytime
off on Sunday so she could attend her meetings.  Mae saw her hit the door fram
with her hand as she went back to work and we left.  We took Any and Ivan back
to the hospital and we came home.  I called Elder Hyer and he gave me some
recommendations as to how to handle the money.  I was going to reply to Mikes
questions about the sell of our house and what we wanted them to do with the
check when we got another e-mail saying that he had a check for the full amount
including $10,000 that Scott and Mishelle borrowed extra.  That presents a
problem with taxes.  I tried to call Roy to get his advice but he didn’t
answer.  I called Mike and we now have some problems to figure out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We got up on time but Mae had
to do her hair and then start on her preparations for the training she will do
today.  I called Scott but he wasn’t home from work yet.  I talked to Mishelle
for a few minutes.  Scott called me back when he got home.  He has checked with
Ed Sorenson, our tax accountant, and he says that the sale has to be over $250,000
before you have to be concerned about it.  We had a crew of men come today and
put in a new well.  They made a tripod with three bamboo polls, with a pulley
at the top.  They then tied a driver to the end of a rope and manually lifted
the weight up and dropped it on a pie to drive it into the ground.  It was
interesting to watch them do it all by hand.   Roger Silvia came by and he is
selling “My Way”  house hold products as a second job to earn money.  It looks
like Amway to me with just a different name.  While he was here, I had him fix
a couple of computer problems.   I ran up and got some copies made for Mae’s
training while she was still studying.   I fixed me a sandwich, but Mae was
fasting as she needed the help of the Lord as she doesn’t quite know what to
expect – whether she would be training the District Primary Presidency, like
she had planned to do, or if we was training the Branch Primary Presidencies
since this is the day and time that they hold this training.  She couldn’t get
Sis. Tess (the District Primary President) to text her back or answer her
email.  We left at 11:30 a.m. to go to Paniqui so Mae would have time to set up
as she is using a power point presentation.  I helped get the equipment set up
and then we left to go in the cultural hall for the 1<sup>st</sup> part of the
meeting.  Mae &amp; I both got nervous about leaving the equipment unattended
as there were many people and some kept coming in and going out.  Mae asked if
I would go check it.  I did and it was fine, but I decided to stay there with
it, since we lost our digital camera that way.  I was glad I did as several
people – youth, children and adults kept coming in and then leaving when they
saw me.  We would be in a mess without our computer and power point projector. 
I played chess on my palm pilot while I waited.   President Nadado took ½ hour
longer than he should have.  He had an “open forum” and so many asked questions
and he didn’t stop them.  He said 7 times “just one more”.  Anyway, Mae was concerned
since she didn’t have the time she needed.  My beautiful wife did a wonderful
job with her presentation.  While they were getting to the class rooms Sister
Tess told us of a young man that ran over by a drunk driver last week while he
was out doing his Home Teaching.  One of the problems with the laws here is
that unless the family can afford to pay for the prosecution of the driver, the
only thing that will happen is he may have to pay a fine for being involved in
a accident.   Mae needed to visit with Sister Tess’s new counselor a little
longer, so we were late getting to Gerona for Sister Tess’s son’s baptism. 
Sister Tess had left at 4:00 p.m. as she would have relatives waiting at the
Church.  They were late starting so we got there just in time.  It was a good
meeting.  Besides her son, there was another little girl and an older man who
were baptized.  Elder &amp; Sister Hyer were also there, so we visited with
them for a while afterwards.  We then drove to the hospital to visit President
Cabuyaban again.  We had received a text from him on the way saying “You didn’t
come to see me”.  We were there for a while.  I had him tell me again how to
text time to someone.  He explained that the receiver had to use that time with
in 24 hours.  He also explained that when a person buys a P30 text card that
they have to use that time within 24 hours or lose the time.  We realized what
a bad thing that is for the people.  Many are so poor that they just buy P30 at
a time.  That means that they pay P30 a day, where we buy a P300 card and have
almost 2 months to use it.  We visited about the people Mae &amp; I visited on
Friday and about the meetings for tomorrow.  He suggested that we stop at Sis.
Dela Cruz’s to make sure she is planning on teaching the Adult Sunday School
class tomorrow and also stop at his home to tell Annie to go to meetings and
not come to the hospital until the afternoon as she needs to be to Primary to
support her new counselors.  Pres. Mercado had texted us to see when we would
be home, and I texted him back saying it would be after 8 p.m.  We text him as
we were leaving Guimba and told him we were on our way home.  He must already
have turned off his phone and gone to bed as he didn’t respond.  It was 9:15
p.m. when we arrived home, very tired.  I had some milk and toast, while Mae
had something also light.  We then entered my journal entry.  Mae had to finish
it for me as I got to tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5:30 and had to hurry to leave for Guimba at 6:45 AM.  Christopher and the
Elders were soon there to meet us.  With the help of everyone we had the chapel
ready for meetings and then went into P. E. C. meeting.  With out President
Cabuyaban there I was busy but it went quite well, thanks to the help of some
of the faithful members.  After the block meetings Brother Sixto Romano helped
me set Sister Emelita Manuel Baltazar apart as 1<sup>st</sup> councilor to
Sister Cabuyaban in the Primary Presidency and Sister Lolta Aquino Dela Cruz as
2<sup>nd</sup> councilor.  Brother Romano then helped me with the donations. 
After we got those balanced we took the reports and went to the hospital and
visited President Cabuyaban.  He and I got some disbursements ready to take to
the District.  Our working budget was depleted so I advanced some money to the
budget so we could get members reimbursed with out me making several trips from
Munoz to Guimba.  We should have filled our gas tank in the car yesterday for
we were so low that I didn’t think we could make it home, so we stopped and
filled it up.  Brother and Sister Villanueva had some Philippine soup or stew
and wanted us to eat.  We didn’t feel that we could turn them down so had a
bowl.  It was pretty good and very special of them.  It was 5 PM when we got
home.  We text President Mercado to see if they were home so we could take the
x-rays of President Cabuyaban to him so he can take them to the Dr. in Manila. 
If it is T. B. then Mae and I will have to be tested.  We hope for all of that
it isn’t.  We took a short rest before taking the x-ray to him.  We them came
home and got us some dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, July 05, 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke at
5:15 and went walking at the college.  After breakfast, we tried getting on the
internet so we could get on “instant messaging” with our children, but we had
no dial tone.  No matter what we did, it wouldn’t work.  We were really
disappointed.  Soon after 10:00 am, Pres. Mercado called from his work at the
PBO in Manila.  Not sure what happened, but it worked after that, however, too
late to get on with our kids.  I went down and paid the phone bill and then
stopped at the bank to make the deposit.  I went over to Brother Damacio’s and
went over the disbursements.  I had forgot to fill out the weekly financial
report and know that in order to get that I would have to go out to the branch
presidents office.  I went home and ate some lunch and then went out to
Guimba.  I got the report but had some questions about it.  I went over to the
hospital and checked on President Cabuyaban and had him help me with the LUBA
report.  I had got a call from President Mercado telling me that the x-ray of
President Cabuyaban wasn’t any good.  He wants me to take him to the hospital
in Cabanatuan for a new x-ray and skin test.  President Cabuyaban won’t be released
until tomorrow.  I spent the rest of the day trying to get welfare assistance
papers figured out in order to pay his bill.  We will have to submit the
request thru the Area Office and that will take a little time.  We tried to get
the head Dr. to except a promissory note but she said that she had a whole
drawer full of those and they weren’t worth the paper they were written on.  I
finally got President Dasalla to come over to the hospital with me and he got
things worked out so the Dr. will except a post dated check from the Church.  I
got home about 7 PM having stopped at Brother Damacio’s and getting that
check.  I was beat.  I then had to get a e-mail to President Brimhall with the
paper work for President Cabuyaban.  Mae sent a e-mail to President Brimhall
also and one to our family.  I played a game of Chess on my palm pilot while
Mae was on the computer.  I them filled in my journal and we went to bed at
10:30 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke at
5:15 and went walking at the college again this morning.  As we were walking,
we saw a man ahead of us who was carrying a thermo of water (at least we
suppose it was water) and a small plastic sack of rice.  We’re sure that was
his lunch for the day.  Most of the people eat rice for every meal (that they
eat, some only eat one meal a day) they might have some vegetables or greens
with the rice for one meal.  We like the rice over here, but would hate to have
to eat it for 3 meals and sure do like a variety, and like to eat other food
with the rice.  Marlyn fixes us many different dishes along with the rice. 
After breakfast I went over to President Gasmenia’s to have him sign the checks
I received yesterday.  He told me that he thought that they had the problem
with Sister Rubio settled.  I went to the bank and cashed the one check and
then went out to Guimba.  It took quite a while to get President Cabuyaban out
of the hospital, I guess the Dr. was in an emergency.  After we got out we went
to the hospital in Cabanatuan and got a x-ray, then to a privet laboratory to
get the skin test for T.B.  We then went to L.B.C. and mailed the e-ray and
Sundays report to the P.B.O.  I then took President Cabuyaban, Any, &amp; Ivan
home, then I came home.  I was tired so Mae let me sleep for a while before
getting up for dinner.  I sent a e-mail to Scott and mike about the money from
the sell of the house, printed some poems for Mae and then entered my journal. 
It’s been a long day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
showered and soon left for Tarlac to the Honda Dealer to have the car serviced
and do the 70,000 KL checkup.  I asked them to do a service on the transmission
but the only checked it out and said it was ok.  We got there at 8:30 AM and
left the car.  We had our first jeepnie ride into town.  The jeepnie driver
when I gave him a P20, gave me back P8 and Mae P15.  We sent the P15 back up
and he kept that.  We couldn’t figure out what was happening.  The jeepnie
dropped us off about ½ mile from where we wanted to go so we took a trick on to
McDonalds.  When I went to pay the trick driver he wanted $3.00.  I told him no
way and I wanted the price in pesos.  I finally gave him P20.  We had breakfast
then walked over to the mall where Mae bought a few items.  We then caught a
trike to take us back out to the Honda Dealer.  We again had to argue the price
but finally settled on P60.  We were until 1PM before they got the car serviced. 
They did the 70,000 km checkup but didn’t service the transmission.  I asked
them about it and they said they checked it and it was ok.  I gave up, I
brought it in to get the transmission serviced and couldn’t get it done.  We
came home and got something to eat and a short nap and back out to Guimba to go
visiting Eduardo Pagador, a excommunicated member and tried to get him to
realize what he has to do to be re-baptized.  That took longer than we had
planned so we went to the church house.  The YW &amp; YM were waiting for
Sister Browning so they could start mid-week activity.  I was going to train
Brother Villanueva on the clerks job, but the whole time was spent on trying to
help him feel that he could do the job and that obedience has to come first
before the blessings will come.  Also, the need for members to support the
Priesthood leaders (President Cabuyaban).  I came home very depressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up to
go walking when we received a call from President Mercado asking about the
“Branch Organization Survey” and then the ZL’s called asking about the same
report.  President Brimhall had called to tell them that President Mains wanted
that report tomorrow.  It upsets me because I have turned that report over to
the District, but they haven’t kept it up and now they are all calling me.  I
printed off a set of the reports as I currently have them and took them to the
ZL’s.  I then drove them out to Guimba to have the Elders deliver them to each
of the branch’s out there.  After getting home I checked out where the ants are
getting into our bedroom.  I found that where the lines penetrate the wall to
go to the condenser, it wasn’t sealed and the ants are getting through there. 
I sent a letter to Roy asking him about the tax laws concerning the money we
got on the house.  We went to the post office and sent a package to (little)
David.  We then went to San Jose grocery shopping.  While there I bought some
silicone caulk and a gun to fix the hole in the wall.  We also stopped at
Jollibees for dinner.  I took a nap after getting home, then picked up the ZL’s
and went out to Guimba to collect the reports.  After getting home we updated
the files and I printed the reports.  I them filled in my journal, so it is
after 1AM as I am going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up at
5:30 AM in order to get the reports to the Elders and out to Paniqui for
District Development meeting.  Elder Hayman gave a workshop and did a very good
job.  He is going to make a good missionary yet.  Mae had brought brownies for
the Elders.  We visited with one of the Elders and was very surprised to find
that he came from a dysfunctional family.  We have been surprised as how many
Elders come from less active or part member families.   I didn’t feel to well
and was glad to head for home.  Pres. Cabuyaban texted and said that the Dr.
said his skin test was positive.  We stopped and visited with him.  We
suggested that he go to Cabanatuan and have the Dr. there that gave the test
read it.  We took him to Baloc so he could catch a bus from there.  We came
home and I took a nap for about 3 hours.  I felt much better after waking up.  President
Cabuyaban text us to say that the Dr. in Cabanatuan said that the test were
negative.   We watched the Worldwide Leadership Training this evening.  Brother
Roger Silvia came over to work on the computer but he had a bad disk so will
come back tomorrow.  Mae worked on Primary materials and I filled capsules with
my Mannatech supplement.  We were late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, July 10, 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We woke about 5:45am, and I
got ready to go to the district training meeting.  I had been told that it was
at 9:00 am at the resort here in Munoz, so I went there.  No one was there.  I
waiting and still no one came.  I called both Pres. Mercado and Pres. Gasmena,
but didn’t get an answer right away, so went to the gas station and filled the
car with gas.  While there I got a text from Pres. Mercado saying the meeting
was at 10 am.  So, I went back down to the resort and while waiting there, I
got a text from Pres. Gasmena which said that it was being held at the resort
in Guimba.  I didn’t feel good and was frustrated, so just came home.  The
power had gone off, and our landlord came to put the wiring in for the pump.  I
had to chuckle at that and wonder why many people were not killed from
electrical shock.  This wiring would be totally unacceptable by Utah inspectors
and besides being 110 volts, everything here is 220 volts, so should be very
deadly.   I got the landlord to bring a latter and went out back of the house
using a silicone caulking and filled up the hole that penetrated the wall for
the lines going to the air conditioner condensator.  I think that will stop the
ants from being able to enter the house.   The landlord sprayed the back of the
house for ants, that might also help.  Also, when Mae went to open the windows
to allow some veneration into the house,  she opened up a large nest of ants
that had built inside the window frame.  I sprayed those with an insect spray
and literally killed hundreds of ants.  It was so hot that we could not even
rest, so I suggested that we go to San Jose and have lunch at Jollibees.  At
least we were able to ride in the air conditioned car and Jollibees was air
conditioned.  When we came home, the power was back on.  Our landlord had told
us that he heard it would be off until 5 pm.  I helped Mae set up chairs, etc.,
as she had the combined Munoz 1 and 2 young women and their leaders coming for
mutual at our house.  They said there would be 15, but only 8 came and of those
8, only one was a young woman.  Seven were leaders or other sisters who wanted
to come including Marlyn, but again she was cute and cleaned up the dishes
before they left.  Mae and these YW and leaders made chocolate chip cookies and
then played games.  Eliza, the president of Munoz 2 didn’t come until almost 4
pm and it started at 2.  Her counselor and secretary were here, but none of her
girls.  She had told them that she would meet them at 2 at the Church.  It
turned out that she had to baby sit for her sister and husband, who she lives
with, so wasn’t able to come.  She texted the girls telling them to come
straight here, but they didn’t.  We don’t think they knew how to get here. 
Eliza was crying when she came as she felt so bad about it.  Roger Silvia came
to help me figure out what was wrong with MSM messenger.  It wasn’t working and
so we wouldn’t be able to get on “instant messaging” with our kids on Monday.  It
took a long time, but now it works, thank goodness.  The YW leaders, girl and
others didn’t leave until after 5:30 p.m.  Roger didn’t leave until after 7. 
Since it was raining hard, we had him stay and eat supper with us.  When the
rain stopped, he left.  I am feeling lousy tonight.  Pres. Cabuyaban texted
asking Mae and I to each prepare an 8 min talk for Sacrament Meeting.  I had
Mae text him back saying “not to count on us as I am still feeling sick, we
will text him in the morning after we see how I am feeling.  He then texted us,
asking them to call the Elders in his ward and ask them to speak.  We did that,
and they agreed even thought it was so late.  They said they are used to that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 5AM
and did some research for my talk.  I told Mae that I would give the talk and
she would not have to.  We picked up President Cabuyaban and his family on the
way to meetings.  We are still having problems with members following through
with their callings.  After the block Mae trained the Primary Presidency.  I,
with Brother Villanueva’s help, did the finances for the week.  He will also
meet me at the bank to make the deposit tomorrow.  As we got home, President
Mercado text me and wants to come over to get the Branch Summery report.  I
told him he could come by and get it.  I printed off the reports and waited for
him to come.  Mae took a nap and then when she woke up I took a nap.  He and
Sister Mercado came by and visited for a little while.  I designed the program
for the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch conference.  Mae finished the family
letter and sent it off.  We also e-mailed the program to President Mercado for
his approval.  It’s been a busy day.</span></p>

make the Bank deposit.  When I got back Mae was still on with Jeff.  Jeff and I
played a game of Hearts, although it took me quite a while to get into the
program.  We played until after noon.  We went to San Jose to mail the reports
and to do our grocery shopping.  I took a nap this afternoon.  This evening we
went to President and Sister Gajonera’s and held Family Home Evening with them
and Lorna’s sisters.  Mae and I gave the lesson.  We had a good evening being
with them.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning, then came home and got ready to attend Zone Conference. 
As always President Brimhall and Sister Brimhall gave us some excellent counsel
and advise.  Sister Brimhall asked if we can serve for two years and “miss
it”.  I am not sure but that I might fit into that statement.  I am concerned
that I may have done more harm by trying to help President Cabuyaban to see his
problem in offending members in the branch.  I also am not sure how to help him
with his farming and income to his family.  Conference was great with all that
took place, but I seemed to have said the wrong thing again this evening and
hurt Mae’s feelings.  I seem to be good at that.  This entry seems to be mixed
up as that is the way my feelings are tonight.  The conference was for the
Guimba &amp; San Jose zones.  When we got there the Guimba zone all had on
matching blue plaid ties.  They had one for me, which I put on.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke still
very confused about what we are doing and concerned about President Cabuyaban. 
We went walking at the collage.  I composed and sent a e-mail to President
Brimhall also to President Mercado.  That took most of the morning.  This
afternoon we got the programs printed off for branch conference Sunday.  I
popped corn for the youth activity tonight and then took a nap.  This evening
we attended the youth activity and took the projector and DVD out to show the
youth.  I got it set up and then went into Branch Presidency meeting.  Mae left
the activity to go visiting at 7 PM.  At &amp;:30 PM the youth came in and got
me to put the equipment away.  Mae didn’t get back until 8:30 PM.  It was 9:30
PM before we got home.  Somewhere we ended up missing the DVD “Brigham”.  I
think we lost another P1,000 in the money that we loaned Roberto for his school
registration.  His loan came back short a P1K.  Oh well, we have lost every
time we have tried to help someone out with money, but what do you do when they
are desperate and you are the only one who can help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning and then came home and prepared breakfast for the Zl’s and
had a correlation meeting with them.  We were to meet at 8 AM for breakfast but
they didn’t come until 8:17AM, which was a little disturbing when the food was
cooked at 8 AM.  We did enjoy meeting with them to plan the next week.  I went
out to Guimba this afternoon.  President Cabuyaban and I did some visiting.  It
is hard for me to visit when the conversation is in Tagalog and I don’t know
what is being said.  We made several visits.  President Cabuyaban said that the
Sisters in the Branch think that Sister Browning is about perfect.  I told him
that she would be except that she has to put up with me.  I stopped at Brother
Damacio with some cash vouchers and the receipts.  He gave me a check that I
took to President Gasmenia to get signed.  We got a very nice e-mail from
Shellie.  They think they have their computer back working.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning although it was raining.  We walked under the basketball
gym.  After walking we drove the route of one of our favorite areas to walk. 
It measured out at 2.5 KM or if I am figuring the conversion right equals over
1 &amp; 1/2 miles.  We walk about 45 minutes and we walk fast, as we pass
everyone else up.  We had to hurry in order to pickup the Munoz Elders to
attend District Development meeting at Guimba.  We enjoyed being with the
Elders as always.  This will be the last time with some of them.  Elder Ligaliga
will be going home this week.  He has been a great Elder, and he is fantastic
on the piano. Others will be transferred but that is the way it is.  We stopped
at Mercury Drug and got the medications for Nomie, then took them to the Dr.
office.  We found that they had came in last Saturday, which is a week early,
so we tried to get a text message to them telling them that we could bring the
medication to them next week or they would have to come to our place to get
it.  We don’t know why the change.  When we got home Marlyn had dinner ready
for us.  We ate and then went downtown and paid the power bill and cashed the
check for Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> branch working fund.  We came home and took a
nap.  I went out to Guimba this evening, hoping to visit with Brother Matel,
but he didn’t receive my text so I will visit with him on Sunday.  I did have a
member ask to talk to me about a problem and we will have to try to resolve
that on Sunday also.  It was raining quite hard when I drove home and I had
several times that people were on the road without lights and wearing dark
clothing.  It really keeps you alert when you drive here.  Mae stayed home this
evening and it is really interesting that when people see me they ask “where is
Sister?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 6AM so didn’t go walking this morning.  At 8:30AM we went over to a
service project sponsored by the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  They cleaned up
around a school, planted trees and had a medical mission.  Mae worked in the
pharmacy while I visited and took pictures.  We were there until noon.  When we
drove in, we saw a large plastic bag on the table.  We had left a small plastic
bag with Noemi’s lotions and pills which we buy from the drug store, hanging on
the inside of the gate.  Mae had texted Vickie that we had Noemi’s lotions,
etc., but couldn’t get them out to her.  They texted back &amp; said they would
come get them.  Since we were not going to be home, we texted them that we
would leave them on the gate.  We looked in the plastic sack and found 2
beautiful hand crocheted vests for Mae.  There wasn’t a note so we were not
sure they were the ones who left them, but figured that it was them.  Mae txted
them and found out it was.  They are grateful for our help so that Noemi can be
a “cute little girl”.  We then downloaded the pictures so that Brother Nuque
could come and see which ones he wants me to e-mail him.  I also edited a
picture for Ronald Dator and printed it.  I took a nap.  This evening we
attended a Baptismal service for Joy Montero.  It was very nice and all went
well.  Before it finished a storm hit and really came down hard.  I finally
went to the car and got on boots, raincoats and umbrellas and we helped every
one get home.  We were soaked by the time we got home ourselves.  Mae gave me a
hair cut and we took showers before going to bed.  It’s been a long day but a
good one.  Mae gave me a special card, she is so special to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We woke early so we could
leave at 6:45 am to go to Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch meetings.  My back is
really hurting so I was slower than normal, but we still got away in time.   We
texted Pres. Cabuyaban that we would be there to pick him up at 7:15 on the
highway, but we got there at 7:10 so decided to go to his house to pick him
up.  His wife and family were coming with us too and they were not ready.  PEC
Meeting is supposed to start at 7:30 am, but it wouldn’t be starting at that
time this morning.  We wish his wife and kids would come with his mom and come
later and just let President Cabuyaban come with us.  Sister Cabuyaban doesn’t
seem to like his mom, so that is a problem.  Sister Cabuyaban, Pres.
Cabuyaban’s mother, said the closing prayer after Sacrament Meeting was over,
and she started crying during the prayer.  I think she is feeling bad that
Sister Cabuyaban treats her badly.  They are living with his Mom, while they
are getting their home built, and Annie doesn’t want to.   Both Mae and I spoke
during Branch Conference. Christopher spoke first and he took 20 minutes where
he was supposed to take 5 to 8 min., so I cut my talk short.  The youth sang a
song and also the Primary Children sang a song.   The District Presidency
spoke.  After the block, I visited with Brother Matal in the Branch President’s
office and hoped I helped him realize the need to pay tithing.  That is the
only problem stopping him from getting a temple recommend to go with his
daughter, Annalisa, to the temple next month when she marries William.  Him and
his wife could be sealed and then have their family sealed to them and then be
a witness for Annalisa’s marriage.  By the time I finished helping the clerk
count the money, I was hurting so bad that I could hardly make it to the car. 
We came home and I have been in the bed most of the time.  I did call and talk
with both Elder Clark and Elder Maharry.  We texted Nida to see if she could
come in the morning to give me a treatment, but she is in Manila for the week. 
Not sure how I will manage, but somehow I guess I will – with the Lord’s help.</span></p>

having problems with my back so we didn’t try walking this morning.  Mae rubbed
my back several times to day.  We did go to the bank and make the deposit for
Branch 1 got the copies and went to San Jose to mail the reports.  While there
we did our shopping and got a new battery for our cell phone.  This evening we
got texts from Christopher wanting to borrow some money.  We are not sure why,
how much or when.  We met the Elders in Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> branch at the Tabalino
family and had a F. H. E. with them.  It went well and I hope we gave them
something to consider that will help them.  I did figure the bank statement
today and figured our budget and we are in balance on both.</span></p>

walking as my back was still hurting.  We took the four Munoz Elders out to
breakfast as this will be Elder Abao’s last day with us.  He is being called to
serve as a Assistant to the President.  We ate at the Western Food and Coffee
Shop.  We paid the bill and for the six of us it was P480 and I left a P20
tip.  The ZL’s came back home with us and we held our correlation meeting.  Mae
and I had some problems today in communication.  I put a program flyer together
for the rebroadcast of the 1<sup>st</sup> Philippines Area conference.  We also
sent some pictures by e-mail to Brother Nuque of the Medical Mission /
Community Service Project.  I went out to Guimba and met with President
Cabuyaban.  We did a lot of visiting and I guess it was worth while although I
feel like a taxi driver.  Everything is all spoken in Tagalog so I just sit
like a bump on the log.  I was quite discouraged when I got home at 9:45 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did go
walking at the collage this morning and though I got tired it seemed to help my
back.  We keep busy with our spare time with e-mails and letters.  Mae is
preparing letters for all R. S., Y. W. and Primary Presidents in the two
districts.  I wrote a rough draft for a letter to President Mercado and sent a
short e-mail to President Brimhall.  I also took reports to Brother Damacio,
cashed the LUDA check and got flyers copied for the 1<sup>st</sup> Philippines
Area Conference.  We went out to Activity Night and Branch Presidency meeting
this evening.  Mae also went visiting with Sister Villanueva to several
Sisters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
4:30AM and Mae at 5AM.  We hurried and left for Angeles at 6:30AM.  We stopped
in Tarlac and got breakfast at McDonalds before going on to Clark.  We helped
the Clarks pack using both their car and our car to get all their items ready
to move.  About that time the new missionaries arrived so we got to meet them. 
After their orientation we were invited to have lunch with them at President
and Sister Brimhall’s.  We then attended the transfer meeting in the Mabalacat 
Chapel, which was good to see how that goes.  We then followed Elder and Sister
Clark to  Palugrin to their new home.  It is really beautiful and sits on
several acres of land.  It has a gazebo with pool table, a nepa hut and is
landscaped really beautifully, but Mae and I decided we are still happy with
our home and wouldn’t want to swap with any the couple missionaries.  We are
thankful for ours.  There are some things which are better than ours in their
homes, but some things which are not as nice..  The landlord was there along
with 2 hired help and they helped bring in the items from the two cars.  That
was nice.  I hooked up their computer and printer, while Mae and Sister Clark
put the food away.  The landlords brought food for all of us.  It was rice,
shredded coconut, rolls, some kind of a rice steamed dish which is put in
bamboo and steamed and afterwards wrapped in banana leaves.  She also had some
vegetables with lots of squid in it.  She served goat meat with onions, and another
dish which looked like a egg omelet, but didn’t taste like it.  Anyway, Mae and
I didn’t enjoy the meal very much.  Don’t think the Clarks did either.  It took
us about an hour to get home.  Pres. Brimhall texted us that Elder Neal A.
Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles passed away today after a lengthy
battle with leukemia.  He was 78 years old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Although we
were in a hurry to leave this morning I took the shower apart and flushed out
the water heater and we now have better water pressure.  I should have done
that months ago.  We left at 7:15am to pick up the Elders, drop them off in
Guimba and go on to Paniqui District Development Meeting.  After meeting, we
went to Moncada and visited with Imedla Baiola and corrected our scheduled for
Noemi’s checkups and medications.  We received a text from President Brimhall
informing us that Elder Neil A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve passed away
after his long battle with leukemia.  He will be missed.  We got home about
1:30 and Marlyn soon heated up our food for us.  Afterwards we took a nap and
then I got ready to go out to Guimba again to go visiting less-active
priesthood brethren with President Cabuyaban.  We visited 3 families.  We
showed the video “Windows of Heaven” to the Mactal family.  President Cabuyaban
had to have an interview with Sister Emmy.  Afterwards I took President
Cabuyaban and William to their homes.  I arrived home about 10:10 pm. 
President Mercado, his wife and daughter visited with Mae this evening, plus
she said she had other visitors, but still typed part of the family weekly
letter.  She also watched the DVD that Mike had made for us entitled “Our Mom”.
  We got to bed at 11:00 pm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We got up about 6am and at
7:30, the carpenter and his helper were here to fix the ceiling in the cooking
kitchen.  Water had seeped in and causing some problems.  It took them all day
to take out a piece of the ceiling and put in a new sheet of plywood, seal it
and paint it.  That isn’t the way you fix a roof from leaking, but I didn’t say
anything.  We had to stay home all day since they were here.  Marlyn had wanted
us to come to their branch party this morning, but we couldn’t leave the
house.   I worked on my Elder’s Quorum presentation, part of the time I was
looking through the Church magazines for pictures to use in it.  Mae finished
the family letter and sent it off to the kids.   She also read some articles
from the magazines, to us while I worked on the computer.  They finished soon
after 4:00pm so we were able to grab a bite to eat, Mae fixed brownies and I
popped pop corn, we put the multi media equipment in the car and headed off to
the Munoz Chapel for the baptism of Lesly Ann Parrenas Merto, Brother Nuque’s 8
year old niece.  He baptized her as her father isn’t active in the Church.   It
was nice and we were happy to be there.  It was raining hard when we got there
and they are not finished with the parking lot so it was like a swimming pool
again this week.  They did have a plank to walk to get across the water.  There
were a lot of children and youth, but not many adults, so we were happy we were
there.  Brother Nuque had texted us inviting us to come.  Bishop Neito was glad
we were there also.  The zone leaders also attended.  Afterwards, we went over
to Denny’s house to watch the video “The Book of Mormon” which President
Mercado had borrowed from the PBO.  It was very good.  We all enjoyed it. 
There were about 20 people there including President Mercado’s 2 young
children.   We had just gotten home and I was about to go to bed when the cell
phone rang.  It was Elder Hulbert, the zone leader.  He said the one new
Filipino Elder wants to go home.  He doesn’t speak either Tagalog or English
very well and told President Brimhall that he can’t speak or teach so he wants
to go home.  He has only been here 2 days.  President Brimhall wants the new
Filipino zone leader to go out and work with him to see if he can get him to
change his mind, so they needed me to take them out to Guimba.  I was really
tired, but, of course, I went.  We brought Elder England back with us.  It was
12:30 AM when I got to bed so soon went to bed.</span></p>

we got the projector, Screen and VCR set up.  Mae had help and put curtains
over some of the windows to darken the room.  We were able to start the showing
of the 1<sup>st</sup> Philippines Conference on time, but then about 20 minutes
into the conference the power went off.  Brothers went to borrow a generator
but before they could get back the power came back on and we were able to
finish the conference.  One other problem occurred when the first tape ended
and we had to start the 2<sup>nd</sup> tape, for they had double recorded about
10 minutes of the tape, so we had to fast forward it to find where to start. 
Over all it went well and we had about 200 plus in attendance.  It was 2:30 PM
when we got home.  We took a nap and then had a nice baked potatoes and pork
chop diner.  Mae and I played Rook for a while this evening.  It was nice to
relax and get some rest.  Besides the work in the cooking room that the Land
Lord had done yesterday, when we got home this afternoon, they had removed the
plants in front and redecorated it with new plants.  We were enjoying the
plants and shrubs that was there but I guess it is there place so it is up to
them.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 6 AM and then had to hurry to get away to go to the Clark’s.  We stopped
in Cabanatuan at Blas Edwards and bought some DC’s and a AutoCAD 2004 program. 
It cost me P150 or $2.74 for the program, the CD-RW disks only cost me P75 or
$1.37 each.  It was about 10 AM when we made it to the Clark’s.  I transferred
several of our files onto CD for them, what should help them in preparing
training outlines.  They had a nice lunch for us.  This afternoon we took a
ride and saw some beautiful country.  It was 6:30PM before we started home and
it was almost 7:45PM when we got home.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We planned on
getting up and going walking but were to tired and fell back to sleep.  When we
woke it was too late and we had to hurry to have breakfast ready for the Zone
Leaders before we had correlation meeting.  We were ready when they got here. 
We had French toast and scrambled eggs.  We enjoyed having the correlation
meeting and planned on a Home Teaching Visiting Teaching fireside.  After they
left we got reimbursement ready for the ZL’s to take to the mission office.  We
then went to town for gas and to take the letters to the ZL’s.  We went to San
Jose to transfer our money, got some items at the hardware store and the market
and then did our grocery shopping.  While at CVC we picked up the painting that
we had done of the two of us.  Our power has been out all day so it was good to
be going in the car most of the day.  We had lunch at Jollibees while in San
Jose.  Mae did a I. T. L. while we sere at the bank and have a referral for the
San Jose Elders and also while at the Palanki we met a young man that offered
to take our blood pressure and he ask us how he could join our church.  We got
his name, phone number and address and will send in a referral to the mission
office as he doesn’t live here locally. I went out to Branch Presidency meeting
this evening but President Cabuyaban didn’t feel well so didn’t come.  I
visited with him at his home and then went to the office.  I took some money to
Sister Villanueva for their Relief Society Work Day tomorrow.  We were on the
computer this evening sending e-mails.  Time went fast and we were late getting
to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning.  We had breakfast and then did some planning on the
things we needed to do today.  We were busy trying to get it all in.  We went
out to the Relief Society work day at Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>.  We ate dinner at
Cindy’s and them went back to the church and set up for the Guimba Pioneer Days
program.  We showed the movie “Brigham Young” after the speakers.  There was a
fair group that came out.  After the program and movie President Cabuyaban had
us take him to visit Sister Dela Cruz on welfare maters.  It was 10:30PM when
we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking although my back is hurting.  We got some Hydrocortisone cream the
other day and it has really helped with the problem I have been having with
sores in my crouch.  We get one item cleared up and now have problems in
another area.  I wrote my cousin Mark and told him that I thought we are
getting old.  This mission is certainly not the easiest thing I have ever
done.  It has been very challenging in many ways.  The other day while at the
bank, Mae got visiting with a lady and ITL (invite to lisson) her and she accepted
to let the missionaries visit her.  Mae prepared a Book of Mormon with her
testimony and picture in it and we took it over to San Jose so the Elders there
could deliver it.  We ate lunch at Jollibees, bought a Allen wrench, some nylon
rope to hang a picture and some jewelry that Mae saw and liked.  We got e-mails
from Mike, Shellie, Jeff and a short note from Scott.  I went out to Guimba and
met with President Cabuyaban for a few minutes, I had Elder go visiting with me
to three homes on church business.  Mae stayed home and wrote the Family
Letter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke
thinking about the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> branch and what can be done about it. 
I am really quite at a loss as to what I would recommend if I am asked.  We
didn’t walk this morning as we cuddled up for a few minutes and then had to
hurry to be ready to pickup the Elder’s for meeting.  We enjoyed the District
Development meeting and the Elders enjoyed the cake Mae brought them.  Before
leaving the parking lot we had Brother Dalim come over and talked with us.  We
ended up loaning him P180 to get a school uniform for his oldest daughter and
some gas for his trike.  He talked to us about his niece that has kidney
problems and needs dialysis but can’t afford it.  She isn’t a member of the church
so we really don’t have any way to help.  There are so many people here in the
Philippines that really need help but there is just no way to help them all.  We
went to the Mercury Drug and bought the medication for Nomi, and then took them
to the Dr. office.  We stopped on the way home at President Cabuyaban’s and had
him correct some vouchers to be turned in.  We visited with him for a few
minutes.  He seems depressed over the Branch also.  Marlyn had a nice dinner
ready when we got home.  After lunch we took a nap.  Nida came about 3 PM and
gave both Mae and I a treatment.  We encouraged her with her business plans. 
We are still trying to decide just how to help her.  We drove over to brother
Dimacio and took the vouchers.  We stopped at President Gajonera’s but he
wasn’t home.  We went over to President Gasmenia’s to have him sign the check
but it had already been signed by President Mercado.  We feel much better after
the treatments today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke about
2AM to use the bathroom and was thinking of the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch. 
I felt the need to send a report to President Brimhall as to what is happening
there.  I spent a couple of hours composing a ruff draft before going back to
bed at 4AM.  We got up and went walking at the collage and then came home to
shower.  I went back to sleep for a hour and then got up and ate.  Mae helped
me compose the letter to President Brimhall.  At 11AM we drove over to Camiline
to visit Elder and Sister Maharry and take a flower to Sister Maharry.  We went
out to Cindy’s for lunch and then just went back to their place and visited for
a while.  We got home at 5:15PM.  We ate some dinner then finished the e-mail
to President Brimhall and the letter to our family.  Mae sent the e-mails off
and I fell asleep.  This evening Mae worked on materials for Primary and YW. 
It was 11PM before we went to bed.</span></p>
