<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but we had to get up by 5 anyway in order to get to meetings on time.  We left
on time but stopped to pick up President Cabuyaban &amp; his family.  They were
late so that made us late for P. E. C.  I seem to have started the day off with
a negative attitude and it carried through the day.  When we got to the Church
I realized that I had forgotten to bring all my books and papers.  The Elders
wanted to ask us the questions about visits to the five selected families and
that didn’t set to well with me as we are trying to get any priesthood to come
out.  It almost seemed to me that they were just interested in finding out the
questions that they are required to turn in a report on and then be excused
from the meeting.  I also asked them if they had the five I. O. S. forms that I
had assigned them and they are not sure where they are.  Our Executive
Secretary did not come this morning.  The Branch Clerk is also out of town and
didn’t arrange for anyone to bring the Sacrament bread and water.  President
Cabuyaban wants me to conduct the Sacrament meeting.  Prayers had not been
assigned and I didn’t think any music had been prepared.  I felt upset.  It was
Fast Sunday so we didn’t have a program to worry about and President had someone
go buy bread (on Sunday) so that was there.  We still do not have a Sunday
School President so there was no preparation for Sunday School and the teacher,
Sister Dela Cruz, didn’t show up.  I just left that up to President Cabuyaban. 
President wasn’t there when it was time to start Priesthood meeting so I
welcomed President Mercado, started meeting with a song and prayer and turned
the time over to President Mercado.  He released Joel Mata as Elders Quorum
President and sustained William Baccay as Elders Quorum President.  He,
President Cabuyaban and I then set William apart.  William then took over and
talked about the upcoming Temple trip on August 18<sup>th</sup> and also about
baptism for the dead.  We tried to have a Branch Counsel after the meetings but
had very few leaders there so just talked with William and Annaliza about going
to the Temple and inviting the Branch members to also attend the Temple that
day.  I volunteered to help pay some of the travel expenses, if we could get a
large group to go to the Temple that day.  On the way home I got explaining my
frustrations and upset Mae.  We ate some dinner and then went over to Roger
&amp; Heidi’s for a short visit.  I worked on my Elders Quorum presentation
this evening before going to bed.  We received word that Elder David B. Hate of
the Quorum of the Twelve died July 31<sup>st</sup> at 4:15AM.  He will be
missed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We enjoyed
walking at the collage this morning.  One of the things that is great about
walking together is to talk with each other.   Mae and I discussed the problem
that is coming about with the use of the car and decided that we have got to
stop it now.  Upon getting back home and taking our showers we remembered that
Mae was going to give me a haircut.  She did and I had to rinse off again. 
After breakfast we got on the instant messaging with Jeff and Scott.  When I
first brought the internet up there was a cute note from Gail telling us that
our boys were still on the camping trip.  However, Jeff came on and said he had
been home for a couple of hours.  Scott then came on and we enjoyed visiting
for a while.  It sounds like they really had a good time.  Mae went with me to
take care of the money deposit for the Branch.  We also paid our phone bill. 
As we ate lunch, I got thinking about our family and especially Sandi and I
really got homesick and cried.  Part of it is the hard time I am having with
the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch challenge.  We went shopping at San Jose, came
back and put things away, and then took a nap.  ------------- This evening
Roger Silvia came over and helped me figure out an excel program, he installed
my Auto Cad program and he installed a Encyclopedia for us that is really very
nice.  I just felt bad that we took up his Family Home Evening with his
family.  I am not feeling very well tonight.  My stomach feels upset, I also
have noticed that for the past few days my right thigh is sore like a boil.  Oh
well I guess I am getting old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I slept very
little last night.  By morning I felt some better so Mae let me sleep.  I do
not know what it is that is giving me problems but my head feels light or dizzy
and my stomach is upset.  During the night I felt that I would through up but
never did.  I thought a lot about the Atonement and all the mistakes I have
made during my life and can only appreciate the wonderment that is there.  I
didn’t get feeling well enough to go out to Guimba so just stayed home.  It has
rained a lot during the past couple of days.  Mae has kept busy with various
projects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I feel much
better this morning so we got up and went walking at the collage.  After
breakfast I went to President Gasmenia’s and had him sign a check for me.  I
went to the bank and cashed the check so I could take the money to president
Cabuyaban this evening.  We got word that Sugar would be coming to San Jose
today so had her stop and eat lunch with us.  I took a nap and then tried to
register the AutoCAD program, but it wouldn’t let me.  We went out to Guimba
this evening to a Primary practice and Branch Presidency Meeting.  I was
concerned about using the car to pick up President Cabuyaban to go to meetings
and visiting, so I texted President Brimhall.  He replied back and feels it is
ok.  Mae went to the primary practice for part of it and then went to Mid-Week
Activity.  After Opening Exercises, they did a service project of cleaning the
chapel and washing the windows.  At 7:30, Mae went over to Sis. Villanueva’s
planning to go visit sisters, but Sis. Villanueva was not ready and suggested
they go the following week.  She showed Mae several purses which her
sister-in-law sells as a business and Mae bought one.  Afterwards we went to
visit Sis. Dela Cruz as Pres. Cabuyaban needed to visit with her, and then Mae
was concerned about Christopher as he missed Sunday meetings and wasn’t there
tonight either.  She wanted to visit him.  Maybe it’s a good thing we did,
because he is leaving to go to Angeles for a job he just got there working in a
sewing factory.  Mae and Pres. Cabuyaban visited with him for a few minutes. 
He was asleep, but we woke him up.  Mae encouraged him to go to Church there,
to keep preparing for his mission and told him he could get his dental work
done free there in Angeles.  She also told him that Pres. Mercado keeps asking
how he is progressing with his mission preparation.   Hopefully, he will keep
in touch with us.  We didn’t get home until almost 10:30 p.m.   I was a little
frustrated with the way the evening went but I guess I just have to accept things
as they are here in the Philippines.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning and as we walked we commented on some things we feel we
need to write down so we remember them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:38.25pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>One is that the leaves fall from
the trees every day so that is always a daily job of sweeping up the leaves, if
you want your place to look nice.   There are lots of sweepers at the college
and other places of business.  We feel this is a hardship and we are glad this doesn’t
happen at home.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:38.25pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Very few people have a telephone,
and for those that do they have a cellular phone, which is out of range, out of
charge, or out of load or you do not have a phone number for them.  It is very to
get a hold of people to take care of Church callings, make assignments and appointments. 
As to out of load, many buy their time or load card at P30 each.  That is a
very expensive way to buy because you have to use those cards with in 24 hours
or lose the time.  We buy a P300 card and that time is good for two months.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:38.25pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>There are few families that have
their own transportation.  Of those that do it will be a bike, and they come in
a verity of styles, a scooter, a motorcycle, a trike and occasionally a car. Some
farmers have converted a farm implement (kulikliks) which is like a large hand garden
motivator with the blades taken off and tires installed and attached to a
trailer.  Farm implements do not have to be licensed and taxed as are other
forms of transportation.  Public transportation is “Trikes” which is a small
motorcycle with side car. These are everywhere and often a cause of traffic
blockages.  There are “Jeepnies”  which is a model of the old army jeep with a
long body and is build to accommodate 10 to 12 people but you often see 14 to
18 and some times we have seen as many as 6 to 12 people hanging on the top and
rear bumper.  Busses are used for long distance travel and are mainly found
only on major highways.  Because they are large the driver often is rude and
pushes the right of way.  We see many motorcycle operators with helmets, often
hanging from their arm.  If there more that on person on a motorcycle and the
operator has a helmet his passengers will not.  Often you see babies, 6 months
old and up riding in front between the fathers knees.  We often see 3 to 4
passengers on a motorcycle.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We see termite hills everywhere,
some as high as 5 and 6 feet.  Once a colony gets started the people are
superstitious about removing them.  We saw one that had to be removed in order
to put underground utilities in.  After covering up the utilities the ground
was raked down and a funeral was held with the placement of a cross, flowers
and candles burned through the night.  </span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>In the eyes of North Americans, the
Filipino people are polite in some ways and rude in other ways.  For example,
when you are talking with them and they need to go, they will say “please
excuse me, I need to go now.”  If someone comes over to talk to them, they
don’t just walk away from you or turn away from you, they say “Please excuse
me”.  If two people are talking and blocking the hallway or doorway, etc., and
a person needs to go in front of them, they will crouch down, put their hands
together and say “please excuse me” or “cuse me”.  But, if they are in
meetings, many think nothing of talking to other people while someone is
speaking from the pulpit or a teacher is in front teaching a class.  They also
think nothing of getting up and walking out – whether to go to the bathroom, to
txt someone, or just walk outside for a few minutes.  Adults as well as children
and youth, do this.  We are trying to teach them reverence and that this is
also rude.  They are also rude on the roads and in traffic.  They walk, drive
or stop anywhere or anytime they want, and they are not concerned about how it
affects other people.</span></p>

working and industrious, but most are lazy.  Most Filipinos live in poverty.  Some
live in poverty because of laziness, others because of drinking, smoking and
gambling, others because of their circumstances and upbringing, and others
because of their corrupt government.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We came home
and showered and then had to hurry in order to have breakfast ready for when
the ZL’s came.  Because I wasn’t feeling well on Tuesday we had our correlation
meeting this morning.  We mainly planned on a H.T. / V.T. seminar to be held at
Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> branch.  Because of Mae’s advance planning things went
pretty well.  After the ZL’s left we read from the scriptures.  We are reading
the Old Testament and often are left wondering as to the meaning and how the
people can switch back and forth so fast.  I feel that this is the same
attitude that the Filipinos have.  I don’t understand it but I can see that
without the missionary program, the Church would not last very long here.  We
spent some time writing the above thoughts down and I guess there are at least
that many more that we need to try to express some of the experiences we are
having here that are unique to us.  I tried to reach the District Clerk to get
a check but he didn’t reply to my text.  I went out to Guimba this evening and
went home teaching with President Cabuyaban &amp; William Baccay.  We couldn’t
get to the two families as the river was to high and the road was to muddy.  We
were able to visit with three other single members and then returned home.  I
felt very much like a taxi driver because I didn’t understand much that was
said but I provided wheels for them.  Maybe that is doing something.  It was
9PM when I got home.  Mae had been working on the computer most of the evening
plus baking a cake for the Paniqui District Elders.  We had texted President
Nadado but didn’t receive a reply.  Oh well!  Good night.</span></p>

walk this morning as we have to pickup the Munoz Elders and take them to
Guimba, we then went on to Paniqui to meet with the Elders there.  Although we
are not presently doing much training in the Paniqui District we still enjoy
associating with the Elders there and hope to soon be able to get back to
training in those branches again.  We tried to visit with President Nadado but
he didn’t respond to our text.  We stopped at Brother Damacio on the way home
and got a check for Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Br.  Marlyn had diner ready for us
when we got home.  We then took the check to President Gasmenia’s to have it
signed and to the bank to get it cashed.  We came back and took a nap.  This
evening we went out to eat, having made an appointment to meet Mr. &amp; Mrs.
Tony at their restaurant to visit.  We enjoyed the visit and becoming
acquainted with them.  Mae had a hamburger and a crap and I had roasted
chicken.  The chicken was not cut like the Filipinos cut it but was cut like we
do at home.  Both meals were very good and so reasonable.  On the way home we
stopped at Brother and Sister Bustos and visited with them.  They seemed to
enjoy having us stop and visit.  It was almost 9PM when we got home.</span></p>

went bad and we went to bed upset at the end of the day.  I think that is only
the 2<sup>nd </sup>or 3rd time that has happened in the 45 years we have been
married.  We had to apologize to each other this morning.  We were busy getting
ready for meetings.  We picked up President Cabuyaban and his family on the
way.  It has really been a hectic day at church today.  We didn’t get home
until almost 4PM so was tired and hungry.  We baked some potatoes and while
they were cooking we took a nap.  We then fried some pork chops and cooked some
frozen vegetables.  It was good to have a “Western” dinner for a change. 
Sometimes I sure get tired of the Filipino food.  The Hyers called and we will
get together with them for dinner tomorrow.  We played Rummy this evening with
both of us winning a set so we had a one hand play off and Mae won.  We tried
to get on the internet but couldn’t get it to connect this evening.  I entered
m journal and then tried again with the internet and got through.  There wasn’t
any thing from our children so we weren’t on for long.</span></p>

our walk short and came back home.  We showered and ate breakfast and then got
on the instant messaging with Scott.  None of the rest of the family could make
it today.  We enjoyed visiting with Scott.  Mae went with me to make the bank
deposit for the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  When we got back home the Hyer’s
had just arrived.  We enjoyed visiting with them.  Sister Hyer said she is
tired and would like to go home.  I was glad that someone else besides me feels
that way.  Marlyn prepared a nice dinner for us and it was especially enjoyable
to visit with Elder and Sister Hyer.  They had to leave as they are traveling
to the Longapo (? on spelling) mission, for some training up there.  We took a
short nap and then went to San Jose grocery shopping and mailed the receipts to
the P. B. O. in Manila.  This evening we went to the Dallio family (an older
couple that just joined the Church in July).  We enjoyed visiting with them and
talked to them about the Temple and Temple work.  It was a good evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking but being short on time we didn’t walk very long.  My ankle feels much
better today so walking was not a problem.  We came home and showered and got
breakfast ready for the ZL’s.  Following breakfast we had our correlation
meeting.  I took a nap and then went to Guimba to pickup brother Villanueva.  I
got there at noon but he didn’t think I was coming until 1PM so wasn’t ready.  We
then started to leave and he said that Brother Fernando lived here.  That is
the first time that I understood that we were taking him with us.  Brother
Fernando was ready but we had to wait for his brother-in-law who was going to
help him.  Then we understood that two brother-in-laws were going but after
waiting for a while the 2<sup>nd</sup> changed his mind.  On the way Brother V.
got it through to me that we were to be at the hospital before 2PM.  I drove
fast trying to get there but after crossing the bridge with only about 3 km to
go, the traffic came to a complete stand still.  We took another 1 ½ hr getting
to the hospital.  When I pulled in to let them off, being there was signs all
over saying “no parking with out a sticker”.  I stopped in what we figured out
to be the admitting office and as I stopped a guard came over and said that I
couldn’t park there.  I tried to explain that I was just letting them off, but
he didn’t seem to understand me so I just ignored him and unloaded them.  I had
to find somewhere outside the parking lot to park.  We were sent all over the
hospital before we were told that we were too late and would have to come back
tomorrow.  I was not a real happy camper.  We ask if there was a C. R. and was
told that it was so dirty that we wouldn’t want to use it.  It was very
confusing and I am not sure if anyone really knows who told who what was
suppose to be happening but I will try again tomorrow but this time I told them
I would be in Guimba by 5:30AM and would leave at 6AM.  Mae was very
understanding when I came home upset.  I told her I just want to go home and go
fishing.  I really can’t say that I have enjoyed this mission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 3AM
and was up by 3:30AM as I had to leave at 5AM for Guimba.  Brother Villanueva
and I took Fernando and two of his brother-in-laws back to the hospital in
Cabanatuan.  Yesterday the man in the one department that had to get the x-rays
for us said that we had to of been there before 2PM so he couldn’t help us
then.  He said we needed to be at the hospital by 8AM, so we were there at
7:30AM and had to wait for the department to open at 8AM.  We then are told
that the one to read the x-rays doesn’t get there until 10 or 10:30 AM and that
was the man that told us to be there by 8AM.  I would like to have chocked
him.  We were then either waiting or going to another part of the hospital or
pharmacy all day.  At 4 PM we finally got him checked in and Brother Villanueva
&amp; I came home.  We stopped at our house and Mae had some dinner ready.  We
then went out to Guimba and took Brother Villanueva home.  Mae went to Youth
Activity buy no one else showed up.  It was after 7PM before President
Cabuyaban came for Branch Presidency meeting and then we had to leave to get
other things done.  I am sure frustrated with the way things are going.  It was
9 PM when we got home and I’m sure tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I did take
some pictures of the hospital and will try to send them to David and Shauna.  It
is just hard to think that this is a Hospital.  It is so old and dirty.  In
many places you see temporary building that has became permanent.  Electrical
wiring that is ran on porcelain insulators with bear wiring and lighting
connections made by wrapping the wire around the main conductors.  The thing
that really seems scary is that this is 220 volts.  I realize more all the time
of how blessed we are in the United States.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Because of
going to bed late last night we slept in.  We didn’t go walking and after
showering we went to Tony’s Restaurant and had breakfast.  President Cabuyaban
text me and told me, that he had the papers ready to be taken to Brother Damacio,
so we drove on out to Guimba.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The
Cabuyaban’s are moving into their new home.  It has the outside walls up, the
roof on, which is just tin and the trusses would not have held snow,  and a
dirt floor.  It is just one room with a little CR in the one corner.  The
kitchen cabinet has a cement cabinet top with no doors or drawers.  He does have
one electrical outlet so they can plug in an extension cord in order to run a
light.   They are so excited to be moving into their own home.  I was amazed!  Mae
would not have wanted to move into a house like that.  It was more like a
chicken coop or a barn for animals in the states.   The house is just
cinderblock, no plaster, no paint.  The doorway to get into the CR is very
small and the cinderblock has been cut so it is rough so if you brushed by it,
it could cut or scrape you.  They have a toilet, but it does not work as there
is no plumbing, it just goes into a big hole outside the house.  Even though it
was moving day, it wouldn’t take them long to move in as they don’t have hardly
anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                There was
still paper work that was not finished.  I had to go into town and get
signatures from Brother Villanueva, and then to the church house to get a
report which was left on the desk in the office.  We went to Brother Damacio
and found more problems and had to call President Mercado, He wants me to have
President Gasmena approve the one voucher.  I wasn’t able to get a hold of
President Gasmena until 5 PM as he had been in Manila.  I got the Check Voucher
signed and then went back to Brother Damacio for another check.  I went from
there back to President Gasmena’s but found that he had gone and would be back
later.  At 8 PM we drove back to President Gasmena’s and got the checks
signed.  At 8:20 Pres. Cabuyaban texted me and will have to go to Cabanatuan in
the morning and take some money for more medicine.  I will have to meet
President Cabuyaban in Bolac at 5:15AM to give him some money.  I am having
trouble holding my cool as the past three days have just been a rat race for
me.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Well I woke
at 4 AM but was able to sleep a few more minutes before the alarm woke me at
4:25 AM.  I had to hurry and go to Bolac to meet President Cabuyaban by 5:15
AM.  I was just about there when he texted me to tell me that he had to have
P3, 280 with him this morning.  I only had P2, 000 with me so had to return
home to get more.  I called President Mercado who told me he could not
authorize any more that a total of P5, 000.  He suggested that someone else
(otherwise me) might be willing to give the remaining.  I drove back to Bolac
and met President Cabuyaban and gave him P4, 000.  President Cabuyaban wants me
to also line up Valintino’s relatives to take care of him this weekend.  I came
home quite upset.  I really feel that I am being used.  We got ready and left
for Guimba.  We took the Munoz Elders with us.  After taking the Elders to the
chapel we walked to Brother and Sister Villanueva to see if Brother Villanueva
would talk to the family.  Brother Villanueva was not home but would return
about 10 AM.  We attended District Development meeting then went back to
Brother Villanueva.  He was home and willing to go with me to talk to the
family.  The 2 brother-in-laws are willing to go but needed transportation
funds.  I didn’t have change with me so told Brother Villanueva I would get
some change and bring it back to him.  We took some medication and cream for
Nomie to the Dr. office and found that they came last Saturday but was later
that they had told us that they would be.  We took a P100 to Brother Villanueva
and left for home.  We then got a text from President Cabuyaban asking us to
get the papers at his place and have the brother-in-laws bring them to him.  He
had forgotten to take them with him.  We went out to his place and finally
found them, then we took them back to Villanueva’s and asked them to give them
to the brother-in-laws to take down as well as to ask them to take some clean
clothes to him.  I was pretty upset by the time we got home.  Nida was there
when we got home.  After some lunch she gave Mae and I a treatment.  I made it
to the bank to get the checks from yesterday cashed.  I came home and took a
nap.  Brother Maharry called so when I got up I returned his call.  I have a
hard time not saying to much and Mae overhearing was upset with my attitude. 
After dinner this evening I read the Church News, filled out some budget items
and entered my journal.  Mae had got on the inter-net and received a nice
letter from Carla informing us of some of the family news.  We hadn’t heard
that Florence had died in February and now Keith died August 11<sup>th</sup>. 
It was a short letter but gave us some update on the family that we hadn’t
heard about.  We are getting old enough that we need to read the Obituary to
see if we are in it. We have had several family members and one friend die
since we have been on out mission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  After breakfast we went out to Guimba to the District Primary
126<sup>th</sup> Birthday Party.  It was well planned and went well.  It was
held at the 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch chapel.  For lunch we came back into town and
ate at Cindy’s.  It was 3:30PM when we got home.  I took a short nap and then
Tony came to get us for a evening at their place.  They live South East of
Munoz, about 3.6 km and have a lovely home they are building.  They have a 4
year old son and a Filipino girl that lives with them.  They said that she is
their unofficial adopted daughter.  She is 17 years old and helps around the
house and tends their son Kenneth.  Tony and Leah were a great host and
hostess, and we had a wonderful evening as well as a wonderful Western meal of
pork roast, mashed potatoes, gravy and vegetables.  Appetizers and soup was
served first.  After eating we set at the table and talked about the church. 
Tony has read the Book of Mormon through and is starting a 2<sup>nd</sup>
time.  He would like to have some more material.  We will loan him “A Marvelous
Work and a Wonder” for him to read.  Leah, who is Filipino, Tony is Dutch, is
also reading the Book of Mormon.  She said she likes reading the English copy
because it is not as boring as her Filipino translation.  It was almost 9 PM
before we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We over slept
and had to hurry to get to Church.  I have P. E. C. meeting at 7:30 AM. 
President Cabuyaban was at the highway waiting for us and had his family come
later.  As we drove to Guimba I had a bet with Mae that President Cabuyaban
would have his family with him, but he didn’t and so Mae won that one.  I told
President C. that we needed to do more to get Priesthood out and active because
I thought that my assignment would be changed the end of this month.  I wonder
if that will be so or if I am just hopping for it.  Talks had not been assigned
for today’s meetings and as I was to conduct I would have to fill in.  We had
one youth speaker and one Sister that were assigned.  I ask Sister Cabuyaban to
express her feelings as to the Primary Birthday Party yesterday.   I took about
20 minutes and spoke about the Temple and purpose of the Gospel.  I guess it
went ok as Mae said it did.  Sunday School still wasn’t organized as well as
Priesthood meeting.  I took the Young Men and gave them a lesson on prayer. 
With the Elders help I hope I gave them something of worth while.  President
Cabuyaban wanted me to interview the youth for going to the Temple but after
the struggle I had in the class I know that that was an impossible task with
out speaking the language, so told President that he would have to do that. 
After doing the finances President Cabuyaban ask if we could go with Brother
William Bacay to Sister Dela Cruz’s home and bless her home.  William and Annaliza
were at William’s home so we went there.  William said that they would come in
his trike and meet us there.  I felt impressed to just follow them and so let
them lead the way.  I was sure glad I did because it was a different Dela Cruz
than I was thinking of.  That went quite well and we enjoyed visiting with
Sister Dela Cruz.  It was 3 PM when we got home.  We ate some lunch and took a
nap.  Mae worked on the Family letter and got it sent off.  I am really quite
depressed over the Branch and what to do or what to suggest.  We are really
realizing that with out speaking Tagolog that the communication ability is
greatly inhabited.  They think that they understand but if you continue the
conversation there was a lot that did not get across.  Sister Maharry called to
find out if Keith Jensen was related to me as they had been on the inter-net
and saw his obituary in the Rexburg news.  I was glad that Carla had e-mailed
me the other day telling us about his and Florence’s passing.  Sister Maharry
said that she knew Floss through Vietta who she was friends with in high
school.  Elder Maharry also knew Keith who had served as a finance clerk at
Ricks collage with him.  I also called Elder Hyer and visited with him about
his comment of buying a trike to take home when they leave.  I thought about
him as Brother Dalin in the Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch is a motorcycle sales
man and sells are slow right now for him.  Elder Hyer is only thinking about it
but not seriously.  It is really discouraging to try to know how to help these
people.  There are so many problems and as Tony said last night as we were
talking of some of the problems we have seen, “that is only the tip of the
iceberg.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning.  After showering and changing we went to Tony’s for
breakfast.  We then paid the electrical bill and left for Camiline.  We got to
the Maharry’s at 10:35 AM.  They took us out to meet Fernando Fabros, a Branch
President and a carpenter by trade.  I talked to him about building doors for
me to be shipped to the U. S. for our home there.  He took us out to meet a
good friend of his who would be the builder for us.  We didn’t discuss
specifics but discussed if they could provide the things I want, such as door,
cabinet doors, paneling and trim.   He feels he could and they could ship it to
Manila.  From there I would have to make those arrangements.  I would really
like to do it but still feel very uneasy about it.  After that visit we went
for a ride as Elder Maharry wanted to show us some to the area came.  We came
back to Cindy’s and had dinner.  We stopped at the tailor shop that we had
ordered clothes from last time and got our order.  We made an additional order
as we were very pleased with their clothing. We then went to see some more of
the surrounding area.  It was 4 PM before we left for home but we had a very
enjoyable day.  We got home about 6 PM and relaxed the rest of the evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning.  We had the ZL’s over for breakfast and correlation
meeting.  Our main concern was scheduling the H.T. &amp; V. T. firesides.  Just
before noon President Cabuyaban texted me and wants me to go to Guimba, get the
deposit and reimbursement vouchers and get a reimbursement check before
tomorrow.  I got part of it done but I couldn’t get the reimbursement check. 
We went grocery shopping and while in San Jose I mailed the information to P.
B. O.  We found out this morning that the Clark’s were in a accident last
night.  They hit a man that walked in front of them in the dark.  We also found
out that we could not go to the Temple with out it being approved by the Area
Presidency.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We reached President Brimhall
but did not get approval until 7PM this evening.  We were sure grateful for
this permission.  Annaliza was especially happy that we are going to be able to
be at the Temple with them.  When she heard we couldn’t come, she said they
would cancel it, as we had to be with them.  Oh dear, we don’t want that so
called and told them not to cancel it.  They said they were praying that we
could come, and so were we.  Our prayers were answered.  Elder and Sister Clark
got a rental car to use while their car is being repaired.   When they got home
they realized that they had left their house keys on the car keys and could not
get into their home.  They would have to drive back to Angeles to get the
keys.  They called us and ask if they could stay with us tonight instead of the
other trip.  We sure enjoyed having them this evening.  They did not get
permission to go to the Temple.  We felt bad about that as we enjoy being with
them and was looking forward to tomorrow.  When we went to San Jose for our
groceries we also picked up our painting.  We are really excited with it.  The
artist also added in another painting for us.  It was the painting that Elder
Barker had ordered of the Angel Moroni visit to the Prophet Joseph Smith.  We
really like it but Elder Barker didn’t like it so wouldn’t buy it after it was
painted.  We feel bad about that.</span></p>

was a hour longer this time, but we had stopped to withdraw some money from the
bank and to get some breakfast.  President Cabuyaban and I took the youth into
the Temple to do Baptisms for the dead, while the rest went through a session
at the temple.  At 11 AM we had the privilege of witnessing the sealing of
William Bucay and Annaliza Mactal.  It was a very beautiful ceremony.  After
that we went outside the Temple and took pictures of the Bride &amp; Groom
including friends and friends.  The brides and groom also provided a lunch for
all that attended.  Mae and I stopped at the Distribution Center and at
Greenhills mall and got some pearls for our daughters, daughter-in-laws and
older granddaughters.</span></p>

went walking although I felt depressed this morning.  After returning home I
washed our car as it was really dirty fro the trip to Manila yesterday.  We
attended the San Jose and Guimba Districts Zone Conference.  It was very
enjoyable and as normal President Brimhall and Sister Brimhall’s messages were
special.  President had their daughter and son-n-law with them today.  They are
visiting for a few days.  Their daughter sang “I Feel My Savior’s Love” and
that was very special.  The meeting was special all day.  It was also a
transfer day for Zone Leaders and we are losing Elder Hulbert and getting Elder
Michael.  We will miss Elder Hulbert.  It rained hard just before the
conference ended.  President indicated that I might be in Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
Presidency for some time.  That really didn’t make me real excited.  When we
got home President And Sister Mercado came over.  President Mercado signed a
check for me.  He also ask if he could borrow our power point projector for
tomorrow.  We turned him down, not feel very good about it.  After they left I
felt very depressed.  I took a nap and then we went out to Guimba where Mae did
some training with Sister Luz while President Cabuyaban and I went visiting. 
We visited one Brother who used to be a Branch President but now inactive.  He
isn’t feeling well so asked President C. to give him a blessing.  I was asked
to seal the anointing and give the blessing.  I used the opportunity to also
give him a message for the need to become active.  We visited another couple
that are less active and then got some receipts at brother Valentine’s, then
went back and got Mae.  We were late getting home and getting to bed.</span></p>

have time to go walking as we were a few minutes late getting up and we had to
leave at 7:20 AM to go to the Paniqui District Development meeting.  This will
be the last time we will meet with Elder Marks and Elder Hayman as they will be
going home in 10 days.  It is interesting to get to know these young men and
you can get attached to them pretty easy.  Most of them grow a lot from when
they first arrive and they learn to work hard.  We enjoy meeting with the
Elders in these meetings.  After meeting Mae had brownies for them which they
all enjoy.  We then went to Moncada and took Noemi some medication and Nida
some garments that we picked up for her while we were at the Distribution office
the other day.  We also stopped at Christopher’s parents to get the address
where Chris is living but found that he is back with his parents.  We visited
with him for a few minutes and invited him back to church.  On the way home we
stopped at the Bank and cashed the reimbursement check.  It was after 2 PM when
we got home.  We took a nap and then ate before I went out to Guimba to go
visiting with President Cabuyaban.  We visited with two individuals this
evening.  It is so hard when I do not know what is being said.  The one Brother
is having trouble with repentance so we visited for some time about that
subject.  The real problem, it seems to me, is that he is upset because
President Cabuyaban ask him to turn in his Temple Recommend because he isn’t paying
his tithing.  His final words were (in Tagalog), when I get my Temple Recommend
back then I will become active.  I don’t know if it was a wasted time or not
but you sure wonder.  When taking President Cabuyaban home he was concerned
about some of these areas and I told him that he was not a detective to search
out those that were not keeping the commandments, but should take opportunity
when it is appropriate to speak on some of these delicate topics.  It was 9:30
PM when I got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had to get
up and hurry to get ready and leave for Paniqui to attend the Districts Primary
Birthday Party.  They had a very good attendance and the program was well
conduced and organized.  We were especially thrilled at the part that Paniqui 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch Primary did as that was the last branch Mae trained before we were
assigned to Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>.  The president had done so well with the
planning, the customs and the number of children participating.  We stopped at
Cindy’s and got some lunch as we thought we had an appointment in Guimba on the
way home.  However we got a text that it had to be canceled.  We were
disappointed as we would have liked to gone to Tony’s in Munoz for lunch.  On
the way home Tony text us and said they wanted to attend church with us
tomorrow.  We met then at the café and enjoyed visiting with them.  We gave him
a couple of books to read and explained that we would be in Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
branch so we would not be able to attend with them, however we made
arrangements for us to take the Elders out to their place this evening so that
they could meet them and also meet them at church tomorrow.  After leaving
there we went over to the Umipig’s and visited with them, asking them to watch
for Tony &amp; Leah tomorrow.  We enjoyed the visit with the Umipig’s also. 
They are great people and we have enjoyed getting to know them.  When we got
home I took a nap while Mae sent our family a e-mail.  When I woke Mae got
something to eat and then I worked on the computer while she took a nap.  I made
a CD of the pictures that I took of William and Annaliza’s wedding.  I woke Mae
with just enough time to get ready and leave to meet the Elders, however Sister
Maharry called and held her up for a few minutes.  That put us late meeting
Elder Natad and Elder Mitchel.  We went out to Tony &amp; Leah Gerritsen’s to
have the Elders meet them.  We didn’t visit long but was later that we had
planned because of a detour in the road.  Although we didn’t stay long it was
10 PM before we got the Elders home.  It was almost 11:30 PM before we got to
bed.</span></p>

early in order to be on time for P.E.C. at 7:30 AM.  Pres. Cabuyaban didn’t
come out to the road so we had to drive in to get him.  Today was interesting
as normal.  It is sure hard when you understand very little of what is being
said.  If they are talking directly to me then it is in English, otherwise it
is in Tagalog.  As the Sacrament program started President leaned over and said
that there would be 23 minutes left without a speaker.  I did not respond.  In
another minute he said “I’m conducting.”  Again I didn’t respond.  After
another minute or two he asked if I shouldn’t open my scriptures.  Again I
didn’t respond.  After the last speaker concluded with over 20 minutes remaining
he got up and announced that we would have a rest hymn and then Elder Browning
would be the concluding speaker.  I know he would do that and though I thought
of not responding, I rose and gave a talk.  I can only say that the Spirit
directed my thoughts and I spoke the exact remaining time.  I had to ask Mae if
I made any since and if I tied my thought together.  She said that I gave a
good talk.  The rest of the meetings seemed to go about the same.  I sometimes
wonder if I am doing any good or if I am like a parachute that is used to bail
out.  We also have some questions concerning the use of Fast Offerings that I
will ask President Brimhall about.  We came home quite beat.  We ate the
sandwiches that were maid by Tony last night and sent home with us, and took a
nap.  When I got up I started to write President Brimhall about the questions
we have but realized I needed more information.  I tried to call Sister Emmie
Baltizar to find the information but couldn’t reach her.  I will have to
contact her later.  Elder and Sister Clark called to see if we want to go to
Dingalong tomorrow.  We decided to do it so will have to let our family know
that we won’t be on line with them tomorrow.  Mae cooked baked potatoes and
chicken for diner.  It is good to have western style food.  I entered today’s
entry into my journal and then sent a e-mail to our family before we went to
bed.</span></p>

went walking and then came home and got ready to go to the Clark’s.  We ate on
the way to save time.  We got there just after 9 AM.  The four of us drove up
to Dingalon Bay.  This is the first time Mae and I have been there although it
is in our mission.  It is a larger community than I had expected.  We took a
lot of pictures.  The bay is beautiful.  There is so much potential for that
area as is there with the whole Philippines but I doubt if those potentials
will ever come about.  We returned to the Clark’s before 4 PM and only stayed
for a few minutes before we came on.  I was tired so Mae drove back.  We went
to Guimba so that we could hold Family Home Evening with the Matal’s and the
Bacay’s.  We gave the lesson on the importance of Family Home Evening and then
showed the pictures we took at Williams &amp; Annaliza’s wedding at the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t
make it walking this morning.  We had all four of the Munoz Elders for
breakfast this morning.  After eating we went into our correlation meeting. 
The phone rang and Mae answered it.  She was quite a while and then she told me
that it was Sandi and she wanted to talk to me.  It was so good to hear from
her.  She is busy with her work.  She has found out the reasons for her head
aches as she has a ruptured disk in her neck.  The Dr. wants to have her see a
specialist and probably have a operation.  We recommended that she talk to
Randy before she does the operation.  It was sure good talking to her.  We got
a very nice e-mail from Jeff today and appreciated getting that.  Between the
two of them I sure felt Home Sick.  We went into town to make the deposit, took
the check vouchers to Brother Damagio and then went to Tony’s and had lunch. 
Tony was there and quite excited to tell us about attending church and the
missionary lesson today.  He also said that Allen (their unofficially adopted
daughter) would like to also read the Book of Mormon.  He has already read
“True to the Faith” and the Priesthood manual that we gave him.  He also told
us that Kenneth had the whole Jr. Sunday school sing “Baa Baa Black Sheep”.  We
bought some sausage patties from Tony.  We went to San Jose to the Bank and
cashed our check, bought a 25’ tape measure for P195 or less than $3.50.  We
also went grocery shopping.  When we came Mae put the groceries away while I
tried to balance our checking account with Bank of the Philippines.  Mae got
something for dinner and then I went out to Guimba and got President
Cabuyaban.  We visited one couple this evening and also visited with Sister
Emmie Baltzir and arranged for her transportation fare to go for a interview
tomorrow.  It was 9:30 PM before I got home.  I filled out my journal entry. 
Then we played a game of Spider Solitary before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning.  We had two ladies stop us and visited for a few
minutes.  One is there because her husband is doing post graduate work and the
second lives on campus for her husband is the Dean of Administration.  They
have two years until they will retire and then they will build in the vacant
lot across from where we live.  They were both cute in the way they wanted to
visit with us.  It was different to be at home and not really very much to
leave for when Marlyn came this morning.  Later I did go to President
Gasmenia’s to have him sign the checks and then to the bank to cash them.  This
evening we went out to Guimba to attend a dinner for Sister Villanueva’s
birthday.  Mae met with Sister Lus for YW activity night but no young women
came.  For one thing it has rained heavy all day.  President Cabuyaban &amp; I
met in Branch Presidency meeting and I felt that it was very worth while.  The
rains that we are receiving are from a typhoon and it has rained hard all day. 
On the news it showed Manila and they are having a lot of flooding in that
area.  The reports indicate that a 2<sup>nd</sup> typhoon will also follow this
one.  Other than heavy rains, there hasn’t been winds with this one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I have to
make this entry, this morning Mae asked me how to spell TYPHOON and I was able
to.  That doesn’t happen very often, that I spell for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was awaked
between 1 &amp; 1:30 AM with the sound of heavy rains and winds.  We had to
move our bed as the wind was blowing the rain into the window and some coming
through and spraying on us.  Rains have continued through the day.  Mae and I
drove around Munoz to check out the damages and found that they are still minimal. 
We stopped at Tony’s and ate breakfast and enjoyed visiting with Tony.  Leah
came shortly after we got there so we enjoyed visiting with her also.   We took
Tony some more books for him to read and a Book of Mormon in Tagalog for
Allen.  She is the girl that works for them and is their unofficial adopted
daughter.  They have another discussion today, so this evening when we checked
with the Elders they said they are the elect and should be baptized in early
September.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                When we
returned home, I wrote a letter to President Brimhall explaining a problem we
have encountered in the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> branch and asked his advice.  I couldn’t
get onto the enter-net to send it.  I called President Cabuyaban and ask him
how they were.  He said that the winds woke him during the night also.  He said
he got worried so tried to wake Annie but she wouldn’t waken.  He told her that
they should at least have a prayer but she just slept through the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I went out to
Guimba at 1:30 PM and picked up President Cabuyaban.  We started checking on
members and how they were doing.  We soon found that many needing to evacuate
their homes.  We called President Mercado and got permission to open the chapel
for shelter.  We have six or seven families that we were unable to get to and
do not what their situation is.  The river is overflowing it banks and the
water has came up at least 20 feet.  I would guess that 25 to 50 % of Guimba is
in serious flooding.  We opened the chapel to any one that needed shelter but
told them that there could be no smoking or drinking in the building or
grounds.  Some decided to go to the school instead but that is ok.  It was
after 9PM when we finally quite and went home.  President Cabuyaban and I had a
hamburger before leaving for home.  I had to drive slow as many areas of the
highway were under water.  I got home at 9:45 PM and was very tired.  Mae fixed
me some hot milk with toast.  I made my journal entry before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                President
Brimhall called to see how we were doing and to ask about coming out tomorrow
for interviews.  I gave him a report of the Munoz and Guimba area as best as I
could.  He was glad to hear that we had opened the chapel for those that needed
shelter.  I told him that I was concerned about his safety in coming out
tomorrow.  I also reported to him at the progress with Tony &amp; Leah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:40 AM and we waited for President Brimhall’s call.  When he called he said
that he wasn’t coming out as there is water over many of the highways.  I
called the ZL’s and let them know.  We went down to the District Development
but on the way President Cabuyaban texted us and ask if I could bring him some
money and help him.  I texted President Mercado to see if funds were
available.  He said President Dasalla would be over it, so I called President
Dasalla who ask me to get a check from Brother Damacio for P8,000.  I got the
check from Brother Damacio and as we were leaving the church President and
Sister Mercado were walking towards the church house.  I ask him to sign the
check and he told me we needed to take out P10,000 instead.  We went back and
got another check.  I cashed the checks and we took the money to President
Dasalla.  He and Sister Dasalla came to the Guimba chapel with us.  We met to
determine and plan what and how to handle the situation.  President Dasalla
said that we were wrong in letting non-members come into the church and we
needed to get permission from President <br>
Apao before we could use the building.  I went outside and called President
Brimhall about the building and he gave permission and said he would call
President Apao.  There was a lot of talk but I didn’t feel there was enough
positive action.  I finally got them to make a list of food to buy, and then
Sister Browning and I took Sister Cortez and Dasalla, District R. S. President
and counselor, with us and we went to buy the food.  I told President Dasalla
and President Cabuyaban that they need to determine the distribution.  About
that time President Apao came and needed President Dasalla to go with him so he
turned everything over to President Cabuyaban.  We purchased 4 sacks of rice,
noodles, canned sardines and plastic sacks to divide and distribute the food
in.  We took the food to Brother &amp; Sister Villanueva’s where sisters were
waiting to divide the food for distribution.  Mae kind of took charge and
showed them how to organize to speed up the division.  I took Brother Jun
Sextoe with me and we went to the plankie and I bought 400 meters of rope.  My
biggest concern was the seven families that are trapped by the river wit no way
to get food to them.  We went to a family’s home across the river from the
trapped families.  They could shout instructions across the river.  The tatay
then tied the rope around him and swam across the river.  They then stretched
the rope across the river and secured it to trees on both sides.  With it they
could pull themselves back and forth to cross the river.  From there with Jun’s
help we then distributed food to several other families.  It was late when we
finished the last of our deliveries.  Mae and I left for home getting there
about 10 PM.  We very tired and soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
and mainly relaxed today.  This evening we went to Brother and Sister
Pasardan’s and asks if they could help Brother &amp; Sister Dallio with Family
History.  They will get with them tomorrow.  President Gajonera came while we
were there.  He had received a text saying that San Antone was approved to hold
Sacraments meeting only for now under the direction of the Branch Presidency. 
He did not know who sent him the text and was out of load so could not check. 
I texted him some load and we found that is was President Romos.  We talked and
they could get organized by the first Sunday in September.  We then went to the
Dallio’s and informed that Brother Parsardan would meet then at Church
tomorrow.  We came home and worked on catching my journal up as I was too tired
last night to make an entry.  We ate and did some preparation for tomorrow.  It
was 11 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We made it to
Guimba by 7:30 AM and picked up President Cabuyaban on the way.  President
Cabuyaban informed us that all his pepper plants have died due to too much
water.  This is his third crop failure in a row.  In P. E. C. we discussed the
visits that had been made and checked to see if there was anyone still in need
of help.  This was also announced in meetings and none was brought to our
attention.  William told us that that his company just texted him last night to
tell him that they were transferring him.  They didn’t give him a choice but
told him he either did or he would have to look for another job.  That is
really sad news.  When we went to Sacrament meeting we found that none of the
assigned talks were present, so Pres. Cabuyaban asked Mae to take as long as
she wanted as he would have to speak the remainder of the time.  Mae spoke on
reverence, and then after meeting gave out quite bags to families with small
children.  Sister Myra Mata didn’t come today, so Sister Analiza Bacay substituted
on the piano for us, without prior notice.  One thing that was amusing, and you
will only see it in the Philippines, is that I looked at the clock at the back
of the chapel and there just above the clock was a butiqui.  I was frustrated
how the combined Priesthood and Relief Society meeting went.  Finances were a
little frustrating also. Mae also attended the Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch and
talked in Sacrament meeting on reverence and gave out reverence bags there. 
All in all I came home very distressed.  President Brimhall texted us, asking
how we are doing?  I had to answer &amp; tell him that physically we were ok
but are quite heart sick with the trials we see some of these people going
through.  I took the vouchers over to Brother Damacio’s but he won’t be able to
cut a check until tomorrow.  Mae was writing the family letter when I got home
so I laid down and took a nap.  I woke before Mae was finished.  After she sent
it we played one game of Rummy.  Mae won.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning and it seemed good.  We got on instant-messaging with
Jeff, Mike, and Scott this morning.  I went to the bank and met President
Cabuyaban and made the deposit.  I had texted Pres. C. that I wouldn’t be able
to meet him until 11 AM at the bank but at 9:30 AM he texted me and said, “I’m
here.”  I don’t understand the thought process, why did he come early?  I left
and made the deposits and took care of the branch business.  I got home just
before lunch so took a few minute nap before we ate.  Mae was able to get some
e-mails sent.  I called the P. B. O. after lunch and got some records changed. 
We went to San Jose and got our groceries and did some other errorns.  On the
way home we went to Tony’s and ate and visited with Tony and Alyn.  Alyn was
anxious to learn more about earning her Young Women’s Medallion.  Mae enjoyed explaining
it and visiting with her.  The Elders and the AP’s came by while we were
there.  We found out that Elder Michel will be transferred to the Mission Home
as AP.  Elder Welch will be going home.  Elder Welch and Elder Natad came by to
get our monthly reports that go to the mission office.  We enjoyed visiting
with them for a few minutes.  I figured our budget and entered my journal. 
Time goes by so fast and it was after 10 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

walking we cuddled back up in bed.  We had the three Elders here for breakfast
and correlation meeting.  After the Elders left we got things cleaned up.  Mae
was busy with some church work and I took a nap.  I got a CD burned of Crasandra
&amp; Ronald Datar’s wedding and we took it over to Ronald and showed it to
him.  We went to Tony’s and took some more books for him.  He is really excited
about the Gospel and is anxious about being baptized on the 18<sup>th</sup> of
September.  I met president Cabuyaban at 6PM and we went visiting 6 families
tonight.  I still come away from these visits feeling depressed over 1<sup>st</sup>
not understanding the language so I have very little idea about what they are
talking about and 2<sup>nd</sup> I don’t have any idea how to solve the
problems that there is here.  I was beat when I got home after 9 PM but we
stayed up and talked for a while before starting to bed.  While I was gone this
evening, Mae had Crasandra Datar and Ronald’s sister, over to our place and
trained them as Young Women leaders.  She said that went very well.</span></p>
