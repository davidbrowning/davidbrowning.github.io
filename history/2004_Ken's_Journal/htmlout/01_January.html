<p class=MsoBodyText>Just a note:  For over a month I have been having a lot of
pain in my left upper arm.  We are guessing that it is tendonitis and will
eventually clear up.  I am trying to cut down on bread, wondering if that is
adding to some of my pain, as well as to my middle.  I think that most of the
problem is coming from stress.  I guess we will just see what happens.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>                Fire works continued to go off all night. 
The house behind us had a karaoke machine and they sang all night to it and it sounded
like they were sick or dieing.  I think the last one gave up at 3:30 AM, and I
was sure relieved.  We got up at 5:00 a.m. to go walking with the Clarks.  They
always walk every morning also.  We came home and fixed French toast with
yogurt and fruit.  It was very good.  They left to go home at 7:00 a.m. and we
left shortly after to go to the Guimba Hospital to finish the service project. 
We saw the Elders on the way.  We saw Rose and she showed us where the beds
were.  We washed, sanded, and painted beds, bed stands, IV poles, chairs,
benches, etc.  It was good working with the Elders.  We came home and showered,
ate lunch and took a nap.  We did up the dishes from last night and this
morning and there was a lot.  Scott and Mishelle sent us a Christmas gift of a
DVD, “Christmas Mission and Only Once”.  We watched them this evening and
really enjoyed them.  We got a letter from Leah Jones and $10 inside it.  We
also got a nice letter from Van &amp; Allison Bushnell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 5
AM but let Mae sleep until 5:30 AM.  Mae made some brownies to take to the
Elders.  We went out to Paniqui for District meeting.  President Brimhall also
came and talked to the Elders about the very sad experience he had to hold a
disciplinary court and send one Elder home. He asked the Elders to be sure they
stayed with their companions at all times and if there was any flirting going
on to stop it right there and let Him know.  We enjoyed being with the Elders
as always.  This afternoon Mae entered the Paniqui Branch Organization reports
on the computer.  I worked on editing pictures from the Health Fair.  That has
been a big job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went for our walk at the collage.  We left for Paniqui about 7:30 AM as we have
an appointment to give a “Branch Presidency training” for the 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch.  I was sure it was going to go well, for we seem to have several
obstacles this morning.  It seems that Satan sure tries to discourage us just
before we do some of this training.  We got a text from President Mercado
asking if I could attend a District Presidency meeting at 10 AM today.  We were
already half way to Paniqui when the text came through.  The training went well
and Mae was able to train the Relief Society President while I trained the
Branch Presidency.  It went very well.  Elder Elision invited us to eat dinner
with them.  It was very good.  We drove over to Romos to find where the church
is located.  We came on to Munoz and stopped to make some copies before going
home.  We got an e-mail from Shellie saying that she would like to come with
Sandi.  We are excited for that.  Mike sent us four pictured of the snow at
Idaho.  That was neat to get those.  Sister Caroline Rubio came over to visit
with Mae for a while.  I worked on the computer, and then Elder Weber and Elder
Clam came by to give us some reports.  It was after 10 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We attended
the meetings at Romas Branch.  They only have a meeting house, but they were
preparing it for meetings when we got there.  Priesthood and Relief Society
were late starting.  Late starting seems to be quite standard in the
Philippines.  The Elders Quorum President wasn’t in attendance, and they didn’t
seem to have an Aaronic Priesthood program going.  The Branch President wasn’t
sure what they were to have for a lesson, so he gave the first lesson in the
new manual.  He ask me what should be the lesson and I told them that I didn’t
have a study curriculum, but thought with it being the First Sunday, that the
lesson should be chosen by he and the Elders Quorum President.  He gave the 1<sup>st</sup>
lesson and being that I didn’t have a manual in English and it was all in
Tagalog, I didn’t have any idea what was given, except for a couple of
scriptures.  Sunday School was about the same situation, except I was concerned
as to where Mae was.  She went to Primary and gave the lesson there, as the
Primary President didn’t feel she could teach.  There was no Sunday School
President and no teacher, so the Branch President asked Elder Jones to give a
lesson.  With out advance notice and the manual being in Tagalog, he had a
struggle.  The Sacrament meeting started with a Brother giving the opening
prayer that was very emotional.  I wasn’t sure what was happening and asked
Elder Jones what was happening.  He also wasn’t sure but told me that the
wording was ok, just very emotional.  All but one testimony was given in
Tagalog, so I didn’t understand very much.  I left there concerned, upset and
discouraged.  We came home and worked the rest of the day on Branch
organizational reports.  We had 6 Guimba District reports to make corrections
to, 5 Paniqui District reports to correct and 5 Paniqui District reports to
enter totally.  I then had to build the linking reports for the Paniqui
District Branch Survey reports.  We worked until late and quite for the night. 
We lacked some information from the Anao Branch, so had to call Elder Ellison
so he could get the info for me and text it to me tomorrow.  I called President
Clark and visited with him about it and he felt it would be ok if I got the
reports to him tomorrow.  I told him what had happened today in meetings and
told him that I felt that I was so weak in the language that they should send
me home.  He said that I was probably right in thinking that I was weak, but
that I was the best they had so I needed to stay.  I guess we will just keep
trying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking at CLSU, then came home and showered and got ready for the day.  I
dressed in my levis and casual shirt, as I wanted to get the Christmas lights
taken down.  We talked 1 ½ hours to our children on the instant messaging
today.  I spent the rest of this afternoon working on the reports, but finally
got the sent by e-mail to the mission office.  Brother Silvia came over about 5
PM to visit.  They are moving to Brother and Sister Monta’s old home.  Brother
and Sister Monta moved into the new home built just in back of their old house,
so are letting the Silvia’s move into the old home for a couple of years, until
they remove it.  That will help the Silvia’s out a lot and give them a much
nicer home.  I had Roger talk to Elder Hyer and line up a visit with he and
Brother Trabalno and Elder Hyer on Friday, to talk over some business plans. 
We had Roger eat some dinner with us.  We also gave him another P500 advance on
some computer work.  He will install a program update that would have cost me
more than that.  After he left, Mae got on the computer and wrote and sent some
e-mails to our family.  I did go outside and take down the Christmas
decorations, and then laid down to wait for Mae to finish and I fell asleep. 
When she came to bed at 10 PM it woke me.  I hadn’t said prayers, so got up for
that.  I made my journal entries for yesterday and today before going back to
bed.  I wasn’t very sleepy so also played two games of Solitary, and won both
of them.  As Jeff would say, “Life is good.”  Good night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning, but on the way I said things in a wrong was and upset
Mae.  That made walking a little on the quiet side.  We had the 4 Elders over
for breakfast this morning, then showed them some of the pictures of the snow
in Utah &amp; Idaho and then some of the pictures from the Health Fair.  We
also talked about some of the Branch’s that need training.  After they left,
Mae and I went to San Jose to take care of several errorns.  We ate at
Jollibees while we were there.  President Brimhall called this afternoon and
wanted me to e-mail a copy of the proposal for training Balar, to him.  He also
wanted some pictures of our home to send to a couple in the States, to
encourage them to come on a mission.  This evening I colored Mae’s hair and she
cut my hair.  Mae then got on the computer to get some papers ready for
tomorrow.  I prepared something to eat this evening. We worked on the computer
until 10:30 PM before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4 AM and left shortly after 5 AM.  We stopped in Paniqui to give the ZL’s the
Branch Organizational print outs.  We stopped at the Shell gas station in
Tarlac, and bought me some peanuts and got gas.  We had to stop at a bane and
draw some money out as we had forgotten to put some money in my wallet before
we left this morning.  At 7 AM we met the Maharry’s and the Hyer’s at McDonalds
where we ate breakfast and visited.  Mae and I stopped at the Bank on
Clarkfield and transferred $200 from our Utah Bank to our Philippines bank
account so we would have money when Sandi &amp; Shellie comes.  We then went to
Rock Bottom and purchased some supplies we needed.  From there we stopped at
the wood carver to see if he had our Caribous we had ordered, but they don’t
have them yet.  We went to Pure Gold to get an ice cooler, but they don’t have
any now.  We got back to the mission office in time for our 11:30 AM meeting
with President and Sister Brimhall.  President and Sister Clark and Elder and
Sister Maharry were also there.  We discussed our assignment as Couple
Missionaries and doing Branch Leadership Training.  President Brimhall assigned
us to type a draft of a letter to go out to the District Presidents, as to what
we will be doing.  After the meeting we all went out to a Mexican Restraint for
lunch.  We went back to the office and down loaded some files that President
Brimhall wants.  It was almost 6 PM before we left for home.  We stopped at a
mall in Tarlac to see if we could find an ice cooler, but didn’t have any
success.  It was 9 PM when we got home, very tired.  I tried to write in my journal,
but kept falling asleep, so gave up for tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning.  After breakfast we were on the computer all day getting e-mail
letters written and sent to Family, Friends and to President Brimhall.  We also
worked all evening on the letter for the District Presidents that President
Brimhall asked us to draft.  Mae did go out and remove the old seat covers from
the car seats.  She got permission from President Clark yesterday to remove
them.  We were late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
to long to have time to go walking as we needed to pickup the four Elders in
Munoz and be in Guimba before 8:30 AM for District Development Training with
the Elders. We had quite a few letters in the mail when we got to District
meeting.  Mike sent us a CD that he made with David, Tyler, Emily, Shauna,
Mike, David playing the piano, Taylor playing the violin, Becky and Mattie.  We
love it!  After that meeting we came home and got some dinner.  Elder and
Sister Hyer came for dinner, Marlyn had prepared extra, so it was enjoyable. 
Elder Hyer and I met with Roger Silvia and Brother Trabalno that Elder Hyer
might help them see things that they need to consider as they try to start a
joint business.  That took about 3 hours.  The Hyer’s left for home shortly
after that.  We spent the rest of the evening on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We again
slept in to late to have time to go walking.  Brother Marlin Dator came over to
wash our car.  After he finished we spent a little time showing him how to
organize Home Teaching.  That training went very well and I think really helped
Marlin.  I had a bad headache so Mae used the vibrator on my back and gave me
some aspirins.  I took a nap.  I took the time to send a Draft of a letter to
President Clark.  We then had to hurry to get to Paniqui to attend a District
Leadership monthly training meeting.  It was very well done.  President Nadado
asked if I would train the Elders Quorum Presidents when they separated for
department training.  Mae was asked to help with Relief Society training.  We
got home about 6 PM and started preparing for tomorrow.  We think we are ready
and it is 10:30 PM so we are going to bed.  Good Night!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had to get
up and be off for Paniqui by 7:15 AM.  We attended the Paniqui 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch and was very impressed with the Spirit and reverence if their Sacrament
meeting.  I attended the youth Sunday school class and really enjoyed it.  The
1<sup>st</sup> Counselor in the Branch Presidency gave the lesson.  For
Priesthood I attended the Teachers Quorum and was again impressed with the
youth.  However the 2<sup>nd</sup> Counselor again gave the lesson.  I told him
that the only trouble was that he was doing to much.  This is a common thing
here in the Philippines.  The ZL’s invited us to have dinner with them.  It was
very good and we enjoy being with the Elders.  We traveled to Gapan where we
meet Elder Ragasa, who took us to the Chapel and we gave a Home Teaching and
Visiting Teaching presentation.  It went well and we really enjoyed it.  It was
9:30 PM when we got home and I went to bed beet.  Mae stayed up and wrote to
our children.</span></p>

6:15 AM and woke Mae about 6:30 AM.  We went walking at the collage, even
though we were late getting there.  ‘While we were walking we saw President
Gasmenia.  He was there taking his daughter to nursery day care.  He told us
that they missed us at the Munoz meetings.  He said it in a very cute way that
I wanted to remember to put in my journal, but I forgot.  When we got home we
showered and ate breakfast.  We got on the instant messaging with Scott and
Jeff.  None of the rest came in this morning.  We got some e-mails sent before
lunch.   After lunch Mae wrote more to our family, while I took a nap.  We sent
that off, and then Mae took a nap while I went down town to pay our power
bill.  They couldn’t take it because the book was out.  I went to the service
station to get the car serviced but they didn’t have anyone there that could do
it.  When I came back home the delivery man for the phone co. was there
bringing our bill to us.  I made some calls to get our hotel reservations
reserved for us to use for when Sandi and Shellie comes.  Mae went with me to
San Jose where we got the car serviced.  We stopped at a hamburger stand and
got us some hamburgers for our dinner.  We then took the left over three
gallons of paint back and got the refund from it.  We did our grocery shopping
done while there.  Roger Silvia came over and upgraded our Anti-virus program
for us.  We enjoyed relaxing and being together this evening.</span></p>

Guimba and work with the Elders on the Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch’s
membership records.  We matched the corrected I. O. S. records with the
Membership records and prepared them to be sent to the P. B. O. for
corrections.  We worked until 2 or 2:30 PM before finishing.  It was after 3 PM
when I got home.  Mae worked on the computer most of the day.  After getting
some lunch, I took a 45 minute nap.  We worked on schedules and Leadership
Training.  We seem to keep busy.  I set up a special print program for Mae.  It
was 11 PM before I finished and entered my journal.</span></p>

early this morning trying to get things done before leaving for Tarlac to
attend a special Employment Training.  We went into Munoz and paid the phone
bill and the power bill.  On the way back we left some papers at the Gem Book
Store to have them copied.  We picked up the Zone Leaders, Elder Clam and Elder
Weber, also the Zone Leaders from San Jose, at 10 AM.  That really made a car
full.  We had Elder Clam set on the consol.  Before, Mae has tried to set
there, but it is too hard on her back.  We stopped at the bank and made an
withdraw of P5, 000 and then went to the Saver’s Mart, where we purchased an
ice chess.  We met the Maharry’s at McDonald’s for lunch.  As we left
McDonald’s to go to the Stake House, we left our back bag.  We didn’t realize
that we had done this until we got to the Stake House.  Mae and I went back to
McDonald’s and it was still where we had left it.  We felt very blessed for
that.  The training was given to us by Elder and Sister Hyer, and Brother
Benson.  This is a pilot program, given to the couple missionaries, and the
Zone Leaders.  Elder Mains, President and Sister Brimhall, Brother Jo Joe, and
Brother Romos and the Assistants to the President were also in attendance.  The
purpose for this training is to see if this is a program that should be taught
to all missionaries, at church youth groups and possibly even taken to other
youth group at high schools and collages.  We were in class until 9 or 9:30 PM,
and then we had to take the Elders to San Ignosha, where they slept.  Mae and I
stayed with the Hyer’s this evening.</span></p>

get things ready for today’s seminar.  We brought Sister Hyer in with us.  The
seminar only lasted until noon as President Mains had to leave before noon and
Elder and Sister Hyer had to leave about noon.  We went over to McDonald’s and
had lunch.  We stopped at a factory warehouse and bought some dark material
that we can use when we get to Baler, to cover the windows with, so it will be
dark enough to use a projector.  We didn’t get home until 3 or 3:30 PM, but was
very tired.  After eating we took a nap.  We did go over to the Book store and
get some copies and leave other papers to copy.  We also went to San Jose and
buy a baby gift for President and Sister Cabuyaban and their new baby boy.  We
worked on our presentation for tomorrow.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

President Nadado before leaving.  We added a couple of training dates to our
calendar.  We stopped at President Sunny Cabuyaban and Sister Annie Cabuyaban
to give them a gift for their baby.  It was nice to visit with them.  It was
again after 3 PM before we got home.  We ate dinner, took a nap, and then I
went to the Book Store to get our copies, while Mae cleaned up the dishes.  We

didn’t show up until 10 AM.  That really rushed us to get through by 11:30, but
Mae didn’t get through until 11:50.  We had to stop at the Total station for
gas before going to the Tarlac Stake Center.  We were late for the World Wide Satellite
Broadcast of Leadership Training.  We really enjoyed the training.  The main
ones that were there were from the Paniqui District.  After the meeting we went
to McDonald’s and got some dinner.  We went back the Moncada 2<sup>nd</sup>

Priesthood, Mae trained the Sisters in Relief Society.  On the way home the
alarm on our palm pilot went off, reminding us that we were to stop at Roger
Silvia’s for Karen’s 4<sup>th</sup> Birthday.  It was good that we did as they
were expecting us and would have been hurt if we had not attended.  They had
prepared dinner for us, and so we ate it, hoping it will be ok.  We were sure
tired when we got home at 8:30 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We attended
the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch this morning.  It really was nice to only have
a short distance to drive and it only took a few minutes to get to meetings. 
It also was nice to be back to a home Branch and renew friendships.  Many said
that they had missed us, and it was good to know we were missed.  We stayed for
Branch Council and after saw many from the 1<sup>st</sup> Branch and that was
good.  We tried to get some work accomplished this afternoon, but time went
fast and before long it was time for Elder Clam and Webber to come.  We also
invited Sister Carolyn Rubio for dinner so Mae could train her on her new
calling as District Y.W. President.  Elder Clam and Weber and I talked about a
training evening on Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching.  I took the Elders to
their home after we finished and then we took Sister Rubio home.</span></p>

where we left our car and rode with them.  We drove up to Lingayen where we
went to the beach for a few minutes.  We saw some of the historical sights
explaining some of the history of World War II and also how we came to the
Philippines in 1889.  President Clark explained so of that history to me this
evening.  From Lngayen we had planned to go to Dagupan, but we stopped at a
McDonald’s for lunch in Binmaley and spent some time in the mall, so did not
have time to tour further.  We came back to the Maharry’s and then home,
getting here at 6:30 PM very tired.  We composed a letter to President Maynes
concerning the Career Workshop last week.  I then filled in my journal before
going to bed.</span></p>

that Marlin Dater was coming over to wash the car.  He didn’t come.  David
called and we talked to him for almost an hour.  We worked all day on trying to
get prepared for the training at Baler.  We felt a lot of tension and concern
as to what we are preparing.  I drove down to Roger Silvia’s to inform him of
some job opportunities, which Sister Hyer called us about.  He was not home but
Heidi gave him the message when he got home.  He called and I had him come over
and we printed his Resume for him and helped him call Elder Hyer and the P. B.
O. for information.  We hope it helps him.  I took some papers over to the book
store to get copies made.  We worked on the computer until 11:30 P.M.</span></p>

major changes.  Yesterday we were confused as to how we should change it, but
today we seemed to be ok, just busy getting it put together.  We got some
copies made and went to San Jose for a few items.  Elder and Sister Maharry
came at 4:30 PM.  We visited and got things arranged to leave in the morning. 
I did some more work on the presentations after we ate dinner.  We played Rummy

Balar by way of San Jose, through Rezal and over the mountains.  We got to
Balar by noon.  We ate lunch in one of their kuby hut (gazebo).  We could only
get a one room with 5 bunk beds in it, for tonight.  We met with several of the
branch leaders and gave them some training.  The Elders wanted us to go visit
with them this evening, but when we went to get something to eat, it took to
long for the restaurant to prepare our order.  We played a game of rummy before

some thoughts.  Mae came outside about 3:30AM to see where I was.  The
Maharry’s also were up.  They thought it must be late when they heard me close
the door.  We all went back to sleep for a while.  We took a short walk along
the beach.  We ate breakfast, and then the Elders came by to give us a map to
go to Maria.  They told us to find a Baptist Minister by the name of Barry
Philipps.  We had to ask three people before we found him.  The last ones that
we talked to was three youth.  When they had trouble getting us to understand,
one of them ran and got is bike and had us follow him.  He took us right to his
home.  Mr. Philipps and his wife Lilia were very gracious host and showed us
around they have 1 &amp; ½ hectors on which they live with their two sons.  He
is a self appointed Minister.  They have developed a way to use all the coconut
plant to make paper, and then paper products. It was very interesting to see
what they are doing and listen to their story.  He also took us over to see the
Baleite tree, which is a very interesting tree and the largest in Asia.  We
enjoyed our visit with them, but had to get back in order to give leadership
training this evening.  We ate diner at the restraint that is adjacent to our
motel.  We were able to get new rooms today and that made it a lot nicer.  We
got to bed about 10:30 PM this evening.  We were very tired.</span></p>

early so we could shower, pack, eat and check out and still get to the church
by 8AM.  As we drove to the meeting house, the main road was blocked of because
a funeral home opens their doors and extends their benches into the street,
totally taking up the roadway, as part of the chapel.  We commented that “Only
In The Philippines.”  At the meeting house, Elder Maharry taught the Sunday
School President and I worked with the Elders quorum President.  At 10 AM we
invited all the branch adults for some training.  We had many of the leaders
come.  I think the training went quite well.  We changed our presentation on
the V. T. &amp; H. T.  taking out a lot of the mechanics of the program and
added 32 multiple choice questions to get the people to think.   We just hope
that we have done some good.  We left for home at 1:15, having stopped for gas
and some bakery items.  We had to get the air in the tires checked and add to
two tires.  We came home through Bangabon, Rizal, and then San Jose.  We
stopped at Jollibees for something to eat before coming home.  We got there at
5:15 PM, so made good time that way.  Our car was sure dirty, so after getting
things transferred to the Maharry’s car and they left, I washed our car.  Time
went fast and it was soon time for bed.  We received a cute letter from
Shellie.</span></p>

busy day.  We went to Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch Sacrament, then to Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch.  We only attended part of Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Priesthood and Relief
Society, then took pictures of the Branch Presidency.  We next stopped at
Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch to take pictures of the Branch Presidency.  We got
to Carino Branch at 1 PM so set and relaxed for a few minutes.  Shortly after
we got there President and Sister Clark came.  The had been to another Branch
and thought they would find out where the Carino Branch meeting house was as
they will start coming there next week.  We enjoyed visiting with them for a
few minutes before they left.  I met with the Branch President and the Elders
Quorum President for over two hours talking about their leadership needs.  It
was very good as they had a lot of questions that they wanted answers to.  I
certainly had empathy for them in their struggling situation.  Mae taught the
R. S. and Primary.  We didn’t get home until late and then found something for
dinner.  Mae called Sister Clark.  I tried to type my journal but became to
tired.  I laid on Mae’s lap while she was talking to Sister Clark on the
phone.  I fell asleep but woke up with both my arms asleep, making it
impossible to get up.  Mae had got off the phone and had just let me sleep.  I
had to have her come and help me up.  I really felt depressed when I went to
bed.  Mae stayed up and wrote a letter to our family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae wasn’t
feeling well so we slept in.  I was still eating breakfast when Marlin Dator
came.  We went to find a mechanic to see what is wrong with our car.  The
mechanic said he would just check it out but he pulled the front right wheel
completely off.  In doing so they broke the brake race from the wheel housing. 
He then didn’t have the bearing that he needed so Brother Umipig happened to
come at that time, so he took Marlin and I to San Jose to get a bearing.  We
couldn’t find one in San Jose, so Brother Umipig took us to Cabanatuan.  I
asked if we shouldn’t call and check in Tarlac for the parts, but Brother
Umipig felt that he could find it in Cabanatuan, plus he had lived there for 30
years and know the area.  It was also closer.  We went to every parts house in
town but couldn’t find the bearing we needed.  I called Mae and had her call
information and get the number for the Honda dealer in Tarlac.  They have the
part, so we went back to Munoz and had the mechanic put the car back together. 
They had re-welded the brake drum while we were gone.  After putting it back
together, they still charged me P400 for the work.  I came home feeling that I
had wasted P1,000 and a day’s time.  Mae isn’t feeling very well this evening. 
I was discouraged over the car, the money and the time.  We had diner, and then
Mae went to bed.  I entered my journal and also went to bed.</span></p>

get it fixed.  The Honda dealer checked it out and they need to order more
parts.  Some was due to the mechanic yesterday breaking them as he was
disassembling the wheel assembly.  I had to go to the bank in Tarlac to get
some money out of my account.  The ATM was down so that took me a while to get
that done.  I drove the car back as it will take a week for the parts to come
in.  I took a nap, then Mae went with me and we went shopping for a few
groceries in San Jose.  After dinner this evening I worked on the budget, which
doesn’t look very good.  We have several items that we are getting reimbursed
for, so that will help.  It was after 10 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

of the day on presentations.  I did help Marlin take the drapes down and rehung
them after she washed them.  This afternoon Mae went through some Relief
Society training for the new Relief Society Presidency and Visiting Teacher
Coordinator for Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  While she was doing that training
I went to San Jose to get some money out of the Bank.  It was closed and the
ATM machine wasn’t working so that was a waist of time.  As soon as Mae
finished we went to Guimba where we gave the Branch Training to President
Cabuyaban, a counselor, and a clerk.  Both trainings went well.  We got home at
9 PM, and had some soup to eat, and then Mae gave me a hair cut.</span></p>

didn’t start until 9:30 AM.  It was a very enjoyable conference as always.  We
love President and Sister Brimhall.  They praised us, as to the training we and
the Maharry’s gave at Baler.  They said they could sure see a difference in the
meetings last Sunday.  If someone can see a difference, that is thanks enough. 
We just hope that we can make a difference.  After getting home from zone
conference, we went over to Dator’s and took some Relief Society handouts to
Sister Dator.  We came back home and took a nap for about an hour.  It is not
to often that Mae can sleep that long for a nap, but I had to wake her this
time.  We got a e-mail from President Mercado that I replied to about the
monthly report.  Elder Webber and Elder Clam stopped over to discuss the H. T.
/ V. T. Fireside for Saturday.  They left shortly after 9 PM.  We called Mike
and are having him check to see if it is still possible to get the power point
projector in time for Sandi to bring it with her.  If so we asked him to try to
get it for us.  It was good to visit with him for a few minutes.  Brother
Silvia has text us a couple of times today hinting that he needs money.  We
text back and told him that we just couldn’t if for no other reason as it
against mission rules.  We just wish we know just how to help these people.  It
is already 10:30 PM and there is so much we need to get done.  I guess we just
do what we can, good night.</span></p>
