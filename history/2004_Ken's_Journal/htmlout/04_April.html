<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up at
6 AM so I let Mae sleep in a while.  I read a couple of articles in the
Ensign.  Mae is still covered with red spots.  She called the Health Sisters
and they recommended that she get some Hydrocortisone cream and put it on a
couple of times a day.  I worked on the presentation for Saturday.  Elder and
Sister Hyer came over about 10:30 AM.  We visited and I was able to show them
some things about their camera, but not much as I couldn’t get the driver to
load.  Mae cooked a chicken casserole for dinner.  It was nice visiting with
them.  We are planning on going to Baguio next Tuesday and Wednesday.  We think
that the Clark’s and Maharry’s are going also.  I took a nap this afternoon. 
We worked on the computer on various projects until almost 11 PM.  I did go to
town and get the medication for Mae and take some items to have copied.  I sure
love Mae even though she gets after me for my attitude sometimes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
so had to hurry to get to District Development meeting.  Mae still had time to
bake a cake for the Elders.  We enjoyed the meeting.  We stopped on the way
home and visited with President Cabuyaban and looked at his farm.  It is
looking pretty good and hopefully within 8 to 10 days he will have the first
product ready to go to market.  Marlyn had dinner ready for us when we got
home.  We took a short nap and then went to pay the phone bill and to San Jose
and mailed the birthday cards and bought some groceries.  We went out to eat at
Jollibees.  After talking to Elder and Sister Hyer yesterday and hearing how
one couple had served a mission in Nigeria and so wasn’t surprised at things
here, we now think, it could be worse, we could be in Nigeria.  We picked up
some copies we had printed at the Book Store.  We are receiving a lot of
forwarded messages concerning the gay movement and same sex marriages in the U.
S.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early, but spent time getting ready for the presentation this afternoon.  We
went out to Guimba and met Brother &amp; Sister Baliola and their daughter Noemi
at  Doctor A. Lumiqued’s clinic.  He prescribed some medication for her.  We
paid the bills as Brother and Sister Baliola can’t.  While Mae was with the Dr.,
she asked him about the red spots on her back.  He definitely feels it was a
dust mite or something like that, and prescribed a stronger medication than
what she was using.  We came home and ate lunch, took a short nap, and went
back to Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch to give a presentation on Home Teaching
and Visiting Teaching.  We were there by 130 PM, but no one else came until
after 2 PM.  We waited until almost 3:30 PM with only a few that came.  We
finally went ahead and gave the presentation.  I hope it did some good.  I felt
quite discouraged over the way it went.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up very early as Mae couldn’t go to sleep last night, so she stayed up and wrote
the family letter.  I slept in the chair most of the night because of stomach
problems and then I woke early and couldn’t go back to sleep because of trying
to think of how we can help these branches.  I wasn’t in a very good mood when
we went to church.  After Sacrament meeting, I attended the youth Sunday School
class.  Mae attended the Primary, which went quite well.  I visited with
President Gasmena covering several items.  Mae stayed after meetings and
trained the Primary Presidency.  We had dinner and relaxed this afternoon and
evening.  It rained for a while about 4 PM for a while.  We set out on the
porch and enjoyed it.  I popped some corn and we played some games for a
while.  I borrowed the telephone from the ZL’s apartment so we could have two
phones when our children call us tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM so we could be ready when the family calls.  They called at 6:10 AM and
because of daylight saving time, in Utah, it was 4:10 PM Sunday Afternoon for
them.  All of our family was at Mike &amp; Beck’s and had watched General
Conference together.  We visited for almost 1 ½ hours with them.  It was sure
good to hear their voices and they sounded just like they could drive over to
see us.  Time seemed to fly today.   Mae did some training of the District
Young Woman’s Presidency.  I took the car over and got it washed.  Mae got
things packed for tomorrow.  I wrote a e-mail to Scott and Mishelle about the
house, in answer to a e-mail from them.  Mae is having a lot of back pain this
evening.  The spots on her back are starting to clear up, but we are not sure
if we have enough medication.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and went to Tarlac.  We stopped at McDonalds and got us some breakfast
before going on to the Hyer’s.  It was interesting because when we got to the
corner where we turn up to their place, the Maharry’s and the Clark’s were also
there.  We all got there at the same time.  Elder Maharry drove his car with
the Clark’s riding with them, Elder Hyer drove with Sister Browning and I
riding with them.  We left the other two cars at the Hyer’s.  Traffic was
heavy, but we made it to Baguio about noon.  We found the El Cielito Hotel and
checked in, and then went to the mall.  We ate at Kenny Roger’s which took us a
long time to get our food, but it was pretty good when we got it.  We then
spent a little time walking around the mall.  From there we went to Eba’s
Silver shop and to the shops around the area.  Elder Hyer kept looking for Mario’s
Restraint but couldn’t find it.  We asked several people but they just point
some direction and tell you that way, even if they don’t have a clue where you
want to go.  We did have one man tell us he didn’t know, but that doesn’t
happen very often.  We stopped at one place where there was a group of old
people in native costume, waiting for tourists to take pictures of them.  After
we took pictures, they wanted money, but when we only offered then a few pesos,
they wanted at least P200.  When we wouldn’t pay that much, they got very
demanding.  We walked away and they followed.  When we got to the car we
thought they had stopped, but after Mae got in the car, I turned and some of
them started running towards me.  I<i> </i>had to almost shove<i> </i>Mae over
so I could get in before they got to us.  We drove around the area several
times more looking for Mario’s, before we had someone tell us we were one block
down.  We went there and ate dinner.  It was very good and it was a lot of fun
being together as couple missionaries.  We were tired when we got to our hotel
so each when to our own rooms.  Mae and I watched the last half of “Shoot out
at the Ok Corral” on TV before going to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We met the
others at 7:30 AM in the lobby, and then went to Camp John Hay’s and ate buffet
breakfast.  We met two other couple missionaries from the Ilongapo mission.  It
was a enjoyable morning visiting and eating.  Just as we set down to eat,
Sister Maharry’s son called to let us know the Sister Marjorie Fay Hinckley had
just passed away a hour before.  We had heard that she wasn’t at General
Conference because of illness but were saddened to hear of her passing.   The
other missionaries were there for a two day break also.  After breakfast we
walked around the hotel grounds for a while and just enjoyed ourselves.  The
hotel had decorated the grounds for Easter.  It was really very well done.  They
even had a pen with baby chickens and baby rabbits in it.  We then rented a van
and driver who drove us around town and took us to the shops we wanted to go. 
We had a very enjoyable day, but spent quite a lot of money.   We thought we
would head for home by 2 PM but we were later getting away, and then we stopped
at the mission home and visited for a while there.  We also stopped at some
vegetable stands and bought strawberries, lettuce, a cucumber, potatoes and
some green mangos.  It was after 7 PM when we got to the Hyer’s.  They invited
us to stay, and I almost did, but then decided to drive home.  We had a lot to
unpack and bring in.  Boy, we really realize the difference in the temperature
between here and Baguio.  It was really pleasant up there and almost cold at
night.  I set down to the computer to enter my journal, but kept falling
asleep.  I went to bed shortly after 9 PM, but Mae stayed up until 11 PM trying
to figure out where we spent all the money.  She also got some text messaging
from President Cabuyaban.</span></p>

until 6:30 AM.  We didn’t do much today but worked on the computer.  Mae wrote
some on the family letter.  We figured the budget as to what we had spent on
our trip.  Mae took pictures of the items we have purchased to take home as
gifts and put them away.  She also worked on primary preparations.  I spent
over 3 hours, trying to get some pictures reproduced, for Mae.  We went over to
the Book Store to get some copies made but everyone is closed for Holy Week.  I
had to print them on our computer.  I had a training this afternoon, but they
called and rescheduled it for tomorrow afternoon.  I got Brother and Sister
Tabbilos’s B. R. filled written for them.  This morning I fixed French toast
with fresh strawberries, mangoes and yogurt.   For dinner we had toast with
fresh tomatoes and lettuce.  It was good to have some of these fresh items.  We
were late getting to bed, but really didn’t feel we had done very much today,
the time just flew by.</span></p>

District Development Meeting with the Paniqui Elders.  We really enjoy these
Elders and will certainly miss Elder Elison when he goes home in two weeks.  He
is really a special young man.  Mae made a cake to the Elders this morning for
a treat.  We stopped on the way home and visited with President Cabuyaban and
to see his farm.  The rain really hurt his crop in that it was to much water,
and it has really started the weeds to grow.  I really hope this project works
out.  He asked if I could go with him to administer to his counselor, who has
been sick for the last couple of days.  We went with him.  It was 1:30 PM when
we got home.  Marlyn had dinner ready for us.  Brother Mercado and Brother
Sylvia came over for me to train Brother Mercado on the Branch Organization
reports.  I also trained him on some of his responsibilities as District
Executive Secretary.  Mae and I then took a short nap.  President and Sister
Mercado came over to sell me a vitamin and mineral product.  We enjoyed
visiting with them and invited them to stay and have tomato and toast
sandwiches with us for dinner.  I typed on the family letter while Mae worked
on primary projects.  We were late getting to bed.</span></p>

up early as we didn’t get t bed until late.  We went to Guimba and saw the Dr.
about Mae’s back and Noemi’s medication.  Mae’s back is doing much better but
he feels that we should continue with the one cream for a little longer.  We
got enough medication for Noemi to last for two weeks.  We then went to Moncada
and took those medications to her.  Her mother was in tears as she was about
out of what she had and didn’t know how they could get more.  We have made
arrangements with the Doctor to provide what medications they need and we will
pay for it.  We came back to Guimba and ate lunch at Cindy’s.  We then went to
the chapel where Mae visited with the District Relief Society, while I taught a
presentation to the Branch Presidents on “Interviews”.  It went well and I had
a lot of participation from the Branch Presidents and the District Presidency. 
Just before I finished my transformer and surge protector burned up.  We came
home and got something for dinner, and then I worked on the computer the rest
of the evening.  We have had a lot of black ants in our bedroom this evening. 
I have used spray and a fly swat to kill them.</span></p>

meetings at Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  Mae felt quite successful with the
Primary.  I went into the adult s. s. class and enjoyed it.   I was going to
attend the Aaronic Priesthood quorums but Brother Mico asked if he could visit
with me.  We visited for the full priesthood meeting.  Mae and I drove to
Angeles and checked into the “Oasis Motel”.  It was quite nice.  We then went
to the mission home where President and Sister Brimhall invited the couple
missionaries, the A. P. and the office Elders to a nice Easter dinner.  After
dinner we watched a video of the Trial and Crucifixion of the Savior.  It was
very moving but very enjoyable.  The evening was very enjoyable as we spent
time with such wonderful people.  I didn’t sleep very well tonight.</span></p>

Clark Field and met Elder and Sister Clark at the parade grounds where we all
walked together.  Elder Hyer came over later but didn’t walk with us because of
his health.  We came back to the motel where we cleaned up and then went to
breakfast in the dinning room.  The food was very good and we enjoyed visiting
together.  Mae and I checked out, went to the bank to cash a check, went to the
mission home and met with Elder Shaw who helped us figure the set on our
computer so we can show DVD’s on our projector.  We went to the wood carving
shop off Clark, then went to Dr. Rosales and got our teeth cleaned.  We then
stopped at DHL Quilting and looked at quilts.  We bought a couple of baby
quilts for Jessica and David’s new to be baby boy.  We stopped at the Duty Free
store and got some Brownie and cake mixes before going home.  The traffic was
bad and it took us a long time to get home.  It was after 9:30 PM before we got
home.  We were very tired and son went to bed.</span></p>

Guimba where we met Elder Ligaliga and Elder Folker and went out to Talugtug, a
small town about 18 km North of Guimba.  There, Sister Remy Leftakis, a former
resident from there, but now lives in Chicago, and is here on vacation.  She
has several investigators that want to hear the missionary lessons and several
that she is trying to get reactivated.  We had an enjoyable time with her and
the Elders.  It was almost 3 PM before we got home.  We lay down and took a
nap, then ate some dinner.  We went over to San Jose to do some errorns, one of
which was to take some mail over to the Elders there.  We got to their home and
realized that we had left the mail home.  We came home and got it, and then
took it back to them.  We left some tapes to have copied.  We also went grocery
shopping.</span></p>

Women program that she wants saved.  After lunch I balanced our statement and
figured the budget.  We went to San Jose and got the copies of the primary
tapes.  We also got some primary games laminated so they will last a while.  We
spend a lot of time on the computer, but sometimes it seem that we get little done. 
I visited with the Elders in Guimba concerning Branch 1 and 2, trying to figure
out what we can do to help them.  President Brimhall had interviews with the
Elders today, and he did not express his opinion about teaching out in
Talugtug, but he would like more information about it.  I also have been trying
to figure out what can be done to help Branch 1.</span></p>

went walking this morning.  While walking we saw Sister Nieto, her daughter
Wendy and her son Warren playing badminton.  We visited with them for a few
minutes before continuing our walk.  As we were about back to the gate, we
started to pas a older lady and Mae said good morning to her.  She started
talking to Mae and I was afraid that she had a friend for life.  She continued
with us clear out to the car.  I was afraid that we weren’t going to get rid of
her.  Yet we felt bad that someone was so lonely as to pickup on a stranger and
begin to tell her life history.  We fixed breakfast of French toast, with fruit,
peanut butter, honey and yogurt on it, and eggs.  We read from the scriptures,
and then both took a nap.  Mae got on the computer to write letters.  I had the
car washed and oil changed, and then had Mae go with me to mail the baby quilts
to Jessica and David and Shauna’s new baby.  It cost us more to ship them than
to buy them.  We stopped by the Nuque’s to see how Brother Nuque is, as Sister
Nieto said he was in a accident.  They weren’t there and daughter said that
they had taken her grandfather to Manila to the airport, so he could return to
the U. S.  She said that Brother Nuque had only received a cut above the eye,
but was ok.  When we came back home, Mae got back on the computer, again
writing letters.  I fixed leftovers for dinner.  Mae didn’t finish the letters
until after 7 PM.  I then got on the computer to do my journal and wrote some
more on my stories.  President Brimhall called this evening and told me that
President Go, in Belair, would like Elder and Sister Browning to come back up
and do more training in Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching. </span></p>

got ready to attend District Development meeting at Guimba Chapel with the
Elders.  We sure enjoy being with these young men.  We will go out on Sunday
and meet with Elder Brown and his companion and do some visiting of priesthood
holders in the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> branch, then we will meet with Elder
Ligaliga and Elder Folker and try to get more information about the teaching of
those in Talugtug.  The problem there is that the cost to come to church will
be P50 one way, and few Filipinos can or will pay that much.  After meeting we
went over to the Doria family and visited with them for a few minutes.  I am
sure the father went into the other room and kept quiet, so he would not have
to talk to us.  We asked the mother about coming to church, but she used the
excuse that she isn’t feeling well.  The boys had drawings for us and they
would like to again go to Jollibees.  We went out to President Cabuyaban’s and
talked to him about his farm.  The other morning he called saying that the
market was no good and he was only getting P4 per kilo for the pechay.  That is
very low and he wont make it at that price.  Today he was feeling better about
it as he found that there are few growers and the price is now P14 and could
clime as high as P30.  He hopes to get us a payment on his loan by the end of
next week.  We are hoping that it works out for him.  It was 2 PM when we got
home and Marlyn had dinner ready.  After dinner I took a nap.  Mae made
brownies and at 3 PM we went over to Gasmania’s where we wished Eva
congratulations for graduating from collage.  We also met with the District YM
&amp; YW and President Gasmania about youth conference.  They asked if Mae and
I would speak at the opening of the conference.  They also want Elder and
Sister Clark to speak at the closing of the conference.  After returning home
Mae got on the internet.  We had some letters from some of our friends.  I then
worked on my journal for a few minutes.   We stayed up until 11 PM so that we
might call Shellie and Roy.  We haven’t heard from them for a while and Mae got
a little anxious to see how they are doing.  It was good to talk to them for a
few minutes.  We have been getting some calls for the past few days and when we
answer the phone there is silence and then the person hangs up.  We are getting
a little concerned about it.</span></p>

walk and took several pictures especially of the flowers.  Marlin Dator came
over and I went over the training for the Priesthood Executive Committee.  That
took over 2 hours but I think was very well worth the time.  We got an e-mail
off to the Elders in Baler as to the training we would like to do when we go
there on the 20<sup>th</sup>, 21<sup>st</sup>, and 22<sup>nd</sup> of May.  We
relaxed and watched a video of President Hinckley’s tour to Asia.  We also
watched the movie “Only Once”.  I set the computer and projector up so we could
see them on a larger view.  It works very well, but I think we still need
speakers that will hook to the computer.  For over two weeks, we have been
missing the writing stick to our palm pilot.  We don’t know what happed to it,
but Mae had been using the palm pilot while talking on the phone.  When we
realized it was missing, I search the front room area and even reached into the
cracks of the cushions of the couch and big chairs, but did not find it.  As I
started to put the projector and computer away, there on the couch cushion laid
the writer.  Where it came from we do not know, but are glad to have it back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We attended
the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  Mae went into the primary.  I attended the
youth S. S. class, and then I visited with the District Y. M. &amp; Y. W.
Presidents about using the film “Only Once” for the youth conference.  They
will come over Tuesday evening and view the film so that they can make a
decision.  I then went into the Elders quorum to attend the end of it.  I think
I was able to answer some concerns about the purpose of Church Disciplinary
actions.  Mae stayed after meetings to train the Young Woman’s presidency.  I
took a nap in the car.  When Mae finished, I took her home and then I went out
to Guimba to work with the Elders there.  I first went with Elder Brown, Elder
_____ and President Cabuyaban to visit some members.  We first visited a young
man that has married a non-member.  They have a child not quite 2 years old. 
His name is Angelito Alcantara and has been on a mission and endowed although
he does not wear his garments now.  After visiting for a few minutes I challenged
him to have his wife listen to the missionaries.  He promised that he would ask
her.  The Elders will follow us on that reference.  I talked to him about the
eternal purposes of life and the possibility of having his family for
eternity.  We next visited the Dela Cruz family.  Noel, their 22 year old son,
was just killed in a accident last week.  He was driving his trike when a
jeepnie side swiped him as it’s driver tried to pass.  The driver was drunk. 
As the jeepnie hit the trike, the trike was overturned with a girl in the
cart.  She escaped with  only minor scratches, but Noel’s leg was caught by the
bumper of the jeepnie and he was drug for some distance, sustaining death
causing injuries.  The Family is having a viewing in their home today and will
later have the funeral.  We expressed our sympathy and only stayed for a few
minutes.  We next went to the Matal family.  This is the home of the parents of
Annalisa.  We have thought a lot of Annalisa as we have met her.  We have also
felt impressed with William, Annalisa’s intended husband.  Both of who were
there as we visited.  Brother and Sister Matal seem to be wonderful people, but
they are not coming out, as Brother Matal does not want to accept a calling.  I
visited with them about the blessings of the Gospel and told them that their
help was needed in the branch.  I hope we did some good in these visits.  We
then went back to the chapel and I met with the branch presidency of Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup>
branch.  I showed them how I felt that they needed to correct some baptismal
and confirmation records that never got recorded.  The had the original copy of
the certificates, so I had them make new certificates and send them into the
P.B.O.  with a note attached stating that they have never received any
indication that these certificates had ever been recorded.  We also went over
the situation concerning the members that live in Talugtug.  I made assignments
for the Elders to get me the population of both Talugtug and the town next to
it.  We need a listing of all members that live in those areas and those that
are active.  We Elder Brown and Elder Folker went with me to President Desalla’s
home and we ask him about the maps that he has been trying to get for me.  He
gave me the phone number of Noel Delos Santos at the P. B. O. and asked me to
call him, as he hasn’t been able to get him to respond to his requests.  I took
the Elders back to their apartment and then came home.  It began to rain and I
was in heavy rains all the way home.  It was after 7:30 PM when I got there. 
Mae had dinner ready for me.  After eating I felt completely drained and soon
went to bed, but I had to sleep on pillows to prop me up because of acid
reflex, eating that late and going to bed after eating.  Mae was tired also so
soon came to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We over slept
but still got up and went walking.  Ronald Dator came this morning to repair
our front porch light.  With the crank calls which we have been receiving the
past couple of weeks, Mae gets pretty anxious when she hears noises outside at
night.  I hope this will help her calm her fears as she can now turn on the
porch light or the light in the shed from inside the house.  He also informed
us that he and his girl friend have set the 26<sup>th</sup> of June as their
wedding date.  We are very happy for that as he needs to get on with life and
he is a very special young man.  As Utah is now on daylight saving time we
realized that we needed to get on the computer at 9 AM to talk to our family on
the instant messaging.  Jeff had a short e-mail saying that he was in Arizona
and would be flying home this evening.  Gale got on the instant messaging with
us.  Also Mike came on as did Shellie for a few minutes.  Jeff had helped
Shellie figure it out.  It was a enjoyable experience visiting with them. 
After Mike and Shellie signed off, Gale confided with us that Jeff is having
questions with his testimony.  That was hart breaking news but we were glad
that she confided with us.  She has talked to their Bishop and he want to visit
with Jeff.  Gail also asked him to give her a blessing, which he did.  Gale
said that Jeff has agreed to visit with him.  We will certainly be keeping him
in our prayers.  I had to spend some time working on my journal, as it has got
neglected for a couple of days.  It seem to be easy to let it go when we have
busy days and are tired by evening.  Elder and Sister Clark came about 7:30
PM.  We visited and watched the two movies that Scott and Mishelle sent us.  We
really enjoyed visiting and having them here for the night.</span></p>

4:45 AM and went walking at the collage.  It was a very enjoyable time.  We
came home and showered, which took a little while with the 4 of us needing to
get in.  Mae and I showered first and then gave the bathroom to them while we
fixed breakfast.  After breakfast we read the scriptures for a while.  We
attended the Guimba and San Jose Zone Conference this morning.  Both Sister and
President Brimhall gave great messages.  President Brimhall recognizes the
Elders that have had a birthday since the last Zone conference.  After giving
them a candy bar, he gave me a package of Hershey’s Sugar Free Chocolate
candy.  He is always very thoughtful of me.  We came home about 3 PM and got
the Clark’s over night items, and then they left for home.  Mae and I went over
to San Jose where we bought some speakers for our computer.  We bought some
groceries and then went out to eat at Jollibees.  At 6 PM we had Carolyn Rubio
and Denny Eligado, the District Y.W. and Y. M. presidents come over to preview
the film “Only Once” to see if they wanted to have it shown for Youth
Conference.  They feel it is a good one for the youth and would like us to show
it to them.  After they left, we pulled up the internet and had three e-mails,
one from Becky, one from Shellie and one from Julianna.  Mae sent Scott and
Mishelle a short letter.  I added today’s expenses to the budget and then
caught my journal up to date.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I am not sure
what to enter today, wondering if we really accomplished very much.  We walked
this morning at the collage and enjoyed that.  As we came back to the car to
come home, we began talking about our concerns for Jeff, Gale and David.  We
are worried about Jeff and David’s testimonies.  I finished a letter to Mike
expressing our concerns and asking his help in determining if our fears have
grounds to be concerned.  I expressed my feelings that if necessary we would
consider coming home.  I hope that it will not be necessary.  I sent a e-mail
to Sandi, just telling her that we miss her and love her.  We did some
preparation on our talks for tomorrow evening for youth conference.  I got a
text from President Cabuyaban asking for more money, but I couldn’t get through
to him.  He later called and said he was able to borrow some from someone
else.  I hope he can make it and that we helped him more than we hurt him.  I
put on the Saturday morning conference tape and watched it.  We went to the
church expecting to attend activity night at 5:30 PM, but there was no one
there.  We waited and at 6 PM Sister Elisa came but didn’t have a key to the
building.  She tried to get one from President Nieto but he wasn’t home nor was
anyone else, so activity night was canceled.  This kind of planning and
response doesn’t surprise me, but it does discourage me in what we are trying
to accomplish.  We came home and ate some dinner and then I put the next
session of conference on.  The only problem is I slept through the complete
tape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had
invited the Elders over for breakfast and had expected four of them, so we
cooked two packages of frozen potatoes, to fry with bacon in them, a dozen
eggs, muffins (which makes 12 large muffins) and lots of fruit and juice. When
they came it was only Elder Holbrook and Elder Ebanza.  Elder Bos and Elder
Jensen did not come, telling the zone leaders that they had an early
appointment.  We thought to ourselves “they should have let us know as we have
cooked way too much food now”.   We told the zone leaders that we hoped they
were really hungry as we had fixed a lot of food, thinking that the four of
them were coming.  As we brought in the food, they said “Wow! that is a lot of
food.  We told them we were just kidding, that they didn’t have to eat all the
food.  But, as we were eating, the two Elders of them kept eating more and
more, until they had eaten everything except 2 muffins and some of the fruit.  <b>We
were amazed.  </b>We used to think that Elder Jex was amazing at how much food
he could eat, but guess most of the elders stuff themselves when they are
invited over.  We listened to the Saturday afternoon General Conference tape. 
We also worked on our talks for this evening.  We went over to the collage this
evening.  They weren’t ready for us when we got there so we just spent time
with the youth.  I lost a couple of chess games, but it was fun.  We are not
sure just how our talks went because we couldn’t read their reactions.  You
just have to hope they got something from it.  We stayed for the get acquainted
dance after our talks and enjoyed dancing with them.  We commented that that
dance went a lot better than some we had in Utah with the youth.  Most of the
youth got out and danced and the music was appropriate but could have been
better selection to dance to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>After meeting Mae had
brownies for all the Elders.  We then drove to Moncada to see Brother and

her to the doctor tomorrow.  It was 1:30 PM when we got home.  We got some
lunch and did a little on the computer.  I picked up some chairs from the
church house for Mae’s baking class tomorrow.  Mae made a Chicken Casserole
which she will cook tomorrow morning as we are having the Clarks over for
lunch.  We then got ready and took the computer and projector over to the
collage where Guimba District is holding Youth Conference.  We showed the video
“Only Once” to the youth.  After the movie, President Mercado talked to the
youth.  I then told our experience and bore my testimony that I know that
Heavenly Father gave us these commandments to help us be happy.  We think that
the evening went well and the youth got something out of it.  It was late when
we got home, filled out my journal and got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke
early, got ready &amp; went to CLSU to hear Elder &amp; Sister Clark speak at
Youth Conference.  Sister Clark spoke on Preparing for the Temple and Elder
Clark spoke on The Second Coming of Christ.  They both gave very good talks. 
After the talks, they had evaluations and testimonies.  Then they awarded
prizes for the games, etc.  They sure seem like good youth.  We came home, with
the Clarks, and had lunch.  We sure enjoyed visiting with them.  They left at
1:30 p.m. to go to Paniqui to the Paniqui District Conference training.  Mae
had a baking class to give to the Guimba District Relief Society Presidencies. 
She had taken brownies (Texas Cake) to President Gamena when he did the
printing on the T Shirts for her to use for a talk at New Beginnings in
Paniqui.  They loved the brownies and asked if she would teach a baking class. 
Elder Clark helped me set up the chairs; I had borrowed from the church, and
take our big sofa chairs into the East bed room.  The baking class was part 2
of the quarterly district R.S. Leadership Meeting.  Part I was at the Church
and Mae was invited to go there.   I drove over to get the copies at the copy
shop for Mae’s class and my training next week, but when I went to pay for
them, I didn’t have my wallet.  They let me take them anyway and when Mae came
home, I went up to pay them.  Mae said that she told the ladies, she could take
4 of them with her in the car, as they were waiting for trikes to bring them
over.  There were lots more than 4 who piled into the car.  The sisters enjoyed
the baking class and had a good time.  They also enjoyed eating the brownies
and cookies and took some home to their families.  Sister Jean Gasmena had
bought the ingredients for two cakes.  She told Mae that if you buy a cake or
brownies that size, it costs P300, but she had bought the ingredients for the 2
brownies for less than P180 and she still had half of the ingredients left
over.  She was excited.  The problem, however, is that they don’t have ovens to
bake them in.   The R.S. President from Munoz 1, Sister Monta, said she would
run right out and buy her an over.  She does have more money than most of the
other sisters because her husband is a seaman and works on a big ship.  He is
only home about 2 months a year.  She later asked Mae if she could borrow our
oven to bake her son’s birthday cake next month.  Mae jokingly said “I thought
you were going to run right out and buy an over.”  She said “first I’ve got to
find the money to buy the measuring cups.”  They all laughed.  Mae furnished
the brownies she made to show them how, and then divided them into two groups
and one worked in the main kitchen and the other group in the cooking kitchen. 
It worked well.  We borrowed a fan from the Elders as it was really hot.  I
visited with Pres. Gasmena while Mae had the baking class.  Marlyn attended
also and while we were saying “goodbye” to all the R.S. sisters, Marlyn and her
sister-in-law were in the house doing the dishes, sweeping the floors, putting
up the chairs, etc.  We sure appreciated it as we were so tired.  Marlyn is a
gem, we are so grateful for her.  Afterwards, Mae &amp; I relaxed a while
before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as we had taken our showers last night so that  gave us a little more time
before going to church.   This is our last week at Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
branch.  Sacrament meeting only lasted 45 to 50 minutes.  Primary was not very
well organized.  They held primary back in the small room instead of the
chapel, so there wasn’t room for me to attend.  I went into the youth S. S.
class and enjoyed that.  I spent about ½ of the priesthood time visiting with
the Young Men’s President about the need to spend time getting the youth out to
their meetings.  I then went into Elders Quorum meeting and the first thing
that was asked is “What is the main adversity that we have in the church?”  I
raised my hand and told them it was laziness, I then expounded a few minutes. 
That caused a pause in the lesson.  We came home and got some lunch, I then
worked on my presentation for this afternoon and took a nap for a few minutes. 
Mae went with me to the church and helped me get my equipment in.  She then
took the car and went visiting some sisters.  It was 4:30 PM before we could
get started as we were waiting for members of the P.E.C. to get there.  We did
have everyone show up.  I think it went quite well, but I am not sure just how
President Nieto took it.  I was quite straight forward in my presentation and
at one point towards the end, Present Nieto got up and left.  I was not sure if
I had upset him or not, but he then came back with treats at the end of the
meeting.  I am not sure if he went to the tindahon to buy them or not.  My legs
are really hurting me this afternoon and by the time I finished the
presentation they were really hurting.  We then stood and talked to President
Nuque for another half hour.  My feet and legs hurt until I am about ready to
cry.  Mae helped me enter my journal before we went to bed.  She also rubbed my
feet for me.  I fell asleep but Mae stayed up until after 11 PM writing a
e-mail to our family.</span></p>

Mannatech, hoping that it will clear up my problem.  Marlin came and washed our
car.   Marlyn was here today to do the house cleaning.  We got on the instant
messaging with Scott, but he was late getting on because he had to do a update
before it would let him on.  We had become concerned because we had received
that we must update messaging in order to get on the other day.  We were afraid
that ours was the problem, but it looks like the kids are not updated yet. 
Jeff came on later and we enjoyed visiting with the two of them for a while. 
After they signed off, Mae worked on the internet for a while longer.  As I am
having trouble walking, because of my feet, I took a nap.  This afternoon we
went to the bank and got our money for next month.  We also bought our
groceries at CVC.  Our Elders were there shopping also, so we gave them a ride
home. While Mae put the groceries away, I repaired the light fixture in the
kitchen.   Mae got back on the computer, so I put the conference tape on and
watched general conference and played solitary.  Sister Mercado came over and
visited and Mae was able to help her with the program for June’s Primary
Leadership training meeting.  Mae will help with that.</span></p>

give us treatments, but she didn’t come.  At 10 AM we had a brown out, so that
stopped us from working on the computer and most everything we are in need of
doing seems to be on the computer.  I don’t know what we would have done
without this computer.  It was hot, so at noon we drove to Tarlac and had lunch
at McDonalds.  We then went shopping for some material for me two pair of
slacks and Mae a couple of dresses and a jumper.  We got home at 5 PM, found

planning on getting married May 15<sup>th</sup> but the Father-in-law is
threatening violence if they get married in the Temple.  He is even threatening
killing the young man.  We discussed the situation.  President Gajonera and
President Cabuyaban are going to try to visit the father.  If it is just
threats with no action, then the couple will go ahead with their plans.  If it
is more serious we will get back in touch with President Brimhall.  I had
called President Brimhall to ask for advice.  After they left we took our
showers.  Sister Nida Valenton came and gave both Mae and I treatments.  We
also discussed a business plan with her, trying to see if it would be feasible
for her to open her own Physical Therapy office.  My main concern is that she
is too generous to the point that she might work herself broke.  While we
discussed the possibilities we had lunch.  She left about 2PM with some
homework to do.  I will also try to get the cost of having a special table
built.  I went down to the tire store to get a new set of tires for the car,
but they didn’t have a full set of four like they said they did but will get
them in next week.  We went to the church at 5:30 PM again today, but again
there was no Youth Mid-Week Activity.  We stopped to visit with President
Neito, but they weren’t home.  I worked on the computer this evening.  We had

Gajonera and his counselor came over for some more advice.  They had been out
to Guimba to visit with his counselor’s girl friends father.  They said the
father would not listen to them but said that if they got married any other way
than in the Catholic Church, he would have the young man killed, and told them
that this world was not large enough to hide from him.  He said that after they
were married that way, he didn’t care what they did.  I called and talked to

would talk to President Oaks and get back to us.  We left that much with
President Gajonera and his counselor along with having prayer for things to
work out, and will let them know when we hear more.  President Brimhall advised
them to keep the date they had planned of May 15<sup>th</sup> as scheduled.  I

had received word from President Mains asking if it might be possible for
Joselito Tobias, the 1<sup>st</sup> counselor to President Gajonera, and
Maritess Gamurot to get married at the Temple early on the 15<sup>th</sup> of May
and then get civilly married in the Catholic Church that evening.  That is a
possibility that we might explore.  He will do more checking with the Area
Presidency.  Meeting was good with the Elders and we have two new Elders in our
Zone and lost 1 set of Elders from Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup>.  We were sorry to
lose Elder Brown from Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch, but he had been there for
about 7 months.  Elder England from Star Valley Wyoming is one of our new
Elders.  We enjoyed visiting with him.  Elder Jensen is also familiar with Star
Valley as his Grandfather is from there.  After meeting we went over to Dr. Sam’s
and paid the bill for Noemi Baiola.  It wasn’t as much as we expected, so we
are not sure just what happened.  When we got home, at about 1 PM, Marlyn had
dinner ready for us.  The power has been out every since 8 AM.  After eating we
took a nap but it was hard as it was so hot.  We set out side on the front porch
most of the afternoon and evening as there was a little breeze that helped.  We
set out this evening with candles and played a game of Rummy.  I finally won
the game.  The power came back on at 8:15 PM.</span></p>
