<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking at the collage this morning.  Marlin Dator came and washed our
car.  In as much as we were out of power yesterday we had Marlyn come today
instead of yesterday.  We went shopping today for our groceries.  We bought Mae
a new wrist watch.  We also bought some shoe laces, a flower arrangement for
the table and some Jacks for Mae.  Marlyn had dinner ready for us when we got
home.  I got the chairs returned to the church house.  We worked on
presentations for this coming Saturday.  Sister Mercado came over and visited
with Mae this evening.  Mae gave me a hair cut before we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                President
Cabuyaban woke us at 5:15 AM to ask if I would call the Elders and line them up
to work on his place.  It was raining so we had decided that we would sleep
in.  That call stopped that and I was trying to decide just how to handle that
problem.  Sister Lorna Gajonera texted us to let us know that her husband would
be coming by between 7 &amp; 7:30 AM to deliver some Avon products that Mae had
ordered.  Being that I took a shower after Mae cut my hair last night I didn’t
need a shower today.  President Cabuyaban texted me back to tell me that
Brother Andres Vigilia passed away at 7 AM this morning and the family wanted
him to dress the body.  He asked if I would help.  We ate breakfast and I
started work on our budget when President Cabuyaban called back to say that
they needed us as soon as we could.  Mae went out with me.  This was a first
for both President Cabuyaban and me but we got it done.  We did lack a white
tie, and as I understood that the casket was to be sealed at this time so we
put the cap on.  Brother Vigilia was an endowed Melchizedek Priesthood
holder.   Before coming home we stopped at the church and I got some donation
slips and borrowed the forms and awards for the “On My Honor” program.  I
wanted to add them to our computer file and also to read the qualifications for
the award.   We also visited Analisa  Mactal to wish her a Happy Birthday.  From
there we stopped to see the Doria boys and give them a late Birthday gift.  We
came home and got something to eat for lunch.  I took a nap and worked on the
computer for a while.  I went out to Branch Presidency meeting at 6 PM.  I
visited with President Brimhall on the way to Guimba by use of the cell
phones.  President Cabuyaban was also trying to communicate with me as I was
driving.  It is hard enough trying to drive in this country, not alone trying
to talk on the cell phone at the same time.  We had a good Branch Presidency
meeting and then visited Brother Mactal to see if he would go Home Teaching
with President Cabuyaban and I Friday evening.  We then went to Sister Vigilai
and figured out the Funeral Program for Saturday.  I will be an extra speaker
in case one of the other does not show up or there is extra time.  We have got
to get a e-mail off to President Brimhall before we go to bed.  This has been a
very eventful day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting to bed last night so didn’t get up until 5:45 AM.  That put us to late
to go walking.  Besides the regular routine we spent until noon getting the
Home Teaching information entered and printed.  Mae worked on primary and wrote
in two journals for two young women.  I worked on a presentation for the
Aaronic Priesthood award program and added more pictures to our computer
library of church pictures.  That is becoming very nice as we make up
presentations.  I also gave some thought to my talk for the funeral on Saturday. 
We went out to Guimba this evening and got President Cabuyaban and his wife and
then went visiting the two counselors and the secretary to Sister Cabuyaban as
Primary President.  Those visits seem to have gone well.  When we got home I
cut the home teaching forms and made up booklets for the home teaching groups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5:30 AM but had to hurry in order to be ready to leave and pickup the Elder’s
by 7:30 AM.  We take them to Guimba on the days that we go to Paniqui District meeting. 
We hurried with breakfast and as we were eating a new box of cold cereal I
noticed that the container that we had just opened was crawling with little
bugs.  We had already eaten a half a bowl before we noticed it.  We just dumped
the rest out.  Oh well!  So is life in the Philippines.  We attended the
meeting at Paniqui and enjoyed it.  We were a little concerned with Elder
Hayman and the comments he made during the meeting.  It just didn’t seem
appropriate for a missionary to be making fun of some of the things he was
taking lightly.  After we had left and went visiting in Moncada we came back to
Paniqui to eat.  As we drove into the main part of town we recognized Elder
Hayman and another missionary walking along the street.  The concern we had is
that Elder Hayman was in a black tee shirt, not looking like a Missionary.  I
do not have very good feelings about the attitude of Elder Hayman, but do not
know just what I should do about it.  We had gone to Moncada to visit with
Noemi’s mother about Noemi health.  We found that they had ran out of
medication and didn’t go in for the appointment.  She is still in need of
treatment so we told her to go back to the Doctor, which she said they will
tomorrow.  We also talked to Neita about her clinic.  She is being told by
everyone that she talks to that she needs to open her clinic and then they will
come and look at it and decide if they will loan her money.  I don’t know the
answer.  We also visited Sister Vickie _?_ who took us to see a friend of hers that
needs medical help but can’t afford it.  She is not a member of the Church so I
have no idea how to advise them.  There is so many people over here that needs
help and we feel so helpless as to how to help.  We stopped on the way home in
Guimba and bought some medications for Noemi and took them to the Dr. office
asking them to give them to Noemi when she comes in tomorrow.  We got home
about 3 PM.  We were both tired so laid down and took a short nap.  I worked on
my talk for the funeral tomorrow.  I met President Cabuyaban at 5:45 in
Guimba.  We picked up Brother Quinciano Mactal and went Home Teaching to 4of
the 5 families we are assigned.  I don’t know how much good we did, but we did
have some good visits.  We took Brother Mactal home and then we stopped at
Sister Vigilai’s to see if every thing is ok.  The custom is that the body
remains in viewing until the burial, so people have been coming to the house
every since we got the body dressed and in the casket.  What an expense to keep
treats for every one as well as the emotional stress it must be.  It was 9:45
before I got home.  Mae had been preparing treats for the training she will be
helping with tomorrow.  Mae was also preparing food for when the Clarks, and
possibly the Maharrys also, come to our place tomorrow evening.  It was after
11 PM before we were able to get to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke at
5:30 and I left at 8:40am for the Young Men’s Training here in Munoz.  The
District YM Presidency did a great job in the planning and preparation.  I was
asked to give a presentation on the Awards program.  It was supposed to start
at 8:30am, but I understood it was to be 9:00 so they were waiting for me and
so we were late starting.  I went over the Aaronic Priesthood presentation with
Bro. Norbesto Cortez, the YM President and he gave that presentation.  He
seemed happy to be able to do it.  All the district YM presidency gave parts on
the training and did a great job.  We didn’t have a lot there because all the
branches don’t have a YM presidency and the ones who do, are not fully staffed
or have YM 17 or younger in the Branch YM Presidency.  I arrived home about
noon and Mae was ready and so we left for Guimba where we were to attend the
funeral of Andres Vigilia.  I was to speak on the program.  It was to start at
1:00 p.m.  There was a large crowd there.  The first two speakers gave my talk,
so I had to make some changes, but it went well.  The District Primary
Presidency with Mae’s help gave a training for District Leadership Meeting.  It
was to start at 2:00 p.m., but because of the funeral, they were not able to
start until about 2:40 p.m.  There wasn’t the crowd there that they had hoped
for either, but it went well.  The first part was on “Teaching Children” taken
from the book “Teaching, No Greater Call”.  Mae and each of the district
presidency gave a part.  Mae gave a power point presentation for hers.  The 2<sup>nd</sup>
part was on “Teaching Singing” and Sister &amp; Elder Maharry and Sister &amp;
Elder Clark gave parts and taught songs on that.  Also, Kathleen the district
secretary taught a song and Mae gave a testimony of Primary and Primary Songs. 
I helped with the equipment.  Elder Linga Linga played the piano for them.  We
dropped Sister Cabuyaban off on the way home and the Clarks followed us as they
will spend the night with us.  Mae had made fried chicken, potato salad,
brownies, drink, carrot sticks, etc. and after we ate, we watched the new
version of Johnny Lingo.  It was great.  They will let us borrow it to show to
the branches.  We were late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                As we were
late getting to bed, we slept in until 6 AM.  Elder and Sister Clark had to go
to a branch in the Camiling District.  We of course went to the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch.  I attended P. E. C. and then went into the regular block meetings.  I
conducted the Fast &amp; Testimony meeting.  During Sunday School I went into
the youth class and Mae went into the Primary.  During Priesthood meeting we
had someone taking care of the Elders Quorum and Brother Nobesto Corpuz took
the Aaronic Priesthood boys while President Cabuyaban and I went to the home of
one of the Priests and visited with him.  After the block finished President
Cabuyaban and I had some interviews, a ordination to the Aaronic Priesthood and
two setting aparts.  We then had the financial donations to take care of.  We
didn’t finish until almost 2:30 PM.  When we got home I took a nap.  Mae worked
on the Family letter.  We ate the leftovers from yesterday, but they were sure
good to have American food.  President Brimhall called this evening and I
e-mailed him some copies from the book “Faith Precedes the Miracle”.  We also
got the family letter sent and received a cute letter from David.  It is hard
to get to bed on time as time goes by so fast.  It has rained all day and so
again has made the weather cooler although the humidity is high.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking at the collage even though it was raining.  I drove the car to the
covered gym and we walked around the courts.  I felt discouraged over the house
and trying to make Scott and Mishelle a fair deal and at the same time get
enough out of it to build our home.  Also I felt quite discouraged with our
mission this morning as I have been trying to decide just what we are doing. 
President Brimhall described it last night when he said we take three steps
forward and two and a half backwards.  I have a hard time remembering that we
did advance ½ a step.  Brother Dator came and even though it is raining I had
him wash the car and clean the inside.  We got on the instant messaging with
Jeff, Mike and Scott.  We enjoyed visiting with them for a while.  I took a
short nap.  I talked to Elder Hyer and one of the items we covered was the lose
of our camera.  We are looking at $300 to $500 to replace it.  President
Cabuyaban came to town and I met him at the bank to make the deposit.  We also
went to San Jose to mail the P. B. O. report.  Mae and I were going to go to
San Jose to get groceries, but Sister Nita Valentino texted  to let us know she
would come about noon.  At 2 PM we were deciding if she was coming or not.  She
got here at 3 PM.  She gave both of us a treatment.  At 5 PM we ate some dinner
and then she left to catch the jeepnies back to Moncada.  It will take her 4 to
5 hours to get there if she can make connections.  This evening we went to
President and Sister Neito’s home and held Family Home Evening.  At first we
were not sure how it was going to turn out but it went well after we got it
started.  All there family was there plus Sister Carolyn Kay Rubio, Brother
Mico, Elder Ivanza and Elder Holbert..  It went very well.  Sister Neito
prepared a special soup for me as she know that I couldn’t have sugars. 
Everyone participated and we had a wonderful evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke at
5:30 AM but time went so fast that I wasn’t sure if we would go walking or
not.  It was cool so we decided to go for it and our walk turned out nice
despite the time.  We kept busy thru out the day, but I didn’t feel that I
accomplished what maybe should have.  Mae was on the computer trying to work on
some training presentations.  We went to San Jose at 11:30 AM to do some
shopping that we were not able to do yesterday because of the treatments from
Sister Nita.  We got ½ way there and realized I had forgotten to get any
money.  We stopped at Jollibees and ate lunch.  We like to set upstairs where
we can watch what is going on outside.  It is really amusing to watch the
everyday activity here.  We were especially interested in watching the jeepnies
load.  They just keep adding passengers to the load.  We watched three jeepnies
load and they had 13 to 16 people, beside plus the driver, on each.  Where or
how they fit was amazing to us.  It was raining hard as we left Jollibees.  We
stopped at a photo store to check on digital cameras.  Mae saw rain coats at
the store next to the photo store.  We purchased two although the one is an
extra large; I am concerned that it is still not large enough for me.  We did
our grocery shopping at CVC and then came home.  I sent an e-mail to President
Brimhall.  We got a couple of e-mails from Marge Beardall and Linda Browning
that were just pass along.  Although there were cute, I guess I don’t
appreciate getting them.  I got our bank statement by e-mail and balanced out
checking account.  Then Mae got on the computer the rest of the evening.  At 7
PM we watched the video of “The R. M.”, and did not enjoy it.  To me it was not
funny but made fun of almost every program of the church.  I do not enjoy that type
of hummer.  Mae worked more on her training programs but I was just upset so
went to bed.  I woke up at mid-night and entered this journal.</span></p>

about an hour this morning at the collage.  After showers and breakfast we got
on the enter-net with Jeff and played a game of Hearts but with a little
variation, it is Hearts-J D.  If you capture the Jack of Diamonds it reduces
your score.  It makes the game more interesting and challenging.  Also while I
played the game, using the mouse, Mae could write instant messaging on the
keyboard.  We had some work on the computer and then I took a nap.  This
afternoon we went out to Guimba.  Mae attended Young Women Mid-Week while I met
with President Cabuyaban in Branch Presidency mtg.  We made it short as Anne
wanted to attend a family event.  We will meet tomorrow night for a longer
meeting.  Elder Ligaliga and Elder ________ has written musical program on
Christ that the Young Adults are going to present in front of the market in
Guimba on Friday evening and again at the Chapel on Saturday evening.  They
were practicing this evening.  It is a very good program.  We enjoyed listening
to them practice.  Mae gave the lesson in Young Women’s this evening.  </span></p>

alarm went off, Mae said to turn it off.  I did and let her sleep a while
longer.  We didn’t go walking this morning.  After showers, I decided to make
biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  The gravy turned out ok, but the biscuits
that I made from Bisquick were terrible.  They didn’t raise and they didn’t
taste good so we had toast with gravy instead.  This afternoon we went to
Cabanatuan to find a camera.  We can order one but waited for now.  Traffic was
bad both going and coming so we were late getting home for my meeting this
evening.  On the way, one problem with the traffic was caused by a funeral
precession that went across the main bridge and really backed traffic up.   President
Cabuyaban and I met and went over branch meeting schedules and some visiting we
need to do.  We also talked about budget and how it works.  Wow we have a long
ways to go to get this Branch going right.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We attended
the Guimba Zone meeting this morning.  We picked up the Munoz Elders and gave them
a ride out.  The two new Elders are Elder Abao and Elder Gibbons.  They seem
like they are good Elders.  We were afraid that we might lose a set of
missionaries as the mission lost 13 Elders and only got 1 replacement.  Mae had
made brownies for the Elders today.  We stopped at the Dr. Office and paid for
the medication for Noime and purchased some cream for her for next week.  We
went straight to San Jose and bought a few groceries before going home.  Marlyn
had dinner ready for us when we got home.  After lunch I worked on some
pictures Mae wanted me to capture into our file.  I got sleepy so took a nap. 
I worked more on editing the pictures.  We prepared for our neighbors to come
over this evening.  Joie, his wife and two youngest children came over about
6:45 PM.  I had put the movie “Bambi” on for the children.  Their children did
enjoy it and I believe they also enjoyed the show.  Mae had refreshments for
everyone.  I had popped corn.  After the show we had Joie sing and play the
guitar.  He is really good.  Ed came over and apologized that he hadn’t been
over but he had to go somewhere and had just got back.  We put the DVD of
“Building Faith In Christ” on and they really enjoyed it.  That lead to some
discussion about beliefs but it went well.  We then concluded with Ed and Joie
singing for a little while.  One thing that is really amazing to us is that
they can sing with out any accent in the voice at all, but when they talk you
have real trouble understanding them.  It was late by the time we got things
brought in and put away.  Mae called Shellie and we talked for a few minutes
before going to bed.  Well it was over a hour, but we enjoyed it as their
computer is still down so we don’t hear from them.</span></p>

this morning so didn’t go walking.  I was up about 6 AM but let Mae sleep until
almost 7 AM.  We worked on talks and presentations, but time went fast and as
we started to get ready to attend District Leadership training, President
Cabuyaban called to inform me that the meeting was moved up from 2 PM to 1 PM. 
We really had to hurry and were still late.  Mae trained the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch Relief Society Presidency while I was in the leadership meeting. 
President Cabuyaban and I went visiting two families after the meeting.  Mae
went with us but stayed in the car.  As we were visiting the Matas I looked to
the car and Mae had her window rolled down and was visiting with the children. 
We went back to the chapel were we attended a musical fireside for all that wanted
to attend.  Elder Ligaliga was in charge and had Elder Villegas help him.  They
had ten of the Young Singles that sang and gave readings.  It was all based
around the Savior.  Mae gave the opening remarks and did a beautiful job of
it.  Elder and Sister Clark came to watch the presentation.  After the Fireside
Sister Ronalyn Dela Cruze ask Elder Clark and I to give her a blessing.  Elder
Clark was voice and I appreciated the blessing that he gave her.  The Clarks 
came home with us and stayed the night.  We sure enjoy the relationship we have
gained with them.</span></p>

early this morning and prepared breakfast and enjoyed being with Elder and
Sister Clark.  We left for meetings shortly after 7 AM.  Both Mae and I spoke
in Sacrament meeting.  Mae did very well.  Elder Pecundo spoke 1<sup>st</sup>,
followed by Mae, then I spoke and President Cabuyaban concluded.  Elder Pecundo
used the same information that I had planed to use so I had to completely
change my talk.  The one thing we have found is that the Lord seems to bless us
when things like this happen and we are able to complete the assignment.  Mae
changed her talk quite a bit also and did very well.  I became quite concerned
with the branch and the activity of the priesthood.  Quorum meeting went just
about as well as the Elders Quorum in the movie “R. M.”.  We held branch
counsel following the block and I didn’t feel good about that.  Then we
followed with Welfare meeting.  Mae and I got home in time to eat and get ready
to go to San Jose where we put on a fireside at the 4<sup>th</sup> Ward about
H. T. &amp; V. T.  That went quite well even though we had little time to
prepare.  It was 8:15 PM when we got home.  We got something to eat and soon
went to bed, but even then it was almost 10 PM.</span></p>

expected Elder and Sister Maharry to come today, but they called and said they
had to go to court on the fellow that was caught robbing the Sisters apartment. 
They will come tomorrow.  We got on line with Mike, Scott and Jeff with instant
messaging for a while. Mike was the first on line so we visited with him about
the sell of the house to Scott and Mishelle.  When we had visited for a while
with the three of them, then Mike had to go.  Jeff left for a while so we could
visit with Scott about the house.  We didn’t do to good because Scott and Mae
couldn’t understand how I want to figure the cost of the house.  I guess Scott
will call in the morning and we will talk about it by phone.  Jeff and I played
a game of hearts while Mae sent messaging back and forth.  I got a little sleep
this afternoon while Mae wrote the Family Letter.  I fell asleep while trying
to write a letter to President Brimhall.  At 2 PM I met President at the bank
to make the deposit.  While downtown President Cabuyaban helped me check at the
Pawn Shops to see if they had a camera.  We visited about 15 shops but none of
them had a camera, not alone a digital camera.  This evening we went out to
President and Sister Cabuyaban’s and had Family Home Evening with them.  Mae
took some Texas cake out and drinks for refreshments.  President Cabuyaban
popped some popcorn.  We had a nice evening.  We stayed up and composed a
letter to Scott and Mishelle on the sale of the house and got that sent by
e-mail to them.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                As we were
late getting to bed last night, we slept in a little later this morning.  Mae
doesn’t feel the best today, but you would never know it as she just keeps on
going.  We expected the Maharry’s to come this morning to spend the day with
us.  We didn’t go to San Jose because we didn’t know when they were coming. 
They didn’t come until almost 2 PM.  Mae had made dinner and it was ready for
noon.  It was still good but it kept her wondering what to do with it.  Scott
called us this morning and we visited about the house.  I e-mailed Mike a
letter and informed him about the agreement with Scott and Mishelle and asked
for is help in this matter.  We enjoyed having the Maharry’s come.  We just ate
dinner and visited.  We decided to get together again on a P day and go to
Cabanatuan and see a war memorial that is there.  They left about 4:30 PM and
so it gave me enough time to get some e-mails off for President Cabuyaban.  I
met president Cabuyaban at 6:30 PM and we went visiting this evening.  It is
sure hard to understand what is going on when I don’t speak the language.  I
hope we did some good.  We had one family that wanted help filling in a hole in
the floor of their house.  I understood C. S. P. when it was mentioned.  When
we got out in the car I asked President what that was about.  When he explained
that they had dug the hole while looking for buried treasure.  He also said
that the dirt had been carried away, but they had some more dirt that they
could get across the road.  I told him that he needed to tell them that the
Lord helps those that helps them self.  All they need to do is get two buckets
and a shovel and each day fill the buckets with dirt and carry it across the
road, into their house and dump it into the hole.  If they only did two buckets
a day, it would only take them a month to get it done.  I was not in favor of a
Community Service Project for the Missionaries to help them.  We also had one
family that we think hid when we came so they wouldn’t have to see us.  It was
an interesting evening and I hope we did some good.  Mae was still up when I
got home.  We set and talked for a while.  I had Mae go to bed while I entered
my journal.  I won’t set the alarm again, as we were late going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We thought if
we could write this out it might be easier to understand.  We feel that for
your best interest you need to get the house appraised for as high as you can. 
This appraisal will need to be done before you can get the loan.  We would
suggest that you get the patio door and the carpeting done now and then get the
appraisal, as this will make the appraisal higher.  We will pay for both of
these improvements now, but will add the patio door back into the totals.  We
had told you that we would pay for the carpet some time ago, so that will not
be added back in.  We understand about the dog, but we think in order to get
the house loan now you should proceed with those steps.  The higher you get the
appraisal the more it will show that you put down on the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Dear Mike, Becky and family,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I enjoyed
visiting with you, Mike, yesterday on instant-messaging.  We were sorry you had
to leave before we had time to ask about your family.  We appreciate Becky’s
letters and hearing about you, Becky and the kids.  It sounds like the kids are
growing so fast.  We can somewhat see what we have missed, being over here for
two years, as we look at the youth here and see how they have grown.  When we
do this we have a little sick feeling.  We hope that we can make up for some of
this missed time when we get home.  We do know that this is what we were
supposed to do and we are learning much, are having many experiences, and we
love the people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mike, we know
that your time has many demands and hate to add to your burdens, but we need to
ask a little more of you.  We were able to visit for a few minutes with you
yesterday but maybe we can explain a little more about our plans with our
home.  Before we accepted our mission call we had tried to sell the home, as
you know, hoping to clear $50,000 that we could then use to build in Wyoming. 
With the realtors fees and the way houses were dropping in cost, had we sold
then we could not have cleared that amount.  That, along with the worry of
Grandma Jensen, is what prompted me to go to the Temple seeking answers.  From
there we put in our papers for a mission, and instead of building first, we
went on a mission.   The realtor thought the prices of homes would go up, but
they haven’t.  Scott just told us that our neighbors, the Banners, who had
really fixed up their home by putting in oak railings, hard wood floors and
many other improvements, had their home listed at $150,000 and they moved into
his parent’s home who left for a mission.  They have been there for over a year
and their home has not sold, so they just moved back into it this week.   The
Parks lost their home and it sold for $120,000.  He has checked with other
homes which have sold and even had the realtor, who sold the Parks home, walk
through our home and he estimated it at $127,000.  Of course, we will have an
appraisal right away to see, and hopefully, it will be higher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We are having
Scott &amp; Mishelle fix the back patio door as it had pulled away from the
steps before we left.  Kip is going to do it for $1,000 (new door and cost of
labor.)  We are also having them put in the new carpet now so the appraisal
will be as high as possible, making it possible for their down payment to be
added in.  We are having Mom’s friend at work send us the e-mail address where
we can get some money out of our 401K as Mom has to have it out of there by the
time she reaches 65 anyway.   The door and carpet we will pay for now before
the appraisal, and then the price of the door and other needed repairs to the
home, will be taken out of the price of the sale after we have received our
$55,000.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We feel this
is a good time to sell to Scott and Mishelle since they can get the interest
rate at 5 ½ percent.  Also, we will have the money to begin working on the
house soon after we get home.  We will eliminate the realtor’s fee this way,
which takes a big chunk out.  As you can see, we should clear from $50,000 to
$55,000 through this sale.  I do not have an exact estimate of the cost to
build, but feel that we will do ok at that amount.  I think that this will also
be a good buy for Scott and Mishelle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                With you
having power of attorney, we will need to have you intercede for us.  I have
attached a copy of the letter to Scott &amp; Mishelle for you and have told
Scott that you will be the one to handle and sign all agreements.  We hope this
will not cause you too much work and worry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The figures
in the EXAMPLE are not exact, but should give you the idea of what I want.  The
balance was taken off of the mortgage information as of December 2003.  I
believe you can contact Wells Fargo to get the contact information on our
mortgage co. but I believe the Mortgage Co. that Scott is working with will get
that.  It comes out of our checking account as BANKOFAMERICAKY # 060104 0026
182246 if that helps.  We can be somewhat flexible on what we get out of the
house but must be at least $50,000 or above or we can’t sell.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We are doing
well and enjoying the experience.  I tried experimenting with my diet and went
to cheaper nutritional pills, but quickly found that it didn’t work.  Mom
didn’t take her blood pressure pills for three days, as we went on a trip with
the other couple missionaries and she forgot to take them, and her blood
pressure immediately went up.  She won’t try that again although it was done by
accident.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Financially
we are ok, although my being assigned to the Branch Presidency is not only
challenging but also more expensive, I am going thru a lot of gas and gas has
gone up in price over here lately.  We are looking at buying another digital
camera, as ours got left lying unattended for a few minutes and it grew legs
and ran off.  We felt really bad.  We had asked everyone including Pres. &amp; Sis.
Brimhall, Branch presidents and many people.  They are all looking for it, but
when you leave something unattended, even for a few minutes and even in the
Church or Temple, these people feel it is ok to take it.  We have looked at
many pond shops also.  We asked the custodian, but we don’t trust him, he is
one who is dishonest.  We have been told that by many people.  Anyway, we
really miss it, so are looking for a replacement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Well, we sure

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Again we were
late going to bed and Mae isn’t feeling the best so we slept in and didn’t go
walking.  We took a overhead projector to President Mercado and got the I. O.
S. printout that I had ordered.  From there we went to San Jose grocery
shopping, mailed the church report at LBS and drew some money out of the bank. 
I bought Mae a Wedding Anniversary card.  Mae bought a gift for the Mercado’s
daughter as it is her birthday today.  We stopped that off on the way home.  I
hope that doesn’t start something.  We worked on a presentation for this
Saturday that we have been asked to give in Cabanatuan.  We attended Mid-week
activity at Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Br.  President Cabuyaban and I were to have
Branch Presidency meeting this evening but he didn’t make it.  He and Sister
Cabuyaban are having some problems over the building of their house.  Mainly
financial, which they are out of.  He has asked if I could see about him
getting another loan, but I told him that I can’t where he hasn’t been able to
pay the first loan back yet.  Mae wrote Sister Cabuyaban a long text letter
about supporting her husband.  The nid-week activity went well.  Before we left
home Mae was trying to decide what she might do if they asked her to handle it
this evening.  She came prepared with some parlor games.  That is also what
they had planned for this evening.  It was a good evening with 10 to 12 girls
and 3 to 4 boys coming out.  I think the youth had fun.  We got on the
inter-net when we got home and had received a letter from Mike and one from
Sandi.  We sure enjoy our children.</span></p>

there at 9 AM.  We visited with the Clark’s, went to the bank and cashed a
check for $1,000.00 and then went looking for a camera.  We ended up at the S.
M. mall where we bought a Canon digital camera and printer for P28,950.00 plus
they gave us a extra battery worth P2,500 and a caring case fro the printer. 
We had a lot of fun and enjoyed being together but we were tired when we got
home at 9 PM.  I updated the budget and filed in my journal before we went to
bed very tired.</span></p>

pan to Sister Neito with a thank you, on the way home.  Marlyn had diner ready
when we got home.  After lunch I took a nap.  Mae worked on the presentation
for tomorrow.  This evening I went out to Guimba where President Cabuyaban and
I went visiting.  We visited four homes and I hope we did some good.  I had
hoped that Mae would relax a little but she kept busy until after I got home. 
She finally went to bed at 11 PM while I stayed up and filled in my journal.  I
did call President Brimhall for some advise about one of the families we

shortly after 5 AM and started to work on the presentation for today.  Scott
called and wished me a Happy Fathers Day and Happy 45th Anniversary.  We talked
about the house and I told him to go a head and get the patio doors in and the
carpet installed.  Christine Mercado and Marlyn came over at 8 AM to make cakes
for Sister Monta’s sons Birthday.  Marlyn came so that she could clean up after
Christine finished.  She is so good that way.  We wanted to attend a baptismal
in Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch but we still were working on our presentation. 
We left for Cabanatuan about 11:30 AM and we stopped at the book store to get
some copies.  We didn’t have any problem with traffic on the way and got there
with plenty of time to set things up.  I realized that I had forgot to bring
the mouse for the computer.  I tried having Roger Sylvia help me over the phone
to change the controls on the mouse pad but I couldn’t do it over the phone.  I
went up to Blas Edwards and bought a mouse.  I think our presentation went
fairly well.  They didn’t have the attendance they had hoped for but it was
fair for here.  The Stake Relief Society Presidency gave Mae a nice corsage and
a box of Brownies.  We went out to eat at a restraint there in Cabanatuan
before coming home.  We stopped at Rogers on the way home and he helped me with
my computer.  It was 9 PM when we got home.  We were both quite tired.</span></p>

meeting at 8 AM.  Pres. Cabuyaban suggested that we start this meeting at 7:30
AM as we don’t have time to be out and ready for Sacrament meeting.  We will start
that next week.  Meetings went fairly well although I conducted and have a hard
time pronouncing names.  For Sunday school adult class I asked Sister Nievelyn
Ramos, the Young Single Adult teacher, if she would combine with the adult
class and give the lesson as we didn’t have anyone to give that lesson.  She
did and did a great job.  I met with her for a few minutes after the block and
we discussed some ideas for the Y. S. A. to hold Family Home Evening.  She will
get back with me.  We finished P. E. C. meeting and then figured the finances
for the week.  Mae also trained the YW Presidency after the block meetings.  It
was 3:20 PM before we got home.  We got something to eat and then took a short
nap.  President and Sister Brimhall arrived early in Munoz for the musical
fireside this evening so they stopped and visited with us for a few minutes. 
We also went to the fireside.  It was excellent performance and I think all
that attend enjoyed it.  We visited after and were almost the last ones out. 
We played around with our camera for a while trying to get it adjusted for us. 
By the time I got my journal entry, we were late getting to bed.</span></p>

the time went, but at 7:00, as we were ready to leave the house, David called
to wish me “Happy Father’s Day”.  We visited with him until almost 8:00.  We
then got some breakfast and at 9:00 a.m. got on the internet to talk with the
kids on “Instant Messaging”.  Mike was the first one on and about that time
President Cabuyaban and his son, Ivan, came.  I had told him that at 9:00 am we
got on “Instant Messaging” with our children, but he didn’t understand that
both Mae and I did that together.  He thought that Sister Browning could give
Ivan a haircut while I was on the internet.  I let Mae get on the computer and
I gave Ivan the haircut and afterwards gave Sonny (Pres. Cabuyaban) one.  By
that time, Pres. Cabuyaban and I had to leave to make the bank deposit, so we
did that.  I will take the reports to San Jose tomorrow to mail.  Shortly after
I got back home, Elder and Sister Maharry came and we left with them to go to
Cabanatuan.  We stopped at McDonalds and ate lunch and then went out to visit
the war memorial which is located here.  We had a little bit of trouble finding
it, and came first to a military base and inquired there and they said there
wasn’t any thing left of the prison camp, but Elder Maharry went down the road
further and we found the memorial park.  It was very well kept up because it is
owed and funded by the government of the  United States of America.  We noticed
that the two American flags were flying at half mast and wondered why.  We
questioned the caretaker and he said it was because an American President,
Pres. Ronald Regan, had died.  We were very impressed with the memorial park
and was in awe to read the history of what took place there.  They still had
the cement footings from part of the original prison concentration camp.  We
got home about 4 pm.  Mae tried to take a short nap.  I was going to start the
family letter, but got side tracked down loading the pictures from the camera
and then decided that we needed to back up our files of pictures.  That became
much more of a job than I had imagined and in order to back up all of our
picture files, it took 4 CDs.  That is a lot of pictures.  Sister Mercado came
over to visit with Mae and as she was about to leave, I thought I had better at
least go out and speak to her.  As we visited, she commented that now that her
children were getting older (2 &amp; 4 years old), that she didn’t have to
spend so much time caring for them and so she was bored with not having enough
to do and was thinking of going to work, but her husband doesn’t want her to. 
He is the District President.  Being bored seems really strange to Mae and I
because we don’t ever remember having the time to “be bored”.  We are always
complaining that we don’t have enough time to do all that we need and want to
do.  Anyway, Mae took over and wrote more on the family letter.  It was late
when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke soon
after 5 am and went walking at the college.  We haven’t been for almost a week
so it felt good to be doing it again.  Hope we can keep it up this week.  After
breakfast, we left for San Jose to take 3 boxes of Book of Mormons to the zone
leaders over there.  We needed to go to San Jose anyway to send the weekly
reports off to the PBO in Manila.  We also went grocery shopping since we were
not able to do it yesterday.  After lunch, I took a nap while Mae worked on
typing the Family Letter since we didn’t have time this past week or yesterday
to get it written.  I had started it last night, but hadn’t got it finished. 
When I woke up, I resized some pictures we wanted to send the children and sent
them along with the letter.  This evening I went and picked up Pres. Cabuyaban
and we went out visiting.  We visited 3 families and then visited others to
make callings.  I wasn’t feeling good and when I got home, I was running a
temperature.  I soon took some medication and went to bed.  Mae filled out my
journal for me since I wasn’t feeling good.  She also rubbed my feet for me
before I went to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
5:30 AM because every morning we have some nut come by honking his horn to wake
everyone so they can buy his wares.  Sometimes I would like to take what ever
he is selling and shove it down his throat.  I don’t think anyone ever buys
from him at that time, so you would think he would wait until later or find
some where else to start.  Anyway that woke me but I soon went back to sleep. 
Mae had stayed up until 11:30 PM before she came to sleep last night so she
also slept in.  I did feel much better this morning when we got up.  We worked
on some training material and did some e-mailing.  The day sure goes by fast. 
This evening I had Branch Presidency and Mae went out visiting with Sister Villanueva,
the R. S. President and her secretary Sister Mactal.  We discussed some
positions and then President Cabuyaban, Brother Romano and I worked on the I.
O. S. for a couple of hours.  We just got a start on it.  When I got home I
tried to figure out how to make a chart for the branch progress.  Mae did get a
e-mail off to our extended family and one off to Bancor Investments, to see
about drawing out some money from her retirement.  We were late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I woke at 3 am this morning
and could not go back to sleep, so got up for awhile and read the scriptures
and said my prayers.  I went back to bed about 5:30 a.m. and cuddled Mae up in
my arms and we went back to sleep for another hour, then had to get up and get
breakfast prepared as we had invited the 4 Elders over for breakfast.  After breakfast,
we held a short correlation meeting with them and decided we would do this on a
regular weekly basis.  I then met Pres. Cabuyaban and Bro. Manual Garcia at the
Church and we drove in my car to barangay north of Guimba where the Matas live
to see what the possibilities are for having the Church Humanitarian Services
assist us with getting a well and water pump for these people out here.  We got
stuck as the car slid on the muddy roads into a ditch.  We had a young man who
was driving a tractor and he helped pull us out.  Brother Garcia gave us some
recommendations as to what we needed to put in the letter to Elder &amp; Sister
Swenson.  I came back home, we ate lunch as it was about 2 p.m. and I was very
tired so took a nap.  I met Pres. Cabuyaban at Bulok and took he and Ivan to
their home.  He changed clothes and we went visiting.  We visited a sister that
had fallen and hurt her left arm.  Before leaving, we gave her a blessing and
advised her that we could have the R.S. President contact her tomorrow.  We
then visited the R.S. President and asked her to follow through on this.  As I
took Pres. Cabuyaban home, he commented as to what a wonderful wife he has and
then he told me of his experience when I had taken him home of how Annie had
helped him, by getting him something to eat and helped him get ready to go
visiting with me.  She told her as he was about to leave, that she sure loved
him.  I stopped at the district clerk’s house to get a reimbursement check for
the branch and then I went to President Gajonera.  When I got there, they told
me that their son had swallowed something and they were concerned about it.  We
discussed the needs of putting a basic unit out in San Anton.  I came home and
got Mae and we went over to have Pres. Gasmena sign the check.  After getting
home, I had to write two e-mail letters.  One to Pres. Brimhall about the Basic
Unit and the other to Elder &amp; Sister Swenson about getting assistance from
the Humanitarian Services for the well and pump in the Barangay in Guimba.  I
am really tired, so Mae is typing this journal entry for me while I try to tell
her what to type.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We woke at 5:15 am, showered,
ate and left at 7:30 to pick up the 4 Elders in downtown Munoz (where they have
moved) and they rode with us to Guimba for our District Development Meeting. 
Those Elders do a great job conducting, giving MSP talks, workshops, etc.  We
think our zone sings the “Harvest” song the best of any zone, they really put
feeling and actions into it and sing loud.  It sounds great!  Mae baked
brownies for them, which they always enjoy.  From there we went to Gerona to
meet with Sister Tess Mijah and her husband as they are getting a quilting
business and also selling Christmas Lanterns going and wanted to show us their
products so we can tell others and help to sell them.  Of course, they would
like us to buy some also, but we can’t at this time since we just bought our
camera.  They are quality quilts and lanterns.  We enjoyed visiting with them,
and we took pictures of the quilts in order to show people.   They have a
beautiful home, one of the very nicest we have seen.  Her aunt and uncle, who
live in Hawaii, built it so they would have a place to come when they visit
family in the Philippines, but let them live in it.  Not sure if they pay rent
or not, probably so.  We stopped at the Mercury Drug in Guimba and picked up
the lotion, etc., which Noemi needs and took it to the doctor as Bro. &amp;
Sis. Baiola will be bringing Noemi tomorrow for her checkup.  We stopped to get
some cheeseburgers to eat on the way, at Cindi’s.  We went straight to the bank
in San Jose to make our monthly draw and put in another check.  Boy, the months
go by fast.  We went home and took an hours nap since we hadn’t gotten much
sleep the past two nights.  I left at 5:25 p.m. to go pick up Pres. Cabuyaban
to go visiting again tonight.  We mainly took care of getting the medications
and forms filled out to help the Sister that we visited last night.  Her
husband would not taker to the doctor even though he is a trike driver.  We had
the R.S. President take her to the hospital and have her arm checked.  It was
not broken but badly sprained.  I got home about 8:30 PM.  We did some book
work on our budget and I finished my journal entry.  It was 10 PM by the time
we got to bed.  At 10:15 PM Mike called to let us know that the finance co. is
sending him the papers for the sale of the house.  He said that Scott had
called him the other day and told him that they couldn’t buy the house because
the Co. that he works for sent a letter out to all personal that there would be
a 10% cut in all personals wages.  With that cut they just couldn’t buy the
house.  The next day he called back and said that they brought him another
letter saying that the cut was affective for all personal except Scott
Browning.  He said Scott was sure happy.  We visited for ½ an hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and left for Manila at 3:30 AM.  There was little traffic and the freeway
is about completed so we were able to drive to the Manila Temple in 2 ½ house. 
That is the fastest we have ever made it.  We were there in time to attend the
7 AM session with Ronald Dator and his bride to be.  Although I was tired I was
able to stay fairly alert throw the session.  At 9 AM we attended the Sealing
of Ron and his wife.  We felt a little bad that the Sealer didn’t talk more
about the ceremony to the couple and those in attendance.  Also we have noticed
that the Philippine people are very reserved about kissing in public so it is a
shock to them when they are told that they may kiss the bride over the alter. 
Out of the five couples that we have seen married since we have been here non
of them has really kissed the bride.  We got a chance to visit with (passed
Elder) Jerusalem, as he was at the wedding.   Before starting home we went to
the distribution center and bought some items.  We stopped at the mission home
and ate lunch with the Clarks.  We sure enjoy them.  Mae drove part of the way,
as I got to tired.  We got a text from President Cabuyaban, saying that he was
sick and would like a blessing.  We stopped at the Villanueva’s and had Brother
Villanueva go with us and he helped me give the blessing.  As we drove home I
could hear a noise coming from the car and finally decided that it was
something dragging under the car.   It was about 7 PM when we got home.  Mae
wasn’t feeling well so warmed me something to eat and she lay down.  I entered
some items in our budget and the filled out my journal.  I went to bed shortly
after that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had
trouble getting up but got away about in time.  As we drove out of the driveway
I could hear the noise under the car.  I looked under the car and it was a
small branch that was caught on the frame.  I reached under and pulled it out
but got my shirt dirty.  I had to go back in the house and change shirts. 
President Cabuyaban texted me to say he was still sick.  I had to conduct and
preside.  We had one of the talks not show up but there was one extra youth
that had been assigned so I just gave a short message to take up the rest of
the time.  I think it went well, anyway they seemed to pay attention.  After
the block I took Christopher Sumangil and Norberto Corpez besides Sister
Cabuyaban and Ivan to Pres. Cabuyaban’s home where they blessed and gave the
Sacrament to President.  I took them back and then went back and President and
I figured the finances.  It was 3:30 PM before we got home this afternoon.  We
ate some dinner but that stopped me from laying down do to acid reflex.  I set
up the last half of this years calendars for the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> branch. 
You can sure use up time on a computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking at CLSU this morning.  As it threatened to rain we walked around
the basket ball court.  I tried to count the paces around the courts and I
think it is about 300 feet to make one round.  I thought we had walked around
it 4 times but Mae was sure it was much more that that.  Oh well it doesn’t
really matter so we changed subjects.  We do enjoy walking together.  Marlin
Dator came and washed out car for us this morning.  We got on instant messaging
with Mike and Scott but none of the rest came on.  I drove out to Baloc and met
with Manual Garcia and talked over the pump request that we applied for.  He
thinks it should go through quite fast.  We also talked about Pagador who was
excommunicated from the church in Cabanatuan and now lives in Guimba.  Brother
Garcia remembers the case as he was the Stake President at the time.  I then
went out to Guimba and got the bank deposit from President Cabuyaban.  I took
him to the hospital to see the doctor as he is still sick.  When I got back to
Munoz I made the bank deposit and cashed the check for last week.  After eating
some lunch Mae and I went to San Jose, where I mailed the weekly report, a
Birthday card to Brad and a get well card to Bob.  We bought some groceries,
and got some papers laminated for President Cabuyaban.  Mae finished writing
the family letter.  I got some potatoes and a chicken breast in to bake and
then took a nap.  After dinner we watched the movie “Brigham” and then I
entered my journal entry.  We tried to get on the internet but it wouldn’t let
us in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We prepared
breakfast for Elder Hulbert and Elder Abao.  We then had a correlation with
them so that we might help each other.  I went to Brother Damacio and got two
checks to cover distributions for Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  I couldn’t get
President Gasmenia’s signature until 1:45 PM so I went back home.  I took a
nap, ate dinner and went to President Gasmenia’s and had him sign the checks. 
I was then able to cash the checks at the bank.  I then went to Guimba to get
President Cabuyaban.  When I left the house it was raining hard.  There were
two boys about 6 years old that was playing in the rain totally nude and just
having a good time.  On the way to Guimba a man was taking a pee beside the
road, which isn’t unusual to see here.  When I got to Pres. Cabuyaban’s they
were all asleep, Pres., Ivan, Jared and Sister Cabuyaban.  Jared had been
nursing when they went to sleep so Sister laid there exposed.  I had Sunny go
with me to get the food items they needed and pay their bills.  On the way
there were two boys on the side of the road having a peeing contest.  You just
have to smile and say “Only in the Philippines.”  Pres. Cabuyaban still is sick
so I took him back to his home and we called tonight’s visiting off and I came
home.  Mae and I worked the rest of the evening on the computer.  Time goes by
so fast when you are working on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We have had
rain for the past two days with it getting light some times and even stopping
for a few minutes.  Sometimes it is raining so hard that you can barley see
across the road to the neighbors.  The wind also gets pretty strong sometimes
but all in all it really isn’t bad.  We walked at the gym at the collage again
today.  It is not quite as enjoyable as walking around the campus but we enjoy
talking as we walk and it gives us good exercise.  We had a fairly standard
with breakfast, showers and scripture study.  We especially enjoyed reading 1
Corinthians 13.  We worked on being prepared for the meeting with our Mission
President and wife and the couple missionaries.  This afternoon we had Sister
Rubio come over and we visited with her about the need to support that
Priesthood and not criticize our leaders.  She has and is going through a lot. 
I am not quite sure what we should do if anything.  We just pray for guidance
from our Lord.  We got word this morning that the youth activity in Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>
has been changed.  We tried to reach YM &amp; YW leaders in the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
branch but didn’t get word back until 5:30 PM that they were holding Midweek
Activity for the Branch.  We got the computer, projector, screen and DVD of
“Brigham” ready and went out.  When we got there we found that the power was
out so couldn’t show it anyway, and so they sang songs and played games.  We
had about 15 youth out this evening.  It was 9:15 PM before we got home.  Our
power was also out.  We are glad for the lamp that we bought that runs on
rechargeable batteries.  It is much better than candles.</span></p>
