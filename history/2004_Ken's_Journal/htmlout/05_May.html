<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning.  We had just got home and into the shower, when
President Brimhall called.  He said he needed more information on Joselito
Arcega Tobias and his bride to be, Marites DeGuzman Gamurot.  They are trying
to get married in the Manila Temple, but her father is objecting, even to the
point of being violent and having Joselito killed.  I hurried and got dressed
and went down to the Munoz Chapel to visit with President Gajonera.  We tried
to get contact with either one of the couple, but could not at that time.  I
came home with what information that President Gajonera could give me.  We got
ready to go out to Paniqui District Leadership training.  On the way we made
some calls and received some calls with information about the wedding.  I did
leadership training with the Branch Presidents concerning the conducting of
interviews.  It went fairly well but I only got ½ ways through the presentation
and ran out of time.  Elder and Sister Clark came out to the meeting also. 
After the meeting, the four of us went out to eat and visit.  We were tired
when we got home.  Mae laid down and went to sleep, but I stayed up working on
a letter for President Brimhall concerning the information that I had
gathered.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We over
slept, but as it is Fast Sunday we were able to get ready ok.  We attended the
Paniqui 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  After Fast and Testimony meeting we attended
the Primary.  They were better prepared that most Branches that we attend but still
have a long ways to go.  That building is also the District Center and today is
the dedication of the building.  Dedication meeting was to start at 11:30 AM,
so I left the primary room and met the Branch President in the hall way.  I
checked with him about letting the primary out to attend the dedication.  He
said he wanted them to remain in primary, so Mae stayed and kept the children
there.  I attended the Dedication.  President Brimhall gave a talk and the
dedication prayer, doing a very good job.  After the meeting I tried to meet
with the Branch President of Paniqui 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  I didn’t get to
far with him, in fact I felt like I was not wanted.  His attitude, that I
received, kind of upset me.  Joselito and Marites were their when President
Brimhall came for their temple recommend interviews.  Also Wilfredo Sagun was
also there to get his Temple recommend as he will be getting married on the 18<sup>th</sup>
of May.  Mae and I came home about 2 PM.  We turned the A.C. on and shut the
bedroom door to keep the cool air in and took a nap.  We later got up and ate
dinner.  Mae got on the computer to write to our children.  I watched the
afternoon session of General Conference.  Mae watched conference tapes while I
worked on the computer catching my journal up to date.  I talked to President
Go this evening by phone about our trip to Baler to do some training.  I also
called President Brimhall about the way finances are handled with the Baler
Branch, as they do not report to a district.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Someone
texted us a thought at 6:30 AM, although we didn’t recognized who it was.  We
were a little late getting up, but still went walking.  We showered and had
breakfast after returning home.  Marlyn came while we were eating breakfast. 
She said the she had heard that the power was going to be shut off today.  We
hurried and filled some water containers just in case.  We got on the computer
and visited with Jeff and Gail using instant messaging.  As we were closing
with Jeff, Scott came on and visited for a while.  Mike is in Florida, Sandi is
having trouble with her computer, and we don’t know what happened to Shellie
and David.  We enjoyed the visit.  Marlin came and washed our car.  Shortly
after he left President Rodelio Cabuyaban and Ivan (his son) came to make a
payment on his loan.  He had texted Mae asking if she could give him a haircut
like she did Elder Browning, so she did.  We had them stay and eat lunch with
us.  I tried to teach him more about farming and encouraged him to try a new
way of planting pechay.  They hadn’t been gone for long, when Marlin returned
with his wife and son.  Mae had wanted to visit with Imelda about Relief
Society.  I visited with Marlin about Home Teaching.  When they left Marlin and
I loaded the old clothes dryer onto his tricycle for him to take it to Ronald. 
While we did this Sister Mercado came over to get the material and clothes to
use as patterns to make Mae some dresses and me some slacks.  We then went to
San Jose to do our grocery shopping.    Mae stopped to talk to the man (an
artist) who has his business set up at the front of CVC.  He is very friendly
and very talented.  Mae always admires his work and talks to him.  Tonight he
asked about our daughters as we had introduced them to him while they were here
visiting.  Mae said “I don’t know where they got their talent as I surely don’t
have the talent and you and they have.  He looked at her and said “You have the
best talent.”  Mae asked what he meant and he said you teach people about God
and you help people and spread God’s word to all the people.  That is the very
best talent a person can have.”  Mae was surprised and agreed that it was the
best talent and that we are blessed to be here serving on a mission and
representing the Lord, Jesus Christ.  Mae wants to bring him a Book of Mormon
next week when we come to do our grocery shopping and ask him if he would be
interested in hearing the missionaries.  We were very tired when we got home. 
We warmed up some supper, Mae then watched General Conference.  I worked on the
computer catching my journal up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking at CLSU this morning.  As we finished we stopped at a fruit stand and
bought some mangos and cantaloupes for breakfast.  I gave Mae a hair cut and
colored her hair.  I then went to town and bought new tires for the car.  While
downtown I paid the phone bill.  We ate lunch and then I drove out to President
Cabuyaban’s and visited with him about his farm.  We talked about the
possibility of raising rabbits for the meat.  He went with me and we visited a
carpenter shop in his area about building me doors for our cabin, and also
about building a table for Nida Valenton’s massage therapist office.  I left
him some plans for the table and he will get the price back to President Cabuyaban. 
As I was returning home it started to rain hard.  I took a nap and then we ate
some supper.  We decided to go visit President Neito, but found that he was not
home.  Mae suggested that we visit the Corpus but I felt that we should visit Roger
and Heidi Sylvia.  When we got there, Roger said that Heidi had told him that
we were going to come and visit them this evening.  We visited with them for a
while, mainly about their church callings.  We were sure glad that Mae had been
inspired to go visiting and that  was inspired to visit the Sylvia’s.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning.  It had rained hard yesterday, but it was very warm and
humid today.  We had several text messages when we got home, which slowed us
down.  Sister Gajonera came over about 10 AM and visited with us about Joslito
and Maritess’s wedding.  His parents, aunt, sister and President Gajonera went
out last night to try to visit with Maritess’s parents, but that didn’t go very
well.  The father just became even more angered.   I told her that we hadn’t
heard back on the direction from President Brimhall and advised Joslito and
Maritess to just go a head with their wedding plans without the consent of her
father.  She said that is the way Joslito feels and is sure they will.  She
also asked if it would be possible for her to come over on the 10<sup>th</sup>
and bake an anniversary cake for her husband.  It will be their 3<sup>rd</sup>
wedding anniversary on the 11<sup>th</sup>.  The 10<sup>th</sup> is Election
Day here and we have been told that on that day we were not to leave the house,
so it would be a good day to have company.   I worked on the computer and Mae
worked on Primary, then at 4:30 p.m. we had a sandwich and then went to
President Neito’s as we had an appointment with he and his wife at 5:00 p.m. 
Mae visited with Sis. Gena Nieto about Primary and I visited with Pres. Nieto
about enduring to the end and magnifying our calling.  Mae was able to get us
an appointment to meet with he, his counselors plus their clerk and executive
secretary for this Friday night at 7:00 p.m. at his house so I can give them my
“Interviews” presentation.  He was not at the District Branch President’s
meeting in Guimba when I gave it to the other branch presidents in this
district.  Mae is pretty aggressive these days.  Afterwards, we went over to
visit the Corpus family.  The father and daughter were there, but Susan was at
the Palanki working as a meat vender.  We visit with Tatae Corpus and Joy and
then he said if we could wait, he would go and pick up Susan.  We did.  Mae
tried to visit with Joy, but Joy doesn’t understand nor speak much English. 
Mae was getting worried about what else she could say, when Joy excused herself
and came back with some photograph albums.  That saved the day as we all looked
at the photos and commended about them.  Soon he and Susan came and we visited
with all of them for a few minutes.  They are a neat family, just wish they
would be more committed to the gospel.  We came home and worked on our
presentation for Baler, finding pictures, scanning them and working on the
Power Point Presentation.  It was late when we got to bed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t
wake early enough to go walking this morning.  I got a call from Brother Noel
Delosanto at the P. B. O. regarding the maps I have asked for several months
ago of the Guimba District.  He said that he thought they would be here this
week.  Mae worked on the computer most of the day.  I got some of our Mannatech
put into capsules.  We went to San Jose to return the conference tapes to
President Apao and sent some blanks tapes with them asking that he duplicate
the conference onto them.  We did some grocery shopping as we will not be able
to go shopping on Monday as it is Election Day here in the Philippines.  While
shopping a Pilipino couple approached me and said, “Elder Browning, do you
remember me?”  I had to omit that I did not remember him.  They are Bishop
Graspe and his wife Lea of the San Jose 2<sup>nd</sup> Ward.  We visited with
them for a few minutes.  They may call us to give a Fireside.  After returning
home we ate and then I worked on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke up at
5:00 a.m. and hurried to get ready to leave by 7:00 to pick up the 4 Munoz
Elders down in the town, where they have recently moved, so they could ride out
to Guimba with us and then we would go on to Paniqui for the District
Development Meeting.  We enjoyed visiting with them on the way.  They are
squashed in like sardines in the back seat, but they say it is much better than
riding in the jeepnies, plus it is free.  We enjoyed being with the Paniqui
Elders at their meeting also.  President Brimhall was also there to interview
the Elders and spoke to them about doing a pilot program.  We went over to the
Baiola’s afterwards to see if Noemi had the medications she needs.  She doesn’t
have the one lotion so we told them we would get it for her right away.  We
then went to visit Sister Nida Valenton to see if she had the prices for her
Business plan.  She was happy to see us, but very embarrassed because she has a
little Nipa Hut, and she couldn’t invite us in because it was too hot in there
and too small and she doesn’t have a fan.  She felt bad that she couldn’t and
also that she didn’t have food to offer us.  She said “When I go to your house,
it is big and nice and you serve me food.”  She is such a special lady.  Mae
hugged her and told her that it doesn’t matter, that we loved her and Heavenly
Father does too.  She told her that it isn’t the size of the home that matters,
it is love that makes a house a home, and she had lots of love.  She started to
cry and hugged her back.  She got a couple of plastic chairs and we sat there
in the small area she had in the shade.  She did have the figures so we will
figure it up and present it to Elder Hyers tomorrow.  In the afternoon, I
worked on the budget, the business plan for Sister Nida and then sent an e-mail
to President Brimhall concerning some questions which President Nadada had
talked to me about there at Paniqui.  President Nadada arrived just as we were
getting ready to leave.  We really had to chuckle as he came on his
motorcycle.  As he took off his helmet, he said “Wow! This heat is terrible; it
is going to drive me crazy.  But the thing that was so funny is that he was
wearing a coat along with the helmet.  We see this over here all the time that
they are wearing coats as they drive their motorcycles and trikes.  We guess
they figure the wind is to hot to blow against them, we guess, but we don’t
know.   I then took a nap.  Mae made brownies to take tonight and we left at
6:30 p.m. to go to President Neitos to give the Interview training with him,
his counselors, clerks and the YM President.  It went well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went to
Guimba this morning and helped the Hyer’s set up for their workshop on
employment.  There were only 2 people that were there at 8 AM, but they
continued to come in until we had almost 25 to 30.  Sister Nida Valenton came
but I didn’t feel she really need the work shop so I took her out side and
worked with her on her business plan.  I guess only time will tell if she can
pull it together.  We broke at noon for lunch and went over to Cindy’s for
lunch with Elder and Sister Hyer.  We enjoyed visiting for the few minutes.  We
went back to the church and had about ½ of the class return.  Mae and I stayed
until about 2 PM and then we came home to get some rest.  We tried to reach
someone in the Paniqui 1<sup>st</sup> Branch to find out if they wanted us to
give a seminar on Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching this evening but we could
not reach anyone.  We stayed home and rested.  President Mercado and his family
came over and brought me a training DVD for Branch Clerks.  Mae worked on the
family letter.  I prepared dinner and then did up the dishes.  We got several
rain storms this evening.  They are quite hard when they come.  I guess we are
in the rainy season, although we think this is earlier than it was last year. 
The weather is very hot and we mainly stay in the bedroom with the air
conditioner.  President Brimhall had called me this morning to let me know that
the First Presidency had given permission for Joslito and Maritess to get
married in the Catholic church and then go that same day to be sealed in the
Temple.  I visited with Joslito and he said they would go to the Temple on the
15<sup>th</sup> and be married and sealed and then the next week to have a
civil wedding by the Catholic Priest.  He asked if we could attend the wedding
on the 15<sup>th</sup>.  I called President Brimhall this evening and he said
that was ok with him.  We will try to do that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We arrived at
the Paniqui District center by 8:30 AM for meetings with the 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch.  There was a young American there that looked like a missionary, except
he didn’t have a badge on.  We told him so and found out that he was a
missionary here and went home shortly before we got here.  He and two other
x-missionaries from the Philippines and 2 other boys just came back for a
visit.  It was fun visiting with him.  Mae and I went into Primary and did most
of the Primary together.  We hope the leaders are gaining something from us.  I
visited with the Branch Presidency after the block meetings while Mae visited
with the Primary Presidency.  I felt much better with the Branch Presidency
this week.  When we started for home, Mae had received over 6 texts wishing her
a Happy Mothers Day.  She had received some before we left home this morning
also.  It was 3 PM before we got home.  We got something to eat and then laid
down for a nap.  I only slept for a few minutes when stomach problems woke me. 
This evening we read from the novel “Lifted Up”.  David called and talked to us
for about an hour.  It was mainly to wish Mae a Happy Mothers Day.  We sure
enjoyed visiting with he and Shauna.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 6:30 AM.  Shortly after we got up the cell phone rang just once.  It
wasn’t hard to guess who that call was coming from.  President Cabuyaban calls
that way and then hopes that I will call him back.  He has been doing some
research on rabbits and the possibility for raising them for meat and a
profit.  I will figure out a time to get with him.  It is encouraging that he
is thinking of how this idea can become a reality.  We can’t go very fare from
the house today as it is Election Day and Americans may not be safe.  President
Brimhall asked us to stay around our home, especially this evening.  At 9AM we
got on the internet with Sandi.  Jeff and Gail got on about 9:30 AM, and then
Scott got on.  Sandi and Jeff had left the conversation and we visit with Scott
about buying the house.  We were about to sign of when JaNae got on.  Scott
stayed on for a while and then we visited with JaNae until almost 11 AM.  It
was a wonderful experience visiting with our family.  President Gajonera’s and
his family came over.  Lorna had Mae help her bake a cake and ice it.  The cake
is in honor of their 3<sup>rd</sup> wedding anniversary.  I put the DVD of
Bambi on for their son to watch.  After they left we ate dinner and then I got
on the computer and balanced our bank statement.  At 3 PM we went over to
President and Sister Mercado’s for a Birthday party for their son Lagrande.  I
mainly visited with Roger Sylvia and President Gasmena.  He is 2 years old
today.  We came home and shortly after Brother Sylvia came over and checked out
the Anti-virus program on our computer.  Just as I started to discuss another
problem, Ronald Dator came.  I asked the two of them about hooking up our
speakers to the VCR and also to our projector.  They showed me how and Ronald
also went to town and bought me the cables I need to do it.  We have some good
friends here.  This evening Mae and I read from the book “Lifted Up”.  It is
really a good book and we have a hard time putting it down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning.  Mae got on the internet and received some messages
and sent some.  She had problem with the computer being so slow that it took a
lot of time as she tried to send e-mails.  I therefore cleaned the C drive and
then ran the Defragmenter program.  After doing so, the programs ran much
faster.  While waiting for these programs to run, I had time to capsulate some
of my Mannatech product.  At 6 PM Eliaza &amp; Eva Gajonera, and Girlie, their
cousin, came over and they and Mae made a Texas cake and iced it.  We watched
some pictures and then watched the first of the film “How Rare A Possession.”  
Mae and I had to take them home as the jeepnies have quite for the night.  When
we got back home, we watched the last of the film.  I entered my journal entry
before we retired for the night.  We used the projector to view the pictures
and the film.  It makes the viewing very nice.</span></p>

went walking.  When we returned the phone was ringing.  It was Elder Clark, to
let us know that Elder and Sister Maharry would not be going with us Saturday. 
I next got a call from Noel Delosantos from the P. B. O. informing me, that the
maps of the Guimba District that I have been waiting for, had arrived and he
would send them to me by way of President Mercado.  We ate breakfast and then
Sister Mercado, President Mercado’s mother, came with Mae’s dresses she made
for her.  We spent quite a while working on a presentation for Baler Branch. 
This evening we attended the Young Women mid-week activity, for the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
branch.  We got on the internet and got a couple of e-mails.  We were up late
reading from the novel we have got involved in.  </span></p>

went walking at the collage.  We came back home to shower and eat breakfast.  After
we started working on the computer, which took most of the day.  Sister Mercado
came with my two pair of slacks that she made me.  I really like them.  This
afternoon we drove to San Jose to do some shopping.  As we drove Mae read from
the book “Lifted Up”.  After buying our groceries and going to the car, I
decided to purchase a roasted chicken.  The young man selected the chicken and
then cut it up.  I do not know where the Filipinos learned to cut up chicken,
but they use a meat cleaver and chop it up into small pieces.   When we
returned home we continued to add pictures into our computer files.  We are
establishing quite a large file of Church Pictures that we can easily access
for use in our training presentations.  President Gajonera and his family came to
visit with us, asking for directions to Clark Air Force base.  Before going to
bed, we finished reading the book.  We spent some time getting a suggested
program for the training at Baler, to Elder Gouch.  We asked him to visit with
President Go about the training program.</span></p>

Guimba Chapel and then we went back to visit President Cabuyaban.  He paid us
P1,000 but is having trouble doing that.  I don’t know if he will get the loan
paid back or not.  We attended The Guimba District Development meeting.  From
there we went out to Paniqui.  We stopped at Cindy’s and had lunch and then
went over to the District Center to the Youth Conference.  As we came in the
parking lot President Mercado visited with me and ask if I would except the
call as 1<sup>st</sup> Counselor to President Cabuyaban in the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch.  President Brimhall is the one that recommended the calling.  Things
are always changing.  I will be sustained on Sunday.  We are concerned about
the training we had planned on doing for the Paniqui 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  We
attended part of the multi-district Youth Conference.  When we came home we
went straight over to San Jose where we bought two wedding gifts.  Sister
(Mother) Mercado came just as we got home.  She had Mae’s dresses, a slip and a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went to
the temple with Joselito and Maritess this morning and it was wonderful.  Trying
to get to the Temple I made a U-turn in a area that was no u-turn.  I didn’t
see a sign, but as soon as I made the turn four officers stepped out to stop
me.  We were able to talk them out of giving me the ticket.  Joselito asked
that I be one of his witnesses.  Some of the branch members went also, so that
was great.  They took some of their youth so they could do baptisms for the
dead, but they had not arranged for it previously with the temple, and there
was a tight schedule so the youth were not able to do the baptisms.  That was
sad since they came so far and were really looking forward to it.  The branch
president thought Joselito had made the arrangements when he made arrangements
for his temple wedding, but he didn’t.  We can understand why he didn’t.  We
left at 4:00 am, picked up Elder &amp; Sister Clark at 6:00 and we arrived in
Manila at 8:00.  Dad made really good time as it usually takes us 5 hours to go
that far.  The wedding was wonderful.  The sealer was Filipino so we couldn’t
understand all of it, but he spoke in Tag-lish so we got quite a bit.  When he
asked them to kiss over the alter, they were both so shy that it wasn’t much of
a kiss.  They are a great couple and we’re sure they will be very happy.  They
have gone through a lot and their faith has been tried, but they made it and
we’re so proud of them and happy for them.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Dad
and I had a little problem, however, as when we went to show our recommends to
the temple worker, they had expired.  Somehow, we had it in our minds that they
would last us throughout our mission.  Dad said that Bishop Walker said we
wouldn’t need to get another recommend until we came home, but even if he did,
we should have noticed the dates and we would know that two years had been up. 
We met with the president of the temple, he called President Brimhall and they
let us in.  We had talked with this temple president the other times when we
were here, so he knows us, but said he usually doesn’t make exceptions.  Oh
boy, we goofed, but thankfully we were able to go in.  We went out and had
pictures with them and then came back in and went through a session.  We then
went to a near-by Jollybee for lunch, and went back to go through another
session.  Elder &amp; Sister Clark had planned to meet some Elders on the 2pm
session, but they didn’t show up.  They were the returned missionaries, coming
back for a visit, that we told you about in our last letter – Elder Stone and
his friends.   Anyway, we will meet early with President Brimhall on Tuesday
morning to get a new recommend, before leaving to go to Manila again with the
other missionary couples.  Bro. Sagun, the counselor in Guimba branch 2 has
asked Dad to be one of his witnesses at his temple marriage on Tuesday, so
that’s special.  We love this young man also.  He is a returned missionary and
has been practically running that branch single handedly.  They are planning to
live in Guimba, so we’re happy for that.  After getting home I called President
Brimhall and asked him if we could wait until next week to install me in the
Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch Presidency, as we already have appointments set up
with Panique 1<sup>st</sup> Branch for some training there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                This morning
we went to the Panique 1<sup>st</sup> branch to do training there.  I told the
Branch President of our change in assignment and let him know that today would
be our last day with them.  He was very disappointed for that.  When we went in
to the Primary we got tears in our eyes to see the changes in Primary after the
training Mae gave them last week.  The primary president and her counselor had
been preparing all week and Primary was practically like it is in Utah, today. 
The president had come early, set up chairs in rows, and had wonderful opening
exercises including 2 children giving talks.  Her counselor wanted to give the
lesson prior to sharing time, and since all the children are ages 8-11, it was
fine.  We were so proud of the counselor, she gave an excellent lesson, doing
all the things it called for in the lesson, had wonderful visual aids, came
early and wrote special points on the chalkboard, had eye to eye contact with
the children and had great participation.  Dad &amp; I needed to leave, after
the lesson, to go to YM &amp; YW and I hadn’t had a chance to tell the
president that we had to leave, so I motioned for her to go to the adjoining
room with me and after I told her, I complimented her for all she had done. 
She hugged me and cried and said that after the training, she wanted to do it
the way the prophet has asked us to.  She said that no one had trained her
before and she didn’t know that she was supposed to do these things.  (I don’t
think they understand the General Handbook of Instructions when they read it
themselves - they need to have someone go over it with them).   She said, “Oh
Sister, can I show you the “Sharing Time” materials my daughter and I have
made, before you go?  She had gone through all her old Liahona’s and cut out
the visual aids for Sharing time activities, mounted them on heavier paper, and
did all the things they required.  Her oldest daughter helped her and they had
fun doing it.  I was excited.  I’m sure they will do great now.  They are so
humble (teachable) and sweet.  I will miss them, the children, and all the
wonderful people in that branch.  After meetings, Mae met with the YW
Presidency and I met with the YM Presidency to do some training.  Mae’s
training went quite well.  I was surprised when I went to give the YM
training.  They are all young men under 18.  Two are priests and one is a
teacher.  I gave them some training, but will need to talk to the branch
president and tell him, the boys can’t be the YM presidency; they can be the
quorum presidencies, but not the YM’s.  Mae also wants to talk to the branch
presidents about having a married sister be the YW president.  These single
adult sisters are wonderful and would make excellent counselors, but they need
the maturity and experience of a married sister.  Practically all the branches
have single adult sisters as the presidency.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning.  After getting home, Mae cut my hair and then we
took our showers.  We were still getting breakfast when Marlyn came.  Marlin
also came over and washed our car.  We got on the computer at 9 AM but none of
our children were on.  Mae worked on the family letter and then about 9:25 AM
Mike got on with us.  At 9:30 AM Sandi got on so we visited.  Mike left in a
half hour so we continued with Sandi, then as we were about to get off with
Sandi, Scott came on.  We enjoyed visiting with all of them.  Sandi is still
having a rough time with Terry’s passing.  Scott has been busy with work so
they haven’t done more on the house yet.  Sandi is having a hot tub put in next
to her patio.  Terry’s sons Troy and Kyle have also put in a sprinkler system
for the lawn that will sure help her.  When Sandi left we continued to visit
with Scott.  Mae went back to work on the family letter and then got back on
the internet to send it.  Jeff saw her on and they visited for a while.  Jeff
told us that the bike was going to cost over a thousand dollars to repair, so I
told them to let it go for parts.  The bike has set for almost three years and
that wasn’t good for it.  I just worry about the car, truck and snowmobiles. 
By then it was dinner time.  I did get two naps in during this morning.  This
afternoon was spent getting ready to go to Manila in the morning and Baler
Thursday morning.  Time went fast.  It is sure hot and humid so we spend most
of the time at home in the bedroom with the door shut, as it is the only room
with AC and without insulation in the houses, the air leaves fast.  I was able
to meet President Apao at the Stake Center in San Jose and get the conference
tapes he had made for me.  It has been raining most of the evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
3 AM and left at 4:15 AM for Clarkfield.  We got there by 6:00 AM.  We had
interviews with President Brimhall for new Temple Recommends.  Elder and Sister
Clark went with us to the Manila Temple.  We went through Sealing of Roberto
Sagun and His brides marriage.  Elder &amp; Sister Clark went on a endowment
session with Elder &amp; Sister Hyer and Elder &amp; Sister Maharry.  Mae and I
went out for pictures and a Wedding breakfast.  That was really nice.  They had
a large group attending the wedding and many more attending the wedding
breakfast.  We then went over to the distribution center and bought some Church
supplies.  Mae also had ordered special embroidered temple envelopes for all
the children &amp; spouses, plus her and I. They are beautiful.   Mae met the
lady &amp; paid for them, plus 3 nativities from another lady.   It was a
little confusing getting everyone together, but we all went to the Holiday
Hotel where we had rooms reserved.  Our room was on the 27<sup>th</sup> floor
and we had a wonderful view.  This is a beautiful hotel.  Thankfully, it only
costs us $58.00 because we live here and have a Filipino driver’s license,
otherwise, it would be about $150.00.  This evening we went to the Manila Hotel
for dinner.  It wasn’t just dinner, it was “fine dining”.  Elder &amp; Sister
Hyer made arrangements for us to have a van and driver for tonight and
tomorrow.  The hotel is on the waterfront and so there were ships in the harbor. 
It was dark so we couldn’t see the ocean very well, but it was still neat.  The
grounds, fountain and gardens were beautiful.  The food was excellent, but just
us and another couple were there.  Soon the other couple left.  They had a 5
piece orchestra playing for us that were very good.  They played up on the
stage, but soon came down to our table and serenaded us.  They asked for
requests and they could play anything we requested.  It was wonderful.   We
enjoyed dancing to their music.  The Hotel was very elegant .We were then given
a tour of a gallery that had a lot of history of the Hotel and famous visitors
who had stayed before.  This is where General MacArthur had his suite.  The
host took us through a honeymoon suite and another suite for dignitaries and
then took us into MacArthurs suite.  It was beautiful.  They had left the
furniture and furnishings as it was then, along with the pictures on the walls,
lamps, etc.  It looked like someone was living there.  It had a huge picture of
General MacArthur on the wall behind his desk.  We took pictures of our
husbands in front of the picture.  We went out onto the balcony and it was a
beautiful view.  It was great to be there.  We got back to the hotel about
11:30 p.m, but it was a wonderful day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We arose at 5:45 a.m. and met
the Hyers, Clarks and Maharrys for breakfast.  The breakfast is paid for with
the price of our rooms and it is wonderful – a buffet with all kinds of
breakfast foods.  The chef makes omelets for us or cooks eggs anyway we want.  
After breakfast, we drove to the PBO where we met the driver again and climbed
into the van and we were off to the Bazaar.  They have this bazaar once a month
and all the ladies at the PBO and Temple and other missionaries in Manila, plus
other places go there.  We have been once before.  The men are not too crazy
about this idea, but the women love it.  Mae bought wooded grandparents toys
(to stay at our home for the grandchildren to play with when they come to
visit.) plus she bought toys, etc., for the grandchildren.  We then went out to
the war memorial.  There were 55,000 white crosses and some stars.  The stars
were for the jews who were killed in the war and the crosses for the
Christians.  These were all Americans who died in the war.  We felt like we
were on holy ground with the blood of all these Americans in the navy, army,
air force or marines.  They had acres and acres of land as it used to be a
military base.  The grounds are beautiful and many people are hired to take care
of it.  They have a beautiful monument with all the names of those who were
killed in action craved in beautiful stone walls all around a huge circle.  In
the middle of the circle is another monument.  We took lots of pictures.  I am
proud to be an American and proud of what America stands for and how these men
and women gave their lives for their country and for freedom.  From there we
went back to the PBO where we split up and the Maharrys rode with the Hyers to
go home and the Clarks rode with us.  After dropping off the Clarks at the
Mission Home, we stopped at the duty free stores for Mae to get some more
brownie mixes and cake mixes.  We stopped in Tarlac at McDonalds for something
to eat and arrived home about 8:30.  It has been raining pretty steady since
Angeles.  It got really heavy in Guimba and the rest of the way home with lots
of thunder and lighting.  We were beat, but Mae put things away while I entered
what we spent on our budget.  It was about 11:00 p.m. when we got to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It was about
6:15 AM when we got up and started packing to go to Baler.  We left at 9 AM and
stopped for a minute in San Jose.  The road that we always take out of San Jose
was closed and it took us a while to find a alternate rout.  The roads were wet
and muddy and it seemed rougher than we remembered but we made fairly good time
and got to Baler at 2 PM.  We checked in but there was no power through out
Baler, but it came on about 3:30 PM.  We enjoyed a short nap.  At 4:30 PM we
went to the meeting house and others came right after we got there.  President
Go told us, when he got there, that the power was off because they had failed
to pay the power bill and hadn’t receive a notice.  We met outside on the porch
and had enough light to do fair.  We had planned on having the Elders Quorum
Presidency and the Relief Society Presidency there, but we had President Go,
his 1<sup>st</sup> counselor, and ½ dozen sisters there.  We did some training
but it wasn’t quite what we had planned.  The 1 counselor in the Elders Quorum
finally came.  When it got dark, we quite and closed the meeting.  We gave the
1<sup>st</sup> counselor in the branch presidency a ride home.  He lives 7.6 kl
from the church house and said there are three other families that lives out
that far but can’t afford to come to church.  I was rather discouraged at the
way it went.  Mae took the sisters and she did fairly well.  </span></p>

AM and couldn’t go back to sleep.  Mae slept until almost 7 AM.  We went
walking on the beach and enjoyed that.  The day went fast and I soon went up
for the training of the branch clerk at 2 PM.  Power still wasn’t on and
President Go needed to go make some copies, so I waited.  I fell asleep
waiting.  President Go informed me that the clerk couldn’t be there until 4
PM.  I went back and had some lunch and returned with Mae.  We really didn’t
get started with the clerk training until 4:30 PM, so that put us behind on the
other trainings.  The training did go well with all three groups.  Mae felt good
with her trainings also.  I didn’t finish with the training until 9:30 PM.  At
9 PM I asked President Go if we wanted to stop and he said that we should
continue with the training.  The Elders stopped in during the evening to see
how it was going.  I visited with Elder Gooch about the possibility of a Basic
Unit in the area north of the large bridge.  He will try to get some
information on that area.</span></p>

got up at 5:30 AM we had to hurry in order to pack and check out and be at the
Church by 8:30 AM.  Some members soon got there but President Go didn’t get
there until 930 so we waited for him.  The presentation went well, we had
President Go give the opening address.  The Elders quorum president gave a
short talk taken from the First Presidency and the R.S. President gave a short
talk from the Visiting Teaching message.  Mae and I then gave a presentation
using the computer and projector on the need to sacrifice.  We broke up the
group and went out Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching.  Mae and I went out
with them.  After 1 ½ hours we all came back to the church and reported on our
visits.  It really went well and they had a good time.  We had the Elders buy
some treats for us to have when we got back together.  We then showed the video
“How Rare a Possession”, we had a lot more come during the film.  Before going
home Mae wanted to go down to see the ocean once again.  We left Baler at 3:30
PM and got home at 8:30 PM.  We were tired and had to unpack when we got here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We attended
meetings in the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  During the Sacrament meeting I
was sustained as the 1<sup>st</sup> Counselor to President Cabuyaban.  I was
asked to talk during the meeting.  After Sacrament meeting President Mercado
set me apart in my calling.  Mae then went in to Primary and helped there.  I
went in to Sunday School during which President Cabuyaban gave the lesson
because the Sunday School teacher didn’t show up and the Sunday School
President doesn’t feel that he can. Also during Priesthood meeting the Elders
Quorum President didn’t show up so I conducted and President Cabuyaban gave
that lesson.   After the block of meetings, I helped with the recording and
counting of the donations.   We then took a break and Mae and I came home.  Mae
had me take a short nap while she prepared some dinner.  I picked up President
Cabuyaban on my way to the church.  He said he wanted to take a nap, but his
children wanted him to play with them.  We had a short Branch Presidency
meeting.  Then we held a P E C meeting at which only the President of the
Sunday School and the Full time missionaries came.  That meeting went quite
well, although I think I talked to much.  President Cabuyaban met with the
Relief Society President and went over some welfare items.  While he did that I
met with the District Young Men President, Norberto Carpuz, and we discussed
some training that is coming up and also went over the organization of the
Young Men Aaronic Priesthood program.  He felt that I helped him a lot.  President
Cabuyaban, Brother Norberto Carpuz and I went over to visit a family that the
husband is very sick and dieing.  It was 8 PM when I dropped President
Cabuyaban off and came home.  Mae had been on the internet, so I couldn’t call
her to let her know that I was on the way home.  It has been a very interesting
day.  While we were visiting, flying bugs came in from every where.  Norberto
explained that they were termites.  It is the migratory season for them.  When
I got home Mae said that she heard something that sounded like rain on our
bedroom window.  When she pulled back the drapes she saw all these flying
bugs.  I explained to her what they were and we remembered them from a
year-a-go.</span></p>

President Cabuyaban to send in the weekly reports and make the deposits.  When
I got back the Land Lord was here trying to repair the kitchen area chandelier
as it came lose from the ceiling and almost fall to the floor, but was stopped
by the electrical wiring.  Mae and I went to San Jose and did some shopping. 
We ate at Jollibees while there.  We like to go upstairs to eat so that we can
watch the traffic of San Jose.  It is really quite amusing.  After getting home
we put the groceries away.  I cut up two chickens, hoping that Marlyn will not
cut it up smaller.  I worked on our budget until I became frustrated and gave
up.  I entered my journal and we went to bed.</span></p>

breakfast for the Munoz Elders, Elder Bas, Elder Jenson, Elder Ebanza and Elder
Holberg.  They came at 8:30 AM.  We enjoyed having them and visiting with
them.  We made plans to go on Monday Evenings with them to have a Family Home
Evening with selected families.  After they left we read a letter that Shellie
sent and some pictures that she had prepared for us.  It was good to find out
why she hasn’t e-mailed us lately, her computer is not working.  I took a nap
and Mae worked on organizing our pictures.  I started a presentation on the Aaronic
Priesthood Organization in the Branches.  I needed some pictures of a Branch
Presidency, for the presentation, so we visited the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch
Presidency.  It was good to visit with each family.  We think it is quite cute
that we are often referred to as “the couple”, as we go around.  The children
enjoy gathering around us and try to talk to us.  They get very excited when
Mae ask them their names in Tagalog.  The people also really like to have their
pictures taken and are always asking for a copy.  As our printer doesn’t do the
best in printing pictures, we try to send them a copy by e-mail if they have a
address.  When we got home Mae prepared a light super of cottage cheese and
toast.  We worked on the picture organizing for a couple of hours before going
to bed.</span></p>

pressure.  It was a little high, but not to bad.  We went to San Jose to make
our bank transactions and to pay our water bill at Aqua Soft.  When we got home
I took a short nap, while Mae made us a lunch.  We left for Guimba shortly
after 11 AM and went to the Dr. Office to pay for Nomi’s visit, but the
receptionist was out to lunch.  We then met President Cabuyaban and visited a
brother that gave us some pepper plant starts.  President Cabuyaban gave us
some pechay starts and some squash seeds.  We met the Relief Society President
and the Employment Specialist and went visiting families that are growing
gardens as a preparedness program.  We were able to visit six families as well
as President Cabuyaban and give them some plants and seeds for planting.  It
was a good experience to be with these two sisters and visit the families.  We
stopped at the Dr. Office again but they had no record to the last visit, so we
didn’t pay them.  Sister Cabuyaban got sick last night and didn’t feel good
today, so President Cabuyaban didn’t go visiting with us.  He also canceled the
Branch Presidency meeting for tonight.  We came home and the power was off, so
it was hot.  We were hot and tired so we laid down and rubbed each others feet
and tried to take a nap, but it was to hot.  Mae got up to get a drink and
found that the power had came back on.  After turning on the A/C we took a nap
for a couple of hours.  We then stayed up until mid-night.  Mae worked on her
training for this week end and I worked on a new budget program.</span></p>

late last night so didn’t go walking this morning.  I woke shortly after 5 AM
anyway and didn’t go back to sleep.  We attended District Development meeting
with the Guimba and San Jose Districts.  We are always impressed with the
Elders and the great job that they do.  We went in with the San Jose Elders as
we don’t get to see them very often.  We were very amazed with Elder Cropper,
who has only been out 3 to 6 months.  I didn’t think he would make a very good
missionary when he first came out and we were so impressed with him and his
great abilities and knowledge.  President Brimhall was here interviewing the
Elders.  We both wondered if he wanted to interview us, but he hasn’t had the
time in the past, so we left.  He called us later and said he would have liked
to visit with us, so we will see him tomorrow.  Elder Clark called and they
will not be able to attend District Conference with us this weekend.  We were
disappointed as we were looking forward to having them stay with us.  I got a
new budget table set up that should make it a little easier to keep track of
our budget.  I finished developing a presentation on the “Organization of the
Aaronic Priesthood and Young Men’s program.”  I will have President Brimhall
review it tomorrow.  I am hoping that it will be simple enough for the leaders
here to understand the program. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 5
AM but let Mae sleep until 6AM.  I then found out that she had stayed up until
11 PM on the inter-net.  I should have let her sleep longer but we had to pick
up the Munoz Elders at 8 AM for San Jose / Guimba District Conference. 
President Brimhall’s opening talk was on the Dispensations of time and
apostasy, Sister Brimhall spoke on Guidance and Obedience.  Both gave
excellence talks.  The conference lasted until 3 PM and then President Brimhall
met with Mae and I for a short interview.  He also watched my presentation on
the Aaronic Priesthood Organization.  He liked the presentation and wanted a
copy of it that he might use it in a meeting tomorrow morning.  After taking
the Elders home, we stopped by the Dr. office to get Mae’s blood pressure
taken.  They were closed for the day.  We think that the reason that it was
high the last week, is because she hadn’t been taking her medication.  The one
thing we found is that her medication is working.  When we got home I sent the
presentation to President Brimhall by e-mail.  We got a e-mail from Mark
telling us that Bob was operated on and had a hart bypass due to 5 arteries
being blocked.  He was in the operating room for 5 hours, but is now doing
better and they will know more tomorrow.  We appreciate Mark keeping us
informed.  President Cabuyaban called and wants to hold a Branch Presidency
meeting this evening.  We met at 6 PM for a couple of hours and got a couple of
things discussed.  I feel that our meetings need to last longer and we need to
do more towards visiting and getting priesthood holders active.  One thing
about it, we have only one way to go, because we are about as low as the branch
can get.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning.  We visited a gentleman from Mapal that is here
studding plant science at CLSU.  When we got home we visited with Ed, our
neighbor, and set up a evening on the 11<sup>th</sup> of June for the neighbor
to get together for a evening.  Marlyn came this morning to work as she didn’t
come yesterday.  We were still getting showered &amp; preparing breakfast. 
Brother Norberto Corpuz, the District Young Men President came at noon to see
the Aaronic Priesthood Presentation.  We also invited him to eat lunch with
us.  He commented that we had enough food for ten people on the table.  After
lunch we did get a nap in.  We both did some work on the computer this
afternoon.  At 2:45 PM we went to the Munoz chapel for District Conference
meetings.  Elder Edgardo Fernando of the Seventies is the visiting General
Authority with President and Sister Brimhall also on the program.  We took our
fans, overhead projector and screen to the church for use this evening.  The
AP’s helped us by using the mission van.  It was 8 PM before we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                District
Conference was held this morning.  We were about late because I filled out the
“Branch Organizational Reports” and printed them off for the District Executive
Secretary.  President Mercado’s opening address was good.  President And Sister
Brimhall both gave excellent talks.  A sister from Guimba 3rd Branch gave a
talk and Sister Fernando gave talks but they were mainly in Tagalog so I
understood very little.  Elder Fernando gave a very good talk and really gave
some straight information for the members to consider.  There was fair
attendance until you realized the membership that should have been there.  We
stayed for the meeting with new members held after the main meeting.  I helped
Mae get some dinner started and then I laid down and took a nap.  After lunch I
went out to Guimba, picking up President Cabuyaban on the way and we held P. E.
C. meeting.  After the meeting President and I went visiting.  We visited the
Mother of the only missionary that is out from the Guimba District.  We then
visited two brothers and their families.  This is where I am really having
problems with not speaking the language as well as not knowing the people.  We
also stopped to visit a mother that has a son that is mentally sick and is
killing people.  Because of his mental condition the police can’t hold him in
jail although that is where they have him now, but unless someone files charges
they will have to let him out.  The family doesn’t know what to do with him as
there are not facilities for the mentally ill here in the Philippines.  We took
some medication into the jail for him at the request of the mother.  The pills
are costing P100 per day and that is what the mother makes a day.  We then took
a letter to the R. S. President, and then visited a family that the church is
helping with welfare.  I explained that the policy of the Church is not to give
the recipient of assistance cash, but to have the R. S. President of the Branch
President pay for the items.  She accepted that answer and apologized for
feeling bad towards President Cabuyaban.  President Mercado wanted to visit
with me this evening but I was to late getting home.  Mae and I visited for a
while and then ate some fried chicken and toast.  I filled out my journal and
we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking although we were still tired.  At 6 AM the power went off and we
were without power until almost 6 PM.  We were glad that we had put some water
in storage as when the power is off, we are without water also.  We had to
shower out of a bucket, but at least we had that water.  President Cabuyaban
came at 6:30 AM with the financial reports.  He told us that as he had to leave
early he tried to slip out without waking his family.  As he went to leave,
Iven called out “Daddy didn’t you forget something?”  to which he asked what. 
“You forgot to give momma and I a kiss.”  Iven is about 3 years old.  After
breakfast we got on the instant messaging with Scott.  He is the only one that
got on with us today.  We talked for about an hour when the battery went dead
on the computer and shut us off.  We had tried to find out if the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch Relief Society was still planning on the baking class today.  We finally
had to drive down to Sister Monta’s house.  Her phone had lost it’s charge and
without electricity she couldn’t receive the calls.  They still want to come. 
I brought Mae home for her to get ready.  I got her some groceries from the
store in Munoz, and some LP Gas.  I then went to San Jose to mail some things
at LBC and had planned on getting the rest of the groceries at CVC, but CVC
couldn’t get their generator to run so had to close the store.  I did get some
large nails and got my boots repaired.  Both pair needed the heel replaced.  Mae
had 10 sisters here.  They had a good time.  I went over to President Gasmena’s
to turn in the Branch reports.  This evening we went over to the Tobias’s home
and held a FHE with them.  Thanks to Mae, that went well.  We got home at 9 PM
quite tired.  We are glad to have the power back on and running water.</span></p>
