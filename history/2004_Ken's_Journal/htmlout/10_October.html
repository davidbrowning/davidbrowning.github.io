<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I was up at 3
AM and couldn’t sleep so read, prayed and tried to compose a letter.  At 5 AM I
went into the front bedroom and went back to sleep, until almost 7 AM.  Mae
woke then so we got up and showered.  Neither of us really feel to good so I
called the ZL’s and told them that we wouldn’t be at District Development
meeting.  We went back to bed but the phone soon started ringing.  Marlyn came
and started the house work when the power went off.  It was off for a couple of
hours.  Sister Mercado came and visited with Mae.  When the power came back on
I started composing a letter about my concerns about the use of the Tagalog
language usage in the church meetings.  I worked on and off throw out the day
on that letter.  We went over to San Jose to take the VHS tapes to President
Apao so that we could get a copy of the Semi-Annual General Conference that
will be broadcast this weekend.  We also took some material to the book store
to have copies made.  Mae has worked most of the day on preparations for
tomorrows District Leadership Training meeting.  She will be helping out with
that.  We had Tony stop us over some sandwiches for dinner this evening, on his
way home.  They are sure struggling to keep their business open.  With Mae’s help
I finished my letter and then not knowing who else to do with it, send it to I
sent it to President Brimhall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
but not feeling well brushed my teeth, gargled with salt &amp; vinegar water
and went back to bed.  Neither Mae nor I have felt well.  I have also had some
bleeding when using the bathroom.  I think it is just hemorrhoids as I have had
that before.  We had the ZL’s come over and gave both of us a blessing.  Mae
was busy all morning preparing for the district leadership meeting this
afternoon.  I helped her some.  We were at the leadership meeting from 12:30 PM
to 5:30 PM.  When we left we went over to Tony’s and had dinner.  We enjoy
visiting with Tony and Alyn.  We spent the evening putting things away.  Oh, I
took our media system to the training so the district Presidency could us a
couple of power point programs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We attended
meeting at the San Anton group, taking with us Sister Monta from the District
Relief Society; Brother Silvia, President and Sister Gajonera, of the Branch
Presidency; President Gasmena, from the District Presidency; and Brother
Corpus, from the District Y. M.  The meeting was well attended with a total of
44 in attendance.  We came home and I took a nap while Mae prepared for Primary
sharing time.  We ate lunch and took water as we didn’t feel it would be wise
to fast while we are sick.  We attended the block of meetings with the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
branch.  Mae did some training after meetings and I attend Branch Council
meeting.  I then visited with President Gajonera and Brother Sylvia for a few
minutes after.  They are struggling for active priesthood leaders in this
branch.  Our neighbor, Ed, visited with me for a while when we got home.  Mae
took a nap while I warmed up some dinner.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
as neither of us feel well.  We were still showering when Marlyn came.  We ate
some breakfast and then got on the instant messaging with our children, Mike,
Jeff and Sandi.  Sandi was only on for a few minutes when someone came and she
had to leave.  Jeff and Mike were on quite a while.  We were going to play
Harts, but we couldn’t get the Game Room to open for us.  We rested today and
this afternoon we watched the DVD “Johnny Lingo” also the new version, and
enjoyed both of them.  We went to Tony and Leah’s this evening and had F.H.E.
with them.  Alan had the lesson prepared on the “Atonement” and did a very good
job.  Leah wanted to visit with Mae about Primary.  She recognized that Primary
is not functioning well and wanted some advice.  She is being asked to help
with Primary.  She is really way ahead of most of the Primary leaders even with
out a Handbook of Instructions or a lesson manual.  My big concern with Tony
and Leah is how they will handle the problems that exist in the branch.  We
were late getting home but had a wonderful evening.  We are still not feeling
well, so I hope it wasn’t a mistake to go out tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 6 AM then got up and got ready to go.  We went to Tony’s and ate
breakfast before going over to San Jose for District Conference.  We met
President Apoa as we got to the Stake Center.  He had the conference tapes
recorded for us.  It was a good conference.  After the conference we went
grocery shopping.  I went down to pay our phone bill but they were closed.  I
got gas in the van and came home.  Ed, our neighbor, was out as I went to close
the gate so we got talking.  I gave him a prayer we had received over the
internet.  We visited for a while and Joey came so we visited a while longer. 
I warmed up some dinner.  I am not sure if we are getting tired of Marlyn’s
cooking - Filipino food, or whether it is that Tony is spoiling us on his
cooking, but we are liking the Marlyn’s food less all the time.  That is bad as
we still have four months and ten days left, but who is counting.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4:30 this morning so we could be off to Tarlac at 5:45 AM.  We stopped at
Tony’s and got some sausage for President Brimhall.  We met the Hyer’s and the
Maharry’s at McDonald’s in Tarlac at 7:30 for breakfast.  When we got to Clark
Base we still had some time so we went to Rock Bottom where I bought a CD with
a cover that has an AUTOCAD program on it.  I will try it on my computer and if
I like it I will buy a program.  We thought our meeting started at 10:30 so we
stopped and ordered some picture frames.  On the way to the mission office we
received a text telling us that it was to start at 10 AM.  We made every one
wait and I feel bad for that.  However, when we apologized to everyone, Sister
Brimhall said that it was supposed to start at 10:30, but since everyone was
there, (they thought), they decided to go ahead and start at 10:00. We had a
wonderful meeting as we met with President and Sister Brimhall as couple
missionaries.  It was 4 PM before we left for home.  We had wanted to go to the
S. M. Mall to take our camera in for repair, but I didn’t feel well so we came
home.  Mae drove part of the way letting me rest.  It was 7 PM before we got
home.  I entered some on the budget, ate some soup, entered my journal entry
and went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I have been
sick all day.  We did set up the projector and watched Saturday morning and
afternoon sessions of General Conference.  Mae seems to have a never ending
energy to go, that just keeps her going no matter what.  I commented that I
would like some potato salad, so she went to work and made some for me.  We got
a nice letter from Mark by email.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I have again
been sick all day.  I did get up and drive Mae to the book store for some items
and them to the bank where I cashed the check from advancing P2,000 to
President Baccay for Sister Balthazar.  We then went to the phone company and
paid our phone bill.  Tony came by a couple of times today to see how I was
doing and to bring us some soup that Leah made for us.  Mae has kept going but
did lay down a couple of times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, October 09, 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did get up
and get ready and went to San Antonio.  We picked up Sister Lorna Gajonera and
her sister to take them and some items she needed to go out.  Just about there
we got a text message from Sister Monta, asking where we were.  She was at the
highway waiting for us.  Lorna texted her husband and ask him to pick her up. 
After Sister Monta arrived I apologized that we hadn’t picked her up but didn’t
understand when we had said that we would.  She said that we had texted her
last night and said that we would meet her on the highway.  I ask Mae if she
had texted her?  When we realized that Lorna had used Sister Monta’s cell phone
to text us a message and Mae later responded to Lorna’s message, but it was to
Sister Monta’s phone.  There was no power at San Antonio so we were not able to
set up and show the Relief Society Conference.  The branch had a cleanup
activity anyway and spent most of the day there.  Mae and I came home and
rested.  I got a nap but Mae got several phone calls.  We called had had the
car wash come and get out car and wash it for us.  We watched the Relief
Society Conference, it was very good.  Our power went off this afternoon.  One
of the transformers in our area blow out.  Tony and Alan brought us some
hamburgers for our dinner this evening, on their way home.  Shortly after they
left the power was restored.  We sent a email to our family and then I set up
the equipment and we watched “Brigham Young”.  Although we have seen it several
times we still enjoy that movie.  Mae put things together for lunch tomorrow
while I made my journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We set up and
played the Sunday Sessions of General Conference at the Munoz chapel at 10 AM
and 2 PM.  There was a small attendance at the morning session and much smaller
in the afternoon.  Conference was so good and I had hoped that more would have
felt the need and the privilege to attend, but it wasn’t so.  Oh well, we
tried.  We did enjoy being with Tony, Leah and Alan as they attended the full
day and ate lunch with us.  Sister Balthazar came to tell us that President
Baccay has been trying to get me by phone to talk about the P1500 that we
advanced her.  We are not sure that President Mercado is going to approve that
payment.  Mae has quite a headache this evening.  I thought she would come in
and take a rest, but she needed to make a call and 1 ½ hr later she finally got
off the phone.  Most of the calls were incoming calls, but she didn’t get her
rest.  I got on the internet mainly checking to see if Sister Brimhall had
answered Mae’s letter, but she hadn’t.  Mike sent us some photos and they are
great.  We looked at them for sometime with amazement as to how much the
children have grown up.  We also shed a few tears of homesickness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 6
AM and did my studying.  Mae slept until almost 7 AM before she got up.  Mae
gave me a hair cut.  After breakfast we got on the instant messaging with Scott
and Jeff, as we finished it was Mae, Mishelle &amp; Gail, but it was good to
visit with them.  We left at 9:45 AM and went to Elder and Sister Clark’s.  We
took some lunch with us and they had more ready when we got there.  We drove to
Dingalan Bay.  We drove down by the ocean to see it and to see how well the van
drove in the gravel there.  We got the van stuck but it didn’t take much to get
it out.  Elder Clark thought that the van had positive traction, but it
doesn’t.  We drove around until we found the trail that goes up the mountain to
some water falls.  Three young men offered to be our guide and carried our
lunch for us.  It was just a nice hike to the falls.  The trail was well
maintained and a very beautiful easy hike.  There were covered eating tables
when we got there.  We really enjoyed the hike, the meal and especially the
company.  The young men were very helpful and friendly.  As we drove back to
the Clark’s we decided to take a trip to Bellaire on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
of November.  We sure enjoy being with the Clark’s and are going to miss them
when they leave.  We left their home at 6:30 PM and got home at 7:30 PM.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke and
got up at 5:30 but let Mae sleep until 6 AM.  We prepared breakfast for the
ZL’s who came at 8 AM.  After eating we held a correlation meeting.  After they
left we read the scriptures.  We then were both tired and decided to take a
short nap.  We slept for 1 ½ hours, which is really unusual for Mae, but I
guess we needed it.  We spent the rest of the day working on the computer. 
David wrote us a nice email.  It was good to hear from him.  I spent most of my
time working on a presentation for Elders Quorum Presidents, trying to get
ready to visit Alvin Pelion tomorrow evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning.  We are out of shape, having not walked for almost
two weeks.  As we came down Executive St. we saw the wife of the Assistant Dean
of the collage.  She visited with us telling us that next month they are going
to take a trip to see their children and will be gone for 1 ½ months.  Her
husband will retire in two years and then they will build just across the
street from where we live now.  She said that they will have three bedrooms. 
One for her and her husband, one for their daughter and we could stay in the
third if we come back to visit.  She was cute.  After breakfast we got on
instant messaging with Jeff.  Mae made some other contacts while she had the
internet up.  That took most of the morning.  I was on the computer all
afternoon working on my presentation for this evening.  Mae attended the
mid-week activity for Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> branch but was back at 6:45 PM so I
could meet President Gajonera at 7 PM.  We then went to Pilien’s where we
visited with Alvin concerning his calling and responsibilities as Elders Quorum
President.  It went quite well but his concern was their new baby.  I didn’t
give him any out as to his duty.  President Gajonera is quite discouraged with
the branch and feels he should be released.  I tried to encourage him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning and really enjoyed it except we were tired and out of
shape.  This morning passed fast.  Part of the reason was that we went to
Tony’s for breakfast and visited quite a while with him while there.  This
afternoon I worked on a presentation and after a couple of hours and having it looking
quite well, lost my work because of not backing it up.  That didn’t make me
happy.  Roger Sylvia came over and helped me install an AutoCAD – 14 programs. 
He then wanted to talk to us about his feelings of the branch.  He is quite
discouraged with the way things are going in the branch.  I told him that
President Gajonera said the same thing last night.  We hope that we can give
them some help that might make things better.  We were on the computer until
after 11 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and got ready to leave.  We left for Paniqui District Development meeting
at 7:45 AM.  When we got there no one had the key to the building.  Someone
borrowed it from the ZL’s and didn’t return it.  We were almost a hour late
starting.  The meeting went well.  I was impressed that as all the Elders
assembled they had arranged that we set around a large table.  That was much
more affective that meeting in class room style.  President Brimhall text me
and asked if we had the reading glasses with us.  We stayed to see President
Brimhall and give him some glasses.  He had President Nadado and I stand in
with him as he set a new missionary apart.  We got something to eat at Cindy’s
and ate it on the way as we had another appointment with Elder and Sister
Swenson at 1 PM.  We arrived at the Guimba Chapel at 1:05 PM.  Elder and Sister
Swenson, Elder and Sister Larson, who are on a special mission as water
experts, Brother Garcia and his son, and President Baccay, along with Mae and I
went to the area North of town where the families live across the river.  We
showed the Swenson’s and Larson’s where we are recommending that a well be put
in to provide drinking water.  Whether or not it will get approved or not is to
be seen.  We used our SUV to cross the river for there were still several
inches of water flowing down the river.  After leaving there we went back out
to the 3<sup>rd</sup> branch area where Mae visited with two Sisters that are
in the District Primary Presidency.  From there we stopped and visited Rodelio
Cabuyaban for a few minutes.  It was 7 PM before we got home.  I had to change
the batteries in our day planner and this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> time I have
been successful in doing so without losing memory.  I then down loaded the
pictures from the camera and had to correct some of the names in order to keep
them in proper sequence.  While I was entering my journal entry Mae fell
asleep, so I let her sleep.  I played a few computer games before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and went to Paniqui to the District Relief Society Craft Day.  We had
some concerns, for we had heard that they were going to sell items.  We
understood that according to the Church Handbook of Instructions, that there
can not be items sold on Church properties.  Elder Hyer told me that President
Oaks had indicated that it was approved here in the Philippines.  There were
some items sold.  Mae also purchased a vase and flowers.  I don’t know the
answer.  We enjoyed the showing of the crafts and enjoyed being there with the
Hyer’s and the Maharry’s.  We went out to lunch together and enjoyed being with
each other.  We have planned on a couple’s trip the last of December.  We
stopped at Tony’s on the way home and picked up the curtains Leah sewed up for
us to darken the windows when we use the projector.  After getting home we took
a nap.  Mae didn’t sleep log and got up and wrote to our family.  When I woke I
spent the rest of the day and evening working on training presentations. Mae
made a nice tuna casserole for dinner and a chicken and rice casserole for
tomorrow.  Sister Brimhall called and in the conversation the craft fair was
brought up and we think it got miss-interpreted.  We hope that it doesn’t case
problems but we don’t understand the instructions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had to
change alarm clocks as the one we have been using isn’t too reliable lately. 
We had to hurry as we had to pack the car with the media equipment to show the
General Conference Session at Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> for all the Guimba
branches.  It went well except we didn’t have a member of the District
Presidency there to conduct.  The Elders had seven converts that were baptized
last night that should have been confirmed today but that didn’t happen as the
2<sup>nd</sup> branch presidency didn’t show up.  I took Mae to San Anton on my
way to Guimba.  She had to speak in their meeting.  She then road with
President Gajonera back to the church and then attended the 1<sup>st</sup>
Branches meetings plus did some training.  I got back, after showing the
morning session of conference, and took a short nap and then went down to the 1<sup>st</sup>
branches Priesthood meeting.  I then trained the Young Men’s Presidency, well
the President and 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor.  That went quite well.  We came
home and got something to eat.  Mae had made a chicken and rice casserole last
night to warm up today and it was sure good.  Mae is beat so laid down and took
a nap.  She finally got up and had prayers with me and went right back to bed. 
I stayed up a little while.</span></p>

temperatures were cool, so we really enjoyed it.  We went down to Tony’s for

his place on Saturday.  We got on the instant messaging with Scott, Mike and
Jeff.  After getting off with them, Mae stayed on the internet until noon.  I
took a nap.  This afternoon I did some learning on the AutoCAD.  Jeff sent us
the floor plans to our home in Wyoming so maybe I can do a little work on
them.  President Mercado and Sister Mercado came over for a few minutes to ask
if I would try to visit with some of the prospective missionaries in the
District.  This evening we went to the Newingham’s for F.H.E.  Boy do they like
to talk.  I don’t know if we taught anything or not.  We were late getting
home.</span></p>

to use on Saturday.  Time sure goes fast.  We got a text from Brother Cabuyaban
indicating that he had been assigned by President Mercado that he was to go
with me to visit all the potential missionaries.  That is not the way I
understood that President Brimhall wants me to do it.  He wants me to show the
branch leaders how to do it.  I therefore wrote President Mercado an e-mail
expressing those concerns.  I had also received a call from Elder Mortenson
about some concerns that members have about the care of the building at
Guimba.  I passed those concerns on to President Mercado.  We were late going
to bed, and then Mae didn’t go to sleep, so got up and worked on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
2:15 AM and found Mae was still up.  I got her to come back to bed, but she
still didn’t go to sleep for a while.  I got up at 6 AM but let Mae sleep in. 
I showered and read my scriptures, and then I studied on the AutoCAD program. 
Some of the instructions aren’t too clear and frustrating.  Mae got up at 10 AM
and we ate breakfast.  I worked on our budget and we aren’t doing were well.  I
figure we are short about $155.  I went over to San Jose and cashed the check
for next month.  While there I bought some electrical wire for putting up the
Christmas lights, got my boots repaired and bought our groceries for the week. 
Mae worked all afternoon and into the evening on her presentation for next
Saturday.  I did some more work on the budgets and entered my journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were able
to go walking this morning.  We did some planning and work on the budget, but
most of the time was spent on Mae’s presentation.  We scheduled to go to Baler
to attend the Branch Conference there with President Montemayor.  I also asked
President Baccay if we could schedule time next week to start visiting
prospective missionaries.  Mae decided to shower this evening, so I thought I
would study the AutoCAD program for a few minutes.  I had a problem and wanted
to visit with Roger Silvia about it.  Mae is upset with me because she is
afraid that Roger will think I am not a very good missionary.</span></p>

stopped to visit Sister Villanueva but she wasn’t home.  She had gone to visit
her daughter in Manila.  We came home and ate.  Mae went visiting this
afternoon with Sister Lorna Gajonera and Sister Monta.  I worked on my personal
history and a presentation that I have been wanting to work up.  This evening
we attended a branch social with the 2<sup>nd</sup> branch.  After the party,
we stopped at Roger &amp; Heidi’s for a few minutes.  Mae typed some Primary
materials when we got home.  It was after 10 PM when I entered my journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today has
been a very busy day.  Tony brought Leah by this morning and she road out to
Guimba with us.  Tony asked me about the possibility of help from the church on
a loan to relocate his restaurant as they are not making it where they are.  I
told him that the church would not do that, but that there might be other ways
to work something out.  I took Mae out to Guimba chapel so she could attend the
District Relief Society convention at which they displayed crafts.  I came back
to Munoz and gave some training to the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> branch Elders.  As
I left I noticed that I had some messages on the cell phone.  They were mainly
from Mae asking me to get her Missionary Badge.  She had forgotten it this
morning.  I also stopped at Tony’s and got some sandwiches to eat as we drove
out to Paniqui.  I picked Mae up at noon from Guimba and we drove to Paniqui
where Mae and Sister Brimhall gave leadership training to the Relief Society,
the Young Women and the Primary Presidencies.  They booth did very well and I
enjoyed staying in the meeting and lessoning to them.  We got back to Munoz
just in time to meet Brother and Sister Pelion at Tony’s restaurant.  We waited
for his counselors and his secretary to come.  His secretary came but the
others did not.  Tony served us a nice chicken dinner.  We then came back to
our home and discussed the responsibilities of and Elders Quorum Presidency. 
Just as we were concluding with the training, President Brimhall called me and
asks about the possibility of speaking tomorrow in Paniqui.  He said not to
rearrange our schedule if we had other commitments.  I said that we did have
other training and he said that was ok.  After I took Brother &amp; Sister
Pelion and his secretary home, I called President Brimhall back and talked to
Sister Brimhall, told her to let him know that we would plan on being at the
conference.  I then worked on a talk.  As Mae was ready for bed, we realized
that we needed something from the car.  As it was late I decided to just use
the key to unlock the car so it wouldn’t beep and wake the neighbors.  Well,
that was a mistake.  It sets the alarm of and when I hit the lock button it
beep twice and then started the alarm again.  You have to use the unlock button
to shout it off.  I am afraid that before I got it off I woke the whole
neighborhood.  It was mid-night before I got to bed.  Good night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
about 6 AM and got ready to leave for Paniqui.  The traffic was terrible, not
with heavy vehicle but with having to watch for people doing stupid things. 
There was people pulling out in front of you with out stopping or looking,
pauli (rice) being spread out all over the roads for drying.  That wouldn’t be
quite so bad except they are laying logs, boards, rocks tools and everything or
anything so you can’t drive on it.  Add to that the goats and chickens that
walk on the pali to eat it.  It reminds you of the computer games where you
drive through a obstacle course, the only difference is this is real life and
you can’t push restart and go again.  Even with the craze drive we made it in an
hour and 15 minutes.  We were ½ hour early for the District Conference, so that
gave us time to shake many hands.  The members really enjoy having us shake
there hands and speak to them with a good morning greeting.  Many of the
sisters will give Mae a smelly hug.  By 9:45 AM the building was filling and by
starting time it was full.  To sit on the stand and watch all those beautiful
Brothers and Sisters is a wonderful experience.  Of course we are given a
beautiful ribbon of flowers for the men and a beautiful corsage for the
Sisters; we are treated as though we were General Authorities.  The District
choir is wonderful and beautiful. All the Sisters wear matching blue dresses
and the Brothers are in white shirts and dark slacks.  I enjoy watching the
choir director who is very precise in his direction.  It is just a wonderful
experience being there.  I really felt honored to be a speaker in such a
meeting.  We left directly after the meeting and got to Munoz at 1:10 PM.  I
was amazed at our travel time, both ways, because I have never made it any
faster even when the congestion on the roads is not like it is now.  We enjoyed
the Primary children as they presented the program today.  Mae was the
concluding speaker and she did a wonderful job with her talk.  At the
conclusion of the block, I stayed and gave the Branch Presidency some
training.  They are a good Branch Presidency and I hope the training will help
them.  Mae had came home after the block meetings and then came back to get
me.  We ate some dinner and then we simply collapsed.  I had to put some pillow
under me in order to lie down after eating, but went right to sleep.  Mae got up
and wrote to our family.  She was coming to bed when I woke.  I got up and made
this journal entry before going back to bed.  This had been a busy week but we
seem to be blessed with the energy to keep going when it is required.  I am
really amazed when I think of the speed that President and Sister Brimhall go,
along with the responsibilities that they have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I let Mae
sleep in so we didn’t go walking again today.  We fixed breakfast and tried to
get on instant messaging but couldn’t get a dial tone.  I started checking
things out and found the extension line to the bedroom was broken.  I took the
computer into the kitchen and hooked in there and got through.  Mike, his son
David, Jeff and David got on with us.  We enjoyed the visit.  I repaired the
phone line to the bedroom.  Elder and Sister Hyer came over just before noon
and we went out to Tony’s for lunch.  We enjoyed visiting with them and enjoyed
Tony joining with us.  They brought us back just before 3 PM.  As they left we
realized that we had not brought the keys to the house with us.  We were able
to get the gate open but not the house.  We drove to Marlyn’s and got her key. 
We then picked up Sister Lorna Gajonera, went back home and unlocked the
house.  That is the first time we have done that.  I stayed home and Mae went
visiting a Sister that is having her 83<sup>rd</sup> Birthday.  I worked the
rest of the day putting up the Christmas lights outside. When Mae got home we
got ready for Sister Mercado and their two children to come for dinner and
FHE.  That went quite well.  When they went to go home, the trike driver didn’t
come so I took them home.  Almost two weeks ago their son was in the car which the
Gasmena’s had just got and I guess they were just about in a accident.  Every
since then this child, who is about three, is petrified to ride in a car.  He
screamed all the way home.  It really made you feel bad that he would be so
scared.  Tony brought me some sausage on his way home this evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up but did go walking for a few minutes.  We met a couple that we often
see walking and this time we walked the same direction so visited while we
walked.  It was interesting for they had on jackets to keep warm and we were
sweating with just a shirt and blouse.  They also commented that many at the
collage said that we walked H.H.W.  We didn’t understand what she meant and
when we asked, she said with a smile, Holding Hands while Walking.  While Mae
and I were walking I was expressing some of my concerns about the leadership
and wondering just how and what we should be doing.  Also I was a little upset
that they don’t call back when we ask them for a schedule.  Well when we got
home President Baccay texted me and asked if we could go visiting this evening
and Thursday evening.  I texted back and told him “Yes and he had just maid my
day”.  We had to hurry to get ready for the Zl’s.  The power went off just as
we got home so that didn’t help.  They came for breakfast and correlation meeting. 
After correlation meeting I sent a text to President Mercado about the
missionary application forms.  He texted back and said he would get them.  I
took a nap, and then we worked on finding Gail some information out of my
journal concerning their wedding.  I met with President Baccay and Brother
Roberto corpus at the Guimba chapel.  We went out contacting prospective
missionaries.  I think we did some good although we only contacted 4 young men
and we think we got them thinking about it.  We also visited the mother of the
one missionary that is out in the field now from the Guimba District.  I was
very glad that we had the new vehicle to do this visiting for both places its
clearance and purpose was needed for the roads were very poor.  He will be home
the middle of November.  It was late when I got home.  Mae had got on the
internet and had received a couple of letters from Scott and a letter from
Shellie.  It was good to hear from them.</span></p>

late to go walking.  We left for Angeles about 7 AM but only got a little ways
and realized we didn’t have the cell phone.  I went back and when we got back I
realized that it was in my pocket.  Things just haven’t gone very well this
morning.  We almost decided to stay home.  Traffic was terrible and that set me
off.  Mae got upset with me and it just went that way most of the day.  We did
get done what we needed to and returned home.  We had to leave our camera at
the shop where we bought it.  I guess they will send it back to the factory and
get us a new one.  When we got home our neighbor came over and we visited a
while.  I worked on our budget for a while.  Mae didn’t feel good so laid down
and went to sleep.  I am having some problems with the computer being slow and
not closing files.  I’m not sure what is going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting started this morning as I didn’t sleep very well.  We did go walking at
the collage.  We met Maria and her husband as they were also walking together. 
We visited a few minutes with them.  As there is a school break now, he and the
children have a little free time.  Maria said that her children have seen us
walking and told them that they, their children, hopped that they, Maria &amp;
her husband, will walk together when they are our ages.  As we completed our
walk we go by their home so we stopped and asked if their family would like to
see the movie, “Johnny Lingo”.  They were excited and want us to come a week
from Monday.  Mae went visiting this afternoon and I went visiting with
President Baccay and Brother Corpus.  It was after 9 PM when I got home.  We
got on the internet to send an e-mail to President Brimhall.  Scott saw us on
so he got on for a few minutes.  David then saw us on so he got on for a few
minutes.  It was good to visit with both of them.  Gail had sent us a thank you
note for sending her the information from my journal about their wedding.  It’s
late and Mae is still working on her teeth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I will add in
here the story that Brother Norberto Corpus told me of his mission call.  He
said that when he filled out the missionary application form, all of his family
told him that he should not go and that if he did none of them would help him. 
He said this included even his mother, who is a member.  Only his father, who
was not a member, and who was very sick, gave him any encouragement.  His
father died right after he turned in his application.  He received his call one
week after he turned it in.  All his family including his mother kept their word
and would not help him in anyway.  His branch president paid for his medical
and dental check ups, and gave him two pair of socks and two polo shirts.  A
large Samoan Elder gave him a pair of pants.  Norberto is a very small person,
so the pants were way to large for him, but a Sister in the branch altered them
so they fit a little better.  The Mission President of the Angeles Mission,
President Black, bought him two white shirts and some garments.  Someone else
gave him a pair of used shoes and he left for his mission with his clothes in a
plastic sack, as he didn’t have a suit case and didn’t have enough clothes to
put in one anyway.  He said that none of his family ever wrote to him during
the two years he was away.  I asked him if it was worth it and he said it was
the best decision he had every made.  He also told me that as soon as he
returned home he went to the Temple for his father and did his work for him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
had to hurry to be ready and leave for Paniqui to attend District Development
meeting.  From there we went to Moncada and visited Sister Vengco and her
family.  They took us over to show how they extract the sugar from the sugar cane. 
They were cooking rice in woven pouches in the hot sugar cane syrup.  It was
interesting to see their press to extract the sugar pulp from the cane.  It was
also very interesting to see their boiler, and how they use the remains of the cane
stock for fire to boil the syrup.  They showed us how they use a palm leaf for
the weaving material and how they weave the pouches.  They are very fast and
use an assembly line to do the weaving.  We had a very enjoyable visit with
them.  From there we went to Gerona to visit President and Sister Nadado.  They
were very excited to have us come and visit.  Sister Nadado had prepared pansit
(a fine noodle with vegetables and meat).  It was very good and we ate until we
were full, then Sister Nadado insisted that we take the rest home with us.  We
visited for some time with them before we came home; they were so hospitable to
us.  Mae bought some souvenirs that Sister Nadado had made.  We will miss these
people when we leave.  The driving in this traffic will be one thing I will not
miss.  I just about go crazy by the time we drive very far.  We came close to a
bad accident as a dump truck just pulled out into the traffic and made everyone
else slam on the brakes.  The driver just didn’t care for he was the biggest. 
You have to keep alert all the time for anything to happen.  After getting home
I took a nap while Mae made a cake for Sister Gajonera’s Birthday and took it
to her.  Roger Sylvia came by and we visited a while with him.  We had him stay
and eat with us.  He helped me fix a problem with out computer and I loaned him
some videos and a DVD to use in his seminary social tomorrow.  We had a couple
of phone calls this evening that worried Mae for a call came in on the cell
phone that no one would talk on and when she hung it up a call came in on the
land line.  We even had Roger take the receiver and try to talk to the caller. 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I will add a
story that President and Sister Nadado told us today.  The Nadado’s had been
married for some time but were struggling financially.  They had six children,
when in the year 2000 Sister Nadado got an opportunity to go abroad to Russia
to work.  President Nadado at that time was the Branch President of the Gerona
branch.  He did not want Bessie to go but she insisted and especially with the
encouragement of all of her extended family.  President Nadado said it was
really hard to take care of the children and be Branch President, but he said
he needed to stay in that calling in order to keep his sanity.  He said he
asked the Mission President, President Black, to please not release him.  When
Sister Nadado arrived in Russia, attended the branch of the church there, she
was immediately assigned Home Teachers and Visiting Teachers, who were a couple
missionary, Elder and Sister Frandsen from Sandy Utah.  When they found out
that she had left six children at home they told her she needed to go home. 
She said that she couldn’t afford to go, plus her family needed the money.  The
Frandsens contacted their family and other friends and they raised the funds
for her return fare, plus money for them to buy a palay combine to help earn a
living.  At that time she was given an opportunity to accept a change of
employment with a company in England which would give her a large increase in
income, provide her with unlimited calls home, a bike and a paid trip home for
two weeks every six months.  She said that she couldn’t make the decision alone,
so went to her Branch President to ask him for his advice.  He told her that he
didn’t know what she should do, but Heavenly Father knows.  They knelt in
prayer and when they got up he told her that Heavenly Father wanted her to
return home.  She also felt that was the answer, and so she came back to the
Philippines.  She, of course, had also asked her husband and had him pray for
the right decision also.  When her side of their family found out the decision
she had made, they said that was the stupidest thing she could do to turn down
such an opportunity, and they were angry with her.  We’re sure that part of the
reason is that they expected her to give some of the money she made, to them. 
But, both President and Sister Nadado still feel that it was the right
decision.   She needed to be home to support, love and help her husband, and
teach, train, love and help her children.  They have a wonderful marriage and a
wonderful family.</span></p>

worked on presentations.  Mae went to Guimba to do some training this afternoon
which gave me time to work on the computer.  I went up to the main road at 3:30
PM to get a trike ride to the church house.  However a car stopped and offered
me a ride.  They asked me if I was lost and where was my companion.  They were
members of the church from Cabanatuan and gave me a ride to the Church.  I
enjoyed visiting with them.  I waited for the Sunday School presidency to come
but none showed up.  I waited until after 5 PM and then had Brother Marlin
Dator take me home in his trike.  Mae got home about ½ hr later.  We went to
Tony’s to eat and then went to the market to get some groceries and fruit. 
After taking Mae and the groceries home I came back downtown and filled the car
with gas.  Mae gave me a haircut and we showered and washed Mae’s hair.  I
checked the e-mail and got a reply from President Brimhall that I was looking
for.  We got a letter from Mark and a short letter from David.  He also sent a
school picture of Tyler.  The children are growing up so fast.  We miss that
experience of seeing them grow.</span></p>

feelings.  I sometimes think that I came on this mission to help her and to be
her chauffer.  We came home and I took a short nap while Mae fixed some lunch. 
We ate and then hurried to meeting at Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> branch.  I did some
training for the Sunday School Presidency after the block.  We hurried and
finished packing and went to Elder and Sister Clarks in Palion.  Sister Clark
had some soup ready when we got there, it was sure good.  We stayed with them
tonight.  We sure enjoy visiting and being with them.  They have been such good
friends and we are going to miss them when they leave.</span></p>
