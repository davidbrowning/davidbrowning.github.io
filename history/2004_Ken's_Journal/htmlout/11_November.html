<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early (at 4 AM) to be ready to go walking with Elder and Sister Clark.  We
walked for an hour and then came back to the house and showered and ate
breakfast.  We were ready and left the Clarks at 8 AM for Balar.  We arrived at
11:40 AM so we made good.  Sister Clark did get car sick and we had to make a
couple of stops.  I had Elder Clark drive so she could sit in front.  After
checking in we had expected the Elders were having us for lunch, but they said
they felt we would get a better lunch at the restraint so we ate across the
street.  We then drove over to see the large tree and we enjoyed being with the
Elders and seeing the tree.  That was the first time for Elder and Sister Clark
and the Elders.  We also stopped and visited the Phillips but they were in
America and the help were all of because of “All Saints Day”, similar to
Memorial Day in America.  However they not only decorate the vaults but they
sit on them and play games, visit, eat and drink all night.  We had to detour
around some of the grave yards.  We came home and got something to eat and then
played games with the Clarks before going to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4:15 AM so that we were ready to go walking at 5 AM with Elder &amp; Sister
Clark.  It was a beautiful morning and we walked on the beach.  We came back
and showered and got ready for breakfast.  The Elders came for breakfast with
us.  They brought fresh fruit and ice and made a bended fruit and ice drink. 
They made me one with out sugar.  After Breakfast we took a trike ride to see
and walk across a swinging bridge.  We bought some souvenirs at a gift shop and
then went to the Mother Falls.  It was quite a hike up to the falls.  There was
a group of teenagers that were also going up to the falls.  We had started
first but they soon caught up to us and we thought they would pass us up, but
they stayed with us and helped us quite a bit.  After reaching the falls and
enjoying the beauty there, we started back down.  When we had came up with
Sandi and Shellie we had seen a project that was under way to install a pipe
line from the base of the falls, down the canon to the town below.  That
project had proceeded quite well and there was now a concrete dam almost
completed across the canon to control the water flow and channel the water into
the pipe line.  The youth stopped at a shelter that the workers had built and
ate food that they had brought with them.  They invited us to stay and eat with
them but we declined.  This was Elder and Sister Clark’s first time to visit
these areas so it was very fun for them and all of us had a good time.  From
there we started for home.  We stopped part way up the mountain at a waiting
station and ate our lunch.  I had Elder Clark drive from that point so Sister
Clark could sit in front and not get motion sick this time.  When we got to the
Clark’s we stopped to eat supper with them and ended up staying the evening. 
We visited, played Rummy Cube and enjoyed the evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                The Clark’s
went walking but Mae and I slept in.  We were going to get up and leave before
they returned but they cut there walk short and got there just as we were ready
to leave.  They had us stay for a light breakfast before we came on home.  On
the way we decided that there wouldn’t be very much for Marlyn to do today,
except for some washing, so we texted her and told her she could have the day
off.  When we got home the power was off so there wasn’t any water from the
well.  Marlin Dator came just as I finished unloading the car, to wash the
car.  We debated if he could because the pump was off, but then had him use a
bucket of water we had in storage and he cleaned the car up very nicely.  We
were without power all day and found out that it was out all over the area.  We
used a bucket of our storage water and took a bucket bath.  It wasn’t the best
but it was good to get cleaned up.  We got on instant messaging with Jeff, but
the battery power soon gave up on the computer and cut us off.  It was a cool
day so it wasn’t too uncomfortable with out the A/C.  Our biggest problem was
that we couldn’t the computer to prepare for our Baler training.  I had an
scheduled training for the clerk and executive secretary at the chapel this
afternoon at 5 PM, but they didn’t come and we had no power so we called it
off.  Tony came by to get Alan from youth activity, which was called off
because of the power, and offered to stop on their way home and take our frozen
food to their place and put in his freezer, as he has a generator at the house. 
Mae was able to assemble some of her training materials, so I helped her. 
Shortly after 9 PM we went to bed.  I woke at 11:30 PM with the lights on in
the front room.  I got up and turned on the fan as it was uncomfortable
sleeping.  I also decided to make my journal entries wile I was up.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking at the collage, but made it a short walk as I ad to leave about
7:30 to go to Cabanatuan to meet with Brother Garcia concerning the well at
Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> branch.  We also visited for a while so it was 11:30 when
I got back to Munoz.  I stopped and talked to Tony and got our food that he had
kept in his freezer for us.  He is concerned as he was called and set apart as
a counselor in the Elders Quorum Presidency and he is not an Elder yet.  From
his studies of the Handbook he know that he can’t be in the presidency without
holding the Melchizedek Priesthood.  I told him to hang in and realize they
don’t study the handbook.  I took sandwiches home for lunch.  I took a nap and
Mae worked on the computer.  I then worked on my presentation until 4PM and
then hurried to get out to Guimba to go visiting with President Baccay.  We
visited about three families but I am not sure how much good we did.  It was
9:30 PM when I got home.  Mae had worked most of the evening on her
presentation for Saturday.  I filled in my journal before going to bed.  I am
having pain in my legs that is occurred several times today.  It started
yesterday.  Not sure why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We woke early
this morning but not in time to go walking.  We left for Guimba just after 8 AM
for District Development meeting.  The meeting went well and the Elders did a
wonderful job with all the training.  I was concerned about the call and
setting apart of Tony to the Elders Quorum Presidency.  I was concerned that it
was not right to call him into the Presidency with out him being an Elder yet. 
He to also expressed that concern.  However I could not find anything in the
Church Handbook of Instructions that said this could not be done, so I texted
President Brimhall asking for clarification.  He called me and asked who was
being called.  When I told him it was Tony he said it was ok and he would
approve it.  He wants Tony recommended to be given the Melchizedek Priesthood
at the District Conference.  On the way home we stopped and told Tony what
President Brimhall had told us.  We also stopped at Marlin Dator’s and left a
note asking him to stop by when he got home.  He came by before we left and I
explained that he and Tony needed some training.  I made some changes to one of
my presentations.  Nida came and gave both Mae and I a treatment.  We left for
the Clarks about 4 PM and got there about the time they got home.  We went out
to eat and it was a very good place.  When we got back to their home we setup
the projector and watched the movie, “The </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Best Two Years of My Life”. 
It was ok but I am not overly impressed at any of these Missionary shows.  I
hope our missionaries are better than what they depict.  We also viewed the new
“The Restoration” and I was not excited with it.  We were late getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4 AM and at 5 AM went walking with the Clark’s.  We came back to their place,
showered, ate breakfast and left for Baler at 7:45 AM.  We got to the motel at
11:30 AM and was able to get right into our room.  I took a nap while Mae
worked on a presentation.  We went to the church at 12:30 PM and started to set
up when we were told that the power was off.  We started with out the media
system when the power came on.  Mae visited with everyone about our missionary
responsibilities while I set up the computer and projector.  I made a
presentation then we separated with Mae taking the Sister and using the media
equipment and I trained the Brothers with the caulk board.  At 4:30 PM we
showed the movies of Johnny Lingo.  We were tired when we got back to our motel
but went over to the Bahia de Baler restraint and ate.  When we got back to the
motel, I turned the TV on and we got part of a JAGG movie that we had seen
before.  Mae stayed up a little longer, but I went to sleep.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
getting up in time to walk over to the beach for a few minutes before leaving
for church.  President Montemayor had me present the sustaining of the church
officers.  President Go presented the local officers as I could not pronounce
the names.  I helped Pres. Go with some letters.  Mae went into the Primary and
ended up doing the complete Primary.  After the block, she went to the president’s
house with the counselors and trained the presidency.  We left for home at 2:15
PM and got home at 6:15 PM very tired.  Roger Sylvia came over and asked us our
opinion of him requesting that he be released from the branch presidency.  We
expressed our feelings that we were not sure if he was right to do that.  We
suggested that he make it a serious matter for prayer.  We broke our fast and
ate dinner, we had just warmed up the left over from last night.  Being very
tired Mae went to bed but I stayed up and entered my journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning.  Mae had problems and it made it difficult for her. 
We came home, showered and made breakfast of France Toast.  We really enjoy
that as I put on peanut butter, fruit, yogurt and honey.  After breakfast we
tried to get on instant messaging with our family.  Jeff was on the computer so
we got him and found out that Utah was now on daylight saving time, so we were
1 hour early.  We waited an hour and got back on with Mike, Jeff and Scott. 
After Mike and Scott left we were still visiting a few minutes when Sandi came
on and she told us that JaNae was in the LDS hospital for test as yesterday she
may have had a seizure.  She does not remember the past three days.  As of now
the baby seems to be ok with a strong heart beat and JaNae would just like to
return home to be with Dawson.  We are concerned but glad to have received
word.  I took a couple of naps today.  Marlyn Dator washed the car for us this
morning.  This evening we took the media equipment and went over to CLSU where
we showed the original “Johnny Lingo” movie as well as showing the film
“Finding Faith In Christ” to Maria and her family and any friends, along with
several neighbors that wanted to come in.  The evening went quite well and
everyone seemed to enjoy the evening.</span></p>

walking but cut it short as we have the ZL’s coming for breakfast and correlation
meeting.  We had some companion study after and then took a nap.  Mae didn’t
sleep but got up and worked on the computer.  I compiled a letter to President
Brimhall asking about our release date and possible travel before going home. 
Mae spent much of the afternoon working on her organizational trainings; I
worked on my personal history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were late
getting up as we were so late getting to bed last night.  I went out to Guimba
and met President Baccay and Jun Romero at 9 AM.  We went visiting prospective
missionaries.  We also stopped to visit a older couple and ended up taking him
into the Doctor to have his foot checked for it is swelling and turning dark. 
While we were at their home, the dog and chicken would come in the house, the
chicken hopped first onto the cupboard and then down on the floor, back on the
cupboard and onto the table.  No one seemed to notice.  The Dr. put him on some
medication.  After taking them back to their place, we took Jun home.  President
Baccay and I then went to visit the Madas about their son serving a mission and
the well we are trying to get installed on their property.  I got home at 5:30
PM.  Mae made us some sandwiches that we ate on the way, and we went to the
Munoz chapel where I did some training to the 1<sup>st</sup> branch’s clerk and
executive secretary.  Mae worked with the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> YM &amp; YW
Presidency in visiting the youth, as no one came to activity this evening.  We
got home at 9 PM very tired.  I filled in my journal and then sent a e-mail to
the Hyer’s.  The internet was very slow so Mae stayed up trying to get it sent
and I fell asleep so Mae didn’t get to bed until almost 11 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning.  We met Maria and Chikki (Chemula or God in you in
Nigeria) as we started walking and Maria said that she would have fresh home
made bread at 2 PM this afternoon.  We went down to Tony’s for breakfast after
we had showered and cleaned up.  Tony prepared us an excellent breakfast.  We
also gave her a recipe for Mae’s Texas cake.  Today was mainly spent at home. 
I worked on a presentation I want to update.  We went to Maria’s and visited
with her and Chikka for about 1 ½ hours.  We really enjoyed visiting with
them.  We came home and had a slice of the fresh bread and it is really good. 
We didn’t eat lunch because of the large breakfast and the slice of Maria’s
bread.  I took some papers up to the book store to have them duplicated for
Mae.  I got visiting with the owner for a few minutes while there.  He seems
like such a good man and I wish we could find a way to get them back into the
church.  We spent sometime this evening, packing things that we want to be
shipped home, so we can take them on Monday to Angeles.  </span></p>

late and didn’t have time to go walking.  We stopped at Guimba at the Mercury
Drug and got medication for Noemi to take with us.  Nida was waiting there at
the Paniqui chapel to sell Mae a diamond ring.  I hope it is worth it.  We enjoyed
being with the Elders in District Development meeting.  After meeting we went
to President and Sister Nadado’s to visit.  Sister Nadado had a nice dinner
prepared for us.  We were there about 3 hours and really enjoyed out visit.  We
were tired after getting home so took a short nap before going out to San Anton
to a Branch F. H. E.  We had some confusion about who was to bring the DVD
player but Brother Damacio and I went back and got the one from the church.  We
played the original Johnny Lingo.  It was a nice evening and well attended.  </span></p>

and then got up with the phones ringing.  Mae was on the phone with Sister
Brimhall for quite a while.  I went to a missionary baptism for San Anton of
three youth that were over age and had not been baptized because they couldn’t
afford to come to church but now we have a group there they are attending.  I
went out to Guimba where I got the ring from Nida, visited with Ennie Balthazar
about possible travel at the end of our mission.  President Baccay and I went
out and visited with two potential missionaries.  The one said he would come to
church tomorrow and meet with President Baccay and start filling out his
application forms.  This evening we went out to dinner at Tony and Leah’s but
Tony and Alan didn’t get home until almost 8 PM.  We ate and visited so didn’t
get home until after 10 PM.  I felt some what discouraged for Tony is
discouraged with the way the church is going in the Philippines.  I couldn’t do
any thing except agree with him.  Mae was upset with me because we stayed so
late tonight.</span></p>

AM still concerned about the conversation with Tony last night.  I thought
about it and prayed about it.  I went back to bed at 6 AM and just got to bed
when Mae got up.  Mae let me sleep until 9 AM which only left me enough time to
get ready and go to church.  We went out to Paniqui 2<sup>nd</sup> branch. 
Meetings went well.  Mae worked with the primary which needs a lot of
training.  I visited with the Branch President and felt good at getting a
training schedule for the next couple of weeks.  The Branch President had me
visit with two perspective missionaries and they are both getting their papers
filled out.  The one young man is working with the full time missionaries and
is the Branch Mission leader.  The other, Sister Michelle Lavitoria, is 21
years old and though a very attractive young lady does not have any plans for
marriage now and wants to serve as a missionary.  I enjoyed visiting both of these
young people.  I think both will make great missionaries.  We have a full
schedule of training the next couple of weeks.  Mae trained the Y.W. leaders
after the block and I attended the P.E.C. which mainly focused on missionary
work.  Driving home was very upsetting because of so many on the road with out
lights on their vehicles or walking in dark clothes on the road.  Before
getting home I became up and when I said anything Mae got upset with me.  This
is sure a trial.</span></p>

4 AM in order to get away shortly after 7AM.  Roger Silvia was going to be here
at 6 AM to help me but he didn’t come.  I started loading everything and when
it came to the heavy box, a man that was visiting across the street came and
helped me.  Roget came right after that.  He had over slept and felt bad.  We
stopped in Guimba and gave a video to President Baccay tat the Elders from
Paniqui let them borrow for a couple of weeks.  When we got just about to
Tarlac I remembered that we hadn’t brought the large framed paintings.  That
upset me.  We will just have to bring them when we come on Friday.  We went to
the mission office where Brother David came and brought some Temple plates we
had ordered from him.  We went to the Frame shop and picked up a frame we had
ordered for the cross stitch Sister Balthazar is making for us.  We met Mr. Davies
and gave him the items we need shipped home and told him we would bring the
pictures on Friday.  We also bought a carving of Mary, Joseph and the Christ
Child, and a hand carved Chess Set.  We ate lunch at the VHS restaurant.  We
then went to the SM mall and checked on the camera, which they said is not
under warranty, so we are having them check the cost and time to get it
repaired.  We really hadn’t figured it should be under warranty but it was them
that said they would replace it.  We got Sister Clarks glasses for her and then
came home.  Traffic has sure been bad today and especially through Tarlac.  At
the SM mall we couldn’t believe the crowd that was there and as we thought
about it we remembered that there is a national holiday for the Muslims.  We
really feels that the Lord watches over us as we travel, but even then I still
get up tight because of some of the stupid things these Filipinos do.   We got
home after 6 PM and had to hurry to get to President Gasmena’s to hold F.H.E.
with his family.  It was a good evening.  We got home about 9 PM.</span></p>

up in time to go walking this morning.  We prepared breakfast for the Zl’s at 8

and then I took a nap.  I worked on my presentations this afternoon.  I also
called President Ramos to see about using his computer for the training for the
Saturday District Conference meeting.  He said that I could and wondered if I
would be using his time as he didn’t see time scheduled for me.  He will check
with President Brimhall and let me know what the schedule will be.  I went to
town and bought LP gas, paid the power bill and bought some ice cream for Mae. 
Sister Lorna Gajonera and Sister Eliza Gajonera came over to talk to Mae. 
Elisa wants to put her papers to go on a mission but is concerned about getting
a optometrist check up.  We went out to Paniqui 2<sup>nd</sup> branch and Mae
trained the Relief Society Presidency and I trained the Branch Presidency.  We
felt good about the way both trainings went.  It was 10:30 PM before we got
home and after 11 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at 6
AM and got ready to go to Guimba to meet with President Baccay, Brother Garcia,
and others to go over the project of putting in a well on the Mata family’s
farm.  After that meeting I returned home.  Mae was on the instant messaging
with Jeff and Mike.  Marlin Dator came and washed our car for us.  Elder and
Sister Clark soon came and we visited with them, and then went to Tony’s for
lunch.  Tony had prepared a wonderful dinner for us.  Leah and Kenneth were
also there to meet the Clarks.  We enjoyed the time together with them and
included Tony and his family with us.  They had to return.  Mae and I worked on
getting some pictures sent to President Brimhall that he had asked us for. 
Both Mae and I worked on our talks for Sunday.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking at the collage even though it was raining lightly.  We came home
and spent much of the morning preparing for District Conference.  I went
shopping for some groceries in San Jose while Mae worked on the computer.  This
afternoon we packed a few clothes and went to Tarlac.  We stopped on the way at
Brother Cabuyaban’s and paid for some calendars we had ordered.  We got to
Tarlac at 4:30 PM and then found out that we weren’t meeting until 5:30 PM.  We
went out to eat at the Fortune Restraint with President &amp; Sister Brimhall,
Elder &amp; Sister Clark, Elder &amp; Sister Hyer, and Elder &amp; Sister Maharry
to let Elder &amp; Sister Clark know how much we think of them.  They will be
leaving the mission on Tuesday to return home.  President Brimhall picked up
the entire bill.  After eating and visiting we went over to Elder &amp; Sister
Hyer’s and stayed the evening.  Elder &amp; Sister Clark also came over.  We
had brought some rook cards but no one felt like playing.  Elder Hyer said he
didn’t like playing games but would rather figure out how to make more money. 
Anyway it was enjoyable to visit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5 AM and soon were downstairs preparing breakfast of sausage patties, eggs,
fried potatoes and toast.  After breakfast the Clarks soon left.  Mae helped
Sister Hyer do up the dishes then we left at 7:45 AM for Angeles.  We went to
Bereditos and bought a large turkey and a few other items.  We went to the wood
carvers and arranged for him to ship quite a few of our items home.  We had to
go to the Bank and cash another $500 in order to pay the shipping cost.  We met
Elder &amp; Sister Maharry at the wood carvers so went out to lunch with them. 
It was almost 4 PM when we got home.  We unpacked and Mae started working on
the computer.  At 5:30 PM we went over to Marie’s and bought three loafs of
home made bread.  We had some for supper and it was sure good.  Mae and I
worked on the computer the rest of the evening trying to bet ready for District
Conference.  I went to bed about 9:30 PM.  Mae stayed up another hour or two. 
About the time she came to bed I got up with stomach pains and they kept me up
for a couple of hours.  I was not so sure that I might be having a heart attack
as the pain was mainly on the left side and in my left arm and leg.  I finally
fell asleep in the big chair and Mae woke me sometime before morning and I was
able to sleep in the bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
5:15 AM and went into the bathroom.  Mae woke about 6 AM and we were soon busy
getting ready for our training today and District Development meeting.  We went
to the church at 9 AM and were busy from then on.  Mae did training of the
Auxiliaries with Sister Brimhall.  With the aid of President Romas’s computer I
was able to give my presentation.  It went quite well and President Brimhall
said it was good.  I hope it will help.  I thought all the meetings went quite well. 
The last meeting ended at 6 PM, and then President and Sister Brimhall, Mae and
I went to Tony’s.  He had a nice pork dinner ready for us.  We had a wonderful
evening and meal.  It was after 8 PM when we got home.  I broke up the bread to
make dressing but there wasn’t anything else we could start for the
Thanksgiving Dinner we will have on Monday.  I entered my journal and then
worked on President and Sister Nadado’s story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 5
AM to go into the bathroom but let Mae sleep a little longer.  We thought of
asking President And Sister Brimhall over for breakfast but when I called they
had already had something.  We enjoyed having a little time before going to
church.  The conference session was very enjoyable, even if Mae and I had to
talk.  After we spoke, President Mercado asked all those that we had been in
their homes to please stand. It was very humbling and amazing when half to two
thirds of the congregation stood.  I wish we would have had time after to have
shaken hands with so many but we had to hurry to leave for Paniqui.  Tony was
sustained along with seven others to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood. 
President Brimhall was the one that ordained him after meeting.  I felt bad
that I was not there to sand in also.  We made it to Paniqui in less than an
hour and that amazes me.  It always takes us one hour and fifteen minutes to
one and one half hours to get there.  Mae’s talk there in the Paniqui 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch went well also.  We attended Primary today and enjoyed that.  After the
block of meetings Mae trained the Primary Presidency.  We were very tired when
we got home, but it has been a good day.  We called Sandi and sang Happy
Birthday to her.  It is so good to talk to her.  She says she is doing pretty
good and has some friends that were with her yesterday.  We talked to her about
½ hour.  Chelci tried out for Country Stars and was selected out of over 200 as
the 20 finalist.  She may get to go to Nashville for a tryout there.  We have
mixed feelings about that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5 AM and started preparing the turkey.  Things went well and we were able to
get everything ready for the Elders.   We also got on the inter-net for a
little while with Jeff, Mike and Scott.  It was good to visit with them.  Tony
loaned us his mixer and that made making mashed potatoes much easier.  We had a
full Thanksgiving dinner with 10 Elders, Marlin, Mae and I.  We cooked a 22.5
lb turkey with two batches of dressing.  We started dinner at 2 PM and finished
at 5:15 PM.  Instead of watching a video we became better acquainted with each
Elder and each bore their testimony of the Gospel.  Marlyn has been so good to
help us all day, along with her regular duties she help with the dinner and
after she stayed and helped do up the dishes and clean up the house.  We took
her home as it was raining and late.  While we were bearing Testimonies Marlyn
also bore her testimony and said that the Lord guided her to come home just in
time to be able to come to work for us.  She said she knows that she was
supposed to do this.  She said that she will be going abroad again after we
leave.  She said she was so grateful that she could have this experience with
us.  All the Elders were so cute and expressed thanks for the wonderful
dinner.  Their testimonies were wonderful to hear.  Elder Hatch gave a powerful
testimony and said that Joseph Smith was a Prophet and the Church is true and
that is why we are here.  We sure enjoyed being with them.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>After cleaning up we took
Marlyn home, got some gas and returned home.  We watched the new movie of
Johnny Lingo and enjoyed it again as we have watched it several times before. 
I entered my journal and did some writing in my stories but quite shortly after
10 PM so we could go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at
3:30 AM and got up for a while.  I read a couple of chapters from the Book of
Mormon before going back to bed.  We slept until after 6 AM.  We went walking
at the collage and met Maria and Chici and visited with them for a while as we
walked.  Because it started to rain we walked up to the gym and walked around
it for a while.  We came home and showered and changed and then went back and
bought some granola from Maria and of course visited a while.  We went to
Tony’s and ate breakfast and also talked to him about the business program and
the money he is trying to come up with.  I have very mixed feelings about what
we should and could do for him.  We returned the table and chairs to the church
before returning home. I worked on my presentation for this evening the rest of
the day.  I went to Paniqui 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch and gave some training to the
Young Men’s Presidency.  I just wonder how much they understand and if we are
doing any good.  It was 8:30 PM when I got home.  Mae didn’t go with me this
evening.  We sure need two computers so we can both get things done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae was so
late before she got to bed last night that I didn’t wake her in time to go
walking.  I had also got involved in reading the Book of Mormon and read for
quite a while.  We just had granola for breakfast that we had bought from
Maria.  It is sure good.  I upset Mae because of the way I looked and spoke
when she wanted on the computer this morning.  I really was just teasing her
but I was wrong to say anything.  She was on most of the morning working on her
presentation for Saturday.  I called on our camera and they said it is repaired
and we can pick it up.  This afternoon I wrote a talk for this Sunday.  This
evening Mae had Eliza and Eve Gajonera come over and she talked to both of them
and especially Eve about marriage.  We hope she did some good and Eve will
reconsider this marriage with the boy she is thinking of marring.  It was 9:30
PM when I drove them home.  Mae isn’t feeling too good this evening.  Again
this mission has another twist to it.  We didn’t think we would be marriage
counselors on our mission; in fact this mission is completely different that I
had ever dreamed of a mission being, but it is fun, I think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
got ready to go to Angeles that we might pickup our camera.  We left at 7 AM
and got to the S. M. mall just before 10 AM.  They had our camera ready and did
not charge us for the repairs.  We were going to buy a package of paper and ink
cartridge for our picture printer but we couldn’t find anyone in the mall that
carried what we needed and had to go back to where we bought the printer and
have them order it for us.  We walked around the mall and bought a few items. 
I bought Mae a poinsettia for Christmas, as she always enjoys those.  When we
came back to Angeles I got lost coming off the freeway and ended up going quite
a ways out of our way but the worst was that we got in a traffic hold up due to
construction.  We stopped at Mercury Drug and got some of the pills Mae needs. 
We then went to eat at A’LaCreMe’s which was good but not as good as last
time.  We drove straight to Paniqui where I was to do training for the Elders
Quorum Presidency at 4:30 PM.  The Quorum President and 2<sup>nd</sup>
Counselor came at 5 PM so we started.  I only got through 4 or 5 slides when I
realized that this was way above there understanding.  I tried to help them
understand what it meant to have Faith in Christ.  If I got that across I feel
that the evening was worth while.  They are so child like and I am not sure
just how much we are accomplishing.  It was 9 PM when we got home and then I
entered my journal.  Mae laid down and went right out.</span></p>

have much time but we still went walking this morning for a few minutes.  We
attended Zone Conference this morning at 9 AM until after 3 PM.  President and
Sister Brimhall were marvels as always.  Their son Brett and his wife Holly
were with them and we were impressed with them.  They spoke as well as sang a
song in Japanese, as that is where he served his mission.  We were impressed
with them also.  Tony, Leah and Alan supplied the dinner and it was very well
done and very good.  We sure love that family.  We came home after the
conference just long enough to get the computer and leave for Paniqui.  We attended
a Branch Family Home Evening for the Paniqui 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch.  It was
nice but they didn’t have any Priesthood to support the branch.  It was 9 PM
before we got home.  I entered my journal but Mae stayed up to work on her
presentation for tomorrow.  I’m tired, good night.</span></p>

read in the Book of Mormon for a while.  Mae woke shortly after 6 AM but I let
her sleep as long as she would as it was mid-night that she came to bed last
night.  We got ready and went out to Panique to their Y.W. program.  Elder
Maharry called just before we left the house this morning and said that
President Brimhall would like him to give the same presentation in the Camiline
district conference as I gave in the Guimba District Conference.  They will
come over Monday and I will give him a CD of my presentation.  When we got to
Paniqui, they were already playing volleyball.  We watched them for a while and
then I went inside and worked on a new presentation I am preparing.  I am not
sure just why I am preparing it.  Mae did some last minute changes to her
presentation.  I set things up for her and they started at 1:30 PM.  I felt
that Mae did a very good job with her presentation but without speaking Tagalog,
it is hard to say.  We did have some things we felt needed some attention in
the teaching of modesty to the Y. W.  When we got home Mae wrote a letter to
the District Young Women President addressing those concerns.  I warmed up some
leftovers for dinner.  While Mae was finishing the letter I cleaned up the
table and got the turkey bones cooking to make stew tomorrow.  Mae was tired
and went to bed.  I got on the computer and did some work on our budget records
and entered my journal entry for today. </span></p>

do her hair but let me sleep in.  We made French toast for breakfast and ate
late.  That way we could just eat twice today.  We prepared turkey stew from
the turkey bones I cooked yesterday.  We stopped at Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>
Branch on the way to Paniqui and left a schedule for training starting next
week.  I had a talk prepared for Sacrament meeting but the Primary took all the
time with their program.  This was the first time President Manuel had
conducted with a Primary program so he didn’t realize that it took the complete
time.  That was ok with me but I was prepared.  I went in to the youth Sunday
school class and was enjoying that when the counselor in the Primary came and
asked if I would talk to the Primary children.  I did and then I went into the
Y.M. Priesthood class.  That was a fun experience and I was asked to give some
thoughts a couple of times.  Mae did some more training in the primary
presidency meeting and I went into the Priesthood Executive Meeting.  It was
almost 7 PM when we got home.  I heated the stew and set the table while Mae
finished the family letter and got it ready to send.  It has been a busy day
but a good one.</span></p>

went walking this morning.  Although it looked like rain, it didn’t, and we walked
for over ½ hour.  We got home in time to shower and dress before Marlyn came. 
Marlin Dator came and washed our car although it started raining shortly after
he finished.  Mike, Jeff and Scott got on the instant messaging with us.  Elder
and Sister Maharry came at 10:45 AM.  We went out to eat at Tony’s so they
could meet him.  I gave Elder Maharry a copy of the presentation that I gave in
district Priesthood Leader meeting that was held in conjunction with District
conference.  We enjoyed being together.  Mae and I went grocery shopping after
we left Tony’s, and the Maharry’s went back home.  After getting groceries we
came home and I prepared a presentation for this evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were
planning to use my presentation and also show the video “Finding Faith in
Christ” for the Family Home Evening with the Eligodo’s tonight, but as we were
driving down the road to Bro. Deney R. Eligodo’s home and his parents, the
lights went out and we realized there was a brown out.  Since we couldn’t use
any of our technology, we went to plan B.  Mae had brought a beautiful picture
of Christ, the Family Home Evening Resource Manual, some pictures of Christ and
some handouts to give them.  I used my ball of string, which I have used
several times to show the pre-existence, earth life and the here after.  While
I was explaining that, Bro. Ronald Dator, his wife Kasanthra and his sister
Ronnalyn came.  We think Bro. Denny invited them.  I talked about the life of
Christ and Mae talked about lessons to be given during December and things to
do to make this season more Christ centered.  It went well.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Sister
Eligodo had made some delicious soup which they served us and we served the
Brownies Mae had made.  We enjoyed visiting with them, they are special
people.  Bro. Denny returned from his mission about a year ago.  He was an
assistant to the president there.  He is a remarkable young man and is now a
counselor in the district YM’s Presidency.  He is an only child.  His parents
were active in the Church, but they wanted Denny to get his schooling in before
he went on his mission.  Pres. Mercado, who is their neighbor, felt he should
go now, so talked Denny into going before, which Denny wanted to do also. 
Denny’s parents were so upset with Pres. Mercado and their son that they have
not been back to Church even though he has returned.  He was hoping we could
come and inspire them to go back to Church.  His mother was very receptive, so
we hope it helped.</span></p>
