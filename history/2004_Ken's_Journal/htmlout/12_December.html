<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t
have any power this morning but still got up and went walking.  When we came
home, we had to take a “cold bucket shower” since our power is still off and
when our power is off, so is our water.  We store water in our empty plastic
whey buckets so we did have some water, thank goodness.  I am having a lot of
pain in my neck and wish that I could get a treatment from Randy.  Mae called,
and Nida will come tomorrow and give me a treatment.  The power came back on at
10 AM.  Mae finished the reports on the potential missionaries.  We got an
e-mail from JaNae with some pictures of Dawson attached, they are sure good.  I
worked on the budget and got Decembers started.  We drove to Tarlac and went
out to eat with Elder and Sister Hyer at the Fortune café.  It was really good
but we thought it was a little expensive, and then I figured the exchange rate
and it came to less than $10.00 for the two of us.  We had to laugh at thinking
P500 was expensive.  The Hyer’s also gave us some ideas as to where we want to
tour in the Philippines before we go home.  We went to Paniqui where I gave
some training to the Branch Mission Leader.  That went well and while I was
doing that Mae attended the mid-week activity.  We got home about 8:30 PM.  I
entered my journal entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, December 02, 2004 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t feel
well this morning but got up at 4:15 to go to the bathroom.  I read 3 or 4
chapters in the Book of Mormon before going back to bed for a while.  When I
again woke I found that Mae had got up and let me sleep.  My neck and back are
really hurting and it hurt to try to do exercises.  We went walking at the
collage anyway.  It was treating to rain but didn’t yet.  As the morning went
on we got text messaging from several warning of the coming typhoon.  Even
President Brimhall called us and told us that if we were safe and dry to stay
where we are.  With that we called President Manual in Paniqui 2<sup>nd</sup>
Branch and canceled our training for tonight.  Nida Valentino came and gave
both Mae and I a treatment.  She really worked on me and I feel much better. 
Part of my problem is that I am coming down with a cold.  With the concern of
the storm we made Nida some lunch and sent it with her hoping that she will get
home before the storm hits.  Nida told us some of her experiences she is having
with trying to get a clinic opened so Mae wrote them down and they are in the
file “Friends in the Philippines 2003-2005”.  Every one is expecting that this
will be a big storm and are trying to prepare for it.  It is now 4 PM and we
are starting to get a little wind but nothing bad. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                 At 5:17 PM
we lost power and the storm is picking up.  Mae had me work on all the windows
and get them closed just in case the storm gets worse.  We tried before the
power went off to get an e-male to our family to let them know that we think we
are safe but with the storm we couldn’t get through.  The winds blow all night
quite hard but we are ok.  Mae and I set out on the porch and played rummy for
a while, using out battery operated lantern.  (I won two games)  We are sure
glad for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                No power and
the storm continued although the worst was over at daylight.  I didn’t feel
good so we stayed home, not going to District Development meeting.  I stayed in
bed most of the day.  Mae cleaned and did some packing. Tony and Leah came over
and visited and took our freezer items to their place.  We looked over the maps
we have of the Philippines and set some directions as to where we want to
tour.  We tried to play rook outside again but with out the winds the bugs came
into the light and mad it to miserable so we went inside to finish.  (I won
again.)  I was up several times through the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                There was
still no power on this morning.  We did go walking at the collage and found
lots of small branches and leaves that had blown down but nothing major.  I
still didn’t feel very well but we kept going.  We had a hard time getting
ready for our training for the Paniqui with out power and we weren’t sure just
what we were giving.  President Nadado asked that I train the Elder Quorum
Presidents in Home Teaching, so I had to put a new presentation together.  We
left without me being sure just what I was going to give.  Mae felt much the
same way.  We got to Paniqui early enough to do some work on the computer. 
Both of our trainings seemed to go well.  We are amazed at how often the Lord
helps us when we are in trouble.  When we got home the power was back on but we
didn’t have water.  I checked and ants had gotten into the switch and stopped
the contact points from touching.  I cleaned that out and it worked fine.  It
took me a while to catch my journal back up to date.  Mae made Tuna gravy with
broccoli over toast for supper.  The left shift key, on our computer, quit
working today and that is a pain.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sunday, December 05, 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
this morning and read for a while in the book of Mormon.  When I came back to
bed Mae let me sleep until 6:30.  On the way to Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> branch this
morning, we took the list of potential missionaries to the Full Time Elders in
Munoz and Guimba.  When we got to Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>, the building and
grounds were still locked waiting for someone to arrive with a key.  It was until
almost time for the meeting to start before the key came.  Brother Asuncion, 1<sup>st</sup>
counselor took charge and conducted the meeting.  President German and his
family were 15 minutes late for the sacrament meeting.  Today being Fast
Sunday, both Mae and I bore our testimonies.  After the meeting both of us went
into Primary.  The Primary was well organized and went very well.  I went into
the Y.M. during the Priesthood meeting.  I think my presence scared the Y.M.
President, for his counselors took over and gave the lesson.  The first counselor
got a lesson manual for me in English so I could follow.  I was asked to share
some feeling through out the lesson.  Following the block meetings we attended
the branch counsel meeting.  We got involved in the H.T. &amp; V.T. programs
and didn’t explain what we would be doing during this month with them.  I am
amazed at the mentality level of these people.  I do not know just how to
explain my feelings, but I believe that a Deacon’s Quorum Presidency in the
States have a better comprehension of Church leadership than do these leaders. 
I do not know if it is the language difference or the mental ability.  I become
very frustrated as we think we have explained something but then something is
said that lets you know that they do not understand it at all.  We came home
totally excused with the day.  We lay down to take a nap but Mae couldn’t sleep
so she got up and started a letter to our family.  At 4 PM we ate some dinner
and then at 4:30 Mae had the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch Primary Presidency
come for some training.  She was very tired when she finished.  As we drove the
Sisters home Mae was talking to Sister Soreano about her son who is now 12
years old and has graduated from Primary.  She said he is discouraged because
he has never been interviewed to be ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood, yet. 
How to help the Priesthood Leadership understands their responsibility, I do
not know.  When we got home we watched the video “Voice From The Dust” and
really enjoyed that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Monday, December 06, 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking although neither of us felt the best.  As we were finishing we met
Maria and Chica as they were finishing their morning walk.  We talked and got
some vegetables from the green houses there at the collage.  It is interesting
that we had seen one of the workers and had asked about buying some vegetables
and he said they didn’t have any now, but when Maria heard we wanted some she
went right over and said that she wanted some and they had them for her.  Could
it be that we are foreigners and she is Filipino?  Anyway we were late getting
back and Marlyn was already there.  We showered and got breakfast ready when
David called.  He to was worried about the new of the typhoon.  We enjoyed
talking to him and he let Tyler and Emily also talk to us.  Emily said “Grandpa,
I sure love you.”  That about broke me up and I got very homesick.  By the time
we got of talking to David it was time to get on with the other boys.  Jeff and
David got on for a few minutes then David said good bye.  Jeff asked about
getting on tomorrow as he and Gail are watching a movie so we will do that.  We
kept the inter-net on for a few minutes and Sandi and JaNae came on, so we
enjoyed visiting with them.  I took a nap but Mae stayed on and sent the family
letter.  After lunch Mae took a nap while I remodeled a picture of us, so we
can have Sister Arlene Topias do it in a cross-stitch.  We went to San Jose and
did our grocery shopping for the week.  We also bought some Christmas cards and
filled the car with gas.  While at the gas station there were a couple of young
boys that came up to the car and sang a Christmas carol so we gave them a few
pesos.  We soon had several more boys there singing but the station attendants
sent them away.  We came home and put the groceries away and then went back to
Maria’s and bought some bread and mushrooms.  From there we went to Tony &amp;
Leah’s for F.H.E.  We showed the DVD “Joy to the World”.  Leah had prepared a
chicken noodle dinner that was very good.  We sure enjoy being with them.  Tony
said that they think things have worked out on getting financing for the well
drilling project and he thinks he will be going to Pakistan the first of
January.  They feel good about it.  We were late getting home and then I filled
in my journal, the budget and prepared some Christmas cards.  Mae typed the
phone messaging that had came in today from the cell phone.  It’s late and we
have to get up early in the morning.  Good night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae is quite
sick this morning so I had her sleep in.  I got up and soon left, taking some
letters that we need to get into the mission office, to the ZL’s.  They will
take them tomorrow when they go to Zone Leaders counsel.  I then drove to
Cabanatuan and gave Jane a Christmas card with help from someone on the other
side of the World.  I did a few errorns and worked on the computer most of the
afternoon.  Mae slept a lot today so you know that she is sick.  We think it is
a virus but I also feel it is because she is feeling too much stress. 
President and Sister Gasmenia came over this evening to show Mae the program
for the Young Woman’s program they are having this Saturday.  Mae will be on
the program and if Sister Gasmenia can get her power point presentation
transferred to a CD, I will project it with our median equipment.  We had
several groups of youth come caroling this evening.  Mae didn’t need that added
stress.  We have to marvel and wonder about the Filipinos.  We just pray that
somehow we are helping them and the Church to grow.  I still don’t feel the
best.  Mae did get on instant-messaging with Jeff, Mike and David this
morning.  I sent an e-mail off to the family this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t go
walking as Mae is still sick.  We were on the computer most of the day, Mae was
working on a couple of talks while I was working on a presentation.  After
lunch Mae was on the computer while I went down town and paid the phone bill. 
I also bought some Amoxicillin for Mae to see if is will help her get feeling
better.  I finished the capsulation of my Mannatech products.  We will have
enough to last until we get home.  We sent an e-mail to bishop walker informing
him of our release date and date of arrival home.  We are getting a lot of
Carolers that come around for the money; I get a little tired of it.  Some of
them are the same ones each night and they sung the same song.  It is like the
barangay leaders that stop you on the road, by stretching a rope across the
road and want money for a barangay activity.  This is something that happens
quite frequently and I feel that I am being held up.  Sometimes I will stop and
when they lower the rope I drive through.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae still
isn’t feeling well so we slept in and did not go walking.  As the day went on I
can see that the medication we bought yesterday is starting to help Mae.  We
both spent time through the day working on presentations and training
programs.  I texted President Brimhall and asked about showing the presentation
that I have been working on about Jesus Christ, at the Mission Christmas
Party.  He said it sounded good to him.  I took some papers to have copied for
Mae.  Maria texted us, and said that the bread would be ready at 6 PM.  I went
over and got it.  Cheekie said that he received word today that his father had
died on Friday.  His father was 90 years old and died quite easily.  He just
feels bad that he wasn’t able to take his family home to meet his father before
he died.  They also said that there wasn’t any way that he could afford to go
home for the funeral.  I hope that there is some way we can introduce them to
the gospel.  They are sure a neat family.  I paid for the bread and then Maria
asked me to wait a minute.  She came back with a large piece of fresh baked
pizza for us.  Tony and Leah came to get some of the bread.  I offered to take
it down to them but they insisted that if we put it in a box it would carry ok
one their scooter.  We had several groups of youth come caroling this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t have
time to go walking this morning.  We left for Paniqui shortly after 7 AM as we
had to stop and visit Sister Emie Balthazar on the way.  She has the cross
stitch of Christ finished for us.  We asked her if she would do us another just
like it.  She said she would, so we will give this one to President and Sister
Brimhall for Christmas.  We went out to the District Development meeting.  The
Elder’s talked to us after about two of the Prospective Missionaries and some
trouble they are having about finances.  I later passed this information on to
President Nadado.  We were told that in some debates during Priesthood meeting
it was settled by saying “Elder Browning said it was ---”, that really scares
me.  That is happening with Mae also.  The counselor in the district R.S.
presidency went to President Nadado and asked a question and after he answered,
she said “well Sister Browning said we should do this……..”  President Nadado
said “well, if Sister Browning said to do it that way, then do what she said.” 
We then went to Moncada to visit Sister Vengco.  We were able to take some
pictures of the processing of sugar cane.  It is very interesting to see the
set up they have to extract the pulp, cook it and cook a rice package in the
syrup that is sold in the market.  Sister Vengco prepared a nice dinner for
us.  She also had her counselors in the District Relief Society Presidency
there and after dinner Mae gave some training to them.  I took a nap in the car
while she was doing that.  We went to Gerona and visited with Sister and
President Nadado.  We sure enjoy them and feel so close to them.  We stopped
back at Sister Balthazar’s and visited with her again about the cross stitch
and the tour we want to take at the close of our mission.  It was 8 PM before
we got home.  We had a light super and I made my journal entry.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did sleep
in, although I woke at 3:30 and read the scriptures for a while before going
back to bed.  When I got up I had to hurry to get to a training I had at the
Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch.  My training of the Young Men Presidency went
well although the President didn’t come.  I was not too surprised as last
Sunday he was petrified when I came into the Aaronic Priesthood group.  His
counselors had to take over Priesthood meeting for he would not.  Mae also had
the District Primary presidency training.  I got home just before 1 PM and ate
a sandwich before we went to the District Young Women Anniversary
Commemoration.  Mae was asked to be one of the speakers and I helped with the
media equipment.  It was after 5 PM when we got home both very tired.  After
something to eat Mae typed the phone messages.  This seems to be a daily need
as we have so many messages come in.  After she finished, I typed a letter to
our extended families and made my journal entry before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went out
to Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch again today.  President Mercado and his family
road out with us and we used the time to visit with him about some of our
concerns.  We were not able to do any training except to meet with President
German and go over some concerns.  I felt flustered at the operation of the
Branch.  It is really struggling to have any resemblance of a Church operated
unit.  I went out to the car and opened my scripture or I should say the
scripture opened to the D &amp; C 123:17 which I had underlined.  That helped
me feel better and I went back in and we attended a P.E.C. meeting.  I gave
quite a bit of counsel to President German concerning the functioning of the branch. 
Mae felt that I might have been too forceful.  After getting home I wrote
President Brimhall about my actions and asked for his counsel.  I also wrote
him regarding another matter.  He may be glad that I am going home soon.  This
evening the young children came around Christmas caroling (actually begging)
and I told Mae not to give them anything tonight.  However when they came to
our house they sand Jingle Bells in English, as last night I told them I wanted
them to sing another song and in English next time.  I had to give them
something for doing that.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We have a
practice with the Elders this morning at 8 for the skit in the program
tomorrow, so we didn’t have time to go walking.  We got home at 10 so we could
get on line with out children.  Scott, Jeff &amp; Gail were the only ones on
today but we sure enjoyed visiting with them.  While we were on with them,
President Brimhall called on the cell phone to give us some very sad news;
Elder &amp; Sister Clark’s youngest son was killed in an automobile accident on
Friday, December the 10<sup>th</sup>.  The Clark’s should have got home on the
2<sup>nd</sup> of December so hopefully they did get to see him.  They felt so
bad that they couldn’t be home when he got married in August, but now how sad
to have this happen.  Sister Baltazar called and said that she was at the Munoz
church.  We went down and visited with her about a cross stitch and the places
of interest that we would like to tour before going home.  We went to San Jose
groceries shopping and then came home and put things away.  At 6 PM we went
over to Maria and Chici’s place and had dinner with them.  Maria had prepared a
vegetable soup and pizza that was very good.  We had a very enjoyable evening
visiting with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We left early
for Cabanatuan to attend the Mission Conference and Christmas Party.  Sister
Jane Magno came over and thanked us and had a little gift so we will remember
her, she is special.  The morning conference meeting was very enjoyable with
talks from some of the Elders, then Mae, then I gave a presentation on Christ,
Sister Brimhall gave a wonderful message and President Brimhall gave a
wonderful talk on the light of Christ.  We had a very nice meal and then each
of the districts put on a skit that was quite fun.  One of the Elders from San
Jose asked me if we had lost a digital camera.  Someone there said it had been
found.  We didn’t understand just what happened but we got our camera back,
which was exciting, we really didn’t ever expect to see it again.  Just before
getting home we received a text that Maria had bread ready.  We text Tony and
he and Leah came to our place.  We took them to Maria and Chica’s and
introduced them.  We got a loaf also and when we got back home invited Tony and
Leah in and had fresh bread and butter.  We also watched the DVD that President
and Sister Brimhall gave out as gifts, The Restoration.  It was very
enjoyable.  Mae and I relaxed the rest of the evening.  We were late getting to
bed.</span></p>

5:30 but Mae slept until 6:15.  After breakfast I went down to the Zl’s and got
our mail.  The Country Creek ward Primary made us a Fall Tree poster, with all
the leafs containing the children’s names and a message.  We really like it and
put it up on our wall.  Nida came this morning and gave us treatments.  She
also brought Mae’s rings back after repairing them.  They replaced 4 of the
small diamonds that have been lost, rebuilt the settings and the bottom of the
ring where it is starting to ware thin.  The total charge we P1,800 or $33.  Mae
had some concerns about the touring we are planning on doing before we go home,
so we talked a while about that.  If I ever learn to have more patient and
understanding it will sure help.  We went to San Jose and mailed some Christmas
Cards, also we bought some gifts for tomorrows Mission Conference Christmas
party in Tarlac.  We went visiting the Sylvia’s this evening.  Sister Monta
came over and Brother Silvia and I gave her a Priesthood blessing.  Her mother
also came over and wanted a blessing so we gave her one also.  When we got home
I got on the computer and it indicated that updates were waiting so I did an
update.  It took over 1 ½ hours which made us late getting to bed.  It was
after 11 PM when I went to bed, but I needed to check out the computer before
tomorrow and enter my journal.  I also had to check the internet before going
to bed.  Roger Sylvia sent us a Christmas card by e-mail; Scott sent us a short

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I got up at
4:55 and the alarm went off 5 minutes later.  We hurried to get away by 6:30
for Tarlac.  We went to McDonald’s for breakfast and then to the Sony dealer to
have them check our camera.  They will have to keep it.  We went over to the
Stake Center for the Missionary Christmas Party.  Al the couple missionaries
spoke and I gave the presentation on Christ.  That part was very spiritual; we
especially enjoyed President &amp; Sister Brimhall’s talks.  We then had lunch
but they didn’t have anything that I could eat.  Following that each district
put on a skit that was quite good.  The missionaries have quite a lot of fun
when they are given a chance.   Gift were exchanged and then those missionaries
that will be going home in January bore their testimonies.  When we left we
went over to McDonald’s for me something to eat.  Four of the elders came there
for something to eat.  It was interesting for there were 3 American Elders and
one Filipino Elder.  The American elders all ordered large orders but the
Filipina Elder said he was still full from lunch.  We were tired when we got
home so we put things away, and then went to bed.  I entered my journal before
going to bed, also played two game and won both of those.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It has been a
very busy day and this morning we slept in until 6 AM.  We have a lot of ants
in our bedroom again.  When I started checking this morning I found that there
was a nest in the A/C.  I sprayed it heavy and killed a lot of them.  Hopefully
that will slow them down.  We were late getting to District Development meeting
but enjoyed it anyway.  We went to Camiline after meeting, and ordered Mae some
more clothes from the tailor there.  They were able to repair Mae’s dress that
she had snagged.  I thought it was ruined but was glad to see them repair.  We
ate at the new Jollibees there in Camiline.  It is better than Cindy’s.  We had
time to come home and I took a nap.  Mae lay down but couldn’t sleep.  We went
back to Guimba and met the Elders there and went to a member’s home where an
investigator was invited and we showed my presentation on Jesus Christ and then
showed the new DVD “The Restoration”.  Mae was to attend the mid-week activity,
but it was canceled for a dance at the school.  We got home at 8:30 PM quite
tired.  Mae went right to sleep but I stayed up and entered my journal.  I
didn’t take time to play a game tonight but went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning for a change.  This morning there was very few that
would respond to a “Good Morning”, it almost seems strange that one morning
most will respond but then there are days like today that few will respond.  We
both noticed that is often the case.  We had some time this morning to relax so
it was nice.  This afternoon we went out to Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> for a Primary
Christmas Party.  Mae and I gave a flannel board story of the nativity and Mae
bore testimony using the glove that has Velcro finger tips to hold pictures. 
We left there and came to the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup> Branch Christmas party.  Mae
was going to give training at Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> but they texted and changed
the date.  We enjoyed the party having a good time.  They always invite us to
join their activities.  They asked us to give a talent and we were not sure
just what to do.  They had some fairly good music there so we danced.  They
also had us join in some of their games.  When we got home at 6:30 PM we got on
the inter-net and had several messages.  We were over two hours getting through
the messages that were there.  A lot of them are forwarded messages and I wish
that they wouldn’t send them as we don’t have time for them.  Many times we
just delete them.  We did get one from Sandi, telling about Chelci and a
singing contest she is in, also one from Georgia that we sure enjoyed.  I’m not
feeling to well this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We have had
problems with ants every since we have been here.  I guess they are just common
every place.  When we first got here and wrote about them, Georgia and Rick
sent us some ant traps.  They have helped some.  We had them coming into the
bedroom a few months ago and I realized they were coming in from the AC so I
went outside and caulked around the condenser lines and that seen to have taken
care of them.  Last week they again became a pest and again they were coming
from the AC.  This time I think they just had a nest and I sprayed it heavy
with bug spray and seem to have stopped them.  In the cooking room we have had
a lot of them and found that they were coming in from a crack where the ceiling
had been repaired but hadn’t been sealed, so I caulked that and hopefully
stopped them there.  Both of these areas were large black ants.  Last night Mae
got a candy bar out to eat.  She will get a candy bar and just eat a bit every
day or so and then rap it back up.  Tonight she got it out and took a bite when
she noticed small sugar ants all over her hand.  When she looked the candy bar
was full of them.  She sure was spitting and washing her mouth out.  It is just
amazing how those little things can smell sugar and get to it.  Oh well,
another thing you just have to put up with in the Philippines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had to
hurry to leave for Guimba by 8 AM.  We had President Mercado ride with us this
morning hoping that I might visit with him about some of my concerns about the
Guimba branch’s, but I couldn’t get the conversation turned that way.  I am
afraid that until there is changes in the District Presidency, there will never
be progress in the branch’s.  After Sacrament meeting I visited with the young
man that is marring the Primary President this next week.  They are planning to
be gone for almost three months and then will move back into the Branch to
live.  He will also be a great help to the branch.  During Priesthood meeting
President Mercado had the new Elder’s Quorum President sustained and set
apart.  I reminded him later that he hadn’t released the previous President, I
think it upset him that I would correct him.  I just don’t know just how far I
can try to correct or teach President Mercado?  Mae trained the Primary
Presidency after the block and then trained the Y.W. Presidency at 2 PM.  I
trained the Branch Presidency from 2 PM until after 4 PM, which went very
well.  We got home at 5:30 PM very tired.  We forgot to stop at Marlyn’s and
get the cross-stitches so I returned and got them so that I might leave early
tomorrow for Angeles.  I typed a letter to President Mercado explaining the
training that I gave to President German.  I experienced stomach pain this
evening and finally lay down and had Mae finish the letter and send it off b
e-mail.  She let me sleep and when I woke it was 10 PM.  She had got on and
received three or four e-mails and answered them.  I finished and added my journal
entry and played a game before going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and I left for Angeles about 6:30 AM.  Mae stayed home so she could get
on the instant messaging with our children and to take care of some other
things.  I went first to the bank and talked to the manager about exchanging
Pesos to U.S. dollars.  Another man said he also could exchange them for us at
the V.F.W.  He said he would charge less for the conversion and cautioned us
against taking it to the U.S. and then exchanging it.  I next went to the frame
shop and left him some cross-stitch to frame.  I stopped at the wood carvers
but the owner was not there so I told his son that we would stop on the morning
of the 24<sup>th</sup>.  Next, I went to Blessies and paid for the shipping of
the quilt we had ordered (and Sister Brimhall paid for).  At Hard Rock I was
told that to buy a new Auto Cad program would cost me almost $700, so I just
gave him P300 for the copy of the program that he had given me.  I stopped at
McDonald’s and bought me something for lunch.  I went over to the S.M. mall and
bought some photo paper and ink cartridge and from there drove home getting
home at 3 PM.  Mae had gone to San Jose with Marlyn to get Christmas gifts for
the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Christmas party.  When I got home I lay down and took
a nap.  Mae came home and started to prepare food as we had invited Tony, Leah,
Kenneth and Alan for dinner.  We then held a F. H. E. and talked about
Christmas.  We had a very enjoyable evening.  Marlin and Imelda Dator stopped
by to see if we would like some pork as they are killing two pigs tomorrow. 
It’s been a long day and it is now 10:15 PM and I’m ready to go to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were going
to go walking but realized that the Elders would be here for breakfast.  Then
the Elders called and said that they had an appointment with President Brimhall
this morning so wouldn’t be over for breakfast and correlation meeting.  We
decided to give Mae a hair cut and dye her hair.  We finished and were ready to
rinse her hair when we realized that we had no water.  The landlord had someone
cleaning the tank.  We had to bring in water from storage to rinse Mae’s hair. 
About the time we finished the water came back on.  Mae made breakfast while I
printed some pictures that we could give to others.  We left at 12:10 to go to
Guimba where we picked up President and Sister Baccay and met Brother Garcia
and others with him and we went to the new well site to turn it over to the
Brugay captain and the residents of that area.  That was wonderful to see how
the people appreciated it.  They had had a well, but it only went down 20 feet
so the water wasn’t clean and pure and in the summer months, it practically
went dry.  President Cabuyaban and I (where I was his counselor) were out there
visiting and found out about this situation, so we worked with Brother Garcia,
who is over welfare in this region and Elder and Sister Swensen and were able
to get the funds from the church to put in this new well.  It goes down 180 feet
so is really good water and lots of it.  They had a program and I spoke along
with Brother Garcia and the brugay captain.  It went well, and we enjoyed being
with all these good people again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We came home
and got something to eat, then went to Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch Christmas
party.  It started at 4 pm, but we were a little late.  We got there just in
time to see Leah and 3 other ladies do a native folk dance.  They were in
beautiful pink costumes and they did a beautiful job.  The entire evening was
wonderful with the primary, youth, single adults, Relief Society, and Elders
doing at least one or two numbers.  They also played games and had piñatas for
the children.  The primary also did the Nativity, complete with costumes.  They
all brought wonderful food.  They asked Mae and I to bring prizes for the games
and a vegetable salad.  They asked Mae and I to dance and then others joined
in.  Santa Claus was there for the children bringing goodies.  There lots of
people there – some we hadn’t met, they were investigators and less active
members.  It was a huge success.  Everyone had a wonderful time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning at the collage.  After walking we stopped at Chamel &amp;
Maria’s and bought bread and granola.  We visited for a few minutes before
coming home.  They are having a hard time financially but I guess they are not
alone over here.  We wish we could help them more.  After coming home, cleaning
up and eating breakfast we went to the bank in San Jose.  They haven’t had our
last check clear so we couldn’t draw out money yet.  I did withdraw P10,000 so
we would have enough so meet our needs for now.  We bought some groceries at
CVC, got a wedding gift wrapped and bought some greeting cards.  We next got
gas in the car and then left for Guimba.  We were to attend a open house for a
couple in Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch but we couldn’t find their place.  We
went on to Camiling where we met Maharry’s at Jollibee’s for lunch.  We picked
up the clothes from the tailor that Mae had ordered.  Mae ordered some more
pants and I ordered 3 pair of Levis.  On the way home we again stopped in
Guimba and this time found a member that showed us where to go and we delivered
a gift to the Bride and Groom.  When we got home at 6:45 PM, Tony was waiting
for us so he could get their bread.  I ate some toast and hot milk for super
and then filled out my journal.  Mae lay down and fell asleep.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up in time to go walking as Marcelo and Brother Ray from Paniqui 2<sup>nd</sup>
branch came.  Marcelo wants to meet Marlyn so we took them over and introduced
him to her.  It was kind of cute but we were not sure if Marlyn appreciated
it.  We went from Marlyn’s to Chiemela and Maria’s and gave them some
watermelons.  That gave us an excuse to go there and get the names of their
children.  We next stopped at Gasmena’s and left a gift for Eve, for her
wedding. We then went to San Jose where we bought some Christmas gifts for Chiemela
&amp; Maria’s children some Christmas gifts.  While in San Jose we ate
breakfast (brunch) at Jollibees.  We them went out to Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup>‘s
Christmas party.  It wasn’t very well planned or attended.  We got there 1 hour
late and were among the first to arrive.  We got home at 6:30 PM after stopping
at the marked for some fruit.  The Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> branch came caroling
this evening.  They really were good and well planned.  We really enjoyed
having them come.  They sand several songs.  Mae had made Texas cake and served
them with cake and juice.  I wrapped the gifts for Chiemela and Maria’s
children.  I got on the internet and had 35 e-mails.  We were sad to get a
e-mail from Jennie and Robin Porter telling us that Uncle Dale died the other
day.  That was sad to here as we will miss him however we are not sad for him as
we know he was ready anytime.  We were busy all evening and while I was on the
computer Mae was getting things ready for us to leave in the morning.  It was
after mid-night when we got to bed.</span></p>

leaving fairly early but by the time we got ready it was 7:30 AM before we
left.  We went over to Chica &amp; Maria’s and took them some gifts for their
children, plus a fruit basket for them.  We stopped in Tarlac to get some money
out of the ATM but it wouldn’t work right and I ended up loosing our card.  We
got some breakfast at McDonald’s.  We got to Angeles at 10:30 AM and went right
to the Frame shop.  The frames were ready for us and we were very pleased with
them.  We stopped at a park and put ribbons and a card on the frames.  We took
the large cross-stitch of Christ to President and Sister Brimhall.  They really
appreciated it but we told them that it was just a little of our appreciation
for them.  We checked in at the Holliday Inn shortly after noon.  We went to
the room and took a nap for 1 ½ hrs.  We turned the TV on and found a cute
story on the Hall Mark channel that we watched.  At 5PM we met the Hyer’s, the
Maharry’s and the Brimhall’s.  We visited and then ate diner at the Buffet.  It
was really a good selection and we ate at the side of the swimming pool.  There
was a musical group that was very good and we danced to some of the numbers. 
We visited and enjoyed relaxing as we ate.  Just before 9 PM we left the dining
rooms and went to the lobby of our floor and exchanged gifts before going to
our rooms.  President and sister Brimhall gave us a box of candy for Mae and
some sugarless candy for me.  They are very thoughtful that way.  The Hyer’s
gave us some Mango Jam from Baguio and the Maharry’s gave us a nice plaque.  We
gave each of them a cross-stitch of the Salt Lake Temple that Marlyn made for
us and we had framed.  Mae &amp; I watched another Hall Mark show and cuddled
in bed.  It was late when we got to bed but it was a wonderful Christmas Eve. 
Mae is so enjoyable to be with.</span></p>

company.  All of us went over to the mission office at 10:15 AM.  We asked
Sister Brimhall if the activities last night caused her pain.  She replied yes
but it was worth every pain.  President Brimhall took some pictures; we were
not able to get any as our memory stick is full.  President also announced that
Elder &amp; Sister Maharry had been asked to extend for three months and they
had accepted the call.  We left about 11 AM to come home.  We delivered mail to
the Elders in Paniqui, Guimba, Munoz and San Jose.  We were both very tired
when we got home so we lay down and took a nap.  At 6 PM we went to Chica and
Maria’s for diner in their back yard.  They had also invited two other couples
that are neighbors and fellow students at the collage.  Maria had prepared a
very nice dinner.  After dinner we played a short game and then watched a
movie.  I had brought the media equipment so we could project the show onto the
screen.  It was late when we got home.  This has been a very different
Christmas for us but also very enjoyable.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Today was a
busy Sunday as Mae had a talk in Sacrament meeting and I had two trainings to
give after meetings.  The one was to the new Elders Quorum President and I had
the Elders (missionaries) join us so that they could interpret for us as the
Elder’s Quorum president doesn’t speak much English and I don’t speak Tagalog. 
I then gave the branch clerk some training and we got along very well as he
speaks very good English.  Mae thought that she was going to train the R.S.
Presidency but the President was sick so that fell through.  This is our last
week with the Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> branch and next week we start with the
Paniqui 3<sup>rd</sup> branch.  This will complete our training of the branches
in the two Districts.  When we got home we ate some diner and then Roger Sylvia
came over to ask us about help in getting some missionaries applications ready
to turn in for processing.  I ask him to get President Gajonera’s to type up a
letter on each of the four that are submitting applications and I would then
talk to the mission presidency.  I typed a letter to our family and sent it by
e-mail.  Mae got some things ready for our trip tomorrow with the Hyer’s and
Maharry’s.  However she went to bed not feeling very well.  I got on the
inter-net to send the Family letter, and then I saw that President Brimhall had
a letter for me.  It was concerning the Blacks and the Church.  After saving
that I decided to play a game before going to bed.  Scott got on his computer
and as I was still up I got on instant messaging with him for a minute.  They
had a nice Christmas but Ashley got hit by one of the cousins and has been up
with an ear ache until 2 AM this morning.  It was 10:30 PM before I got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t
have time to go walking this morning as we had to be ready to leave at 9 AM. 
Elder and Sister Hyer and Elder and Sister Maharry were here right on time and
we were soon on our way.  They also told us that there was an earthquake in the
Indian Ocean that sent title waves which has caused over 60,000 deaths and
still climbing and great damages.  The Philippines Islands were protected from
the waves by the Asian islands to the West of the Philippines.  Some islands
had waves go completely over them and others had waves from twenty to one
hundred feet high slam into them causing great destruction.  The number of deaths
is raising with each report that comes in.   We stopped a couple of times on
the way, once for lunch and then once as we crossed over the first mountain
range.  We arrived at Banaue just before 3 PM.  We stayed at the Banaue Hotel,
which was quite nice.  When we got our rooms, Mae &amp; Sister Hyer went
looking for them.  Our room numbers were 231 &amp; 232 so they went up a floor
and couldn’t figure the room numbers out as all the numbers on that floor were
400 and up.  We figured out that the lobby was on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor and
we had to go down to get to the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor.  Banaue is built on the
side of the mountain and all buildings hang over the side and have to be
supported by lower floors or stilts.  We were amazed as we looked at the
building sights as well as the construction.  The rice terraces are also
amazing to try to think of how they are constructed, but also sad as they are
starting to deteriorate because of lack of use.  The work is too hard and the
pay is too small so the younger generations are going to Manila to find work. 
The rice terraces of Banaue are one of the eight wonders of the world and
because of lack of foresight, of the people and government, they will
deteriorate and the attraction that brings tourist to Banaue, not the wood
carvings, will be lost.  We went around town for a little while and then ate at
the hotel.  We were all tired and so went to bed fairly early.  </span></p>

Birthday than she had ever had before.  We spent the day sight seeing and
shopping at gift stores.  Before retiring we watched a culture show put on by
some of the natives of the area.  It was interesting but made you realize how
little of an understanding of life these people’s ancestors had.  The sad thing
is few still have little knowledge of the purpose of life.  Elder Hyer said
that there are no missionaries in this area now.  The meals at the hotel are
not what you would call the highest rated, but they aren’t too bad.  We ate
there as it is probably the best in town.</span></p>

to the ZL’s before they went on a service project, and borrow their telephone. 
That way Mae and I could each have a phone when our children called us at 9 AM
for our Christmas call.  All our family was at David and Shauna’s except for
JaNae and Brad.  When we asked why, we were told that they had an appointment
with the missionaries to start taking the lessons.  We could fully accept that
excuse and are very excited about it.  We visited for 1 ½ hours, but the time
went very fast.  Mae got on the inter-net while I took a nap.  We went out to
Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> Branch for their Christmas party.  We gave Emmy Balthazar
an advance on the cross stitch she is making for us.  We then went to the
Paniqui District Christmas Party but left early from there as we had an
appointment with Roger Silvia to visit with the prospective missionaries. 
Roger gave me a floppy dish with letters of recommending the missionaries for a
call. The first disk would not open so I called Roger and drove down to his
place.  I took the computer with me and we saved the file into my computer.  I
e-mailed them to President Montymayor after I got home.  We got sleepy so I
will have to finish this entry tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
6 AM so didn’t have time to go walking.  Our neighbors brought a gift over for
us.  It is a beautiful cross-stitch of two Angels with a very nice card; you
can see a picture of them in our picture files 2004-12-31.  That will be
something we will want to treasure.  We attended District Development meeting
with the Guimba Elder’s.  Before coming home we went to the Guimba District
Hospital to check on bringing prospective missionaries there to get the medical
check-up.  Sister Loreta Pambio from Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch was on duty
at the hospital and so we were able to talk to her.  She asked us to bring them
in Tuesday at 9 AM for the medical checkups and the cost would be for the
reading of the x-rays only.  We came home and ate dinner as Marlyn had it ready
for us.  Mae tried to take a nap but the neighbors were fighting and with their
baby crying she couldn’t.  I printed several copies of a poem for Mae and
framed them.  We got several text messages this evening wishing us a Happy New
Year.  In fact they came in all evening and became almost a bother.  We set the
media equipment up and watched a Church History Video and Lion King.</span></p>
