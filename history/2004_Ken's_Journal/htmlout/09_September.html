<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We made it to
go walking this morning.  It seemed good to get out.  We met the lady that her
husband is working on postgraduate schooling, Angelina.  She told us about the
vegetables that they grow and sell on the campus.  She also invited us to
attend a Christian study group on Wednesday morning.  That might be
interesting.  We bought some vegetables after we finished walking.  They had
squash, cucumbers and lettuce that are excellent.  I told Mae to show Marlyn
how to cook baked chicken and squash for dinner.  That is another example of
the Filipino people not understanding what they are told. Mae explained what we
would have for dinner and later showed Marlyn how to cut up chicken but when
noon came Marlyn had also prepared Filipino food.  We will just save the
chicken for later.  Brother Umipig came by to tell us of his father’s funeral
tomorrow.  He was 97 years old when he died.  We have already made plans to go
to Angeles to take care of several items and to take Elder Natad to meet his
new companion.  I started capsulation of my nutrient but the moister is so
heavy in the air that the powder is immediately picking it up.  I called
President Mercado and asked him if he could bring me some “Absorbs” packing
from the Distribution Center.  He said he would.  I wrote more on a report of
the flooding in the Guimba area.  We went out to Guimba so that Mae could teach
Sister Emmy some of the Primary songs and then help Sister Lus Parinas with
Mid-Week Activity. Sister Lus had 14 young women out to the activity night this
evening.   I had planned on meeting with President Cabuyaban in Branch
Presidency meeting but he text and said he was to tired.  He had taken
Farncisco Valintine to the Dr. for a check up and had applied for a job.  I
just read in a book while Mae did her thing.  After Mutual, Mae had told Sis.
Villanueva that she would go visiting with them, so I drove them around.  It
was 9 PM when we got home.  Mae warmed up some chicken and squash for me.  I
made my journal entry before we went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We left this
morning at 6:30 AM for Angeles.  We picked up Elder Natad on the way because he
has to attend the transfer meeting to get his new companion.  We met the Hyer’s
at MacDonald’s in Tarlac and ate breakfast there.   Two missionaries came to
get Elder Natad there.   (I caught this journal entry &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup>
entry last night then closed the computer without saving it so lost it.)  From
Tarlac we went to Dr. Mildred Rosales, our dentist, and we both had our teeth
cleaned and checked.  We ordered frames for our pictures, checked with the wood
carver about getting a crate to ship things home, bought Mae’s blood pressure
pills, went to the mission office to pay for some books we ordered for Tony
&amp; Leah, went out to eat at Ala Crème’s, went to a mall to buy a small
tripod for our camera.  We have wanted one and ordered a quilt at Blessy’s.  It
will be a king sized quilt and will cost P8,800.  We ordered the pillow shams
for P900 so a total of P9,700.  We came back to Gerona and were planning to
meet Sis. Tess Mejia at her house to buy two quilts and some Christmas
decorations, but as we were driving down the road to her house, the flood water
became deeper and deeper until we decided we had better back up and call her. 
She said “Yes, we couldn’t come to their house, but to go to the church and we
would meet them there.”  Her husband is the branch president of Gerona Branch
so we went in the church and visited a while about the flooding, then bought
the items and left to come on home.  We paid a total of P24,000.  P1,400 for
the beaded Christmas tree (which Bessie Nadado made), P1,500 for the string of
15 shell lights, P2,500 for the shell Christmas lantern, P8,800 for the queen
sized quilt and P9,800 for the king sized quilt.  Blessie’s quilts and the ones
we get from Tess are about the same quality and price.  Tess’s quilts come with
the pillow shams, we don’t pay extra for them, but the quilts are more
expensive.  Thankfully, their house is not flooded, but many homes in Gerona
and Paniqui were.  It was 9:30 PM when we got home.  It has been a long day,
but we accomplished a lot and enjoyed being together.  Mae always reads a lot
while I drive. (When she isn’t taking pictures.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We picked up
the Munoz Elders at 7:45 AM and drove to Guimba for District Meeting.  It
doesn’t start until 9 am, but the ZL’s have to be there at 8:30 to prepare for
it.  Our new zone leader is Elder Espanol.  Mae misjudged him when she heard
that he was Samoan.  She was thinking of the some of the other Samoan Elders we
have had and we haven’t been too impressed with most of them.  Elder Espanol is
not like them, he is sharp.  We can understand why Pres. Brimhall chose him for
a zone leader.  He has only been out for 16 months, but from seeing him and
talking with him, we feel he will be great.  Pres. Brimhall came, as he will be
interviewing the Elders.  We asked if we could be first, so we wouldn’t have to
wait until the end and get home late since we will be meeting Elder &amp;
Sister Clark at our home at noon and then go with them to Tony’s café.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Pres. Brimhall told us that
he had talked with Pres. Mercado that morning and told him that dad needed to
be released as he had other plans for us.  Pres. Mercado told him that they
were planning to release Pres. Cabuyaban and put in William Baccay as the new
branch president.  William is our new Elder’s Quorum President.  We are not
sure he is ready to be a branch president, but if they feel inspired to do it, then
he must be.  We think Pres. Cabuyaban will be happy to be released.  He has
been in for almost 4 years.  President then proceeded to ask us to pray with
him about moving us.  He said he had been thinking of having us work in other
areas now that we have finished with these two districts.  We told him we
hadn’t finished as we still have two branches in Guimba and two branches in
Paniqui that we haven’t met with and trained.  He hadn’t realized that, so hope
he will let us finish those as they need training too.  He said he was also
thinking of moving us out to the Clark’s home when they leave so we could do
more work out there.  He asked us when we would be going home and we told him
the middle of February.  He said “Oh, that only gives you 2 and ½ months and
that probably wouldn’t be worth the inconvenience of moving, for just that
long”.  We agreed.  It is beautiful out there, but we hate to move and we don’t
think we would be as liberal as the Clarks.  Their landlords just come into the
house any time they want, whether they are home or not.  Many times they come
home and find them there.  We wouldn’t like that.  We didn’t think we would be
moving on our mission – but not sure now.  Hope not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                It is Elder
&amp; Sister Clarks 40<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary and they wanted to
celebrate it with us.  We had told them about Tony and Leah and about their
café, so they texted and asked if we could go there with them.  We were excited
to see them again and have them meet Tony.  We had a wonderful time visiting
with them and Tony.  Leah only works until almost noon and then leaves to pick
up Kenneth and be with him the rest of the day.  Tony is doing so good.  They
texted us to ask if I would baptize them as it would be an honor for them. 
They are to be baptized on Sept. 18<sup>th</sup>.  We talked about that and I
told him that I could baptize him and he would be confirmed, then on Sunday he
would receive the Aaronic Priesthood to the office of a Priest and then on
Monday or Tuesday, they could have another baptism for Leah and Alyn and Tony
could baptize them.  He was excited, so we think that is what they will do. 
Just before we left, Tony asked if he could share something with us.  He said that
on Wednesday he had the feeling come over him that it would be a “good day”. 
Nothing happened different until later in the afternoon, when many people came
in and they made a lot of money.  They were so excited as they haven’t been
doing well and felt they would lose the business.  He said today he had the
feeling that it would be a “special day”.  He wasn’t sure what that meant until
Elder &amp; Sister Clark and Mae and I came.  He felt the spirit as he visited
with us, and said “It is a SPECIAL DAY.  I had to leave at 4:00 pm to go to
Guimba to meet with Pres. Cabuyaban, Christopher and his mother about an
emergency with his grandmother.  We also had several other people to visit
with.  I got home about 8:30 p.m. very tired.  I didn’t sleep good on Thursday
night and since I didn’t get a nap today, I am really tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Saturday, September 04, 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wow! What a day!  It started
at 5:30 am when we started getting text messages, then shortly afterwards a
beggar lady came and then Pres. &amp; Sister Mercado and their 2 children came
to bring us the oxygen Absorbers we had asked him to get for us at the PBO.  We
need these since I am capsulating our nutrient powder from Mannatect for my
health.  There is so much moisture in the air – so much humidity, that it ruins
the power.  Hopefully, these will help.  Mae was embarrassed because she went
to the door and was only in her duster since she has been exercising and saying
her prayers.  We wanted to walk before showering.  A few minutes later, the
doorbell again rang and it was Marlin to wash our car.  He usually doesn’t come
until 8 am, but he had a meeting this morning at that time, so he came about
6:50 am.  We usually take the car, but told him we would just walk to the
college, instead of drive.  We got dressed, paid him and headed out.  When we
got to the first gate (where we usually walk), it was locked so we decided to
go partway back and walk down another road.  It was a beautiful morning,
overcast, but really nice.  Mae asked if I would cut and color her hair this
morning, so we didn’t shower immediately when we got home, we decided to eat
breakfast, then do her hair and then shower.  While we were eating, the
doorbell rang again and it was Roger Silvia.  He brought us the program for
their Branch Family Home Evening on Friday night where they want me to give the
opening address and then have us use our equipment to show “Finding Faith in
Christ.”  He also wanted to sell us some more cleaning products as he needs the
money.  I asked him to help me some on the computer.  After he left, we
received another text message saying: GUD AM SIS BROWNING I NID UR HELP I WANT
2 CALL U BUT MY LOD S NOT ENOUGH MY NIECE S IN D HOSPITAL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> It was from Lorna Gajonera –
Christina delivered her baby, but Christina had a urinary track infection, but
didn’t tell anyone so didn’t get medicine to get it cleared up and the baby got
the infection.  It needs medicine or might die.  Sis. Monta is only family
member who has any money, so she gave what she could, Lorna gave what she
could, but still not enough.  They called Pres. Mercado, but he said they have
no cash and since it is Sat., they can’t get any until Monday.  We think he
might have suggested that they call us since we have helped others in a pinch
like this in Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> branch, until they could get the welfare
money from the district.  We loaned them P3,000.  It’s good we can do this,
otherwise people could die.)  I cut and colored Mae’s hair, then quickly
showered while Mae made me a sandwich and I headed off to drop off the P3,000
at Pres. Gajonera’s, but didn’t have time to test out the equipment so will
have to do that another time.  As I started out of Munoz, President Mercado and
others were off to the side of the road with a trike.  They were waiting for
President Gasmena, but because President Gajonera couldn’t go, they were all
trying to fit into one trike, which included the district primary presidency. 
I, therefore, bent mission rules and gave Sis. Mercado and Sister Tobias and
Brother Damico a ride to Guimba to our meetings.   We had our district
presidency and branch presidency meeting, then Pres. Cabuyaban and I held a
branch presidency meeting.  I got home about 4 pm.  The air conditioner on the
car is going out and we are having to clean up condensation water out of the
floor of the car.  We are going to have to get that fixed.  After coming home,
I fixed dinner while Mae finished typing the letter to our family.  I used the
lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes (which the Hyers had brought home from Baguio and
gave some to us), boiled some eggs, grated some cheese and we had a delicious
chef salad.  After eating, we went to visit Brother &amp; Sister Umipig. 
Brother Umipig’s father passed away, and he had come on Wednesday to bring us a
special invitation to come to the funeral which was to be held on Thursday.  We
already had plans and dental appointments in Angeles for Thursday so we
apologized that we would not be able to attend.  We enjoyed visiting with them
tonight.  All their children and grandchildren were there at their home, but
had gone upstairs or in the family room, so we could visit.  Just when we were
ready to leave, Sister Umipig jumped up and said she would like us to meet her
children.  We had previously met some of them, especially Maricel, who is a
doctor, but it was fun to meet and visit with all of them.  The grandchildren
were so cute – all granddaughters.  They took pictures of us with their
family.  Mae typed the e-mail for Pres. Brimhall about our new YW President
when we returned while I took a nap.  We sent the letters by e-mail and then
went to bed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up at
5:30 AM but had to hurry in order to be on our way by 6:45 AM.  We picked
President Cabuyaban up on the way.  I for got to get my note books so that
upset me.  I am really having problems with not getting discouraged.  I feel
that I have failed in doing very much training since we have been in the
branch.  Mae is doing much better that am I.  Meetings went about normal.  In
the States I think you would say it was a flop but here it’s about normal.  We
had Branch Council following the block program.  We then took care of the
donations.  It was 3 PM when we arrived home, and I was completely beat.  We
took a nap and then got up and got some dinner.  We worked n the flood report
and a report for President Brimhall.  Mae also finished up the family letter
and got it off.  It was after 10 PM when we went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke up
just before 5 AM but let Mae sleep until 6 AM.  We got ready and went walking. 
When we got home we hurried and showered and then went to Tony’s for
breakfast.  We came home to get on instant messaging with our children but PLDT
was not working this morning and we couldn’t get on the internet.  We were
disappointed at that, but try as we could we weren’t successful.  We did the
banking for the branch, paid the phone bill and complained to the office about
the phone lines.  Of course we know how much good that will do.  Marlyn had a
nice dinner ready for us when we got home.  We went to San Jose shopping and to
mail the report to PBO.  We came home and put groceries away.  I worked on the
computer for a while.  Time went fast and before we were ready it was time to
go to Tony &amp; Leah’s.  We showed them the DVD of “Finding Faith in Christ”. 
Mae had made a “fruit cocktail” desert and I had popped some corn.  We had a very
enjoyable evening with them and are amazed at the reading </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tony is doing.  He completed
the D &amp; C this afternoon.  We had a very enjoyable evening visiting with
them.  It was 9:50 PM when we got home, much later than we had planned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4:30 AM and left for Tarlac about 6:00 AM.  We got to the Honda Dealership
about 7:30 AM, so we made good time.  We had to wait until 8 AM before anyone
arrived at the shop.  I asked them to repair the A/C, service the car and
replace the left rear light cover.  They asked about doing an 80,000 km check
up?  I called President Brimhall and he said to have it done.  I was given an
estimate of P20,570.25 and was concerned until I calculated the dollar value of
$367.33.  I cannot imagine that service in the Sates being less than a couple
of thousand dollars.  I do not under the value difference.  The Assistant’s to
the President and the office Elders brought us a car we can use while we are
waiting for our car to be repaired.  Mae and I then went into Tarlac and ate at
McDonald’s.  We then drove to Camiline and went to the tailor that had made us
some clothes.  Mae got a blouse, a jumper and a skirt while I got some slacks.
The total came to P3,400 or $60.75.  We are very pleased with them.  We had to
come back to Tarlac as the road to Paniqui was washed out with the flooding, so
while in Tarlac we checked on having a tailor made me a suit with two pants a
vest, also a dress shirt.  The cost will be P9,700 or less than 175 dollars. 
We then came back to Guimba where we stopped and paid the Dr for Naomi’s
medications.  It was 3 PM when we got home.  We tried to balance our budget but
can not account for everything.  I took a nap while Mae tried to get on the
internet.   This evening I went out to Guimba.  I stopped at Sister Baltazar’s
and gave her a pattern for cross stitching.  When I went to leave there was a
kid (baby goat) in the road.  I honked the horn but he didn’t move.  I stopped
and he ran under the car.  A man came and got him out for me.  I picked up
President Cabuyaban to go visiting.  We visited a couple that is just living
together.  They have one little boy and are expecting a 2<sup>nd</sup>.  He is
a member and she is receiving the discussions.  President talked to them about
getting married as that will be one of the requirements before baptism.  We
then stopped and visited a few minutes with William and Analiza Baccay at their
new Tyndahon.  They opened it today.  We visited a young couple that is living
together at his parents.  She is pregnant but both are only 16 years old. 
There is some debate about getting married, plus the missionaries are going to
give her the discussions.  Brother Norberto came over so it would be proper for
the Elders to teach them.  President and I visited Sister Dela Cruz who has her
oldest son home for a while.  President and I discussed several other items
through the evening.  I was very tired when I got home.  I did call the ZL’s 
and President Brimhall to discuss Tony, Leah and Alen’s baptism.  There is a problem
that Alen is not legally adopted by Tony &amp; Leah and Alen’s father is still
alive.  After discussing this with President Brimhall he said he would give
permission for Alen to be baptized.  It’s been a long day and it is almost 11
PM, GOOD NITE.</span></p>

went walking at the collage.  I had been up from 4 AM but Mae didn’t wake until
5:30 AM.  Mae gave me a hair cut before we had breakfast.  We tried to call
Sandi but the line was busy.  We got on the internet to see if Jeff was on and
was able to talk to him.  Them Mike saw that we were on so he came on for a
while.  Next Scott saw us on so he came on.  It was neat to visit with the
three boys when we missed them on Monday.  I took some invoices to Brother
Damacio and then cashed that check.  I had the car washed as it was so dirty. 
I did get a short nap this afternoon before we went out to mid-week activity. 
I had an interview with Sister Belen Rigdao to extend a calling, which she
accepted. We held Branch Presidency meeting.  We stopped at Sister Nida Vigilia
and found that she was sick.  We gave her a Priesthood Blessing before
leaving.  We took President Cabuyaban home and he asked if I would assist him
in giving his mother a blessing, which we did before coming home.  I was on the
computer making some entries, while Mae made some phone calls.  We were late
getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking at the collage this morning.  It was a very nice morning and we
enjoyed the walk.  We came home and after showering we prepared breakfast for
the ZL’s.  They came at 8 AM and after eating we held a correlation meeting.  I
worked on my talk for Friday afternoon.  At noon we took the invoices to
brother Damacio, and then went to Tony’s for lunch.  Tony made us fish and
chips that were delicious.  We took them two Bibles that they were excited to
get.  He told us of an experience that he had of a man that came into his café
and told him that he was wrong to listen to the Mormons.  That these young men
were just selling him and he shouldn’t buy.  He said he tried to tell him that
he wasn’t buying anything and that he was praying and making up his own mind
and heart.  He said it did upset him for the man wasn’t very polite but was
very loud.  We visited with him for a while.  We also found out that Elder
Natad isn’t feeling well, so we went over to the Elders place and asked Elder
Natad if he would like a blessing and he indicated that he would.  Elder ______
anointed him and I sealed the anointing and gave him a blessing.  We took the
check we got from Brother Damacio to President Gasmena’s for is signature.  He
is not home but we left the check to be signed when he returns.  I did some
more research for material for my talk. Then I took a nap.  This evening I went
out to Guimba where President Cabuyaban and I did some visiting.  This is
really hard for me as I don’t speak the language.  I am sure those we visit appreciated
the visit, but it is very awkward.  We made about six visits and tried to get a
prescription for Brother Valintino.  Mae had me take a dress to Sister Emie
Baltizar.  She is still suffering from a bad wisdom tooth.  President Brimhall
called me and said he needs me to bring the car back to the mission home
tomorrow.  We will change plans and do that.  Brother Nuque called me and
invited us to their place for his Birthday, this evening.  I had to apologize
that we couldn’t make it.  Brother Villanueva invited us to attend his Birthday
on Saturday.  It was 9 PM before I got home, very tired and beat.  My wife is
the most wonderful and understanding person.  I don’t know what I would ever do
without her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
5 AM and left for Angeles at 6:50 AM.  We stopped at the Honda Dealership and
got a phone number, as we went through.  We stopped at the McDonald’s in Capus
for some breakfast.  As I was letting Mae out of the car I felt some one touch
my back pocket.  I whirled thinking some one was trying to get my wallet, but
it was a little girl probably less than 6 years old trying to get my
attention.  She was hungry and wanted some money.  As we don’t give money I had
her wait and we ordered three “Egg McMuffins” and took out to her and her
mother and brother.  I know they get good at begging but that look on her face
and the thin, poorly clothed little girl really got to me.  I had a hard time
eating my food for the tears in my eyes.  You feel so bad for some of these
people and especially the children.  When we got to Angeles we went to the drug
store and got Mae’s medication.  We also filled a prescription for Brother
Valintino.  We went to the mission home and left the car.  I did talk to
President Brimhall about Sister Baltizar’s financial problems.  He told me that
we could not replace the stolden items from Fast Offerings. He did give me
P2500 to help her get back on her feet, with instructions to monitor the
program.  The AP’s took us out to eat at VA restaurant for lunch.  Elder Abad
met a man that he had met before and told us that he was a member of the
church.  He seems to quite well off financially and is starting several
business here in the Philippines to help the people out.  We ordered and ate
but when we went to pay the bill, we found that he had paid it for us.  Elder
Abad and Elder Michel then took us to Tarlac to get our car.  As we left the
dealership it was raining very hard and continued until the turn off to
Guimba.  We got home about 4:20 PM and had to hurry to be ready for the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
Branch Family Home Evening program.  I was the speaker and showed the DVD
“Building Faith in Christ.  I felt that I was blessed in order to put my
thoughts together and give it.  They played some games after the DVD and then
had some refreshments.  We were late getting home and then we ate something light
but it still upset my stomach.  I stayed up for a while letting my stomach
settle but Mae went to bed.  I opened the internet and found a letter from
Shellie, and then played 3 or 4 games of spider rummy” on the computer before
going to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke early
trying to think of how to help these people.  Mae slept in but she didn’t feel
very well most of the morning.  She asked me to give her a blessing, which I
did, and then she got feeling better.  We called Sandi and visited with her for
about 15 minutes.  It was good to talk to her.  She told us that JaNae and Brad
are expecting a baby in the middle of March.  We should be home for that.  We
went out to Guimba to the R. S. Home Making and Brother Villanueva’s Birthday. 
I also visited with William Baccay at their tindahon.  Brother Villanueva and I
went over to Francisco Valintino’s and gave him the prescription we purchased
for him.  Mae and I drove to Moncada to take out the medications for Noemi. 
When we got back to Guimba we stopped at Emmy’s to visit with her about there
teeth problem and her financial problems.  I had Mae take a note book in to
write some items down as we talked about them, but when we got out to the car,
she said she didn’t take many notes and I said that is about as much as we
accomplished.  I am just baffled as to how to help this people.  We came home
and while Mae showered and washed her hair, I made my journal entry.  David
called to talk to us.  It is very good to hear from him.  Connor just got his
first tooth in yesterday.  Boy it doesn’t seem like he should be that old but
he is four months old now.  They hope to close on their home on Wednesday and
move in on Friday.  When I think of the things that are going on home and how
fast my grandchildren are growing up I get homesick.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were a
little late getting off this morning but picked Pres. Cabuyaban up at 7:30AM. 
We held P.E.C. and planned the program for the Branch Family Home Evening for
Saturday 18<sup>th</sup> at 6 PM to 8 PM.  Before Sacrament meeting started
President Mercado and President Dasalla came.  They interviewed President
Cabuyaban and then me to tell us that they were going to reorganize the Branch
Presidency and would be extending to us a release.  That changed the program
with President Mercado Presiding and President Cabuyaban conducting.  It is
good but we will miss many of these members that we have got to know
personally.  During Sunday school time we were in the office turning things
over to President William Baccay.  For Priesthood meeting Brother Roberto took
the Aaronic Priesthood and I gave a lesson to the Elders.  I stayed after
meetings to help with the finances and to help where I can.  There was a
question about the ordering of the Liahona, so on the way home I stopped at
President Mercado’s and asked him about it.  After getting home we laid down
for a nap.  I went to sleep but Mae couldn’t go to sleep so got up and wrote
the family letter.  We ate dinner and then went over to Brother and Sister
Sylvia’s, taking them a framed “Proclamation To The World”.  We visited for a
while and told them that we would attend the Sacrament meeting at San Antone
next week.  Roger was so excited with the way things went with the meeting at
San Antone.  All of the Presidency went out, as they held there first meeting
at San Antone.  There was 33 in attendance and added to the Munoz 1<sup>st</sup>
branch made 111 for total attendance.  After getting home I entered my journal
while Mae took a nap.  We then popped some corn and played a game of Rummy,
which I won this time.  We then set and talked about life and the good life we
have had.  We haven’t had much money but we have a lot of love, the best
children and great grandchildren and now starting with great-grandchildren.  It
is fun to be with Mae for she is my very best friend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I had set the
alarm but forgot to pull it out so we over slept.  We went to Tony’s for
breakfast and visit with Tony for a few minutes.  The baptismal for them are
set for Saturday at 2 PM and Sunday at 4 PM.  That is exciting.  I met with
President Baccay at the bank and we made the deposit.  We came home for a few
minutes and I started some training.  At 11:45 AM we went to the Munoz chapel
where Brother Damacio gave President Baccay some training on the reports.  We
went to President Gasmenia and got a check and then went to San Jose to mail
the reports.  While there we bought a hamburger for lunch.  I bought two each
but Pres. Baccay asked if it would be ok if he took one home to Anniliza for
she loved Jollibees hamburgers.  We came back home where we continued some
training until 3 PM.  Pres. Baccay went home with an appointment for me to meet
with him at 2 PM tomorrow.  Mae and I lay down and took a nap.  Mae woke me about
5 PM and said Tony had called and asked if we could have a lesson on baptism as
that is what they are preparing for.  We had to quickly prepare but it went
well, although we were to long.   Tony and Alyn didn’t get there until almost
7:30 PM.  Mae visited with Alyn about personal progress while Tony and I
visited and Leah finished with some snacks.  It was a very enjoyable evening. 
We got home just after 10 PM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning.  We again met the lady that we have visited with before. 
We thought that her name was Angelina but she corrected us for it is Maria
Victoria.  We took the Elder Aspinol, Elder Natad, Elder Gibbons and Elder
Jensen out for breakfast at Tony’s.  After breakfast we brought Elder Aspinol
and Natad to our home and held a correlation meeting.  After that meeting I
took the Elders back to Tony’s where they planned for their baptisms.  I went
to the bank to cash the checks for the Guimba 1<sup>st</sup> branch.  I came
home and took a short nap.  This after noon we went out to Guimba where I met
with President Baccay and gave him some training.  Mae did some visiting while
I was there.  On the way home Tony text us and said that Kevin had brought some
anti-Mormon literature and ask if I would look at it.  When we got there he
explained that he had read it and found it to be a lot of garbage.  We read
through some of it and saw that part truths were used out of context, miss
quoted and made up.  Tony has no trouble with it and we are glad for that.  While
there we ate dinner to help him out and that saved us fixing it.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking; it was cool and very enjoyable.  We came home, showered and ate
breakfast. We updated a few files on the computer and worked on the programs
for Brother Tony, Sister Leah and Sister Alyn’s baptismal.  We took a nap, ate
lunch and went to San Jose to do our grocery shopping.  The phone company had a
repairman check our phone and he found out that we had a bad fuse outside in
the connection box.  Marlyn did extra and washed our bedroom drapes today. 
They look much better.  We stopped at Tony’s and took the programs to him to
look over and make corrections for us.  We also had him make us a club sandwich
that we ate on the way out to Guimba.  I met with President Baccay and some of
the other leaders to discuss the Branch Family Home Evening on Saturday.  After
that meeting I met with President Baccay, Sister Villanueva and Sister Emie and
we discussed Sister Emie problem with her teeth.  I had called Dr. Rosales and
she definitely feels she needs to come in.  I explained the finance situation
and she will do the checkup and consultation free and will keep all other
charges down.  I again visited with President Baccay about Sister Emie’s financial
problems.  Mae met with the Young Women (&amp; Young Men) for Mutual.  They had
been planning a Talent Show for the past 2 weeks and it was to be tonight. 
They had a large group of youth come.  At least 22 and all but 2 were young
women.  Sister Luz Parinas and her counselor was there and the past young
women’s presidency were there.  They are all single adults.  Several male young
adults were there also, plus the full time missionaries stopped in for a few
minutes.  The talent show wasn’t too successful since most of the youth who
signed up (or someone signed up for them) wouldn’t participate.  Deng Mactal
played the piano while her sister Mary Ann plus AJ and another girl sang about
3 numbers.  And Madonna, Jenny Dela Cruz &amp; another girl sang a song. 
Norberto Corpuz, a returned missionary played a hymn on the piano, but that was
all who participated.  The Lord helped Mae to think of taking extra things for
the youth so in case, some of the youth didn’t participate, so she read a
beautiful story and had a fun game which took the rest of the time and the
youth seemed to have a good time.  They also presented Mae with some letters
from the youth and another large decorated paper sign they all wrote a few
special words on thanking Mae for her smile, support and help.  She had made
Texas Cake for them and they liked that also.  Mae went visiting with Sis.
Villanueva and Sister Emie for a few minutes and then we stopped at Pres. &amp;
Sister Cabuyaban’s to give them a framed “Proclamation to the Family” to remember
us by and we took pictures and enjoyed visiting with them for a few minutes.   They
are a special family.  We took Emie home on our way.  Mae called the health
Sisters and ask what we can do about the problem I am having with jock itch. 
We are concerned about the continued use of the Hydrocortisone.  They suggested
that we use Nizoral cream.  I also called the office Elders to let them know
that we are having the same problem with the A/C in the car so will return it
to the garage in the morning.  We will let them know when we find out anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got ready
and left for Tarlac at 7 AM and then had to come back for some items we had
forgotten.  We still got to the Honda dealership in time to be first in line. 
We were there until 11:30 AM as they were checking out the A/C.  The problem
was a plugged drain line from the condenser.  While waiting Mae worked on the
computer and I took a nap.  A man put a movie on the TV that we got interested
in, so we watched the end of it before leaving.  We went into Tarlac and met
with Elder and Sister Hyer and went out to lunch.  We had a very enjoyable time
and came close to staying over with them.  We had taken a change of clothes in
case it took longer with the car repairs.  We felt that we needed to come back
and visit with Sister Baltazar on our way home.  After getting home I texted
Roger Silvia about helping us on our computer.  He came right over and spent
quite a while helping us with it.  I had to change the programs for Tony, Leah
and Alyn’s baptism programs.  We also had to get on the e-mail and send a
letter for Sony Cabuyaban.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had to
hurry this morning in order to pick up the Munoz Elder’s to go to District Development
meeting.  We were told that we should start the meeting 1 hour early as there
would be transfers today.  Who ever as we got to the Guimba church a message
arrived that there would not be any transfers today.  As everyone was there the
ZL’s started early anyway.  After meeting Mae and I went to the Dr. Office and
paid the bills for Noemi.  As we came back home, Sonny Cabuyaban texted us and
wants to visit with us about the National Family Week and Family History that
he has been put in charge.  Sister Browning was very upset that he thinks we
can help him and wants me to tell him we cannot.  I finally told her I would
talk to him if she would not say anything.  She finally agreed that she would
not.  We met Sonny downtown Munoz and I thought Mae was going to go back on her
promise.  Then as we visited she softened and before long was very enthusiastically
making suggestions and offering help.  She strongly felt that it was not fair
for such a job to be given someone on such short notice.  Marlyn had dinner
ready when we got home.  Most of the rest of the day I spent putting my
Mannatech supplements into capsules.  I am pretty sure that we will have enough
product to last us but we need over 600 more capsules.  Mae and I watched the
movie “Only Once” again this evening.  I went to sleep but Mae got up and got
on the inter-net and sent Sandi and JaNae a letter.  It was 12:30 AM before she
came to bed.</span></p>

shortly after 6 AM but let Mae sleep until she woke at 7 AM.  I had my
scripture study and prayers while waiting for her.  For breakfast I prepared
French Toast and eggs.  Marlin came over and washed the car this morning.  We
got a text from the ZL’s asking us to reprint the programs for Tony and Leah’s baptism;
they had left the other out to Guimba yesterday.  Mae made two Texas cakes for
this evening.  We attended Tony’s baptism and I had the privilege of baptizing
him.  Leah will have to be interviewed by a member of the Mission Presidency
before she can be baptized so we are not sure if it will be tomorrow or not. 
She is quite concerned about it but it is just something that the Elders cannot
give clearance on.  We stopped and bought LP gas on the way home.  It has
increased in cost by fifty five pesos.  We had to hurry to leave for Guimba so
we can set up for tonight.  The evening went well and we had a good turnout. 
They seemed to enjoy the DVD of “Building Faith in Christ”.  After the showing
President Baccay had both Mae and I give a short talk.  We have become very
close to many in the Branch and it is hard to leave them.  Many expressed their
love for us.  We got home a little after 5:30 PM and then had to unload.  We
were both very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did sleep
in until 6 this morning.  It was good to return to the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>
branch and see so many that we know.  Tony was presented as a new member of
baptism and confirmed by President Nieto.  He was also presented to be ordained
to the Aaronic Priesthood to the office of a Priest.  Tony was given the
opportunity to bear his testimony during the sacrament meeting.  During the
opening of Priesthood meeting I had the opportunity to confer the Aaronic
Priesthood upon Tony and ordain him to the office of a Priest.  The AP’s were
there right after meeting and they told us that President and Sister Brimhall
were on their way so that President Brimhall could interview Leah.  They soon
came and the interview was done and approval for her to be baptized was given. 
Tony said that they would just go to their café and eat rather than go all the
way home and back.  We stayed for the 1<sup>st</sup> branch’s Sacrament meeting
as President Brimhall and Sister Brimhall were attending there.  We then came
home and got some lunch and went back to the Baptismal for Leah and Alyn.  Tony
performed the baptism and though it took him three tries with Leah he did
well.  Leah said that the first 2 attempts just didn’t feel right but she bore
testimony of the wonderful feeling she felt the 3<sup>rd</sup> time.  Tiny said
he also felt the difference when he did it right.  He had no problem doing it
with Alan.  There was also an eight year old boy, Doncarles Ganzagan baptized
by his father following Leah and Alyn.  Doncarles was then confirmed a member
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints.  Leah and Alan will be
confirmed in Sacrament meeting next week.  This evening Mae and I popped some
pop corn and played rummy for a while.  We then tried to get onto the instant
messaging.  It took a while but we did make it.</span></p>

went walking.  After breakfast we tried to get onto instant messaging but were
not able.  We were very disappointed.  I took a nap.  Scott called and talked
to Mae for a few minutes so that helped Mae feel better over the failure to get
through this morning.  We met with Sonny Cabuyaban and gave him some
information on Family History.  Elder &amp; Sister Clark came about 11:30, we
visited and then went down to Tony’s for lunch.  We had a great time visiting
and enjoyed visiting with Tony also.  We stopped back at our place for a little
while and visited until they had to leave.  This evening we went out to Tony
and Leah’s for Family Home Evening as Alyn is planning the lesson.  Alyn did a
very good job, it is amazing how she has progressed and is coming out of her
shyness.  </span></p>

going to fast this morning so just went walking form our house.  After getting
home and starting to shower I realized that something was wrong with Mae.  When
I asked her about I found out that I had hurt her feelings a couple of days ago
and it was still bothering her.  Besides apologizing to her, I told her that
when we had been counseled by Elder La Grand Richards; to never go to bed with
feelings, and reminded that that meant both of us.  We prepared breakfast and
had Elder’s Aspinall and Natad over and then held a correlation meeting.  We
helped them with a “Baptismal Program” layout, and then Mae got showing them
family pictures.  Mae swept under the all the furniture in the living room as
Marlyn doesn’t do the best job in that area. Time went fast the rest of the day
and we soon had to go out top Guimba for a meeting on the “National Family
Week” plans.  That seemed to go quite well.  We got home about 9 PM so while
Mae was doing other items I made my journal entry.  We often play a couple of
games on the computer at night just to unwind.  I played a couple and then Mae
played a game while I was doing my teeth.  I also have been having some problem
with an ingrown toenail so I fixed it before we went to bed.</span></p>

came home the Brongay was spraying for mosquitoes, so we paid them P25 or 50
cents and they seemed happy with that.  I prepared French toast, pork chops and
fried potatoes for breakfast. Marlyn had me help her take the front room
curtains down so she could wash them today.  We got on the instant messaging
with Jeff this morning and that was fun.  We were glad that it worked today. 
We went to the bank and made our monthly draw and then went grocery shopping. 
Marlyn had dinner ready when we got home.  She had the drapes ready to hang,
but we were in a hurry to leave for Tarlac.  We got there in time to go to OUI
Tailoring and get my suit before we went to the Stake Center for an open house
to meet the Hyer’s two daughters that are for a few days visit.  After the open
house we went to McDonald’s with the Maharry’s.  We enjoyed visiting with
them.  It was 8 PM when we got home.  Mae had me help her put up the curtains
this evening.  I then made my entry and that took up the evening.  We played a

while she was on the computer.  I texted President Mercado suggesting that we
view October General Conference a week after but he texted me back and said
that he would have to get the Area Presidency’s permission to do that.  Oh well
we only have 5 months left before we go home.  We went to Tony’s for dinner at
6 PM.  He hadn’t been busy all afternoon but had some customers come in after
we got there.  We always enjoy visiting with them.  It really started to rain
while we were there.  We stopped at President Gajonera’s and gave him some
training information that we will be willing to give his branch this next
month.  We came home and Mae gave me a hair cut.  We got on the internet and
had a letter from Jeff, Shellie and Georgia.  It was good to hear from them.  I

addresses.  President Nadado then spoke.  They had some of the class rooms set
up for genealogy and family history training and displays.  We then separated
and went to the District Development training.  Mae had brownies for the Elders
after meeting.  We got a chance to visit with President Nadado but didn’t make
any plans.  It was after 1 PM when we got home.  We got something for lunch and
then Mae laid for a nap while I started a letter to Bob and Mark.  When Mae
woke I lay down and she worked on the computer.  She wrote a letter to our
family.  I slept for over 1 ½ hrs.  We got things ready for the Sylvia’s to
come this evening.  We bought take out from Tony’s for dinner tonight.  Wile
Roger and Heidi were here we watched the DVD “Brigham”.  The really enjoyed it
and it was a fun evening for them and for us.  President Brimhall texted us and
said our car was in but they had to wait for licensing, maybe by next Wednesday
we can go to Angeles to get it and take the old one in.  That may be good for
we are still having some A/C problems.  We sent the e-mail to Mark, asking Bob
about staying in their basement for a while after we get home.  I also asked
them to send us some capsules &amp; some acidophilus. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and left for Guimba before 6:30 AM to help with the National Family
Week.  We showed DVDs and videos all day.  We had a fair attendance of members
but I didn’t see any non-members.  Due to the short preparation time given Sony
Cabuyaban he didn’t have time to advertise the event through out the
communities. We started cleaning up shortly after 4 PM and left for home about
5 PM.  We texted Tony and ask if it was too late to stop in for something to
eat.  We had egg salad sandwiches with fries.  We enjoyed visiting with Tony
and Alyn as we ate.  He had a family come in just as we were leaving.  When we
got home Mae laid down for a few minutes so I got things unloaded and the
computer set up.  I tried to enter my journal but was too tired to think and it
had not been long enough for me to lie down after eating.  After Mae got up,
she took a shower.  I had played a few games on the computer to relax and then
entered my journal.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We attended
the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> Branch so that we might participate in the
confirmation of Leah and Alyn.  I was able to confirm Alyn while Brother Nuque
confirmed Leah.  We were discouraged that Sister Neito didn’t stay and take
care of her responsibilities as Primary President and with her not staying her
two counselors also went home.  If Mae had of felt better I think she would
have stayed to help with the children.  We came home and took a nap and had
some lunch between meetings but went back and attended the full block of Munoz
1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  At the conclusion of the block I stayed for P.E.C. and
felt very discouraged at the conclusion.  All the meetings are totally conducted
in Tagalog and I felt that I had just as well stayed home.  I just don’t know
if we are doing enough to make any difference.  Mae isn’t feeling well and lay
down for a few minutes when we got home.  We ate some soup and then watched a
DVD of “Lady &amp; the Tramp”.  Mae went to sleep but I stayed up for a while. 
Elder Maharry called to let us know he had been released from the Branch
Presidency today.  Brother Cabuyaban called me to say thanks us for our help
yesterday.  He also asked if I would transfer P2 to his cell phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were both
sick during the night.  I was not as bad as Mae.  She ran a fever most of the
night but felt some better this morning.  I mainly had a sore throat and when I
gargled with salt water and vinegar it helped a lot.  Marlyn went on a trip
over the weekend so her mother came in her place.  That may be good as there is
possibilities that Marlyn may look for employment abroad and that will give
some experience to see if we will have her mother finish the last of our
mission with us.  We were able to get on the instant messaging with our boys
this morning.  We did get cut off before we had finished.  By the time we got
back on all had left except Jeff.  I got on with him and played a game of
harts.  Mae texted Tony and Leah to let them know that we are sick and we wouldn’t
come tonight for Family Home Evening.  They immediately came over bring some
limes for us and asking what they could for us.  They are special people.  President
Brimhall called us to let us know that the Couple Missionaries meeting would be
changed to October 6<sup>th</sup>.  Elder Clark texted me, asking about a
correction to be made to a membership record.  After lunch we lay down and went
to sleep.  Nita came and gave both of us a treatment.  We just relaxed and
watched the DVD of “Lady &amp; the Tramp II” and the “Little Mermaid Returns to
the Sea”.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were still
sick this morning and so mainly stayed down.  President Brimhall called to let
me know that the car would be in tomorrow.  He latter called to give us the
time of 11 to 11:30 AM.  I did go to San Jose to get some groceries.  I have
been rather depressed about the work and the activity here.  The trip to San
Jose had several small discouraging events that didn’t help my attitude. 
Sister Emmy Baltazar has texted us several times this evening.  Mae still had
to put her hair up at 9 PM so I played a game on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at
4:30 AM to get ready and leave for Angeles.  Sister Baltazar texted us and ask
if we could stop on our way.  When we did she wanted to know if she could go to
Angeles with us, as she needs to look for a place to live for it sound like she
is going to get the job there.  We can’t take her but we gave her P400 for the
bus.  We explained that we can’t let people ride in the car except to
accomplish missionary work.  We stopped at McDonald’s in Capus for breakfast. 
We got to Angeles in time to check on an Auto Cad program, get the two picture
frames we had ordered, check at the wood carvers shop and to get some groceries
at the Duty Free Shop on Clark Base before going to the mission office.  We got
to meet the new Elders and Sister Missionaries that just got here.  It was almost
noon before the driver from Manila got there with our new car.  It is a Toyota
Reva, color Lithium (a golden tan).  It seems to be a very nice van and handles
very well.  We stopped in Tarlac at the mall and bought some VHS tapes so that
we can have General Conference recorded for us.  We were tired when we got
home, but while I was unloading Ed and Jimmy came over to see the car and we
visited with them for a while.  They asked us about having the car christened
for that is a custom among the Filipinos when you buy something new.  (It now
made since as to the car blessing that President Neito had.)  We didn’t say
anything but that is Catholic tradition not Mormon culture.  Marlyn had made us
some porridge that we warmed up for supper.  I got on the internet and did a
reply to Mark, to Jeff and wrote a short letter to all of our children asking
for their Wedding dates.  We were tired so soon went to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Both Mae and
I slept well.  I got up about 4:30 AM and was up for about 1 ½ hr before going
back to bed until almost 8AM.  I started updating our budget and Mae started
getting items to send home organized.  We got a message from Sister Amie
Baltazar that she got the job and will start training on Monday.  There is a
problem though; she doesn’t have the finances to get started.  I called
President Baccay and scheduled a meeting with the three of us.  I tried to get
her to go to the dentist tomorrow, but when I called and we talked to Dr
Rosella she feels that Amie needs to first have a medical examination before
she comes in on her teeth, so that is on hold.  After figuring the financial
needs I had President Baccay talk to President Mercado and there is some
concern as to how much will be approved.  I left President Baccay with the
decision as to what help will be given and told him that if she doesn’t take
the job because of finances then what will they do.  Oh well I don’t know how
to help.  I came home quite frustrated, plus the traffic was upsetting today
and I don’t feel good.  I came home and took a nap.  Not feeling well is
frustrating in it self.  This evening we got one box of items packed in
preparation to shipping some things home.</span></p>
