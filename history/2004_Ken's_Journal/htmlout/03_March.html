<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
until 7 AM and I think that through us off all day.  We didn’t go walking, but
things just seem to keep us going all day.  Marlin came over and washed our
car.  We got on the computer on instant-messaging with Mike, Scott and Jeff. 
The Elders came over so I visited with them while Mae stayed on the computer
with our boys.  I went to the Gem Book Store and got some cards for our cell
phone.  We got the monthly reports completed today and sent to the office.  I
worked this evening getting loan papers set up for President Cabuyaban and a
record of the loan we made to Roger Silvia with his computer for collateral. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae set the
alarm last night but hadn’t changed the setting from the other day when we went
to the Temple.  The alarm therefore went off at 3:30
 AM.  We had been up for a few minutes when I looked at a clock.  I asked Mae
to check another clock, as this one was wrong.  When we found that we were up
to early, we went back to sleep for a couple of hours.  We went walking at the
collage, came home and gave each other hair cuts, before taking our showers. 
President Cabuyaban and Brother Corpuz, his 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor, came by
and we spent some time finishing up a Loan Contract to help him with his farming. 
I believe that we have set it up in such a way that it will be a help to him.  Before
they came here, they went over to President Gasmenia’s.  On the way here, they
saw a snake and with rocks killed it, it was a cobra.   We haven’t heard from
Sandi to know if she is going to finance this loan, we hope so.  Mae hasn’t
felt the best today.  I went downtown and paid the phone bill, bought some LP
gas, got the care serviced and filled with gas.  This evening Roger Silvia came
over and made some corrections to our computer.  I talked to him about the
problem we are having with the projector showing DVD’s.  He could not figure
out the problem either.  Elder Weber and Elder Ebonza came by to get the Branch
Organization reports.  We scanned several pictures into the computer this
evening.  It was 10 PM before we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Wednesday, March 03, 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t go
walking this morning, to tired to get up, and then at 7
 AM our landlord called to see if they could repair our C R today.  Mae told
them yes, but we still needed to take showers.  Ten minutes later the door bell
rang and they were here to measure for parts.  We did get our showers before
they got back.  I made a temporary C R out in the shed, as Mae isn’t feeling
the best and I felt this would help her out.  We didn’t go to Cabanatuan to
Zone conference, because Mae wasn’t feeling well and the repairs on our C R. 
We had thought of attending Zone Conference there, as we have several things
tomorrow.  Most of this morning and part of this afternoon was spent scanning
in the pictures we got at the Distribution Center.  This afternoon we went out
to Guimba to attend the Youth mid-week activity.  When we got there, all there
was, was primary children.  The primary presidency came and they were playing games. 
The Young Woman finally came, but the planed activity fell through because the
lady that was going to teach choir didn’t come.  Mae ended up teaching 25 to 30
youth a Mutual lesson.  I tried to set in the car and work on the computer, but
I had primary children all over the car and three times they set the car alarm
off, playing with the locks.  I finally started the car and rolled up the
windows and locked the doors so I could get something accomplished.  President
Clark called just as we were getting home.  I visited with him for a few
minutes.  I had to do some work on the toilet to get it to stop leaking.  We
worked on Mae’s presentation for a while, then I had to fill in my journal for
today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Thursday, March 04, 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at 5:30
this morning, but didn’t go walking as we got on instant messaging with Jeff.  Jeff
is having some personal problems and we wish so much to be able to help him.  I
am not sure how we can do that except to continue to pray for the Spirit of the
Lord to touch his understanding. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We
went out to the Guimba District Hospital, picking us president Cabuyaban on the
way. We were there to help support as the Humanitarian Services as they made a
large donation to the Hospital, of equipment and supplies.  That was special to
be a part of it.   Also Brother and Sister Umipig followed us out but took
their own car.  We were there when the truck from the Church Humanitarian
office came with the hospital supplies.  Elder and Sister Swenson and Brother
Garcia soon arrived.  We backed the truck to the front door and started
carrying in supplies.  The hospital director and staff watched with excitement
as boxes were carried in and Elder Swenson checked the shipment.  A brief
acceptance ceremony meeting was held at which the director of the hospital
expressed appreciation.  Elder Swenson gave a short talk as to the fact that it
was not a large rich church that was providing these items, but many
individuals that gave their offerings to the Lord to help where He saw the
need, even the widows mite.  He also explained that they and Mae &amp; I as do
the other missionaries, pay our own way to serve as missionaries.  Brother
Garcia spoke and also explained that his part in this program is a calling that
he had been given and he to paid his own expenses.  Rose (the hospitals head
nurse, and also a member of the Church) was the M. C. for the program.  After
the program was over she came over to Mae and hugged her saying that they
didn’t know if this would ever materialize.  She just hugged Mae and the two of
them cried.  Rose also commented, that this was the first time she had ever
been a M. C.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>After
the program we returned to Munoz to the Zone Conference and enjoyed the last of
it.  During the Zone Conferences, President Brimhall recognizes those having
Birthdays since the last Zone Conference.  He does so by giving all those
honored a Snicker candy bar.  For me he gave a package of Reese’s Sugar Free
Peanut Butter Cups.  They were very good and I saved some of them for later. Elder
and Sister Clark were able to come to this zone conference, so after it ended
we had them come over to our place to eat lunch and visit before they returned
home.   We sure enjoy visiting with them.  They left about 4:30
 PM for home.  Mae and I both played a couple of computer games.  I then worked
on my presentations and sent a e-mail to President Brimhall asking for his help
with some items in my presentation.  Mae typed a letter to Jeff.  We are late
getting to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early but didn’t go walking.  We attended District Development at Munoz today. 
Mae had made Chocolate Chip cookies for the Elders, they sure liked those. 
Marlyn had dinner ready for us when we got home.  After lunch we took a nap,
then worked on the computer the rest of the day.  You can sure spend a lot of
time when you start on a computer.  We got Mae’s presentation finished up and I
did a lot on mine.  Mae also got a letter written to Jeff.  We hope it will
help him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were up
early so we could get on for just a few minutes with Jeff on instant messaging
before we left at 7:15 to pickup three young sisters from the Guimba District
to attend the a special Young Men Mission Preparation Conference at Paniqui
District Center.  When we got there one of the young men had a  python snake so
I held it so Mae could take a picture of it.  I guess we shouldn’t have done
that because we are cautioned not to touch any animals.  Oh well!  It was a
great conference and we hope it will cause some of the youth to think about
preparing for a mission.  After getting home we attended a convert Baptism for
Avelina Ordanza of the Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup> branch.  We were tired when we got
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in,
and then worked on presentations for a little while.  We left for Church at 11:15
 AM and stopped at Guimba 3 so Mae could visit with the District primary
president.  We got to Moncada 1<sup>st</sup> Branch just before 1
 PM, but they were already starting.  Mae bore her testimony in Tagalog, so
people thought she could speak in Tagalog.  She soon had to let them know that
she didn’t say much.  After Sacrament meeting, Mae went into the Primary.  I
went into the youth Sunday school.  There was only one young man and he soon
left.  The teacher did a very good job at teaching the lesson.  I attended the
Priesthood and it was just for the older brethren.  After the meeting, I
visited with the Young Men’s president.  We then attended the Branch Counsel
meeting and that went very good.  Mae and I took about 20 minutes explaining
what our assignments were.  After the meeting we went to the elder’s home and
got Elder Elison and Elder Lopez.  They took us to Brother Tabbilos’s to visit
him as he just got home from the hospital.  He had a tumor in his throat that
they had to remove.  He has lost a lot of weight and still has a hard time
talking very loud, but he is doing very well.  We enjoyed a nice visit with he,
his wife and their daughter.  It was after 8
 PM when we got home and got something to eat.  Mae has had cramps in her feet
this evening.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke at 4
 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep thinking about the kids and their problems. 
I don’t know what I could do more if I were home, so I guess it is best that we
are here, so I can call on the Lord to watch over them.  Mae got up at 5:30
 AM and we went walking.  That seems to really help both of us with our back
problems.  After getting back and showering, I prepared breakfast while Mae
worked on the letter to our family.  I lay down and just got to sleep when I
had acid reflex which woke me.  We got on instant messaging with Scott, Jeff
and Mike.  While they were on with us, they also called David and Sandi.  All
the boys are going out to Sandi’s tomorrow afternoon.  We were excited about
that.  Mae was on the inter-net for quite a bit of the day, but got quite a lot
done.  This afternoon we went over to San Jose grocery shopping and mailed some
cards through LBC.  I updated our checking account and balanced our checkbook.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
went walking this morning.  We showered, had breakfast, read the scriptures,
and then I went out to visit President Cabuyaban about his farm.  He is coming
along fairly well, although he has some extra expenses that he hadn’t planned
on.  I got home at noon.  Mae &amp; I worked on the computers the rest of the
day and evening.  President Brimhall called this evening and asked if I would
give the Spiritual thought for the meeting.  He also asked that we give some of
our ideas on accomplishing what the Area Presidency is asking couple
missionaries to do.  President Cabuyaban called and asked that we keep him in
our prayers, as he isn’t feeling very good this evening.  We were up late
getting things ready for going tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We left
shortly after 6 AM for Tarlac.  We got to McDonalds right at 7:30,
the Maharry’s were already there and the Hyer’s came shortly after.  We enjoyed
visiting as we ate breakfast.  Mae and I followed the Hyer’s over to their
office after leaving McDonald’s.  We were just going to get some papers from
them, but a couple was there to show Sister Hyer some jewelry, but Mae stayed
to look at it.  That put us behind time, and then when we got to Mabaloket, the
traffic was backed up waiting to get around the detour for the road.  We got
held up there about a hour.  We stopped at the bank and cashed a check so I
would have the money to loan President Cabuyaban.  When we got to the Mission office, they were in a staff meeting.  As soon as it was over we went upstairs and
started our meeting with all the couple missionaries.  Sister Brimhall had
lunch for us.  We then finished the meeting.  President Brimhall confirmed what
I thought and that is that our assignment had been changed to leadership
training and not to worry about the 5 family activation programs.  After the
meeting all of us went over to a quilt shop.  We are going to order a quilt for
our bed at home.  Before leaving Clark Field for home, we stopped at the Duty
Free store and bought a few items.  We got home about 9
 PM, very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up and
prepared breakfast and had the four Munoz Elders over to eat.  I worked on the
computer getting the books up to date on Pres. Cabuyaban’s farm.  I left about 12:15
 PM to go out and visit President Cabuyaban.  After visiting with him, I
stopped at a door shop and visited about having them make us the doors for our
new home in Wyoming.  When I got home Mae and I looked for a while to find our
checkbooks.  We finally found where we had put them.  I did some more work on
my presentation.  Mae and I then started on of the films we bought last night
at the Duty Free Store.  I tried to get the projector to work on the Disks we
had bought.  I can play them on our computer, but I cam not project them.  Mae
made cookies for the Elders this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We had to
leave by 7:30 this morning to go to the District Development meeting at the
Paniqui district.  This is the last time we will see Elder Lopez, as he leaves
to go home on Tuesday.  We have enjoyed getting to know him.  He is a fine
Elder and the mission will miss him.  On the way home we stopped at the Guimba
 District Hospital and visited with Rose.  We will bring the little girl, Noemi
Baliola, from Moncada 1<sup>st</sup> Branch to have Rose and the Umipig’s
daughter check her to see if they have any idea how to help her.  We got home a
little after 1 PM.  Marlyn had dinner ready, so we ate and took a nap.  I did
some work on President Cabuyaban’s farm papers.  I changed the gas tank on the
stove and as I took the empty tank out to the storage shed, I put my back out
of place.  I hope this old body will hold out for another year.  Mae and I
worked on a letter to take to the Branch’s, prior to our one month training period
at a branch, to get better organized when we get there.  I got to the point
where I was confused, so we quit and watched the rest of “Lion King”.  Sister
Brimhall called and talked to Mae saying that her and President Brimhall had
just finished reading the evaluations on the two branches (Guimba 2 and Moncada
1) which we have been working with, plus our goals for the month and plan of
action.  She told us “thanks”, that they liked them, and that they appreciated
the hard work we were doing.  They visited for a while and Mae mentioned that
we were working on a letter and schedule form to go out to the branch president
prior to going there, letting them know of our plans and assignments from Pres.
Oaks and Pres. Brimhall and asking for dates &amp; times to do the various
trainings.  Sister Brimhall got excited and said that was great.  After she
hung up, the phone rang again and it was President Brimhall.  He had called
because Sister Brimhall had told him about this letter &amp; schedule and he
said he was really excited about that and to put his name in our letter as
stating he gave full support of this.  He also asked us to promote the Liahona
in our trainings.  President and Sister Brimhall are great.  We love them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Soon after waking up this
morning, we received a text message from Pres. Cabuyaban saying</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>“GUD MORNING! EARLIN G DIS AM
I VISITED D NURSERY, N WAT DID I SEE? NO POPCORN POPPING BECOZ DER WAS NO
APRICOT TREE, BUT I SEE THOSE PLANTS MENT 2 BECOME MONEY SOON!”  We got a kick
out of this cute message.  I responded “GUD AM, WHOEVER SAID MONEY DON’T GROW
ON TREES DIDN’T WORK HARD AND PRAY HARD.  BUT DON’T COUNT MONEY TIL HARVEST.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We did go
walking this morning although both of us are not feeling very well.  My problem
is still from my back, which the walk seemed to help.  Mae’s eyes are starting
to give her a lot of pain.  She started taking the medication that she had
received before we came on our mission.  Her eyes continued to get worse as the
day progressed.  This evening we had the Silvia’s over for dinner.  We put on
the show “Lion King” for the children to watch, but they were pretty hyper. 
Roger helped me give Mae a blessing.  Shortly after the Silvia’s left, the
Elders came.  I went through my presentation on “interviews” with them.  Elder Clark called and helped me with some questions concerning my presentation.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Mae let me
sleep in this morning.  It was good as I didn’t get to bed until almost
mid-night.  We had to hurry in order to be ready to leave for Moncada 1<sup>st</sup>
branch, as Mae wanted to be there a little early.  We got a rough draft of a
training schedule printed off and I gave it to President Cortez.  Mae and I
attended the primary.  After sharing time I left and as there wasn’t a youth
program, I set the computer up in a room and typed a letter to Pres Nadado. 
After meetings Mae spent about 1 ½ hours training the Primary President and her
one counselor.  We stopped at the Guimba chapel, on the way home and met with
President Dela Cruz and President Cabuyaban and we went over some of the needs
to the building.  I will try to get something done in this area.  After getting
home we worked on the letters to the Branch Presidency and the District
Presidency so that I could send them to President Brimhall for his approval. 
We were late getting to bed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking at the collage this morning.  As we walked we discussed Sandi and the
situation that she is going through.  Oh, how I wish we could be there.  This
evening we sent her a e-mail that I hope she can get the feelings of love we
have for her.  We were late and before we finished taking our showers, Marlyn
came to start her day.  She doesn’t get here on Mondays until 8:30
or 9:00 as she goes to the palanki first.  By the time we ate breakfast it was
time to get on instant messaging with the boys.  David sent us a beautiful
e-mail and yet it leaves us concerned for Shauna and their new baby.  Shauna is
having labor pains and is on medication to, hopefully hold of the delivery for
a little longer as she is only 7 months along.  We enjoyed visiting with the
boys.  While we were on line with them, President Neito came so I went out and
visited with him for a few minutes.  Marlin Dater also came and washed the
car.  We got an e-mail from Roger Silvia, this morning, that had us a little
concerned.  He asked if he could come and talk to us about a problem, this
evening.  We were concerned that there might be problems, but when he came this
evening, he just wants to let Jo Jo Persarden use the computer for a few days. 
Jo Jo is finishing up his collage finales and needs a computer to do so. 
Brother Persarden offered Roger P2,000 for the use of it.  Roger will need to
repair the CD drive for P600 before Jo Jo can use it.  He will give us P1,400
now and then when in two weeks Jo Jo is finished Roger will bring the computer
back to us.  We agreed with that plan as it will help Jo Jo out and will pay
Roger the P1.400 towards the loan he has with us.  We did go to San
  Jose this afternoon to do some shopping.  I sent President Brimhall the
following white report.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In Wednesday’s meeting you
counseled us to go out on our “P” day.  So we did and wanted to tell you how
much fun we had.  We went out to eat, at our one and only restaurant,
Jollibees, and instead of eating at the tables on the main floor, we went
upstairs where we could watch the streets of San Jose.  That was one of the
funniest shows we have seen.  That is the main intersection in San
  Jose.  There are three traffic officers on that corner and it was so fun to
watch them<b> try</b> to direct traffic.  Along with watching them get
frustrated, there was always unusual truck loads of whatever.  People dressed
in some of the most unusual ways, trikes loaded with more than they look like
they can hold, of every thing from people to pigs, along with building
materials, produce bags of palay and what ever you can imagine.  To top off
what we could not believe was a jeepnie loaded with (we think) turnips.  Not
only was the bottom filled to capacity, but there were turnips stacked at least
3 feet on the top with no sides to hold them on.  The only thing we could
figure out is they had left enough of the tops on to be tied together.  You
could not see that however, you could only see the turnip it self, but somehow
they not only were three feet above the top, but they hung over.  What an
interesting time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We slept in
this morning so didn’t go walking.  My neck and back is quite tight today.  We
spent most of the day on the computer.  I took a nap after lunch.  I got the
Palm Pilot restored and we got the day planer up to date.  This evening Roger
Silvis brought us the P1,400 payment on the computer loan.  I helped him take
it over to the Parsardan’s  for JoJo to use.  He was quite excited to get it. 
Roger installed the new CD drive and it worked ok.  Elder Ibanza, Ronald Dator
and Ace Dator came over and gave me a blessing.  Mae told me that she loved
me.  That is sure good or it would be a one sided love affair.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I woke with a
lot of pain and soreness, especially through my left shoulder and neck.  We
were already late to go walking, but Mae got on the inter net and just happened
that Jeff was on.  They only visited for a few minutes but Jeff assured Mae
that Gale hadn’t read her letter.  I don’t think it would have bothered Gale if
she had, but Mae was sure worried about it and so it relieved Mae.  That made
it worth the time for her to get on the computer.  We went walking, which
helped me, but the pain continued through the morning.  We decided to try to
find the message therapist that Ace &amp; Ronald told us about last night.  We
understood that it was before you got to Munoz, so we drove all the way to Cabanatuan when we turned around and came back.  It was just inside the Munoz city
bounders that we found it.  We stopped but they were out until 2
 PM.  We came home and though it was noon, I didn’t feel like eating, but went
to bed for a little while.  The Dr. is a Physical Therapist, not a Massage
Therapist.  I had her give me a treatment anyway.  It helped some, but I was
not really satisfied with the results.  I relaxed when we got home and watched
a recording of the Sunday Session of General Conference, April 2000.  Mae
worked on the computer the rest of the day.  I heated some leftovers for
dinner, and then Mae and I rubbed each others feet, and then watched the DVD of
Bambi.  That is still a cute movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up at 5:15
this morning but because we were leaving at 8
 AM for Moncada, we just walked here in the neighborhood.  Mae drove this
morning as my back, arm and neck are still very tight.  We got there at 9:30
 AM and the family was waiting.  We thought that just the mother (nanay) Sister
Imelda Baliola and her little girl, Noemi would be going to the hospital but
instead the father (tatay) and Sister Nida Valenton, the Relief Society
President were going also.  Mae explained that she was driving the car as I was
having trouble and needed to find a massage therapist.  Sister Valenton said that
she was a massage therapist and that she had given Elder Eliason and several
other missionaries treatments.   Brother Baliola hired a trike and they
followed us to the Guimba District Hospital, where Sister Rose (head nurse) and
Dr. Umipig checked her.  Dr. Umipig feels that her problem is due to nutrition,
but wants her to see a specialist.  They have already talked to the specialist
and wants us to take her there.  When I asked Sister Rose if there was any
charge, she gasped and said “No way.”  They are so special and appreciated all
that we have been involved in with the hospital.  We went to the Specialist,
but she was out today and they want them to come back next Wednesday.  The Dr. there
did check Noemi and gave her a prescription.  We bought that for them.  Sister
Valenton told me to get some baby oil, some Ben Gay and some alcohol and she
would give me a treatment.  They were going to follow us to Munoz, but Mae
thought of the Elders apartment there in Guimba.  We went there but the Elders
were gone.  We talked to their landlord, Mrs. _____ , and she let us use a cot
on her porch.  The treatment that Sister Valenton gave me did much more good
than the one I got yesterday.  We stopped at President Cabuyaban’s about noon
and visited with him about his farm.  It was after 2
 PM before we got home.  I worked on the computer getting the farm records
updated.  I’m not feeling very good – sore throat, etc., so went to bed early. 
I didn’t sleep very well tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Although I
didn’t sleep very well last night I felt some better this morning.  We attended
District Development meeting in Guimba.  It was interesting that every
companionship has been changed.  We have two new Elders.  As we talked with the
Elders, I realized that the Elders do not have the “Church Handbook and so do
not know what each meeting is for.  I will look into that for them.  On the way
home we stopped at President Cabuyaban’s and visited with him, concerning the
extra money he is needing.  I hope we are handling this right.  I didn’t feel
very well this afternoon.  Mae kept busy all afternoon and evening preparing
talks for the meetings tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                I didn’t
sleep very good last night, so Mae let me sleep in.  I took her up to the
Chapel at 9 AM as the Guimba District Relief Society was having their Birthday
celebration.  Mae had to speak at it.  I came home and worked on a letter to
the Branch Presidents.  At 11:30 I picked Mae up at the chapel and we went to
the Panique District Chapel for the Relief Society’s there Birthday
Celebration.  Elder and Sister Clark also met us there.  Before we left we were
given several Mangos and turnips.  At 3:30 PM we left there and went to the
Camiline District where we met with the Maharry’s for a special training they
put on for the Primary on how to teach the Children to sing.  It was really
very good and we enjoyed it.  Elder and Sister Maharry invited us over to their
place where they had dinner ready for the six of us.  It was very good and we
enjoyed the company.  We set around and discussed and evaluated the way our
training has been going.  All in all I think we came to the conclusion that we
are each trying to train in a little different manner, but maybe that was good. 
It was after 9:30 PM before Mae and I left, the Clark’s stayed the evening with
them.  We were sure tired when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were too
tired to get up early to attend the Sacrament meeting of Munoz 2<sup>nd</sup>. 
We attended meeting this afternoon at Moncada 1<sup>st</sup> branch.  Mae
trained the Y.W. Presidency after the meetings.  I visited with the Branch
President about the branch training.  He would like us to train all the leaders
next Sunday after the block.  We decided that Mae will train the Sisters in
Visiting Teaching and I will try to train all the Priesthood in one group. 
That is normally 4 to 6 hours of training in 3 or 4 separate groups.  Oh well,
we will try.  We were tired when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and left for Moncada where we met Sister Valenton and Sister Baliola. 
They took us to Brother &amp; Sister Baliola’s home and sister Valenton gave me
another massage therapy treatment.  She isn’t as good as Randy, but it sure
helps.  They also showed us the family farm and gave us a sack full of
tomatoes, egg plant and mangos.   After we got home, we got on the inter-net on
instant with Jeff and Gale.  No one else came on, but they didn’t think we
would be here.  I rested some this afternoon.  Mae was on the computer quite a
bit today and I would get on when she wasn’t.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                Even though I
didn’t feel very well, we got up and went walking at the collage this
morning.   I felt so week that we only walked about ¼ the distance that we
usually walk.  I slept some today, but we still worked on the computer most of
the time.  I did get dressed this afternoon, long enough to go get some keys
and get our overhead projector from the church house.  We sent Sandi a short
e-mail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up early as I am still feeling bad.  I wanted to get a lot done on my
presentation for this week end, but we got capturing pictures and the time goes
so fast.  After lunch I took a short nap, and then we went to San Jose to the
bank and shopping.  The one that we have always dealt with at Bank, Roger
Alberto, informed us that he will be going to Manila to receive some training
for 6 months and then will be an assistant manager some place.  We were glad
for him, but will miss him when we go to the bank.  I worked this evening on my
presentation.  Mae gave Sandi a call and we talked for quite a while.  It was
sure good to talk to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We got up
early and went to Moncada so that Sister Valenton could give me another
treatment.  She worked on me for about 45 minutes to an hour.  Mae then gave
her some training as the Relief Society President.  On the way home we stopped
at President Cabuyaban’s and looked at his farm.  The crop seems to be doing
well.  He plans to start transplanting from the nursery to the main areas
tomorrow.  I want to stop tomorrow and get some pictures of that.  I loaned him
an additional P3,200 for the operational expenses, I hope that will do it for him. 
We came home and got some lunch, and then I took a nap.  I spent the rest of
the day on the computer working on my training for this Sunday.  We got a nice
e-mail from Sandi.  We sure are concerned for her and wish we could lift some
of the load for her.  She says that she feels that she is being blessed with
special blessings because we are serving the Lord.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We picked up
the Elders in Munoz and took them to Guimba for their District Development
Meeting.  We, however, continued on to join the Elders in Paniqui.  We thought
we had got there early but they started at 8:30 AM because President Brimhall
was there for interviews.  We enjoyed the meeting with them.  The Paniqui Zone
got two new Elders, Elder Clarey and _____.  Elder Marks replaced Elder Lopez
as Zone Leader with Elder Elison.  We visited with President Brimhall for a few
minutes before he left.  We wanted to stop and visit with President Nadado.  We
got directions to his home in Gerona from his wife, but when we finally found
it, she had given us directions as if we were coming from the South and we came
from the North.  They have a nice but very humble home. We visited with
President Nadado concerning holding a employment work shop with the Hyer’s,  also
concerning the training of Branch Presidents in holding Interviews.  President
Nadado scheduled for me to give that on the 1<sup>st</sup> Saturday in May.  We
enjoyed visiting with them, and as we left, Mae commented about her pretty
plants.  Sister Nadado insisted that Mae take one of them home.  We stopped at
President Cabuyaban’s, but no one was home.  We took some pictures anyway.  We
got home at 1:30 PM.  Marlyn had dinner ready for us.  I laid down for about a
hour after eating.  I spent the rest of the day on the computer helping Mae
with some printing, but mainly working on my presentation for Sunday with the
Moncada 1<sup>st</sup> Branch leadership.  Mae isn’t feeling very well this
evening, but I can’t get her to quit. </span></p>

to Guimba District Primary Sports Fest. held at Guimba 3<sup>rd</sup> Branch
building.  They had a good program and good attendance.  Elder and Sister Clark
also came out.  It was a good day and we enjoyed being with the Clark’s.  We
stopped at President Cabuyaban’s and watched them transplanting the Pechay
plants.  Yesterday I was concerned at the looks of the transplants, but today
they are looking much better.  We just hope and pray that this is helping
them.  We came home planning on relaxing the rest of the evening, but right
after we got home President Neito called us and invited us to a Branch
activity.  We went and enjoyed it but was glad to come home, very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We didn’t get
up until almost 7 AM.  I started on my presentation for today.  Jo Jo Pasardan
called to see if he could come over for a few minutes.  We had him come over. 
He needs to print some work of, but we couldn’t figure how to do it as my
printer will not hook up to Roger’s computer.  We left for Moncada with plenty
of time, and so when we got passed Guimba I decided to take a road that Elder
Clark told me was a shorter way to Moncada.  We took a wrong turn some where
and got lost.  After asking several people, we made it to church 10 minutes
late.  That was a mistake.  We attended Moncada 1<sup>st</sup> Branch.  After
the block program, we held training for the leadership.  Mae took the Sisters
and trained them on Visiting Teaching.  I took the Priesthood Executive Committee
and trained them all together.  That training usually takes four or five sessions
at 1 to 2 hours each.  I took 1 ½ hours this evening.  I think it went fairly
well.  We then picked up Elder Elison and Elder Marks , and we went to visit
Brother and Sister Roger Tabbilos.  It was 9 PM when we got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We were not
sure when Sister Nida Valenton was coming to give us a treatment.  We didn’t go
walking and took quick showers, so we would be ready when she came.  I prepared
breakfast of egg omelet but was not sure if we would have others here and how
many if they came.  We did finish our breakfast and started on the family
letter, before she got here.  While she started on me, Mae got on instant
messaging with our children.  After she finished with me, I took over the
computer while Mae got a treatment.  It was good to be on with our children. 
All of them were on with us except for Shellie.  We visited there until almost
noon.  After lunch Mae got on the computer and sent our family letter.  I took
a nap.  At 3 PM Sister Rubio came over and visited with Mae.  She stayed until
8 PM visiting.  She informed us of many things that are going on in the
branches that are wrong.  I am not sure just what to do about them, but it
makes you wonder about the strength of the people.  It is no wonder that the
Lord withholds his blessings.  We got some dinner, read an article in the
Ensign and got ready for bed.  It was late when we got to bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>                We went
walking this morning at the collage.  There is a termite hill that someone is
cutting away.  It was interesting to us as we have heard that they are very
superstitious that little people lives in those hills and if you disturb the
hill, you will be cursed.  A couple of weeks ago, we saw where some men had to
dig a termite hill away in order to run water lines.  The next time we went by
there, there was a small cross and some flowers similar to what you would put
on a grave.  We found it very interesting.  After breakfast I went to San Jose
and met with President Apao about the needs to Guimba 1 &amp; 2 chapel.  I
apologized to him that the communications had went the way they did.  He was
very receptive and explained all the procedure.  I took the Zl’s a letter for
the Paniqui 1<sup>st</sup> branch and a letter to Sister Clark containing the
reimbursements for March and the charges for April.  I then went out to
President Cabuyaban’s and we went over his farm project.  I brought President
Cabuyaban back to Munoz with me.  On the way I mentioned that I had seen a palay
cutter and it cut more than a dozen men could cut.  He said that the government
would not let them use it because it would put people out of work.  It was
almost 2 PM when I got home.  Mae fixed some lunch.  I took a nap after lunch. 
This evening Mae and I went to visit the Pasardan’s to see if everything was settled
with the tithing problem.  President Brimhall had visited with them and things
are looking better now.  While visiting, Brother Pasardan told me he was
teaching an auto mechanic’s class on Saturdays.  He said that he has a 68 year
old lady taking the class.  He asked her why, at her age, she wanted to take a
class like that.  She told him that she has two vehicles and her chauffer was
always telling her that he needed to repair them, but she doesn’t know if he is
doing it or not, so she wants to know what he is doing.  We had a nice visit
with them.  We worked on the budget after getting home, ate and did my
journal.  Was late going to bed.</span></p>

went walking this morning.  When we got home and took our showers, Mae’s back
was spotted all over with bites of some kind.  She noticed that when she sat on
the couch at the Pasardan’s last night and leaned against the covering, she
began to itch.  We are not sure just what it is, but are watching it.  I ran
some errorns this morning get some LP gas, gas in the car and checking on new
tires for the car. Mae worked on the computer getting some songs printed for
the Primary’s.  I took a nap.  Brother Sylvia came over and they would like to
take the hard drive from their computer to repair another.  They will get paid
on the 15<sup>th</sup> and plan on paying us in full at that time.  We said to
go ahead.  I worked on a presentation for the Guimba 2<sup>nd</sup> branch for
this Saturday, but became a little frustrated with it.  </span></p>
