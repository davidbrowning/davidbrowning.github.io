ideas I came up with I don't want to lose

Who are you?
You, the one reading this. Most of us have an elaborate story we like to tell when answering this question fully. Have you ever questioned that story?

My ask is that you give me 6 months to help you get life straightened out. Commit to re-thinking how you approach life and be open to forces bigger than any of us. I don’t have any magic pills or quick fixes. We have work to do. Let’s get going.

Life has taught me 2 critical lessons so far

    I am not in control, life unfolds around me in a beautiful way regardless of what I want to happen. Going with the flow is something that was drilled into me during the time I spent in West Africa, and I want to share that lesson with others

    The world is already exactly how it "should" be. We spend days, months, and some of us years steamed because the world we see around us isn't the way we think it ought to be. The second we let go of this imaginary world that exists only in our troubled mind is the moment we can change ourselves for the better

My objective: Help you realize what you can and cannot control. I want you to stop rejecting what you wish wasn't there and fully embrace what is

Let go of your “self” and fly

For me, obesity was a form of suicide. I was so appalled by what I saw around me that I didn't want to be a part of it anymore, and I was too scared to use more traditional methods. Something clicked inside me and showed me there is no way that the world "should" be. The moment I let that idea go, the weight I felt lifted and within a year, the physical weight (100 lbs) left too. This idea of a perfect world you're holding on to is actually holding you down. I want to teach you how to go beyond what you think the world should be so you can stop "should-ing" yourself.

The story I tell myself when I think about how I got to this moment involves a middle class religious upbringing, mistakes, missionary service in West Africa, more mistakes, working with vulnerable people with disabilities, some more mistakes, marrying the love of my life, working three jobs to support a family while pursuing higher education, more mistakes, alcoholism, depression, obesity, and finally discovering a handful of truths that brought me out of the patterns that had been running and ruining my life.
