<h2> Today I learned </h2>
<h1> 2/11/2016 </h1><br><p>Today I learned a lot about how to use vim. I am starting to practice, and improve my understanding of the language. Specifically, I learned how to jump up, down, left, and right using the hjkl keys. I learned that y is 'yank' and p is for 'paste'.</p>



</br>

<h1> 2/18/2016 </h1><br><p>Today I learned how to host a webpage using nodejs, a little about the express package, and several additional commands to use within vim.

	  The specific vim commands are:<br>
	  <ol>
		<li> o and O to insert a new line below and above the cursor respectively.</li>
		<li> 0 to jump to the beginning of a line </li>
		<li> :set number to display line numbers </li>
		<li> :noh to clear the highlighted text until the next search '/' command </li>
		<li> #G or #gg to jump to a specified line number </li>
	</ol>
	  </p>
</br>
<h1> 2/23/2016 </h1><br><p>Today I learned that you can download content directly from a page if you copy the URL and paste it into the downloads section of firefox. I also picked up another vim command, 'R' is for replace. It acts just like 'overtype' in ms word, namely, that it replaces all characters you type starting wherever you initiated the command.</p>

</br>
<h1> 9/1/2016 </h1><br><p>Today I learned that the reason you can't just boot in to safe mode with f8 is that the boot process is just too fast. Technically, the commands f8 or shift + f8 still work, but there isn't enough time for the operating system to recognize them, thus MS added in a way to reach troubleshooting if the OS failes to load 3(?) times.

</br>I also picked up an incredibly useful powershell function:

</br>[System.Data.SQL.SQLDataSourceEnumerator]::Instance.GetDataSources()

</br>I found it on <a href="https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/2013/find-sql-server-instances-across-your-network-using-windows-powershell/">this</a> article by Edwin Sarmiento. It queries all the SQL instances on your network, and returns the host and instance names of the SQL servers it finds. 
</p>

<h1> 9/8/2016 </h1>
</br>
<p>
Today I learned how to verify a checksum. </br>
$ sha256sum &lsaquo; file to check &rsaquo; </br>
is the typical command on many linux flavors. </br>
You then compare this hash to the one on the downloads page from which you received the file.</br> If the two are the same, the check passes. 
</p>

<h1> 12/19/2016 </h1>
</br>
<p>
Today I learned how to access pieces of an expression you've already found with a reg-ex </br>
(Specifically with powershell, but according to powershell.org the syntax is the regex standard)</br>
So you've got a string (We're going to stick with the example from powershell.org) "Don Jones". </br>
You'd like to swap first and last names. Here's how you do it: "Don Jones" -replace "([a-z]+)\s([a-z])"+,'$2,$1' </br>
The result: "Jones Dan" </br> </br>
In the instance where I needed this idea, I had the following two expressions,    
  [regex]$begOfName = '(\d)(,)([A-Z])';, and
  [regex]$endOfName = '([A-Z].?)(,)(\d)';. </br>
  
Basically, when you export as a .csv from powershell, in compliance with the .csv standard, it puts " (double quotes) around every item. 
I didn't want that for the project I was working on, I only wanted quotes around the name of the person behold: </br>

$obj_arr | ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation |%{$_ -replace('"','') -replace($begOfName,',"$3') -replace($endOfName, '$1",$3') ; }|Out-File output.csv -fo -en ascii </br></br>
In essence: take my objects, convert them to a .csv replace all the double quotes, then add them back in where I need them. (I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but it
was sufficient for what I was doing. 

Also, I realized that the reason a String[] is passed to the main function in Java is for giving the program command line arguments!

<h1> 1/5/2017 </h1>
</br>
<p>
	Today I learned how to best open a different file in vim </br>
:e <path to file> </br>
Also I learned how to page up and down. </br>
Ctrl F (Page Down) </br>
Ctrl B (Page Up) </br>
In addition, I learned a little about ! in bash </br>
!! (run the most recent command) //aka bang bang</br>
!$ (the paramater most recently used) </br>
</p>
<h1> 1/10/2017</h1>
</br>
<p>
	Today I learned some more useful things from the VIM tutorial, </br>
0 is a much more efficient way to move to the beginning of a line. </br>
:dd will delete the entire line. </br>
:dw will delete a word </br>
:c is the 'change' operator so it will take w,e,$ etc as parameters. </br>
:ce will delete the end of the current word and place the user into insert mode </br>
x will delete a character </br>
I still need to practice the 'count' command (for example: 2w will jump two words to the right, and 4dd will delete 4 lines). </br>
Replace is just Ctrl+R </br>
</br>
	
I also learned a bit about the terminal command 'history' </br>
My quest for this knowledge was fueled by the following addition to my pi's .bashrc file </br>
<i>alias please='sudo (history -p !!)'<i> </br>
Basically, if I execute a command in bash, and have insufficient permissions, I can execute a 'please' command. </br>
This will cause bash to execute the previous command (!!) with elevated permissions as history -p &lt; command &gt; </br>
will simply display the command prior to execution this fits perfectly into the bash alias. </br>
