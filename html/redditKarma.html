      <p>wikiHow's <a class="inside" href = "http://www.wikihow.com/Make-People-Instantly-Like-You">second tip</a>
         under "How to make people instantly like you" is about
        remembering the idea that people are interested in themselves. <a class="inside" href="http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/6-habits-of-remarkably-likeable-people.html">Inc.com</a> calls this
        "Social jiujitsu" not only asking about people, but asking open ended questions
        about something they've accomplished. I really don't care too much about sources as this is merely for personal curiosity, but if it brings
        back interesting enough results, I may make it a bit more scientific.</p>
