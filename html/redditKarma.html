      <h2>Hypothesis:</h2>

      <p>Asking redditors within the comment section of any given post questions about
        themselves will show a dramatic increase in commment Karma.
      </p>

</br>

      <h2>Background information:</h2>
  
      <p>wikiHow's <a class="inside" href = "http://www.wikihow.com/Make-People-Instantly-Like-You">second tip</a>
         under "How to make people instantly like you" is about
        remembering the idea that people are interested in themselves. <a class="inside" href="http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/6-habits-of-remarkably-likeable-people.html">Inc.com</a> calls this
        "Social jiujitsu" not only asking about people, but asking open ended questions
        about something they've accomplished. I really don't care too much about sources as this is merely for personal curiosity, but if it brings
        back interesting enough results, I may make it a bit more scientific.</p>

</br>

      <h2>Experiment:</h2>

      <p>Again, as it's not the most scientific thing I've ever done, I'm ready to test my hypothesis. I'll update the site with questions as I ask them. </br>
        <h3>Questions:</h3> "They look fantastic! What is prague like? does all the food look that good?" In response to a delicious looking pastry comment,
        the poster mentioned they had visited Prague. "Why do you think it is that people are so easily persuaded?" In response to a commentor talking about some
        books he has read on the subject.
      </p>

      <p><h3>Notes:</h3> As I attempt my first question, I find it surprisingly difficult to ask a sincere question meeting two qualifications, a) that doesn't somehow
        include me as either subject or object and b) that doesn't seem to have some ulterior motive for asking. I've also noticed that several questions I'd deem
        stupid enter my thoughts as I come up with them. Perhaps this is one aspect of generally liked people: questions like this come relatively easily to them.
        One aspect of the hypothesis that I'm already feeling is wrong is the "any given post". There are certainly those that are better than others, but
        There are certain ones that just don't provide the atmosphere to ask these types of questions. Interesting observation: it has been 41 minutes since I
        posted the first question(23 minutes since the second), there have been 0 responses, and neither comment has received a single upvote. On the other hand, I posted
        a comment which questioned the idea of a top level comment. It already has an extra point and a response from the poster. Obviously several variables are
        in play. Type of person interacting with reddit late mornign on a Thursday, subreddit, and type of post to name a couple. Also of note: a pop culture reference
        is getting hands down the most attention. 
      </p>
      <h2> Conclusion: </h2>

      <p>
      Social media is a complete waste of life.
