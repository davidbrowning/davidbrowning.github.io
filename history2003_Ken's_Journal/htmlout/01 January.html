<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Mae
still isn't feeling the best, but we kept busy working on missionary papers. 
Bob and Carroll invited us up for fish breakfast this morning.  It's always
nice to have someone else fix breakfast.  Scott, Mishelle, Kylan and Ashley
came over this afternoon and borrowed our scanner.  Scott isn't feeling very
well either.  We got letters sent to some of our friends that we had not
called, letting them know of our mission call.  This evening we started packing
for our trip to Arizona.  We did watch a TV show called &quot;Dave” this
evening that was really a cute show.  Bob suggested a couple of shows that were
on tonight, but we only watched the one.  As it was, we were until 11 PM before
we got to bed.  Mae couldn't go to sleep, so slept in the recliner most of the
night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Mae
never slept very well last night so I let her sleep in a little longer and I
prepared breakfast.  I took Mae to work.  While there we got a Secretary in the
other office to notarize some papers.  Superintendent Bryon Bowles came out to
express his appreciation for Mae and the work she has done for the District.  I
thought it was pretty neat that he would be so personal.  Leaving Mae at work, I
did a lot of chasing around, making phone calls about our mission and checking
out a laptop computer.  I got back to Mae's office at 1 PM thinking we were to
meet with a Financial Planner; however, he asked if he could change time to 3
PM.  Mae and I went to Inkley’s and got passport pictures.  After taking Mae
back, I rushed to get things packed in the car and back to Mae's office.  We
met with the Financial Counselor for a few minutes but didn't make a decision
at this time.  We left Mae's office after 4PM.  We stopped at Mike's for just a
few minutes to get the software and cables for our digital camera.  We rushed
up to the M. T. C. and picked up some training materials for the Tagalog
Language.  I parked in a spot that tipped the front of the car down, and
because we were low on gas, the car ran out of fuel.  The brothers in the
M.T.C. office called transportation and had him take me to a gas station, where
I purchased a gas can and gas.  He took me back to the car and we were soon on
our way.  We stopped and got some dinner, before leaving Provo.  Mae wasn't
feeling very good so I got her some Nyquil tablets and she took one.  It put
her right out.  I drove as fare as Beaver where we stopped and got a motel room
for the night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
didn't sleep the best, due to Mae not feeling well, the beds were to hard and
the dinner we ate didn't settle with me the best.  We slept in a little, but
got away at 8:15AM.  We drove to Kanab before stopping for gas and something to
eat.  While there, I made a couple of calls regarding our Mission Call.  We
lost about a hours time there, but got to Roy and Shellie's about 6PM.  We ate,
visited, gave them the Christmas gifts, we had brought down for them.  Mike
called and said he had found us a laptop computer for a good price.  He bought
it, but if I don't want it he can take it back tomorrow.  I typed my journal
entries for yesterday and today on Shellie's computer before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in until about 8:30 AM.  I worked on the computer finding a way to spell
check my typing.  Mike called and told me more information about the laptop
computer he bought for us.  It sounds like a pretty good unit.  Mike is going
to download all the software we need and then when we return, he will show us
how it all works.  It is special for him to spend so much of his time to get us
set up.  Roy and Shellie were packing to leave for California to go on a cruise
ship to Mexico, for their Wedding Anniversary.  Mae and I will tend the
children while they are gone.  We really didn't do much except be with the
children.  This evening I watched two videos, Mae did set down and watch the
2nd one with me.  We moved our things down to Roy and Shellie's room so we
could be closer to Jase's room and be able to hear him, if he wakes.  Garrett went
baby sitting this evening.  He was gone for six hours, but was paid $36 for the
evening.  Maybe I need to start baby sitting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Jase
woke Mae shortly after 7 AM.  Mae let me sleep in until about 9:30, then I let
her go back to sleep for a while.  Garret had to help collect Fast Offerings
this morning, so I took him over to the Priesthood Leaders to get his packets. 
I then worked on the computer typing my journal entrance.  Shellie called to
see how every thing was going.  They hadn't boarded the ship yet.  We attended
church meetings and enjoyed them very much.  We had a nice baked chicken dinner
ready when we returned home.  This evening we held F. H. E. with the children. 
Jase likes me to put him to bed for some reason.  Mae and I soon went to bed
after getting the boys to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            It
was a relaxing morning with the boys still out of school.  We ordered the
Mannatech products that we will need while in the mission field.  There were
some problems getting the total cost to go on our Visa card, but we finally got
it worked out.  Garret went with me and we went several places, Walgreen’s for
some note books and Thera-gesic, a Health store for capsules (which they didn't
have in bulk), and some Acidophilus, we had to go to another store where we
bought the capsules.  We then went to Home Depot and bought materials to lay
some tile for Roy &amp; Shellie.  We planned to take the boys bowling this
evening, but with travel time and stopping at McDonald's to eat and play, it
became to late, so we just let the children play longer at McDonald'.  Garret
wanted to watch a video after the little boys went to bed, so while Mae and
Garret watched &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, I also filled capsules.  It
was late when we got to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Mae
got the boy's off to school this morning.  I located tools and started the
preparations to lay tile in Roy &amp; Shellie's bedroom.  I was unable to
locate Roy's 1/2 inch drill motor.  I had to go to the Home Depot in Mesa to
rent a tile saw.  After checking the rental on a drill motor, I purchased one. 
Rent would have cost $50.00 for two days and could purchase a new one for
$104.00 including tax.  Brother Black from the M. T. C. called us this
afternoon and we spent about an hour with him on the phone, starting the
language training.  I spent the rest of the day and evening cutting tiles. 
Although it only took 17 - 18&quot; X 18&quot; tiles, to do the area they want
tiled, there are 23 pieces and every tile has 1 or more cuts.  I was sure tired
when I quite tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            This
morning I woke thinking about the storage or sale of the car and truck.  I
don't know what we should do, but when I tried to talk to Mae about it, she
immediately was negative about it.  That put me in a bad mood that lasted quite
a while.  I set the tile in mortar, and then cleaned up tools and the floor
where I had tracked it up, cutting tiles last night.  I returned the tile saw,
bought some groceries and looked at some ear receivers for the phone, so we
could communicate easer with Brother Black as we are instructed in the Tagalog
language.  I brought some head sets home, on the understanding that if they
wouldn't work I could return them.  As soon as I got home and opened them to read
the instructions, I realized they wouldn't work.  After the boys got home from
school, Mae, Jase and I returned the head sets.  We went over to a Radio Shake,
where we bought a speaker unit that would install on any phone line.  It was much
cheaper and I think will be better.  We played games with the boys before
getting Quint and Kevis to bed.  Garrett wanted to stay up longer, so we
watched a video with him.  Mae and I stayed up studding Tagalog and trying to
read the scriptures in Tagalog.  We are sure going to need the Blessings from
Our Lord if we are to be successful in this calling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got the boys off to school, and then I began to prepare to grout the tile. I
got the grout to wet, so had to run to Home Depot to purchase some more.  Mae
helped me with the grouting by keeping towels cleaned out for me.  We then
tried to stretch the carpeting back, but with the weight of the water bed, it
wouldn't let it stretch far enough.  Brother Black called and we spent the next
hour and 45 minutes with him.  I feel completely overwhelmed.  I worked more on
the carpeting, but had to give up until I can get a carpet stretcher.  I spent
some time on the computer getting today's tutoring session down.  I cleaned up
from the floor work.  After dinner, I felt completely excused, but Mae
continued to push for more study time.  My mind simply rebelled.  I finally
took a shower and got ready for bed.  Mae tried to get me to relax, but she
couldn't quit, so she stayed up to study and I went to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            At
2:50 AM, I woke up to use the bathroom.  I couldn't go back to sleep, worrying
about learning the Tagalog Language.  We had planned on being ready to report
to the M.T.C. the end of February.  That in it self, with all the things we
need to do before then, seemed almost overwhelming, but now to add to that, the
learning of a foreign language, I just don't know.  I walked the floor until 4
AM, then got dressed and walked outside, getting back home at 6 AM.  We talked
and prayed, then prayed and talked, but are still over whelmed.  I thought
about getting a carpet stretcher to pull the carpet, but can't find a wet-vac
to drain the water bed.  I am sure that we need to remove the weight from the
carpet before we can get it to stretch enough to finish the job.  I finally
decided to weight until Roy returns before doing more.  I put a call in for
Brother Craw, but only got his message machine.  Mae cleaned house most of the
day, getting it ready for Roy &amp; Shellie's return.  This evening we took the
boys bowling.  It was quite a bit of fun and the boys seemed to enjoy it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
thought we could sleep in this morning but Jase was awake at 7A. M. as normal,
so we had to get up.  I used the knee kicker and was able to get the carpet to
stretch farther.  At 10 A.M. Brother Black called and we spent 1 1/2 hrs with
him on our lessons.  He says we are doing very well, but I am still struggling
to remember words and their meanings.  We are sure seeking the Lords help with
this challenge.  After our lessons, I again worked on stretching the carpet,
and was able to get it looking good.  We called and talked to Sandi this
afternoon.  After lunch, I worked on the carpet again, and then returned the
kicker to Home Depot.  I made some copies of papers for Mae and bought a few
fruits at a stand.  Garrett helped me fill some capsules this evening.  After
getting the little boys to bed, Mae, Garrett and I watched a video, before we
went to bed.  We have been expecting Roy and Shellie home this evening or at
least expected them to call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
woke early and was concerned that Roy &amp; Shellie hadn't called as of yet. 
Garrett said that Shellie had told him that they would get back to LA on
Saturday.  After a couple of calls, we found the phone number of the couple
that Roy &amp; Shellie had gone with.  I talked to their parents, who are
tending their children, and found that they wouldn't be getting to port in
Calif. until 8:30 AM today.  That calmed my concerns.  After getting some
breakfast, Mae wanted to study.  I was tired and had a headache, so laid down
for a nap.  That had Mae upset, because I didn't study with her.  This is sure
creating stress.  We took the children and attended church meetings.  Mae had
Lasagna ready for dinner when we got home.  I made up a fruit salad, from the
fruits I had bought yesterday, but the boys are very picky and hardly ate
much.  I guess I am just getting to old to have small children, but it upset
me, so I went out side to relax.  Roy and Shellie got home about 7 PM.  They
told all of us about their trip, and had souvenirs for everyone.  They had a
good trip.  Roy and Shellie were excited about the tile in their bedroom.  We
visited until about 10 PM.  I made my journal entry and worked on our language
lessons before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were able to sleep in, letting Shellie get the boys off to school.  Garrett asked
about taking a picture of his Robotic, he had made, so he could send it to his
teacher.  I told him we would after school.  I worked on the Tagalog language
part of the time today.  I lay down on the couch to take a nap, but was awaken
with Jase feeding me potato chips.  I tended Jase, while Mae and Shellie went
shopping.  Mae bought me a new watch band.  I reorganized the computer files I
have been making for our language studies.  After school Mae &amp; I took Jase
and Garrett with us to Walgreen’s where we got some loose leaf binders, and
Garrett had some items he needed.  This evening as we were reading scriptures
as a family, I was amazed at the depth Quint was thinking when he ask a
question about what Shellie was reading from the Book of Isaiah.  Garrett and I
loaded the program that came with our camera, to down load pictures from our digital
camera to the computer.  A power unit did not come with the package, so I told
Garrett I would try to find one tomorrow.  Garrett asked if he could try using
another program and try to down load the pictures.  I let him and sure enough
he was able to do it.  I would have just given up and waited until I had all
the equipment to follow the instructions given.  These kids really amaze me
with what they can do with modern technology.  I called the MTC training center
and set an appointment for Mae and I to get more medical test taken in
preparation to go to the Philippines.  We will go for them at 9 AM on the 21st.</p>

Brother Black called us at 1 PM and we were on the phone for the next 1 hr .and
45 min..  Again I am over whelmed with trying to learn the Tagalog language. 
We stayed up late playing games wand visiting with Shellie. Roy and Garrett
spent the evening setting up their new computer.</p>

slept in, not getting up until 8 AM.  It was a relaxed morning, mainly visiting
with Shellie.  This afternoon Mae &amp; Shellie went shopping for Mae some clothes
for her to wear on our mission.  I worked on making more flash cards, like the
ones Shellie had designed for us.  Maybe they will help us with the language
training.  I was able to keep Quint and Kevis quiet so that Jase could sleep
most of the time Shellie and Mae were gone.  I was unable to print the flash
cards off the computer, for Roy hadn’t connected the printer.  Quint and I had
a good take about education and  it’s importance, after he got home from
school.  I started watching a video just before Shellie and Mae got home.  We
stopped it when dinner was ready.  After dinner, Mae &amp; I got most of our
things packed in the car.  We visited with Roy &amp; Shellie and all watched
the rest of the movie, before saying our good bys and going to bed at mid-night.</p>

and I got up at 3 AM and were on the road by 4 AM.  Mae was able to sleep most
of the way to Flagstaff, where we stopped for gas.  Mae then drove to Page,
while I slept.  We stopped there for breakfast, before going on to Kanab.  We
stopped there and tried to find Judy Giles, but they didn’t answer the phone,
so we just left them a message.  We went through Zion National park, then up
the freeway to American Fork, where we stayed the evening with Mike and Becky. 
Mike and I were most of the evening working on my new computer that Mike had
bought for us.  Mae enjoyed playing with David, Taylor and Mattie, along with
visiting with Becky.  It was a very enjoyable evening, just wish we had more
time to stay longer.  Mike talked to Mae &amp; I about not stressing out over
the language so much.  It was mid-night before we got to bed.</p>

eating.  We got away at  8:30 AM and went out to Grantsville.  We got there at
9:40 AM and just had time to get the phone speaker hooked up and a card table
set up, when Brother Black called.  We were 2 hr on our lesson today.  I spent
a lot of this afternoon working on our laptop computer typing up today's
lesson.  This evening Terry and I watched a show on TV.  Sandi, Mae and I
played a game of Rummy.  Mae and I took showers, before going to bed.</p>

JaNae.  I prepared some breakfast for all of us, and then helped them with the
other preparations.   At 11:30, we went up to the Church House where Sandi had
scheduled for the baby shower.  I helped set up, then helped with the serving
of the food.  Sandi had about 40 guests come in response of invitations.  By
the time they finished, we cleaned up and got back home, it was after 4 PM.. 
We relaxed, Shellie sang a song for us, with Sandi accompanying on the piano. 
Mae and I worked on our language lessons.  Mae is doing much better than I am
with the language.  This evening Mae, Sandi and I watched the three DVD's made
of our old home movies.  We also watched the pictures that Mike had taken, and
made DVD's for all the family.  Mae and Sandi did some exercises, before we
went to bed.  Terry had gone up to his son's and laid some floor tile.  He got
home about 6 PM, quite tired.  He went to sleep watching the DVD's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
woke at 2:30 AM and couldn't go back to sleep, so got up and studied until
after 6 AM.  Mae woke when I came back to bed, so she got up and studied.  Sandi
had a nice breakfast ready for us about 9 AM.  I worked on creating another
Tagalog language file, for some how I have lost the one I had created while we
were at Shellie's.  We attended Church with Sandi.  Terry didn't sleep much
last night, so didn't feel well enough to go with us.  Priesthood was held
first.  The counselor in the Bishopric welcomed me and had me introduce
myself.  Being that this Ward used to be the Clark Ward, I know many of the
Brothers.  I had visited with Fred &amp; Kenny Hale when we were waiting for
meeting to start, so Kenny had the Bishopric ask me about or mission call. 
Also as I was visiting with some of the Brothers before meeting started,
someone said that I used to operate the Stake farm.  A brother that lived there
no, ask if I had planted rocks there, for he sure was finding many now.  He
also said the rocks had a hard clay coat on them, that if they wanted to use
the rocks, they had to chip the clay of with a chisel and hammer.  I realized
that the rocks are coming from the hard pan that covered the farm area.  It is
being broken up as basements and footings are dug, and the material spread out
on the yards.  I found it very interesting.  We enjoyed the meetings and saying
hi to many we have known from when we lived here.  Sandi had a nice dinner
ready for after we returned home from church.  Brad and JaNae also came for
dinner.  It was good to visit with them.  This evening, we watched a TV show,
then Mae went to bed.  Sandi and I watched a second show, called &quot;Perdition&quot;,
it was quite cute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up to breakfast being ready, ate with Sandy &amp; Terry.  We left for home
at 9 AM, studying Tagalog numbers on the way home.  We stopped at the Church
Distribution in Layton and bought garments to take on our mission.  We also
bought Temple Ordinance clothes for Jeff for his Birthday.  We stopped home and
unpacked the car, cleaned up some, for when we left on the 3 rd for Arizona, we
really left a mess.  This is something Mae never dose, but this time we were in
to big of a hurry to take the time to clean up the house.  We ask Bob if he
could cook a roast for us, to be ready to take to Jeff and Gale's home for
dinner with them.  He not only cooked the roast, but sliced it and made gravy. 
Mae had a appointment with the Dentist at 12 noon.  After that we drove up to
Liberty, where we took some pictures of the cottage that Jeff and Gale will use
for their Honeymoon.  We then went to Sam's Club and Best Buy, to purchase a
carrying case for our Lap Top Computer.  We also bought a printer.  We went
home and did some more house work before taking dinner over to Jeff &amp;
Gale's for dinner.  President Richins called and ask Mae to speak in Stake
Conference next Sunday.  That really puts mort stress on Mae.  I would rather have
him ask me to talk, than Mae.  Trent, Anna &amp; Lillian stopped over to wish
Jeff a Happy Birthday.  We visited with them for a while, and then after they
left, we played a game of Harts.  It was about 10 PM when we got home.  We then
went through the stack of mail, which had come while we've been gone.  We were
after mid-night getting to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up at 5:15 AM and had to hurry to get away by 7:15 AM to Provo.  We got to
Provo in time but couldn't find where we were to go, so as a result were a
little late.  We had a short interview to see if we had any problems with
anxiety or depression.  We then went for some lab test, and had a chest x-ray. 
That took us until 11:15 AM.  We went up to the mall and got some lunch.  We
met Brother Black at the Senior Missionary Training Center, where we met in
class for over 2 Hr.  We stopped at a Maverick store to use the restrooms and
got some Frozen Yogurt.  We had to take a specimen back to the Lab; and then
went to Mike &amp; Becky's.  We gave Becky a Birthday gift and sang Happy
Birthday to her.  She &amp; Mae visited and I fell asleep for a couple of
hours.  Mike got home before we left, so we got to see him also.  We drove to
Grantsville, to Sandi &amp; Terry's.  Sandi soon had dinner ready for us. 
After dinner, we played a game of Rook.  Sandi and I won Terry and Mae.  We
then played a single hand which Terry and Mae won.  It has been a busy day, but
a good one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Mae
got up early to work on her talk.  I got up and had breakfast with Sandi, then
went home to get the connecting cables so I could transfer the pictures from
our digital camera to the computer, so we could print a couple of them out for
Sandi.  I visited with Bob and Mark for a few minutes while I was there.  I
called and left a message for Jeff, that we didn't want him to take our desk
top computer until after we leave for our mission.  I also called and left a
message for Nolan, that if it would be easier for him, he could send me a
check, for the money he owes me.  I exchanged the some batteries at Radio
shack, got gas, bought a hamburger for lunch and drove back to Sandi's.  Mae
and Sandi were out waking when I got there.  I down loaded the pictures, which
took me some time, assembled the printer, but couldn't get the driver loaded. 
When Terry got home from work he helped me.  We printed off two pictures of the
cottage that Jeff and Gale will spend their Wedding Night at, so Sandi can put
that cottage in the picture she is going to paint for their wedding gift.  We
went up to JaNae and Brad's for the evening.  Brad didn't come home in time for
us to see him.  JaNae had pizza for dinner and we watched a dumb show on TV. 
It wasn't as good as evening as I would like to of had.  After returning to Sandi
&amp; Terry's, Terry wanted to play a game of Rook.  We played 4 hands when Mae
&amp; Terry won, then another hand which Sandi &amp; I won.  We sure enjoy
being with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
slept in until 8 AM, and then got up for breakfast with Sandy.  I called
Brother Black and ask him to let us miss this lesson today.  I did work on
correcting some of our previous lesson material, on the computer.  Mae spent
some time working on her talk for Stake Conference.  Mae and Sandi walked
together for their exercise, I did some stretches while they were gone.  Sandi
practiced some music on the piano that she will be accompanying a Sister with
for next Sunday.  I sure enjoyed lessening to her play.  After lunch, Sandy asked
me to give her a Fathers Blessing, which I felt privileged and honored to do. 
We are sure proud of Sandy and the changes she has made in her life.  I also
gave her some advice about dealing with Dave when it comes to settling on what
David owes her on the house.  I told her that she needs to ask for the paper
work on the sell of their original home and expect him to pay her 1/2, if not
she should immediately contact her lawyer.  She should then go for the 50% plus
all expenses in order to collect what he owes her.  We left for home shortly
after 3 PM, but had traffic problems after passing the airport.  Because of traffic,
we lose time and had to go directly to Randy's for my appointment with him. 
Mae used that time to study.  Randy really had to work on me trying to get me
loosened up.  He worked for a hour and fifteen minutes, then scheduled me to
return on Saturday at 9 AM..  I took Mae out to eat, and then we stopped by
Scott and Michelle's.  They weren't home but the garage door was up, so we went
in to leave them some pictures.  While we were there, Scott came home to change
Kylan.  They have been visiting with the friends across the street.  We visited
for a few minutes, and then came on home.  We put things away and watched “Touched
by an Angle&quot; on TV, before going to bed.  Mike called with a question
concerning some plumbing.  Bob came down to bring us some mail.  There was a
package from Larry and Tammy with anti-Mormon information that they want us to
read.  We will just send it back.  It is interesting that I felt impressed this
morning to write to them and so started a letter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            Bob
prepared breakfast of biscuits and gravy for us.   I wrote a short letter to
Larry &amp; Tammy and got their material repackaged to return to them.  In the
letter, I ask them two questions: If they are right, what have we lost?  If we
are right, what have they lost?  I doubt if they will really consider the
questions, but I think I politely ask them not to contact with this kind of
material, unless they want to openly discuss it.   Mae cleaned the storage
room, while I worked on our bank account.  This afternoon I took some items to
the D. I., bought a set of king size sheets for a bridle shower gift, copied
some papers for Mae, picked up some chicken for dinner, returned some items to
Bryce, and bought some filtered water and eggs at the store.  Mae had the house
fairly cleaned up when I returned.  We quit about 7:30 PM and watched &quot;JAG”
that Bob had recorded for us, while we ate dinner.  We were busy all day but
still have a lot to do.  It was after 10 PM when we got to bed.  Although  it
some times seemed over whelming and frustrating at times, it was good to be
home and with my best friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
were busy this morning, and I just had time to get down to Randy's for another
treatment.  While there, Mae called to tell me that Brother Black called and
wants to up our appointment to 11 AM.  When I got home, he had just called.  We
were with him for 2 hr. &amp; 15 min..  I feel that I am really slowing this learning
down.  I took letters and Bridle Shower invitations to the Post Office, getting
there just before they closed at 1 PM.  I then exchanged our Temple Garments,
looked for another pair of cowboy boots, (but the Durango Brand boots have gone
out), looked for a cable that will connect our palm cradle to our lap top
computer.   It looks like they have discontinued manufacturing that stile of
fittings and it might be cheaper to get a new palm planner than to get an
adaptor.  I then bought a Frozen Yogurt, went home and took a nap.  Mae had
worked on her talk, cleaned house, and went to a Bridle Shower for Gale.  She
got home about 4 PM.  We had to hurry to get to Stake Conference this evening,
but it was sure a good meeting and worth attending.  After the Conference we
had several ask us about our mission call.  Brother Laprevote asked us when we
wanted to be set apart.   I told him that we would like to, as soon as
President Sanders feels it was appropriate.  We went into President Sanders and
he said that he would like to set us apart on November the 11th for our mission
calling, but if I felt that we would like a blessing with learning the
language, he would do that next Sunday.  That is what we will plan on.  After
getting home, Mae worked more on her talk.  I set up the camera and copied some
of our family pictures so we will have them with us on DVD.  We didn't get to
bed until after mid-night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up about 7:30 AM but were busy trying to get ready for Stake Conference at
2 PM.  Mae was busy with her talk, I was trying to organize the pictures from
our camera onto our computer.  We were also trying to get packed to go to David
and Shauna's.  Mae also prepared a casserole for dinner this evening at Scott
and Mishelle's.  Stake Conference was very enjoyable and Mae did an excellent
job with her talk.  Bob, Carroll and Mark attended our conference to support Mae;
I thought that was pretty special.  We had many congratulate us on our call
after meeting, then Brother Shane Sheet's, from the Country View Ward, told us
he had served there.  He was excited to tell us about the Philippines and so
visited with us for quite a while.  When we got to Scott &amp; Mishelle's, they
wanted us to stay longer, so we decided to stay with Jeff and go up to David's
tomorrow.  We played games and visited, then went to Jeff's and visited with
him until 11:30 PM, before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            We
got up about 7 AM, visited with Jeff for a minute before he left for work.  We
went over to the Star Cafe to eat breakfast.  We mailed the wedding invitations
of Jeff and Gale at the Clearfield Post Office, and then left for Idaho.  I
drove until we got to Plymouth, then Mae drove while I slept.  She drove to
Rich &amp; Lois's where we left some materials and a check for the balance in
the Browning Family Organization fund.  We then drove on to David &amp;
Shauna's, getting there just before 1 PM.  We sure enjoyed being with Davis
&amp; his family.  David helped me on my computer, to set up some files.  We visited
until quite late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
woke quite early to use the bathroom, and couldn't go back to sleep, worrying
about the Tagalog Language.  I went down into David's study, where I pled with
the Lord for help, and studied for a while.  David and I gave Emily a blessing
before David &amp; Shauna took her to the hospital to have her tonsils removed,
at 8 AM.  Mae &amp; I took care of Tyler while they were gone.  Mae let me
study and take a nap, while she played games with Tyler.  I then played games
with Tyler while Mae studied.  Shauna called about 10:30 AM to let us know that
the operation went well and Emily was doing well.  David came home at 12:30 PM
and put a movie on the TV for Tyler, but he went back to bed, as he hadn't
slept much last night.  We had our tutoring lesson with Brother Black from 1 PM
to after 2 PM.  Tyler was as good as can be during that time, not disturbing us
at all.  We enjoyed visiting with David.  This evening David, Tyler, Mae &amp;
I went to the Hospital to visit Emily.  Shauna looks tired, but stayed the
night with Emily.  We stopped and got ice cream and yogurt on the way home. 
Mae and I stayed up and watched a show on TV before going to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            After
breakfast, David went to the hospital and brought Shauna &amp; Emile home. 
Emile seems to be doing quite well.  David and I went down town to fill a
prescription for Emily.  We also found an adapter for my palm pilot to our lap
top.  However the driver will not work, so we are going to have to try getting
a driver from the internet.  David then showed me some homes and areas of
construction.  We had forgotten that Shauna was waiting for the prescription. 
Emily was quite restless, but soon after giving her the medication, she felt
fine.  We got Shauna to lay down for a nap, for she got very little sleep last
night at the hospital.  David got Emily to lay down, but a short time later
when he checked on her, she had blood on her lips.  They called the Dr., and he
had them take her back to the hospital, where she again went through surgery
and catteries a small blood vessel to stop the bleeding.  Mae and I stayed with
Tyler getting some studying  done.  This evening I watched some TV.  David and
Shauna didn't get back with Emily until after 11 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='punctuation-wrap:simple;text-autospace:none'>            I
didn't sleep very well last night.  The wind blow and it rained during the
night.  Also I am very concerned about the Tagalog language.  I am having a
very hard time with memorizing it, and when I say that, Mae tells me I can't say
that.  I really feel the pressure of learning, but also the pressure of time it
takes when this time had been planned to be with our children.  I don't know if
my feelings are right or wrong.  I have no problem with serving for 24 or 25
months, but I thought and said that we would be available the end of February. 
To learn a language during this time, has really added stress.  David stayed
home from work again today, as he needed the rest.  We enjoyed helping with the
children.  Time sure goes by fast as we enjoy being with our family.  David and
Shauna are sure good parents, we are sure proud of our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            I felt concerned about my lack of ability to
remember the Tagalog language, so felt like I would like to go to the Temple. 
I went down, but the Temple was closed for repairs, so I came back home.  David
went to work today.  We had our tutoring session with Brother Black.  Mae and I
took Tyler to a Family Fun Center where we enjoyed all kinds of entertainment. 
David joined us after he had completed his work.  </p>
